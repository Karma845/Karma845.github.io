  <h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &#8211; Fujiwara's First Challenge</h1>
  
  
<p class="calibre4">“The test results… It seems that Fujiwara-kun and the demon fused on a spiritual level.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the room of a certain laboratory, a man in a white coat sitting in front of me said plainly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve been very reckless. It’s a wonder you’re still alive.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s true. So, doctor, is it possible to separate Fujiwara from the demon?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked, the man in white&mdash;the doctor&mdash; nodded back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No. It’s too tough for us to separate them with our current level of magic engineering. It’s a shame that it makes me disqualified as a researcher to say this, but I can only ask you to give up. After all, there is no precedent for the fusion between demons and humans. I haven’t completely caught up with the idea or the technology. That’s why it’s worth researching. But Fujiwara-kun’s position makes it impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How come?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara-kun is one of the leading figures of the East Japan Branch, and there are a lot of problems with inspecting someone in such a position. That’s why, from now on, you’ll have to work hard in your new life as a summoner and familiar.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara (who looked like a demon), who had been silently listening to the doctor next to me, snorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you saying that I can’t get back to normal?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Unfortunately, no. You can’t separate the two colours of paint once they’re mixed, can you? That’s what I mean when you can’t be separated. You acquired the body of a demon of the best talent and quality by accident. You’re probably the strongest human in history now. What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can I not be dissatisfied when I’m no longer myself?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor tilted his head at Fujiwara’s protest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t understand. I know it’s a matter of taste, but your appearance has improved. I mean, of course, you were always beautiful, but you’re in a different league now. It’s like a piece of art. There’s no reason to go back. Consider yourself lucky.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">You’re too rational. Don’t you have any delicacy at all?</p>
<p class="calibre4">But alas, such is the nature of mages. In particular, people like him, who tend to throw away their ethics and decency for the development of magic as if it were a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve got a lot to say, but the main problem is that I’ve become Ashiya-kun’s familiar! I can’t go back to school like this! It’s a disgrace! Can’t you at least remove the mark of the obedience?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara complained.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor flipped through the medical records as if he didn’t care.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“From what I’ve been told, the way you made your contract was irregular, so you can’t regularly break the spell. But you dare not to break the contract with the demon, or you might die. I understand that it’s bad publicity because it’s as if my daughter became a slave to a man her age. But shouldn’t we be happy for the miracle that you didn’t die after such a reckless act in the first place?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara choked out a ‘gulp’ as if she had no words to reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor nodded and moved his gaze to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you have any other questions?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, uh, I mean… I have a question, or rather… Fujiwara’s magic power consumption is too high… Is there anything we could do about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Due to an unfortunate incident the other day, Fujiwara had become my familiar. That’s right. It wasn’t good at all, but it is what it is, and there’s nothing I can do about it. So, I gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, I couldn’t overlook her magic power consumption rate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not like I couldn’t provide her magic power, but it’s too much for me to handle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not a talented magician, to begin with. My magic power is below average, my bloodline isn’t good, and my knowledge is limited because I never study. If I were to use a high-ranking demon, it would be more than just a challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was now like a freelancer who forced himself to buy a supercar and couldn’t even afford the maintenance fee. I’m just an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The best way to deal with it is for you to train yourself to increase your magic power capacity. Or you could use a magic device like the magic tank.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh. Then, can we at least reinforce the magic link and bypass…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Impossible. If you forcefully tamper with it from the outside, the circuits may collapse. Are you blind?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A sigh escaped from my lips at the merciless denial.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic link established between Fujiwara and me was incredibly fragile compared to a regular one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not a surprise since the contract was created in such a reckless manner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First of all, the effective distance was extremely short. Experiments had shown that Fujiwara would not be able to receive magic power from me if we were more than ten meters apart. Furthermore, there was a tremendous loss in magic power transmission. Even if I sent 100% of my magic power, Fujiwara would only receive about 20%.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was because of the poor magic power efficiency of the demon, so it was no wonder I was on the verge of crying. It was a curse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, the hardest part was that we had to be together all the time because of the effective distance. You see, a man and a woman of our age should not be eating and sleeping together, right?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It wasn’t like she looked bad. It’s just…</p>
<p class="calibre4">There were many problems we had to face, and there was nothing we could do about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just that we can’t modify the magic links, but we can minimize the loss of magic power that is transmitted.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For real?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In other words, you can transfer the magic directly without relying on the links. By physical contact.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Erm… What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had a bad premonition, but I asked fearfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor looked at Fujiwara and me as if he were observing lab rats.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In early days, when there were few means of transmitting magic power, magicians used to transfer magic power through physical contact or with the mucous exchange. Learn from your predecessors. If your link is too weak to be of use, you can solve the circuitry problem by taking such measures.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hoo hah!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter what you say, for a man and a woman who aren’t together to do something like that…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you are not comfortable with mating, kissing is fine, or even just hugging each other half-naked will work. However, it goes without saying that mucous transmits more magic power than skin. And also, the larger the area of contact, the better transfer. Body fluids are also an excellent medium, but it’s ultimately your problem. You can do whatever you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He told me that he was sincerely not interested. He was too disinterested in the subtleties of gender.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, this can’t be true… I must be dreaming.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara looked up at the ceiling, seemingly about to faint. She looked like she had eaten a grasshopper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I think I had a similar expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And, you know, this is not of my interest, but with that figure…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor’s gaze turned to Fujiwara, whose beautiful appearance was not only foreign but even inhuman. It wasn’t too much to say that her beauty was breathtaking. She was like a queen from a fairy tale…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, her beauty was way beyond the boundary of common sense. It was like the saying, “Too much is too much.” If anything, she was so dazzling that I felt like I couldn’t walk alongside her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I suppose we could use magic to restore her appearance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, who had been in a state of self-doubt, asked. It was as if she regained some of her energy from a faint glimmer of light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor nodded as he looked at the medical records.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“First of all, it seems that there are currently two consciousnesses residing in this body. I don’t need to bother to state it explicitly, but they’re the consciousness of Fujiwara-kun and that of the demon. Can you feel her?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he asked, Fujiwara nodded vaguely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I feel that there is someone else inside me. I’m sure it’s her. Sometimes I can even hear her voice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heh!? What kind of voice is it, by the way? Does it sound like words? Or does it not make sense?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure. But at the very least, I know she doesn’t have good feelings for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor continued, “I see, so she’s also aware of you, Fujiwara-kun,” and wrote something on the paper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In other words, even though it appears that only Fujiwara-Kun’s consciousness remains at first glance, the demon’s consciousness is still there. It’s mutual. The current form is that of a demon, but Fujiwara-Kun’s body is still there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I wondered how it was possible, but if the doctor, who was much smarter than me, said so, then I guess that’s how it was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor pointed the nib of his pen to the center of Fujiwara’s chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What I’m trying to say is that if you can suppress the demon element, you might be able to switch forms. Oh, and of course, the same can be said about consciousness. It wouldn’t be surprising if the demon took over your consciousness at any moment. Be careful, though. So, let’s see, if you become as skilled as Fujiwara-kun in handling magic, she’ll be able to switch bodies just fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So that’s how it goes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara nodded as if she was impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oi! Oi!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said it as if it were simple, but it requires a ridiculous amount of magic power, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The doctor nodded in response to my concern. “Yes, it does.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Once she’s able to change her appearance, she needs a certain amount of magic power. Though, the first change itself requires an enormous amount of magic power. It is something that can’t be helped.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she needs a large amount of magic power, this poor magic link will not keep up. Inevitably, I will have to supply magic power through physical contact… I didn’t like where it was going.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara, do you want to return to your original form?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was hoping for a denial, but she answered immediately. “Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I absolutely hate looking like a lascivious woman. My shoulders are so stiff because of my ridiculously huge b*****s. What is this? I’m so frustrated.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you can’t stand the discomfort?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up. This triglyceride mass is just a distraction. It’s just a flaw in the body’s structure. Why do men even appreciate this stuff? I don’t understand. You idiot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stupid, right? But if men weren’t stupid, the human race would have died out long ago. Don’t underestimate the instinct of living beings.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. When he said that we have to suppress the demon element, I wondered if Ashiya-kun’s meagre magic power could handle it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Basically, a familiar can’t generate its own magic power. The reason is that summoners, fearing that their familiar will rebel against them, place restrictions on them when they are summoned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Otherworldly creatures such as demons need magic power to sustain their life, and they inevitably have to rely on the magic power supplied by their summoners. In other words, if Fujiwara were to use her magic power, she would be able to control the demon both physically and mentally. But, the vast amount of magic power that she originally possessed was now useless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What a waste.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, you know. If you don’t give it a try, you’ll never know. If it doesn’t work, then give up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to… Oh my god, that really sucks…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s expression clouded with depression, but I was pretty sure that was my line.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When we were disheartened, the doctor said, “Don’t lose hope.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Magic engineering is evolving. Soon it will be possible to separate fused souls. Whether it’s a year, ten years, or a hundred years from now, one day you’ll be able to return to normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t wait that long. If you want, dissect Fujiwara a little bit, I will allow it. But please free me from this monster as soon as possible…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really?” The doctor narrowed his eyes. “Are you sure about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not! Ashiya-kun, you have no heart!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A shriek pierced my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi-Oi, You can’t be serious. That was just a joke, a joke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A joke that isn’t funny is just gibberish! In general, Ashiya-kun, why are you so dissatisfied with the fact that I, a pretty girl with a lot of talent, became your familiar? It should be a great honour to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you understand that it was your overconfidence that triggered this tragedy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t make any mistakes! Every step of the preparation and process was perfect! It was supposed to be, and then some mistake made it happen! How is that possible…? It’s unreasonable.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s my situation that was unreasonable. I just got caught up in it, didn’t I?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was too dumbfounded to say anything, and the doctor nodded, “That’s correct.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“According to the test proctor, Fujiwara made no mistakes. The school had examined the grimoire and the magic formation beforehand. It was said that it would be able to handle the summoning smoothly. There’s no way it could have gone that far.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah,” Fujiwara leaned forward. “That was weird.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s why, even though you failed the exam, you were allowed to advance as an exception. But I think it was also because Ashiya-kun, a summoner, is going to be promoted.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Advancement… Ah… Did the West say anything strange?” Fujiwara muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I, too, was depressed at the thought that tomorrow was the start of a new school year, and I had to go to school with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed that this incident had already been publicized.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a nightmare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Japanese branch of the International Mage Association was split into two major factions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The eastern branch is controlled by the Fujiwara family, while the western branch is controlled by the Sanjo family.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As her name implies, Chikage Fujiwara is the daughter of the head Fujiwara family, and therefore, she reigns at the top of the East in the school. She may not look like it, but she is a member of the noblest bloodline.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, the fact that I had such a big shot as a familiar me was definitely not good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the worst-case scenario, the East might kill me…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why is this happening to me? I wonder if I did something horrible in my previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to be reincarnated as a Yakusugi cedar in Yakushima… I want to spend my time doing nothing but photosynthesis without thinking about anything else.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What kind of nonsense are you saying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She poked me on the shoulder.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">After arguing, Fujiwara and I ended up living under the same roof.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In short, we were sharing a room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I used to believe that living with a girl in the same room would be super exciting, but that wasn’t the case anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why did I imagine such things?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know that we have to live together for a thousand reasons. Yeah, I’ve agreed to live with Ashiya-kun, despite my unwillingness. I don’t like it, but I can’t turn back. I understand that. Yet I still can’t accept the fact that I have to live in your room. It wouldn’t matter if it were my room or not. But seriously, look at this room’s poor condition. Is it a doghouse?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the night before the new school term.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After we were let go from the hospital, we came home, and we were unpacking when Fujiwara commented with resentment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was taking her personal belongings out of one of the several cardboard boxes that had been brought into the room beforehand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stopped my work and glared at her lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ve talked about this earlier. I don’t want to live in your dormitory even if it kills me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">There were three dormitories at this school, and all students were required to live in one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Which dormitory you were placed in depended on your faction. For example, Fujiwara lived in the ‘Heavenly Palace,’ a dormitory built with funds from the East Branch to which she belongs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This Heavenly Palace is more like a luxury apartment than a dormitory, with stores, a gym, a lounge, a large cafeteria, and a large bath house inside. It’s super luxurious!</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the other hand, the factionless and rootless people like me were supposed to live in the dormitory&mdash;basically a pigsty&mdash; called ‘Dormitory A,’ which was with the school from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Dormitory A’ is a dreary wooden building that looks straight out of some abandoned village, with no defining features. If you were to set it on fire, it would probably burn better than other dormitories, but that was it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In light of this disparity, I could understand why Fujiwara was complaining.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, if I were to set foot in the Heavenly Palace, there was a 100% chance that I would get killed. I only have one life, and I want to cherish it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe, Fujiwara, you want to see me get beaten to death by the guys from the Heavenly Palace? That’s so cruel; you have no heart. Those guys are from ancient Rome, where executing criminals was the most popular pastime.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I pointed this out, her mouth twisted in disgust. But she didn’t retort anything back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well… I guess I would have been frightened by her cruelty if she had argued with me on this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now that the nagging has quieted down, I once again start arranging her personal belongings and furniture in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But… all of them were of high quality and looked like a rich person’s possessions. These were items that I could never afford in my entire life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way my room was being eroded by these various items reminded me of how a weak country ended after being unilaterally invaded by a strong country. Although, it was refreshing to see all the cheap furnishings being eradicated from one side to the other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the redecoration was complete, it was no longer my room as I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It had become Fujiwara’s villa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Phew. It’s a little better now, isn’t it? Oh, by the way, let’s change the wallpaper over the weekend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s relentless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara nodded in satisfaction as she looked around the room and sat down on the bed, which had been upgraded by about five levels, crossing her legs like an aristocrat. Maybe it was because she was in demon form with great looks, but she looked odd.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I also sat down on the plush sofa across the mini table.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was soft.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, then. Ashiya-kun. Let’s talk about the future.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It seems that it is impossible to cancel the contract with you for the time being.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not what I meant. We have to share the housework and everything.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? You are surprisingly concerned about practical issues.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although it is a dormitory, life here was more like living alone than with a group.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Except for the curfew, there were no restrictions, and on the other hand, you had to do all the cooking and chores by yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do the laundry.” Pointing her index finger at me, she continued, “I can’t leave it to you, Ashiya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? No, it’s fine, but are you saying you’ll wash my pants?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… So what? Do you have a problem with that? Or do you want to wash mine, Ashiya-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, I don’t want to. If I were to wash your pants, I’d be considered a pervert.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right!” Crossing her arms, she said, “I can’t cook, so I’ll leave that to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s true. She didn’t seem like someone that could cook.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe they had to split work in Heavenly Palace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t expect too much from me. I can only cook some pasta, rice and curry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I ain’t a good cook either. I can’t even crack an egg, though if you want me to, I can try.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop right there… I’ll cook. Just don’t complain if it doesn’t fit your taste.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t complain unless it’s gross. Also, let’s divide the garbage disposal, cleaning the bathroom, and vacuuming according to the day of the week, and then, let’s see… Oh, where to sleep!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara murmured and fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… It’s okay, well. You can use the bed. I’m fine being on the couch.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh really!” When I conceded, she looked a little apologetic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“S-so, I’ll take your word for it… Oh, I’ll tell you now! If you do anything naughty to me while I’m sleeping, or peek while I’m bathing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to. There’s no reason to worry. Relax and sleep in peace. Who’d want to mess with you anyway?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hee~” I laughed it off, but for some reason, she looked serious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ha? It’s a serious and real concern that can’t be overlooked. How could an ero-monkey like you be a gentleman? Are you trying to look good?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi-oi! You will lament in your disappointment that you can’t even be taken seriously by an ero-monkey. Even if you’re naked and limbo dancing right in front of me, I’m going to ignore you and play with my phone, okay? Even with that erotic demon form, it’s out of the question when it’s Fujiwara on the inside. UNDASTAN?” <em class="calibre7">[EN: Felt like it should be left like this.]</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a bit too much, but it was frustrating when she misunderstood me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I leaned my body against the back of the couch, tilted my head back, and waved my hands away appropriately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t see Fujiwara’s expression, but I could easily imagine how distorted it was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… He&mdash;h!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a moment of silence, Fujiwara muttered in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Did I really offend you? My heart sank.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, it’s fine. If Ashiya-kun doesn’t do anything to me, that would be the best… right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked up at the sound of the bed creaking, I saw her standing up and looking down at me with a blank expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gulp. It looked like she’s really pissed off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait. What are you doing? Even if you have a problem with that, don’t resort to violence… No, I apologize if I was out of line, but please don’t be violent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to do anything terrible. I just wanted to ask you to supply me with magic power. You know that I needed a lot of magic power to restore my appearance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed to me that she ignored the flow of the conversation, but I mostly understood what she meant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-yeah, that’s right… But promise me that you won’t hurt me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She grinned and nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t do anything dangerous to you. But as you said, you’re not going to lust after me, not only in my original form and not even in this demon form. You just have to supply me with magic power without worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After saying that, she sat down beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were so close that our shoulders touched, and the demon’s beautiful face came close to mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was definitely making fun of me because I could sense the hostility in her smile, and it was not at all comforting. It was a case where I could clearly feel the outburst of raging emotions beneath her smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“O-oh, I won’t get attracted to you. Who would want to anyway… Hiii&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gently took my hand with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As our fingers intertwined, I felt a chill and the sensation of magic power being drained from the point of contact. Together with it, a mild sense of weariness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. It seems that hands alone are not very efficient. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-yeah”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then give me more…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That said, she hugged me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With one hand entwined, she put her other arm around my back.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/L1tJqB5/000012.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">I could feel her soft touch against my chest… What is this softness? The female body is such a miracle. No, no, wait, don’t be fooled by her. The real Fujiwara is supposed to look like chicken bones.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-you know. T-this is a bit… Not that I’m excited by your body… No, nope.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pushed her back, but she hugged me with double the force.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? Why don’t you stick closer? Are you starting to get h***y? You’re the one who made fun of me… Hehe.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">If it was just the words, she seemed to have a lot of free time, but there was a hint of anger in her tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This girl was ridiculed so much that she had become desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no limit to how much she hates to lose!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nope, not gonna happen! But anyway, aren’t you the one who’s too excited? Do you have a lot of spare time?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, Haa? No, I’m not. Rather, Ashiya-kun, you’re the one whose heart is beating stupidly fast…! I’m sure you’re excited.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m not excited. Rather, it stopped beating! Stop talking nonsense.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then stop being so naive…! Put your arms around my back! Don’t keep your arms up in the air like a virgin! Or are you that afraid to touch a lady? Hehe.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on! You aren’t excited. You said you could handle it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara laughed as if she was somewhat proud of herself. We were so close that the tips of our noses were almost touching.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her eyes were wide open, but they seemed to be spinning in circles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was acting cheeky. In addition to the overwhelming feeling of her plums, the magic power was being sucked from my entire body. My mind was already a mess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I put my arms around Fujiwara’s back as she provoked me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I did it! Are you satisfied now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not like I want to be satisfied or anything… I mean, in this position, it’s so tight… Oh, God.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara straddled my thighs and sat on top of them, probably because her position earlier was too painful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, we ended up in a complete head-on hug.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were sitting face to face. There was no space left between us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The feeling of her whole body, or rather her b*****s, pressing against me and her voluptuous buttocks on my thighs was just amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her reddened face, as well as the ragged exhalation escaping from her mouth, was truly dangerous…</p>
<p class="calibre4">A mysterious scent entered my nostrils.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt like I was getting devoured by this demon, who constantly appealed to all of my senses.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My brain was about to explode.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And would you please stop wriggling that big a*s of yours?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s enough! Get off me! This is bad. I can’t honestly tell you what’s bad about it, but it’s bad anyway because it is! Oi!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha!? I thought you didn’t feel anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t. But you see, this is different! This body of yours is just too soft!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s that? You said you wouldn’t get excited even if I was in this demon form!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Doesn’t count. It doesn’t count anymore. I can’t do it! Your body is amazing! It’s arousing!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I knew that you were an ero-monkey. Don’t get excited about me! You piece of s**t! Now go ahead and apologize!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not fair. S**t, you say? I wouldn’t be excited if you had your original flat body.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now you’ve said it! Let’s get over it! I’ve got a lot of magic in me, and I’m ready to recover my appearance! But remember this, if it turns you on, I’ll kill you. I’ll beat you to death!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kill me then!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll make you beg for mercy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right after that, her body began to glow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned my face away from the glare, and when I returned my gaze, I saw a purely Japanese girl with distinctive black hair. It was Fujiwara’s original appearance. She was back in her sailor uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With tears and a blush on her face, she glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Incidentally, the mark of obedience was still engraved on her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haah&mdash; haah&mdash;” She breathed hard and leaned on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I admit that she was a woman because she was definitely soft.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But compared to that demon, her top was insanely flat. The difference was so immense that it was enough to make me cry. Her face was definitely in the beautiful girl category, but God, you’re too cruel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pressure of being pressed was reduced by 80%.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, how do you feel?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard her weak voice as she held onto me tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The firmness has increased. Of course, it’s still soft, but I can feel the core, your bones, more strongly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What did you just say?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her slender physique, different from that of a demoness, was feminine in a different way. Her small shoulders and thin waist, which seemed like they could break if I hugged her tightly, strongly reminded me of the gender difference between her and me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The weight on my thighs was much lighter than before. And if I wanted to, I could easily push her down… No, of course, I wouldn’t. But… It’s a metaphor. Seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know, but it smelled different from when she was a demon. Was it body odour?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. Rather, it was more like a peculiar comfort. Ah- her hair was so smooth. I guess she takes good care of it. Hmm… and her body felt hot…</p>
<p class="calibre4">In short, Fujiwara is very girly…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s wrong!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I grabbed her by the shoulders and pushed her away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s it. I’m not excited, so get out of here. See? Hmm, I might have been a bit out of line, so I apologize. I’m sorry. I give up now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Realizing that I was starting to feel weird, I tried to lead the conversation away, feeling a little impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Fujiwara didn’t leave.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the contrary, she hugged me more tightly. I couldn’t push her away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s strong… Argh… This girl… It looked like even in her real form, her power as a demon still remained.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Huh! Why are you so impatient?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Huh? Her voice was unnaturally calm?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m not in a hurry. What are you talking about? Don’t interpret things so conveniently.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha!” She chuckled. “Ashiya-kun’s heart is right… here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s beating faster than before. I can feel your heartbeat through my chest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yabe!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara raised herself slightly and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She twisted around on top of me, sitting uncomfortably, and her buttocks rubbed against my thighs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fu-fufu… Come on. You should just be honest with me. Say that I’m very attractive, and you are too embarrassed to tell me. Say it. Then, I’ll forgive you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her eyes were provocative. But there was a slight hint of reserve in it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her face was still red. But before I knew it, the passion she had before receded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if she was convinced of her victory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? Don’t be stupid. It’s just that your chest is so flat that you can feel my heartbeat more easily. Ahhhh. It’s a misunderstanding. Now just get off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t wanna. I used a lot of magic power to return to this form, so give me more.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then Fujiwara rubbed her cheek against mine. Cheek-to-cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What is this girl doing?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“O-Oi-Oi.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t feel that way towards me, it’s fine. Or what? Do you admit it? Mm-hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was getting carried away!</p>
<p class="calibre4">She began to absorb my magic power even faster… Aa… Argh?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh-oh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt sluggish all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Could it be possible that she sucked too much of my magic power?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fu-Fujiwara-san? Do you feel like you still need more magic power? Isn’t this enough?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It wasn’t good. The more I looked at it, the less room I had. I couldn’t even enjoy the feeling of a girl anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was dizzy. I mean, we were exchanging magic power through clothes. Wasn’t that inefficient?</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were told that we should touch each other directly, but we didn’t at all, and the loss was too much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was painful. I was even starting to feel exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara, I’m at my limit. I’m running out of magic power. I’m dying. Seriously, get off. Please.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? Is that how you plan to escape? I don’t want to. I won’t allow it until Ashiya-kun admits defeat. And I indeed don’t have enough magic power. If you understand, give me more.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wasn’t joking, you know. I could die any moment!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara had gotten completely carried away. She was behaving like she owned the place, but I didn’t even have the strength to understand a word that she said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Noisy!</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s painful. I’m dying. I’m being sucked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was losing consciousness… Oh, no, this was really bad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Damn it. I couldn’t do this anymore. I had to transfer my magic more efficiently to satisfy her and make her move.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But what should I do? Direct skin contact is a bit, uh…</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s right. How about… mucous exchange?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her lips were moving busily in front of my eyes. Her tongue wiggled behind it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I unconsciously moved ahead, like a drowning child seeking help.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey! Wha-!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara shouted, pushing my face away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing? You’ve finally shown your true colours! You beast!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-you. Magic power, you want more magic power, right? I’ll give it to you… For real, ah… it looks like I’m gonna die soon…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Amid my unsteady thoughts, I moved my face toward hers. There was no helping me now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nevertheless, she grabbed my face and used her monstrous strength to refuse my approach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that doesn’t mean you can’t kiss me! Are you nuts? Stop, sto&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up. I’m losing too much magic power through our clothes. We have to do this with mucus exchange.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No! No! I don’t want this to be my first kiss! I heard that the first kiss has to be more romantic… Ashiya-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara resisted with a complaint, but I pressed her with the strength of a fool on fire. I felt the muscle fibres in my neck making an unpleasant buzzing sound, but I just hoped it was just my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gradually, the distance narrowed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My consciousness had become quite cloudy. I no longer knew what I was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aa, Aah. Mou! Y-you have to take responsibility.“</p>
<p class="calibre4">With teary eyes, Fujiwara asked me for something. But I didn’t get what she was saying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For some reason, little by little, her resistance began to weaken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was close to the point where our lips were about to touch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yo&mdash; Yoshi!</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, huh? If Fujiwara was trying to escape, there would be no reason for me to do this… Huh?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know what was going on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Anyway, I was going to send my magic power to the limit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just as I was about to do so, my vision flickered…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was just about to take one more step when my consciousness disappeared as if I were melting into the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">*</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kneel.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Osu!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the wooden floor, I kneeled as ordered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In front of me, Fujiwara was standing glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was completely back to normal. Before, her face was so flushed that it looked like it was about to explode.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you have any excuses?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked like a judge passing sentence on a treacherous criminal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pondered how I could get out of this situation peacefully. But no matter how much I tried to make my words sound good, I couldn’t seem to change her mind, so I gave up. It was impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me say one thing for now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By no means did I try to have s*x. That was the Plank of Carneades. In other words, it was an emergency reaction, and from a life-saving perspective, it was inevitable… Ack.”<em class="calibre7"> [EN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plank_of_Carneades]</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara grabbed my head with an eagle grip. My skull felt like it was cracking from her unusual strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knew it. Though she appeared to have returned to her original form, it seems that the demon nature is still intact. I’m sure she was only Fujiwara in appearance, and her powers were the same as the demon. That’s just unfair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha?! What did you say?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara-san, this is bad. My head will sink deeper. You seem like a pro wrestler crushing an apple. Oh, my mistake… It’s my mistake. My head…! It hurts!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun? I almost had my first kiss stolen from me in such a stupid way, you know? I thought I was going to be screwed. How are you going to take responsibility for that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it hurts! Please forgive me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara let my head go as if the pain she had inflicted on me caused her to calm down to some extent. Then she sat down on the couch right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Seriously! I understand that you were desperate because you were about to run out of magic power, and I’m sure that I had an unknown reason for provoking you, so I’ll forgive you this time. But remember, there won’t be a next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for your generous treatment. I will never do anything like that again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s forget about this. Nothing happened between us. Is that clear?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, ma’am. But you know Fujiwara, you were carried away in the mood at the end…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got carried away! I’m lying. Please forgive me, please have mercy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara let out a depressed sigh as I hurriedly shifted from kneeling to prostrating.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haah. I wonder if I’ll be able to start school tomorrow like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… It’s not gonna be okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I expressed my honest opinion, she took one look at me and frowned, looking truly disgusted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I pray that a huge meteorite hits our school…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are acting like an elementary school kid who hasn’t finished her homework during the summer vacation.”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The road that led to the school building from the dormitory was adorned with cherry blossom trees in full bloom. It was as if they were celebrating the beginning of a new school year.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This year was going to be great.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But for Fujiwara and me, the glamour was just sarcasm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Prosperity?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Hope?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">How can I have hope?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Sure enough, the school I hadn’t been to in a long time after spring break was more uncomfortable than ever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Why is that? Because curious glances were radiating from everywhere.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If human gazes could pierce, I’d be full of holes by now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The problem, as you have probably guessed, was that the East branch students treated me as if I was the root of all evil. They blamed me for the incident, saying that I had interfered with Fujiwara’s exam.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a tremendous shift of responsibility. Even Fujiwara defended me, but that just made them unhappier. I was stuck in a negative loop. It wasn’t funny.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">On the other hand, the other faction, the West Branch, treated me very well. From the West’s perspective, I seem to be a hero who dealt a huge blow to the East scum. I didn’t intend to do that at all. I wanted to tell them not to involve me, a factionless person, in their faction war.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What a pain!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“G-good work, Souta-kun. You’ve been through a lot.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was now after school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was exhaustedly lying on my desk when I was approached by someone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I looked up, I saw a quiet-looking female student with long bangs covering her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was my classmate, Asahi Hirano.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We got along quite well because we were both in the same faculty and shared the same faction affiliation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m all beat up… Please heal me!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ehh… Ah, eh… Umm… You did a great job!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi uncomfortably stroked my head. Her hand movements were awkward, and her cheeks were red from embarrassment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was touched by her innocence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I can’t get enough of this. I think I’m about to wake up to something.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You idiot!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I turned around at the sudden abuse, my eyes met Fujiwara’s, who was giving off an aura of unhappiness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara clicked her tongue and continued, “It’s a shame that you have to stretch your nose to get a girl to be nice to you. Why didn’t you refuse, Hirano-san?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi, who was interrupted by Fujiwara, replied modestly, “W-well, I don’t mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It seems that she couldn’t strongly oppose the queen of the class.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Since Fujiwara has been messing with me regularly, Asahi was also involved with Fujiwara to a certain extent, but it seems that they haven’t been able to get along comfortably. She has had some contact with Fujiwara, but they didn’t seem to be on friendly terms.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Really? If you don’t like it, you’d better say so. Ashiya-kun gets carried away easily. If he does something you don’t like, don’t hesitate to ask for help.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara glared at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Tell me, how can you be so shameless?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I hoped she could share some of Asahi’s kindness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’s wrong with being shameless? In fact, you should work harder because I’m all beat up. Do you have any idea how nervous I was because of your cronies? I thought they were going to kill me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s… true. I’m sorry those kids bothered you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The apology was unexpectedly straightforward, and it was disheartening.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Maybe she was having a hard time keeping things in control.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, okay. But what are you going to do now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I wasn’t asking about big stuff like how she was going to handle them, but about what she was planning to do after school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Basically, there were no clubs at this school. Students are allowed to act freely after school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, first-year students usually studied in the library to improve themselves, practiced magic under the supervision of their teachers, or engaged in mock battles between students.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, we were now second-year students.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Starting from the second year, in addition to independent studies, we were able to receive quests.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Quests are like part-time jobs offered by the International Mage Association, which runs the school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">They send requests that are not worthy of professionals to students as practical training (with some exceptions).</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The exam to advance to the second year is the same as the provisional exam. If you pass the exam, you will be considered to have the minimum required skills to become a mage, and the association will issue you a temporary license, allowing you to accept quests.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Accepting quests is optional, but if you complete them, you will be remunerated. You’ll get some amount of money and points.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">These points are an electronic currency used within the school, but they are also an internal score. A certain number of points are required to graduate. In other words, if you don’t complete your quests by the third semester of your junior year, you will have to stay in school. Apparently, this is a measure to make graduates immediately effective.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara sighed in disgust.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What do you want me to do? I want to go home and sleep. I’m tired for today…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a rare whine coming from the diligent Fujiwara. It seems that even this conscious woman had her limits.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi’s eyes fluttered in surprise.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Even, you’re like that, Fujiwara-san!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Who do you think I am? It’s tiring to be disturbed by trivial gossip. I’m sick of the girls from the East worrying about my chastity, and the guys from the West treating me like Ashiya-Kun’s s*x slave… People are even dumber than I imagined.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“S-s*x slave!?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I know! That’s why I can’t help but worry because I can’t go against him anymore. I know he’s going to look at me curiously no matter what I do. But for now, there’s no truth to it. However, since he’s constantly eating and sleeping with me, I’m sure Ashiya-kun will soon get tempted and attack me. It really sucks. I feel depressed now…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Aren’t you too self-conscious? I’ve told you a million times that I’m not going to touch you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t help but interrupt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara frowned at me as if she didn’t like what I said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t know how you can say such a thing. Have you forgotten that you’re on probation?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yesterday was an accident. There’s no way I would have voluntarily attacked you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ehhh?!” Asahi shouted while looking at us in surprise, “What happened yesterday?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah&mdash; It’s nothing. Right, Fujiwara?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yeah. Nothing happened.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a blatant misrepresentation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, when she was so harshly rebuffed, the meek Asahi seemed unable to pursue the matter anymore. Although she appeared unconvinced, she backed off, saying, “I see.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I felt sorry for her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Anyway, it was no surprise that Fujiwara didn’t trust me at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If that’s the case, I guess I should prove to her that I’ll never attack her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For both our sakes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I mean, think about it. You merged with a demon now, right? In other words, you’re a creature from another world. Wouldn’t it be disgusting to mate with such a thing? What if you got infected with some unknown virus? What are you going to do if I get infected with a deadly STD that kills people? What if it causes a pandemic? The human race would be wiped out. I’m not stupid enough to mess with you. You understand?” </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre12">[TN: you’re ded lad.] [EN: Doesn’t need the STD to kill him because something else will.]</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Ne, do you think being honest at all times is a virtue?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I’m glad. If it had been Asahi instead of Fujiwara, I’m sure I would’ve lost my mind. Thank goodness it was you, Fujiwara!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“S-Souta-kun! What are you saying all of a sudden…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi’s face turned red, and she let out a small yelp.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of her waving hands in the air.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, gosh! You’re making fun of me again! You’re always like that, Souta-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“My bad! Asahi loves seeing your response. That’s why my tongue slipped.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re not sorry at all. From now on, I won’t forgive you anymore!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s right, Hirano-san, it’s time to cut ties with this man.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara’s harsh words caused Asahi to let out a sob.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Eh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oi-Oi.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t say unnecessary things. She’s one of my best friends. What if she casts me aside?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“A man who repeatedly makes sexually harassing remarks to a timid girl deserves to be cast aside.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That makes me sound like I’m an irredeemable piece of sh*t, so please don’t say that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s the truth. Come on, Hirano-san, don’t give him a chance.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I-it’s okay, we both know he’s not serious… right, Souta-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Nn? … Ah! Yes, we both know I’m not serious.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Why are you repeating the same thing? You ruined my follow-up.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No-no! I’m sorry. Please forgive me, Asahi-sama!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara gave me a scornful look at our exchange, but it’s what we call an agreement. If Asahi really didn’t like it, of course, I would have stopped this kind of involvement and apologized profusely. Maybe.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Mou! Ashiya-kun, you’re really…” Asahi turned her head away and peeked at me from the corner of her eyes and said, “But if you help me with the… quest, I’ll forgive you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh! You’ll let me off with that this time. Well, let’s go look at the board.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’d… rather go home and sleep.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ma, ma!” I soothed the grumpy Fujiwara, and then together, the three of us left the classroom.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">As the three of us walked down the hallway side by side, we were stared at by students passing by.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Those who seemed to be from the East looked at us with resentment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Those from the West looked at us with curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm, I had forgotten about it, because I was depressed, but</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What did you choose as your familiar, Asahi?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I asked Asahi as she was next to me to cover up my uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she was able to advance to the second year of the Boundary Interference Department, Asahi must have succeeded in summoning a familiar. However, there was no sign of the familiar beside her. I’m sure she had it waiting in the dormitory or their original world, summoning as needed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s how it usually went. It was just the exceptions like Fujiwara and me who can’t stay away from each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M-my familiar… you see. Umm… I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know what to expect when she slumped down and mumbled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um… well… It’s a… Su-Su-Succubus… that’s why.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but look at Fujiwara at the sound of her muffled voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought I had misheard Asahi, but judging from the way Fujiwara reacted, I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s surprising. I thought Hirano-san would’ve summoned a unicorn and or another similar monster… Oh, sorry, maybe you can’t get close to unicorns anymore?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you saying? I can still get close to a unicorn!” [EN: In Renaissance, only virgin maidens can approach unicorns.]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Then you’re one of us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara mumbled quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t care if you’re a virgin or not.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Succubus. They’re kinda like…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uu. Nothing n-naughty happened between us…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You summoned a succubus, and you don’t want to do anything naughty? It’s too dubious!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“N-no… I mean… I don’t have such dirty… thoughts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Un. So, I thought that if I summoned a succubus, I could learn how to be more proactive… Also, I wanted to get to know Souta-kun better!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh!? We’re still close enough, right? Wai&mdash; Uwa&mdash; I’m sad!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not what I mean! Not really!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such a waste of talent!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara unleashed her merciless fury.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it would be much more beneficial to talk to different people and have more opportunities to communicate with them rather than using a succubus as a familiar. In the first place, referring to a succubus, it seems like the only thing you’d get good at is how to seduce and handle men.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-is that so? B-but I don’t think so. It’s kinda… Ehee.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara stared at Asahi for a while with half-closed eyes, then said,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hirano-san, you’re a bit chubbier than I thought.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ou!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not that there’s anything wrong with that, … Oh! There are so many people over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When we arrived at the bulletin board, it was crowded with students.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone was looking over the quest outlines posted on the bulletin board.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All of them were second-year students, and I could sense that they were on the lookout to get a feeling of the new quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we approached to join in the excitement, one of them noticed us and shouted, “Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The surprise quickly spread, causing a murmur.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, God.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I swallowed my growing annoyance, ignored the noise, and looked over the posted quests…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa! Look who it is, Souta Ashiya, the rising star of the Boundary Interference Department!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, a woman’s voice rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I turned around, I saw a tall female student and a few cronies looking at us with a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was Ryoka Sanjo. With her long, loosely permed brown hair and well-trained physique, she looked like someone from ancient times. I sensed a similar vibe from her cronies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As students of the Department of Spatial Manipulation, they are apprentice magic warriors who fight with their bodies. Their bodies are their strength, and they train according to their magic spells, so they’re physically too strong. It reflected in her natural attire. That’s scary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Incidentally, the Department of Spatial Manipulation was for those who wished to major in magic, whether physical or magical, to create some phenomenon in space. This includes offensive magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because of its nature, those who graduated from this department often became mages specialized in direct combat, like magic warriors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Department of Boundary Interference, to which we belong, is a department that specializes in summoning, that is, interfering with the boundaries that exist between worlds and summoning creatures as familiars. Of course, in addition to summoning, they also taught us all basic magic so we can handle offensive magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They’re a bunch of troublemakers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara spat out in a whisper. As the two leaders of their respective departments in the second year, they were often at odds. In addition, because they are the top executives of the East and West, they often have skirmishes. Even their personalities were not on the same page.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Iyaa~ So unfortunate. It’s such a shame that Chikage Fujiwara failed to summon a demon and ended up becoming her classmate’s familiar! It was a terrible mistake! Such a blunder!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara clucked her tongue at Sanjo-san’s deliberate, exaggerated and heartfelt statement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sanjo-san grinned as if she was amused by her situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“On the other hand, Ashiya-kun! I never thought you’d be able to turn this talented young lady, who is thought to be the next head of the Fujiwara family, into a demon on the spur of the moment. I can’t help but admire you. You’re amazing, really amazing! Aren’t you even more talented than Fujiwara?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s impossible! Please don’t lift me just to lower Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was too scared to complain, though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she hit me, I’d end up with broken bones.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun! I fell in love with you! Would you like to join the West Branch?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her tongue worked hard to humiliate Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t want her to drag me into their faction drama.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sanjo-san, the thing is…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi-Oi. What’s the matter with you? You don’t have to call me that! You can call me Ryoka.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Isn’t she being too friendly for a stranger? She’s weird.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before Fujiwara became familiar, she didn’t even look at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But if I kept calling by her last name, it wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ll just clear myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll call you Ryoka. Anyway, I’m sorry, but I have no intention of joining any faction.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, well, I’m sorry to hear that. But if you change your mind, just let me know anytime, okay? You’re more than welcome. I can even get you a seat on the executive board if you want. And Mari, I mean… the student council president, cares about you a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such nonsense!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara spat out as if she finally lost her temper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look at this. To trick Ashiya-kun, they sent a woman who had such a bad personality. Disgusting. Do you really want to harass me that badly? How shallow of you. It’s exactly what I mean when I say that you guys are no better than an animal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka’s cheeks twitched at Fujiwara’s counterattack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But she quickly regained her composure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun? Your demon is talking too much. I think she should be disciplined. Otherwise, your dignity as a summoner will be questioned. Or maybe, people from the East generally have no manners, right? They’re all barbarians.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To her last words, the students who had gathered in front of the bulletin board and belonged to the East became frantic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing this, the people from the West started laughing… What the h**l is wrong with these people?</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the midst of all of this, the minority of unaffiliated people couldn’t stand the tense atmosphere and ran away from the scene. Asahi was also looking concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not good. It could turn into a brawl, and someone will get hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka was too strong in a fistfight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But now, Fujiwara was even stronger than an ogre.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But then,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s going on here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the tense air that seemed filled with magic power, a dignified voice sounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The person who appeared was a ponytailed female student, the student council president, Marika Sanjo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just happened to be passing by. What is this about, Ryoka?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As you might tell from her last name, the president is a relative of Ryoka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marika is a legitimate daughter of the Sanjo family, while Ryoka is from a branch family. I remember that the two were cousins.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka smiled fondly at the president.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Iya~ I was having a quick chat with Ashiya-kun, who is the talk of the town. We had a minor misunderstanding, and Fujiwara and I ended up arguing. But it’s nothing serious. You don’t have to worry, Mari-nee.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ryoka, I’m sure you said something inappropriate again. You’re always like that. I’ve been telling you not to agitate the East. When will you learn that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t mean to say that…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Ryoka lowered her head, the president sighed and looked at us apologetically and said, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Souta-kun, Fujiwara-san, I’m sorry about our Ryoka. I know I’m repeating this, but I hope you’ll forgive her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s what you want then, I don’t care…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara replied without even trying to hide her reluctance. She must be very upset about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thanked the student council president in my heart for dissolving this matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know why she calls me by my first name. She often takes care of me, but I couldn’t think of any reason why she would do so. I still wonder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m really sorry… Ryoka, come with me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait! I was looking for a… quest. Ah, Mou~! Ashiya-kun, I meant what I said earlier! If you join the West, I’m sure not only me but also Mari-nee will be happy to see you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Enough babbling!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heee&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka was dragged away by the president.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The remaining people from the East giggled as if they were amused, while the people from the West walked away, looking uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm, insidious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Humph!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the midst of all this, Fujiwara snorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the three of us were looking at the bulletin board, Asahi pointed to a printout.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She might be interested in this one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The printout, an A4-size sheet pinned to the board with thumbtacks, contained an outline of a quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m a little curious about this one.”</p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">Defeat a Thought Entity</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">A request from a woman being stalked by a telekinetic entity. Please help her get rid of it.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">Difficulty level: F</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">&nbsp;People required: One or two people.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">Reward: 10,000 yen + 3,000 points (not including expenses)</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">Note: The party must include at least one female student.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre8">For details, please contact the Student Affairs Division.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4">I see. It’s a quest with no special requirements. It’s just the easiest way to earn some money. I guess it’ll be a good first challenge. I mean, I didn’t want to get involved in a difficult quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It may seem too easy, but it’s my first time. It’s good for a little test, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was expecting Fujiwara to have some quibbles, but she readily agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so, our first quest was decided.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">The next day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After receiving the quest, we headed to a coffee shop after school to meet the client for a chat. There was a female college student in her 20’s waiting for us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The carefully applied make-up and clean clothes made her look more sophisticated than a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre4">College students usually enjoy their campus life to the fullest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But there was a looming shadow on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hello! Are you Ohno-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked up at us in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Are you mages, by any chance?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her voice was sweet and somewhat stilted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We have a provisional license, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded and sat down on the sofa in front of Ohno-san, and Fujiwara and Asahi forced themselves to sit next to me. It was a two-person seat, so it was a tight squeeze. It would be best if one of them sat beside Ohno-san. Were these two actually shy?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve heard that you’ve been the victim of a Thought Entity. I’m Souta Ashiya, a second-year student at the International Mage Association’s Academy, and I’m here to help you. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m Chikage Fujiwara.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, um… I’m Asahi Hirano.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When we briefly introduced ourselves, Ohno-san rolled her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was wondering why you looked very young, so you’re a student.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes. I’m sorry about that. However, we have at least a minimal knowledge of magic, so even though we are students, I don’t think it will interfere with the request.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t mean to complain.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san gave me a brief smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know how she really felt, but I’m relieved that she didn’t give us any trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, let’s talk about the request.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I recalled the details of the quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve been suffering from poltergeist phenomena every night. Is it kind of a ghost?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that’s right. At night I feel someone’s gaze on me from somewhere. Things in the room start to move by themselves. I hear voices, I feel like someone is touching my body, and when I’m sleeping, I feel like someone is on my chest. It’s so painful…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was almost the same as the details in the report I saw at the student’s affairs office.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m listening. Just to make sure, you’re not imagining things, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not! It’s true damon~!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">damon~!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry for that. I sympathize with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I couldn’t sympathize with her at all, but still, I nodded curiously in return.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m sorry to say this, but for those who work with magic… ghosts, thought entities are nothing more than mobs, not something to be feared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If it were a powerful thought entity, it would be scary as a threat. However, judging from what I read in the request form and heard directly from her, it was probably not that big of a deal this time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Plus, the student affairs department had determined the difficulty level to be F.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why it must be a small fry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d like to ask you one question. Do you have any idea what might be causing this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thought entities spawn when the magic in the air combines with strong emotions emanating from a person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the name implies, they are thoughts that have taken form.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The strength of the original emotion is directly proportional to the thought entity’s strength. If you can find out the cause, you can measure how powerful it is.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san swept her gaze at my question. Then she stuttered as if she was having trouble saying something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I was in a club at university. It was an occult research club.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you interested in occultism?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, not at all. My boyfriend likes that kind of stuff, so I joined just to hang out with him.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. And?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I had an affair with someone in the circle.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because of that, our relationship became a mess, and the circle broke into pieces.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While I was questioning, Asahi said, “A circle crusher…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That means…” Fujiwara, who had been listening with her arms locked, said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, you meant to say that your boyfriend or unfaithful partner has a grudge against you and had sent a thought entity to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san nodded at her guess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I believe you’re right. But why do you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s quite possible. As members of an occult club, they probably have some knowledge of telekinesis.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even people without magical powers can create thought entities.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Basically, people who don’t belong to the Mage Association are assumed to have no magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As is the case in any member country of the association, a magic power test at birth is compulsory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The presence or absence of magic power is also written down in the family register.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Children born with magic power, after reaching a certain age, are forced to choose between becoming a mage’s apprentice or having their magic power completely sealed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Magic is a power too great for an individual to possess. If misused, it can even bring great harm to modern society, and it is strictly forbidden for unqualified people or those who have not studied under a mage to use it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, in this case, the thought entity is created when the magic power in the air combines with human thoughts, so the presence or absence of personal magic power isn’t relevant. Even ordinary people could create them if they wanted to.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was why they are most often involved in magic crimes committed by ordinary people.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If nothing else, thought entities are pretty easy to create. And I think this one will be easy to defeat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way to get rid of a thought entity is quite simple. All you have to do is hit them with an attack that involves magic power. The magic power that forms them will dissipate, and they will quickly disappear. It’s the easiest way to get rid of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is the time and place of the appearance of the thought entity the same each time?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, do you think it’ll come inside my room in the middle of the night each day? So far, it’s been quite frequent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“All right. Then, may I come to your room around nighttime?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course… I’d appreciate it…”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">After we parted ways with Ohno-san, the three of us headed back to the dormitory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, who was sitting on the bed, asked while I was on my way to boil some water at the kitchen counter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“About what?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That woman, Ohno-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She seems to be a princess of an otaku circle. It must be awfully nice to conform to the trends. Good for her. She seems to be enjoying life.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, not that. Didn’t you feel like she was hiding something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked at Asahi, who was sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? Ah, um…” Asahi seemed to be quite nervous as she muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t get it. I thought Ohno-san was an amazing person in many ways.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right, she’s amazing. Maybe, Asahi, you also want to be like her? Someone who can destroy their circle like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-w-what are you saying? I won’t have an affair!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. Oh, well. It’s about time you show us your familiar. A succubus, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t think this is the right time…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No offence. By the way, coffee, tea, or green tea, which do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aa… C-coffee. Thanks!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just instant coffee!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun.” Fujiwara got my attention. “I’ll have tea. I want milk tea with extra milk.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can brew it yourself. Don’t be lazy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha!? Don’t be so small-minded. It’s not much trouble. More importantly…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“All right, all right! I’ll make it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I compromised before she could say anything, and Fujiwara crossed her legs. “It’s good if you understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This girl…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Back to the topic at hand, if neither of you thought anything of it, was it just my imagination?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that Asahi and I didn’t notice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, yes,” Asahi nodded. “I didn’t notice anything either.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know, but even if Ohno-san lied about something, it wouldn’t make any difference. So why don’t you just leave it alone? We all have one or two things we don’t want to say.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The water boiled quickly, and I poured it into the cups.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s right. It’ll be all over once we defeat the thought entity.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But if we don’t deal with the source, won’t it spawn more thoughts?” Asahi said with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s true. The reason why Ohno-san was being harassed by a thought entity was that there were people with a strong grudge against her. Even if you disperse them, if you don’t solve the root of the problem, the possibility of another one appearing again is quite high.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But still.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, we shouldn’t pry any further. The only thing we’ve been asked to do is to defeat it. If that’s the case, then we should just kill it and give some advice. After that, we don’t have to hold any more responsibility. The rest is Ohno-san’s problem. What more can we do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’ll be fine as long as we explain that if she doesn’t clear up her relationship, she’ll get another one like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I said as I placed the cup in front of Asahi.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Asahi began to stir the coffee with her spoon, she muttered, “… I guess so”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that she was convinced, though not from the bottom of her heart. She’s quite a tough girl to please.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you being too kind? Be a little more reasonable. See, why don’t you take a lesson from me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To my suggestion, Fujiwara laughed scornfully and commented, “No, Hirano-san. If you follow this scumbag’s steps, it will be the end of your humanity.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your milk tea.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I put the tea on the bedside table, and Fujiwara sipped it without thanking me, muttering in disgust, “Not enough milk.” This girl seriously needs to be slapped once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I managed to suppress my irritation, Asahi said modestly, “You two are living in this room together now, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, well, we do.” Fujiwara replied with a nod and said, “If I leave Ashiya-kun, my magic power will run out, and I’ll die. Of course, I’m unwilling, but I’m forced to live with him, and it’s not a weird thing, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I see. Heh…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">*Spin-spin*</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi stared at the coffee and muttered as she spun the spoon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s nice…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked, she looked up at me, flustered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? Oh, no, that’s… It was… I envy you living with someone else…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why’s that? If that’s the case, why don’t you go live with the succubus too? I mean, it’s about time you showed us the succubus. I’ve been wondering about it for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uu… Do I really need to…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to see it. I really want to see it. It’s really erotic, right? Let me see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I said that excitedly, Fujiwara spat out, “You suck!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah, it sucks!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh.” Asahi groaned and took out a thick grimoire from her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-then… Just a peek… Okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi sent magic power into the grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then a magic circle appeared above Asahi’s head, from which a woman with devilish wings and goat horns appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shouted, clenching my fists.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her skin…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The floating woman was wrapped (not entirely) in thin clothing that looked like a piece of string, exposing about ninety-five percent of her skin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was s**y!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her body was voluptuous, and the combination of a cute face with a touch of youthfulness made her look immoral.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was exactly how a ‘Succubus’ is described.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Isn’t she…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shifted my gaze from the succubus floating in the air to Asahi.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stared at Asahi, then back at the succubus.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What the?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-you have the same face! Eh, twins? Asahi-san, were you a succubus?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But then the succubus glided behind her and placed both hands on her shoulders.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pxJPV81/000010.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“She’s not. I’m just imitating her. Fufu. Hi there, little boy~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heart jumped as she gave me an erotic smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, no.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I fell in love. It was the kind of smile that made one fall in love.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could feel my face getting hot…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“H-hello.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I awkwardly replied, the succubus chuckled and flew over to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, why are you so nervous? You look pretty strong and cute~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her fingertips stroked my thigh with just the right amount of force, barely grazing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My whole body shuddered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She approached so closely that I could feel her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stared at me with the same eyes as Asahi’s, usually hidden by her bangs, seemingly sucking me right in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her red tongue peeked out from her red lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stroked my thighs and lifted my chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t take my eyes off her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t think of anything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her lips approached close to mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“ASHIYA-KUN!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I huffed at Fujiwara’s scream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I jolted back and pushed the succubus away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, Oh… eh? What… What just?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was about to lose my consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre4">What just happened?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Scary!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Succubi are scary!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-why?” Asahi flustered and asked her, “W-what, what were you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yaan~ Don’t get mad at me. He looks so delicious, so I wanted to have a taste of him~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she floated back to Asahi’s side, her tail brushed my chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heart began to jump.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah… I’m dying!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You!! You can’t do that! W-why did you do that!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Instincts… It’s like breathing to me, you know~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not what I meant! Mouu&mdash;!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had never seen her this furious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My face tensed up as I tried to control my racing heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, man. I almost had my energy sucked out of me. Scary. Succubi are scary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that’s good! If I can charm him in my current form, it means that Master can make him fall in love as well, right? Fufu… I’m so happy for you~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is… is that so? Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi, who had been shouting, sat down and curiously looked at the succubus.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, you can! Because my current appearance is entirely yours!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Really!!!!!!!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stared at the succubus as if to lick her entire body, and then I looked at Asahi.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is it the same?</p>
<p class="calibre4">There, that, and everything else is the same…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hee&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Heeee&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks for the lesson!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A.S.H.I.Y.A-K.U.N!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My body convulsed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked over and saw a blank-faced Fujiwara glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“F-Fujiwara. You’re scaring me! Please don’t stare at me like that. I’m begging you. Please return to your normal self, lovely Chikage Fujiwara-sama.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can you be so pathetic?” Fujiwara spat out, “You fell for a succubus. I feel like crying, thinking that I’m the familiar of such trash!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-why aren’t you crying then?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… It’s impossible for me to resist because that thing is seriously alluring.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">[…]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well… looking at the succubus, I realized that even though you have a good face, you aren’t s**y at all. No, I’ve to thank you that you’re my familiar. I mean, now you can rest assured that I won’t be making any mistakes. I really appreciate it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And after that…</p>
<p class="calibre4">She kicked me in the face…</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">After dinner, I submitted a request to stay outside the dormitory, and the three of us headed to Ohno-san’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her room was a 1K apartment for a single student with good security features. [EN: 1K = 1 room with kitchen.]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, it’s a little dirty.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The room she showed us was exactly what a boy would imagine a girl’s room to be.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The whole place was decorated in warm colours and was somewhat fluffy. Considering her track record as a circle crasher, I guessed that the room composition was well-received by men.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, a beautiful cobweb. A perfect hunting ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered how many prey, or men, had been in this room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please have a seat. I’ll get you some tea.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took her words and sat down on a cushion that resembled an animal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi looked around the room curiously, while Fujiwara looked bored at the small bookshelf. The bookshelves were filled up with fashion magazines, women’s magazines, and a few textbooks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Normally, it would happen in about thirty minutes…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san said as she handed out barley tea.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The cups, trays, and all the little things were cute. I mean, even the loungewear she was wearing was cute. The way she tied up her hair looked messy, but it actually looked cute. The natural make-up that made her look like she wasn’t wearing any was also cute. She probably was very artistic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She took her average look to a far higher level with her overwhelming skill.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What’s up with this woman?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everything around her screamed, “Girl! I’m a girl! Everything here is girlish!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">If a small fry woman with low girlish power stepped into this place, she would disappear within a flash…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara, are you all right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked worriedly, Fujiwara gave me a dubious look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems her girlish power was too low to understand the greatness of this room. I better not say anything unnecessary because I had barely escaped death.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s nothing.” I rubbed my jaw, which was still sore, and said, “Well, let’s do one last check.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It wasn’t much of a strategy, but we had already decided how we would act when the thought entity appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was quite simple: Asahi will set up a barrier to block the entity’s escape route, I’ll protect Ohno-san, and in the meantime, Fujiwara will beat the entity to death. If I run out of gas and Fujiwara can’t move before defeating the entity, Asahi will either use her succubus or release offensive magic. If even that fails… Well, I doubt it will.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve never used Fujiwara in battle before, so I don’t know how to allocate my magic power. You can only use one offensive magic at once, or I might collapse right then and there. My supply circuit is also weak. So Fujiwara, when you see the thought entity, just hit it with your fists as much as possible. I don’t know, but I feel like if you unleashed offensive magic, this room might explode.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara may look like an ordinary high school girl, but she had a demon inside her. The magic she could unleash will be quite powerful. A small room like this would be no match for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“All right. And if I fail to kill it, then Hirano-san, please take care of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I’ll do my best, but first, I’ll create a barrier.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we were talking, Ohno-san looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Souta-kun, you’re not going to fight?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? No, I’m going to focus on protecting you, Ohno-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. Thank you. I’ll be relying on you in times of need.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she took my hand and smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was a natural at this kind of thing, wasn’t she? She’s a pro. I got convinced why the indoor circle fell apart. I would have also been in trouble if I hadn’t built up a tolerance for the female body after the succubus incident.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Leave it to me. Well, I don’t think it’s going to be that dangerous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The other party was just a low-grade thought entity, and we had defeated them many times in class.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It wasn’t an obstacle I should get worked up about now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, we stand by. The four of us passed the time by exchanging small talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And when it was almost midnight…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara looked up at the ceiling as if she had noticed something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong? The magic in the air is buzzing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really? You can feel that? That’s amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe it’s because the demon within me is sensitive to magic power. I never had this feeling before. Anyway, you two, be prepared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if triggered by her words, I heard a sound like a punch on the front door. It was the sound of the doorknob rattling violently over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hii&mdash;” Ohno-san cowered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The furniture in the room began to shake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was like an earthquake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even the heavy refrigerator and bed moved. Everything did, except the ground. From somewhere, I could feel a clear wave of magic power that even… I could detect.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s strange. It seemed too powerful of a phenomenon to be caused by a weak thought entity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The interference in the atmosphere was much greater than any of the thought entities we have dealt with in class. It was much larger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara. It looks stronger than we expected…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re right. Hirano-san, barrier please.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Asahi sent magic power into the grimoire, the room got covered in a thin film of magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It should have made it impossible for the thought entity to escape from here, but…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The empty glass floated up and flew towards Ohno-san. I flicked it with my arm in the nick of time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The glass shattered against the wall, and Ohno-san let out a yelp.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Over there!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara pointed to the corner of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a mass of white mist, shaped like a cowering man.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a thought entity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it was much thicker than what I had imagined. I couldn’t believe that it spawned from the emotions of a person who had been cheated on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just as I was wondering, the ceiling light went out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The room was enveloped in darkness, leaving only the dim amount of light emitted by the appliances.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san clung to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if in response, the thought entity arose and let out an inaudible cry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Countless small objects came up at once and flew towards us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t think it was jealous of me being hugged by Ohno-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the small objects flew at me, I screamed as I knocked down the dangerous ones with my grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ones flying towards Ohno-san, I had no choice but to block them directly with my body, and it hurt a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The colour of Fujiwara’s eyes changes from black to crimson, seemingly of a demon. It meant that she was going to be offensive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As her arm glowed blue, I wavered as my magic power got sucked out through the supply circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara struck at the thought entity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, just before she could hit it, the air around the thought entity distorted, creating a transparent wall. It was a defensive reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just this much!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Fujiwara’s fist didn’t stop.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The transparent wall got pierced, and a blue trail blew away the upper half of the thought entity like smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The remaining lower half of the body fell to its knees, causing the various objects floating in the air to lose their power and fall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fuh… it’s just a low-grade thought entity.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not over yet!” Asahi panicked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And in the next moment&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">The white smoke that should have scattered had reformed itself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tch… Then how about this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara wrapped her fist with magic again and delivered an uppercut.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then it was uprooted from the lower half of his body and scattered into thin air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is this thing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it reformed again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How is that possible? If it were a normal one, it would have disappeared long ago.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The most important thing was that the prolonged battle was sucking up all the magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Supplying it from the circuitry is far too inefficient compared to directly exchanging magic power!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m at my limit…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uck… Fujiwara, hurry up. I’m about to run out of magic power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know! But I hit it… Oh, no!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The white particles that had been scattered by Fujiwara’s beatings retreated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the distance between them increased, Fujiwara was unable to reach it due to many small items floating around the room that had risen to block the gap. It was a lot more than I had ever seen before. I wouldn’t be able to protect Ohno-san if I got hit with all of these things. There were even knives and scissors in the mix.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh god! I’m gonna die.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t underestimate me!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara held up her hand and shot out a blinding flare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In an instant, it engulfed the thought entity, broke through the window, and was swallowed by the night sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara-san! I can’t keep up the barrier… Ah, it’s gone…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Asahi was saying something, my magic power emptied, and I collapsed on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My consciousness was distant…</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Let’s review,” Fujiwara said while standing in the middle of the messy room, not attempting to hide her displeasure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ou.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">My magic power got sucked out to the limit, and I had lost consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even though it was only for a short time, it still felt pathetic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It seemed that the Thought Entity had escaped while I was unconscious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wait, Fujiwara-san. Souta-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“M-my room… It’s a mess. All the windows and furniture… Fu… fufu… hahaha…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi and Ohno-san, who were cleaning the room, came to us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san’s eyes were vacant. I couldn’t sense any sign of life left in her eyes, and her legs lost their strength.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Everything got scattered around the room, and the window leading to the balcony got shattered. Most of the furniture was now in pieces. It somewhat resembled a ruin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As a person who was partly responsible for the cause of the disaster, I felt a bit guilty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I hope that the association’s insurance covers property damage. I’ll need to talk with them later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara, on the other hand, looked at me with displeasure, as if she didn’t feel any guilt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What was that thing? It wasn’t normal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;“Yeah! Aah, I’m feeling dizzy, my body hurts…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked up at the ceiling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The light bulb had shattered, and the only light source left was the moonlight coming in from outside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was brighter than I thought… but it didn’t change the fact it still looked like a ruin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, that was unusual, right?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I nodded my head to Asahi, who asked fearfully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yes. It wasn’t just unusual; it was too strong.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Was that really the thought body of the person who got cheated on?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m sure Asahi thought the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Normally, that alone shouldn’t be enough to cause something that heinous.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san nodded weakly at that point.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s true. I have no idea what else to do… Ugh, my room…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Is there something you weren’t telling us? Did you really give us all the information you had?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara’s suspicion made Ohno-san stiffen for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But she immediately smiled forcefully to hide it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You don’t believe me? Hey, Sota-kun, you do believe me, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She sat down and leaned lightly on me. Ooh, such trickery.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara clicked her tongue, and Asahi pulled me frighteningly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah. Of course, if you have nothing to hide, it’s fine. But if you do have something that could affect the strength of the Thought Entity, then it might be difficult to solve without knowing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san grunted, “Uh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The three of us focused our gazes on her reaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But still, Ohno-san mumbled with ‘Uh’ and ‘Umm.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re not lying? I don’t think that thing was just from the person you had an affair with!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara was persistent, and her mouth curved into a paranoid expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi looked at me as if she was troubled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Hmm. From the way she reacted, I’m pretty sure she was hiding something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Though I thought that the Thought Entity came from either the affair accomplice partner or lover, what else could be wrong…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ah! Don’t tell me this girl…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You said you broke the circle, didn’t you, Ohno-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san smiled bitterly at my question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah. Haha… yeah. That’s right&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“But, an affair with just one person is not enough to destroy the circle? Well, of course, relationships will break, and the number of members will decrease to some extent, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san’s face became slumped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Maybe you did something with more than one person in the circle?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san’s face at that moment was like that of a child whose mischief was found out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Hah!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see,” Fujiwara muttered with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“This means that that thing was born from the entanglement of multiple Thought Entities who have resentment towards the same person, you. I’ve heard that on a horrific battlefield, the residual thoughts of countless dead people can agglutinate and create a super-powerful Thought Entity, and this is the same situation. It must be strong.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It might not be that strong, but it was certainly much more formidable than a normal Thought Entity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I don’t know how many people she had affairs with, but if it was with two different people, the entity might be twice as strong as a low-grade Thought Entity, making it more complicated to deal with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But if that were the case, we could deal with it by preparing in advance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Though I couldn’t deny that I was careless due to thinking we were dealing with a low-grade Thought Entity, it was a huge mistake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“With how many people did you have an affair with? Two? Three?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I wonder… how many?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When Ohno-san was reluctant to say anything, Fujiwara commented irritably, “If you want us to solve the problem, speak.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san lowered her head frighteningly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’ve slept with all twelve… guys in my circle. I may be resented by all twelve of them…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh god!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A strange voice came out of my throat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Seriously?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What is… she?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">So that meant that that thing was twelve times stronger than those low-grade thought entities?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Eh? Ehh? T-that many…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara was also speechless, judging from her expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Time-out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I made a ‘T’ with both hands, grabbed Fujiwara and Asahi’s arms, and headed for the corner of the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oi. I can’t do this. That’s too many… Let’s say sorry to Ohno-san and go home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I whispered to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ha!?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara’s expression got distorted as she said, “Don’t be ridiculous! Why should we have to retire from a quest with level F difficulty? What will the people from the West say? They’ll say whatever they want! No! Absolutely not! Though ten… twelve, no, I mean, it’s stupid to help a woman who’s cheating so much, I don’t want to run away from a level F difficulty!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“This is definitely not level F difficulty! I mean, it’s too excessive! Fujiwara, I know you’re strong. In addition, you’ve got the power of a demon, so your attack power is probably the best of the pros!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Then why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“But right now, we don’t have enough strength! And it’s not enough to deal with a Thought Entity that comes back to life every time you defeat it. It’ll be easy if it were a normal ghost or Thought Entity, but not this one! In this situation, you are a rock, and that thing is paper!” [TN: Reference to rock-paper-scissors.]</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, no, no, no, no! We’ve to clear it! We’re gonna clear it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She began to stomp, and the floor creaked from the ridiculous force.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This girl! Is she a kid?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m already at the limit by supplying you with the magic power, and I can’t use other magic anymore. Asahi isn’t an offensive sorcerer either. And even if we were to somehow attack it, it would in no way work against it! We’re stuck here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I explained carefully, Fujiwara fell silent. Though she’s well aware that this quest was impossible, because of her pride, she wouldn’t admit it easily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara should learn how to live more appropriately. She was too self-conscious about her stature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“All right. Let’s stop to get dinner and go home!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wait!!!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Please don’t abandon me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It seems she overheard us… though we were shouting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s not what I mean. You know there’s a limit to what we can do, and we’re not abandoning you. I’ll send a request to the professionals in the association. The request fee will go up. I’m sorry, but this case is too heavy for us students to handle.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah, t-then how much is that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmm, it’s probably a few million. We’ll probably need more than one professional.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“W-wait!” Ohno-san clung to me and said, “I can’t pay that much. Look what happened to my furniture! I need to buy more stuff. I-I’ll do anything for you if you help me. Please. Please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was desperate enough to do anything, this person… I’m sorry, I know how you feel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’ll be fine. The association’s insurance might cover the property damage. Hopefully.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, really? But… even if they do, it’s still millions for me to pay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That thing is quite strong. This time we were lucky that it didn’t attack us, so we got away easily, but if it became hostile, it could kill people. Of course, we are not the only ones. Ohno-san, your life is in danger as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“N-no… Uwaaa… why is this happening? I-I don’t have enough money…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s because you had affairs with people…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I pointed it out, Ohno-san gulped and nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I felt sorry for her, but there was nothing I could do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I guess we’re done here. Oh, shall I help you clean up your room?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m going to stay at a hotel today…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I bowed and headed for the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But when I was about to leave the room, Asahi pulled my sleeve and said, “W-wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What happened?” I looked at her sad face and asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are we really leaving?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Of course, there’s nothing we can do. And probably nothing will happen tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“But, I feel sorry for her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I turned around, my eyes met Ohno-san’s as she looked at me pleadingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Looking at the sight of a woman who was going to owe millions in debt, my heart sank deep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But even if you looked at me like that, it was impossible for me or us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Even so, there’s no way we can defeat that thing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I think we don’t have to defeat it…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What do you mean?” To Asahi’s response, Fujiwara asked curiously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, let’s see.” Asahi explained, “If the reason for its existence disappears, the Thought Entity will disappear, right? I was wondering if there was anything we could do about that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re right, but how exactly?” Fujiwara’s sharp tone made Asahi shy away from her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Umm… I mean, if somehow we can clear the resentment of the people in the circle against Ohno-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t think it’s that easy to get rid of a grudge against someone who would do something this messed up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That was exactly what I meant. To be clear, she’s no ordinary scum.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The resentment of the circle members towards her must be considerable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Uu…” Asahi couldn’t find anything to say in response, so she groaned and fell silent with tears in her eyes. It was a heavy hit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She got disheartened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That’s not good. I don’t care about Ohno-san anymore, but I feel sorry for Asahi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I wonder if I can do something about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But even so, this is as good as it gets. We couldn’t beat it in a fight, and even if we eliminated the reason for its existence, it’s unlikely that the people who created the Thought Entity will simply forget their grudge against Ohno-san. It was a love affair and a twelve-fold love affair at that. It’s too much… too dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san, in her next life, is going to be reborn as salmonella(bacteria) or something. [EN: Bad karma -&gt; worse reincarnation.]</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry, I was reckless and got you in trouble…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi smiled weakly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oh my god! She was so cute that I wanted to protect her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">By looking at Asahi’s dejected expressions, my annoyance with Ohno-san grew even larger. I wonder why she was worried about this scum?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ohno-san is Ohno-san. If you think about it for a moment, you’d know that repeated cheating in a small community would be disastrous. And I could only say that her brain was attached to her lower body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And it must have been annoying for the nerds who were happily studying the occult until Ohno-san showed up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Of course, the circle’s members who gave in to their sexual desires were definitely at fault, but even so, they weren’t black basses devouring the ecosystem. Don’t be careless! [EN: Black Basses feed on small fish, which the MC is comparing the other members with.]</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This woman is no longer a human being. She’s a sexual predator… huh… ah!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yes!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m sure Asahi could do something about that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hey, Asahi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi looked up at me and said, “… Yeah. Let’s go home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I think you can handle it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As soon as I said that, all three of them turned to me at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“How?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When Fujiwara asked suspiciously, I rearranged my thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yeah… It’ll work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even if we didn’t get rid of the grudge, we could eliminate the reason for the existence of the Thought Entity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sleep with it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ha?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked past Fujiwara’s questioning face and locked eyes with Asahi, who looked up at me with a puzzled expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Asahi. You can use your succubus to seduce the people in the occult circle.”</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">As it turned out, the Thought Entity completely disappeared after only three days.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was too quick.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The succubus had taken all twelve men from Ohno-san. When the intentions directed at a person disappear, the Thought Entity loses its meaning of existence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was a succubus. Human bimbos were no match for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder what kind of seduction the guys went through.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wish I could have seen it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We had been visiting the apartment every night to protect Ohno-san for the past three days, but now that the Thought Entity had finally stopped appearing, we were relieved of our duties.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It marked the end of the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The quest was over. That was it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, I didn’t do anything, though!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I got hit, and it hurt, that was all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ohno-san thanked Asahi for her huge accomplishment and gave her her phone number. Ohno-san also said that she would be happy to help her if she needed anything, and Asahi thanked her even though she was confused. As far as love problems are concerned, she seems to be very dependable (if only in terms of offence), but…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hope she won’t get influenced too much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s frustrating,” On the way home from her apartment, Fujiwara blurted out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She seemed to be bothered by the fact that she had not been of much help.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. We have to be thankful that Asahi-sama’s fine play saved us here. There was nothing we could have done.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I said this with a smirk, Fujiwara looked at me for a moment as if she was about to say something but then quickly exhaled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I can’t deny that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“B-but it was you, Fujiwara-san, who got rid of the Thought Entity every time until it disappeared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay, Hirano-san, you don’t have to follow up. I’m just a failure who can’t even complete a quest with level F difficulty. Oh, and I failed the summoning test.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s a bit of a downer because she didn’t do as well as expected in her first quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve never seen Fujiwara this nervous before. I don’t know. It was just strange to see.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The difficulty level was mistaken by the student affairs office, no matter how you look at it, and there’s no point in worrying about it. That’s not the kind of Thought Entity that appears in the lowest difficulty quests. I’ll file a report, and they should fix it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right!” Asahi exclaimed, clenching her fists.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This time, it just so happened that my summon was the right one for the quest! In other quests, Fujiwara-san would have been more effective.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara chuckled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re right. I’ll do better next time. If you’re going to be depressed, you should focus on doing better next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. Let’s just be happy that we got through this time. It’s really thanks to Asahi.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I patted Asahi’s shoulder, she looked embarrassed and giggled, “Ehehe!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It wasn’t me… It was because of my familiar.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t belittle yourself! You’ve done a great thing, be proud! Stick out your chest… Come on!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“L-like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi, who was told that, stretched out her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were huge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t want to say what it is, but it highlighted her bulge more than I imagined, and I just… love it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know what to say, but I think she could be a beautiful girl if she could work on her long bangs and unappealing clothes. It’s a shame because the succubus who copied Asahi’s appearance was just like that. Such a waste.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, that succubus seduced the b******s at the occult circle in your form?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ehh? No, that… that was…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi suddenly became uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara gave me a dismissive look, “ASHIYA-KUN!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, no. But I was just curious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-that’s not it,” Asahi said, sounding a little depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-t-there’s no way a girl like me could take a man’s heart, even if it’s a succubus.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m pretty sure that wasn’t the case, but it was too late now for Asahi to have any confidence in herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t try to follow up and just said, “Really? So, she seduced them in her original form. Come to think of it, I’ve never seen her original form.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, no, it’s not like that. It’s just…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Asahi glanced at Fujiwara but quickly averted her gaze awkwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was dumbfounded for a moment and shouted, “What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Hirano-san? By any chance, don’t tell me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, uh… You see… hehe?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hirano-san!? You’re kidding, right? You don’t even know what I look like!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara grabbed Asahi by the collar and violently shook her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! But, but, but you’re much more beautiful than me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case, why didn’t you copy a celebrity?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heee&mdash;! I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asahi shook her head as if it would rip off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I watched the two of them interact, I tried to imagine the succubus in Fujiwara’s form seducing a man… which made me chuckle. It didn’t suit her well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, well. Calm down. It’s what the succubus did, so don’t get angry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not what this is about!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no. Look, you were actually incredibly helpful, though it was the succubus who did most of the work. You’re the real MVP. I didn’t realize Fujiwara was such a big part of the story… Haha!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment I laughed, Fujiwara punched me in the face.</p>
