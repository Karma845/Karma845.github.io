<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>



<p>After all, Ayana and I came home right after that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the time of year when it gets dark soon after five o&#8217;clock, so as soon as I realized that there were no other eyes nearby, Ayana immediately huddled up with me, arm in arm.</p>



<p>I glanced at her and saw her cheeks flushed red and smiling happily at me, so I said nothing and simply accepted her warmth and warmth.</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt bad for Shu. I brought Ayana here like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. Shu-kun has Hatsune-san and Kotone-chan by his side.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, everyone in Shu&#8217;s family loves that guy very much, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s unlikely that he&#8217;ll ever feel lonely while he&#8217;s at home.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(I guess what that guy wants is Ayana more than anyone else)</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I said I felt bad for Shu.</p>



<p>But while it&#8217;s true that I felt bad for him, that feeling would soon disappear as soon as I thought back on what had happened earlier.</p>



<p>If I had not been there, if Ayana had been taken away, it would have been heartbreaking to think about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems that Ayana had caught on to my worst imaginings.</p>



<p>She looked at me with a soft expression on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;m a much more determined girl than you think, Towa-kun! I&#8217;ll beat that guy to a pulp!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She was so cute as she imitated the shush and shadow boxing.</p>



<p>Even if Ayana really was strong enough to fight off a man like that, I would still try to protect her …… I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll move to help any girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll make you a nice, delicious meal!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please do. Is there anything I can help you with?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please relax, Towa-kun. Leave it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Personally, this is the kind of situation that bothers me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not as good a cook as Ayana, so it&#8217;s probably better that I don&#8217;t help out so that I don&#8217;t have to bother her in any way.</p>



<p>Even so, I felt uncomfortable letting a girl who was a classmate of mine, and who was as close to me as a young girl can be, stand alone in the kitchen.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Today, let&#8217;s make …… fried white fish and a salad. I&#8217;ll also prepare some miso soup…&#8221;</p>



<p>This is my kitchen, and yet Ayana seems to know where everything is and what&#8217;s in it, and she works quickly and efficiently.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s almost as if there is another mother, but I guess that means Ayana has been to Towa&#8217;s house a fair number of times.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I can&#8217;t help her with this.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was thinking about another question that had arisen, and watching Ayana&#8217;s movements, I had a feeling that everything would go better if I left everything to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the cooking to you …… but let me know if there&#8217;s anything I can really do to help. I&#8217;ll go clean the bathtub or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. Fufu, Towa-kun is really very kind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s normal to try to help.&#8221;</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s normal to do that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I went from the kitchen to the bathroom to start cleaning, and for the record, I am in charge of this role even when my mother is around.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from expressing my gratitude for the delicious food she always cooks for me, but I&#8217;m not lying when I say that I want to make things as easy as possible for my mother.</p>



<p>If even this feeling is one of the feelings Towa has, I wonder how much Towa cares for my mom,……, and I&#8217;d like to ask him someday.</p>



<p>At that time, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have to apologize for being in this body.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Cleaning cleaning&#8221;</p>



<p>I shouted out to liven up my almost sentimental mood, and from there I finished cleaning the bath almost mindlessly.</p>



<p>When I returned to the living room, of course it still looked far from finished, but there was a slight aroma of deliciousness in the air.</p>



<p>&#8220;It smells so good. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, are you done cleaning?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m in the process of filling it with hot water.&#8221;</p>



<p>I can go back later to see when the hot water has pooled again.</p>



<p>I casually tried to stand in the kitchen with Ayana, but she said she was fine after all and wanted me to take my time.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu♪ Don&#8217;t make such a face. That one, right? I want Towa-kun to taste the food I put all my love into. So please put up with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I sat down on the couch to follow Ayana&#8217;s words, albeit reluctantly.thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you&#8217;re getting into.</p>



<p>I was watching Ayana cooking until the food was ready, and I was curious about what she had said earlier, so I called out to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayana…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…………….&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to ask her what kind of relationship Ayana and I have, but I swallowed my words.</p>



<p>Ayana kept tilting her head and looking at me, but I shook my head and said it was nothing, and she said okay and went back to cooking.</p>



<p>After a while, Ayana&#8217;s dish was ready.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Oh!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now eat up♪&#8221;</p>



<p>The menu was a bit mundane in the sense that it consisted of hot white rice, fried white fish, fried chicken, salad, and miso soup, but I could tell how much thought and care Ayana put into the dish.</p>



<p>Ayana looked at me with an expression of wanting me to eat it as soon as possible, and I clasped my hands together.</p>



<p>&#8220;Itadakimasu!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I grabbed a piece of fried chicken with chopsticks and put it in my mouth.</p>



<p>I was so happy to see Ayana smiling at me as I popped one dish after the next into my mouth.</p>



<p>Of course, I was grateful to Ayana as I savored each mouthful.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s really delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wish I could give more witty feedback, but I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have the vocabulary for that right now.</p>



<p>I was eating it while feeling that it was delicious, really delicious, when Ayana asked me a question like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which do you like better, Akemi-san&#8217;s cooking or mine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… eh?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Please be sure to answer one or the other. You can&#8217;t say they&#8217;re about the same, can you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>What a nasty question and I stopped moving.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that both Mom&#8217;s and Ayana&#8217;s cooking are so good that it&#8217;s impossible to compare which is better ……, but Ayana has squashed that option.</p>



<p>I let out a breath of relief as Ayana waited for my answer with a smiling smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Towa-kun. That was a little mean.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than just a little bit. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha, you&#8217;re so cute, Towa-kun♪&#8221;</p>



<p>I glared at Ayana resentfully because it really was more than a little bit of a stretch, but she remained smiling.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…Haa&#8221;</p>



<p>When I saw her smile, I couldn&#8217;t complain about Ayana, and I smiled at her, thinking she was cute too.</p>



<p>After dinner, I put my mother&#8217;s dinner in the refrigerator and washed the dishes with Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish these days could go on forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so. …… As for me, that means I get to eat the best food every day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I will always make it. Me, Towa-kun, and Akemi will always ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana murmured deeply, as if she really hoped so.</p>



<p>Is she talking about a world where not only Shu and his family, but also Ayana&#8217;s mother are absent?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I stared at Ayana, my phone alerted me to an incoming call from someone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops, I&#8217;ll be out in a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Is it Akemi?&#8221;</p>



<p>A call that maybe it would be even later than I thought? I wiped my hands and picked up my phone, and what was displayed there was Shu&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Shu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it Shu-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>I picked up the phone, wondering what the hell he wanted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Hello, good evening, Towa.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ou&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu on the other end of the phone sounded the same as usual, after all, he probably doesn&#8217;t care much about what happened after school anymore.</p>



<p>I was bothered when I remembered how weak Shu was at that time, but I waited for him to say something while trying not to show it in my attitude.</p>



<p>[Ayana hasn&#8217;t come home yet. On the way home from shopping, she met a friend who invited her to dinner, and her mother heard that she was going to have dinner together.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah.&#8221;</p>



<p>I see, so that&#8217;s what Ayana was telling them.</p>



<p>Ayana has not told her family that she is with me, and Shu doesn&#8217;t seem to know that either. …… Why did he call me?</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s not true, but …… you&#8217;re not with Ayana, right?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Unfortunately, no.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I replied before I could even think about it.</p>



<p>I could feel him exhaling a sigh of relief on the other end of the phone, but I, on the contrary, felt a little better.</p>



<p>I thought to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m such a jerk,&#8221; but it seemed that that was all Shu wanted to hear, and the call was immediately disconnected.</p>



<p>&#8220;Was it about me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so. He was relieved when I told him you weren&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana put her hand over her mouth to change the mood.</p>



<p>Having just finished washing all the dishes and wiping her hands, she slowly walked up to me and hugged me.</p>



<p>She buried her face in my chest, sniffed my scent, and looked up at me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You could have told him. Now I am being monopolized by Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..I couldn&#8217;t possibly say that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder how serious Ayana really is.</p>



<p>As I stared at Ayana looking up at me, it was as if someone was whispering in my brain that I should let the situation gradually drift away from me.</p>



<p>I gently put my hand on Ayana&#8217;s shoulder and pulled away, as if to ward off some kind of temptation.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Muu.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a small breath, pretending not to notice Ayana&#8217;s obvious discontent.</p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, when I was alone with Ayana, I felt someone whispering in my head &#8211; &#8220;Take Ayana away from him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I stole a glance at Ayana&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but since she appeals to me in this way, I&#8217;m inclined to like her.</p>



<p>(…… but I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t do that&#8212;&#8211;)</p>



<p>I think of her as a human being who lives in the world, exactly the same as me, who has a will. …… Of course, this is a matter of course.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Anyway, thank you for today, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, no, no. I&#8217;m happy to be with you, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those words made my heart happy again.</p>



<p>After that, I went outside with Ayana to drop her off.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little cold, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nighttime. I&#8217;m sure this will get progressively warmer as we get closer to summer.&#8221;</p>



<p>I almost reflexively clenched Ayana&#8217;s hand when she said it was cold.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you it was cold.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana stared at my clasped hands for a while, then squeezed them back tightly.</p>



<p>We walked down the dark street together and parted when I saw Ayana&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, Towa-kun. See you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. See you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>I almost reach for her as she turns away from me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I want to complain to my body about how much I want her, but I am sure it is obvious that I myself have been attracted to Ayana in this short period of time.</p>



<p>I will bring about a happy ending where Shu and Ayana get together. …… in spite of what I said with such enthusiasm…….</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard Ayana&#8217;s voice very close to me when she should have turned her back and started walking away.</p>



<p>Ayana was putting her own lips on mine, as if to make a kissing lip sound.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ehehe, it means that you thanked me for cooking dinner for you today♪&#8221;</p>



<p>She smiled mischievously and ran quickly home.</p>



<p>As I watched her back, I touched my own lips in shock and realized that the feeling I had just had was not a lie.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;My heart &#8230;..is beating so loud.&#8221;</p>



<p>I put my hand on my chest, and I could feel it clearly.</p>



<p>I was going home with such worries, wondering if I would be able to sleep properly today.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>I was kissed by Ayana, and it was strongly etched in my memory.</p>



<p>The next day, I was so nervous that I thought I might not be able to make eye contact with Ayana, but that was not the case at all.</p>



<p>As usual, I met up with Shu and Ayana and headed off to school, but when we met, Ayana put her finger on her lips and made a gesture as if to remind me of yesterday.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>&#8220;…… I&#8217;ve been too busy this week, no matter how you look at it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This week, I&#8217;ve been aware of being Towa for a little while now, but it wasn&#8217;t until this week that I started to think about facing this world in earnest.</p>



<p>Ayana was also getting closer to me, and at the same time I realized that there was something else hidden between me and Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;……It really is a bad habit to overthink things.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shaking my head, I once again put my worries out of my mind and looked at Aisaka, who was turning his face toward me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Gazing at the clean-cut, perfectly rounded head, one feels strangely relaxed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aisaka.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your head is a healing therapy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you saying so suddenly….&#8221;</p>



<p>I just reached out and touched Aisaka&#8217;s head with a pompom.</p>



<p>Although the round-cropped hair felt rough, it was quite pleasant, and I patted his head a little roughly, but Aisaka never got angry with me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a little concerned about the girl sitting over there looking at me with a twinkle in her eye …… Don&#8217;t imagine anything weird.</p>



<p>I wondered if that child who liked the combination of B and L, so I asked Aisaka about this.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Is there any girl you like, Aisaka?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Again, out of the blue!&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, this kind of love talk is okay once in a while.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t remember Aisaka being in the game, but since we are friends in this world, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to at least ask him about it.</p>



<p>I was convinced that Aisaka was definitely here because his face turned red as soon as he heard my question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t pester you. So, who is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>I smiled at Aisaka, who was giving me the cold shoulder, and ended the conversation by telling him to tell me about it sometime if he felt like it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had intended to end it there, but Aisaka said he would at least give me a hint, so I listened.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… we&#8217;re not classmates.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh. A junior?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…………….&#8221;</p>



<p>I see, she is a junior.</p>



<p>Aisaka&#8217;s shyness is quite refreshing, and it makes me want to ask for more information, but I&#8217;ll stop here.</p>



<p>Whether Aisaka is in love with one of the junior students or not, I don&#8217;t know, but I hope that love will come true, at the very least. [TL: HMMMM????]</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to the bathroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aiyo~&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I said to Aisaka and headed for the restroom.</p>



<p>I let out a small breath and finished in the bathroom, but then I saw Iori walking in front of me carrying a large cardboard box.</p>



<p>(Is it a package for the student council? She doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to see her feet…)</p>



<p>As usual, Iori&#8217;s atmosphere is cold.</p>



<p>Not being Shu, I don&#8217;t know what she thinks of me, but I just hope that being an acquaintance of Ayana&#8217;s makes a little bit of an impression on her.</p>



<p>&#8220;President.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? Ara, Yukishiro-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess she knows my name after all.</p>



<p>I was relieved to know that, and pointed my finger at the luggage Iori was carrying.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold that. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind at all. It&#8217;s true that I can&#8217;t see my feet, but it&#8217;s not that bad&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>As if to retrieve the flag as quickly as possible, Iori tripped over nothing and almost fell down, but I managed to support her and prevented her from falling.</p>



<p>Iori seemed to be embarrassed to have been seen, and her cheeks were blushing.</p>



<p>(As expected of one of the heroines, this person also has a very beautiful face.)</p>



<p>Iori has both a gallant and cold air about her, and in a way, it&#8217;s like a charm of Iori that she sometimes shows such a bashful expression.</p>



<p>However, looking at her clear expression, I can imagine her face melting with pleasure like in an association game, and that game is really deep.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I&#8217;m sorry, but can you do it for me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Roger that&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I took the baggage from Iori and started to walk away.</p>



<p>I was about to say something when Iori spoke up first.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about you from Shu and Ayana, and I wonder if that&#8217;s what they like about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what Shu and Ayana have told her, so I just nodded my head.</p>



<p>As for me, this is the first time I&#8217;ve talked to Iori, but from the looks of it, it doesn&#8217;t sound like the original Towa has talked to Iori either.</p>



<p>&#8220;President likes Shu a lot, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I guess so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is he like in general?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a casual question, but Iori answered.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The cold expression on her face has gone silent, and she is smiling and laughing beautifully, as if she is enjoying herself when she thinks about Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. I have the impression that he is a cute little boy. There are parts of him that are dependable, but there are more parts I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dependable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… what about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, who knows. But I met Shu-kun because of Otonashi-san, and he was a type of boy I had never met before, so it was a fresh experience for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was the reason Iori met Shu, which I already knew.</p>



<p>I know that Iori later develops a definite crush on Shu, which makes me think that Shu really does have a tremendous protagonist&#8217;s compensation.</p>



<p>&#8220;But Otonashi-san, who has been with him for a long time, is very determined. I&#8217;m still a long way off, but I think I&#8217;ll choose a college nearby and prepare myself for the long haul.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……College.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I wondered how that would help her choose a college, but as I recall, Iori was a nearby college student when the game started.</p>



<p>As can be seen from the fact that Iori is the president, she is very good at guiding people, and her grades are also quite good, so she should be able to aim for a higher university ……, but she went out of her way to choose a nearby university because Shu was by her side, and the result is what it is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not just pick a college for that?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was surprised to hear myself say that.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to say anything, but I just got caught up in the moment and asked her, staring at her.</p>



<p>I expected to be called a cocky junior and told that it was none of my business, but Iori just laughed.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Even if I really like it, there&#8217;s no need to limit my future possibilities… I understand that. Yes, I think I should seriously consider these things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a huff when I saw Iori say that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-10.png?fit=608%2C864&amp;ssl=1" /></noscript></figure></div>


<p>I am well aware that the world I am living in now is not a game itself, but reality.</p>



<p>Therefore, is it possible for me to change their future by interfering in this way, even if that is the path they should have taken?</p>



<p>I still haven&#8217;t found the answer to how to move forward, and there are still many things I don&#8217;t know, but just knowing that my voice can reach the girls …… is a big deal.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible that Iori doesn&#8217;t care about what I say, and it&#8217;s not necessarily true that I can&#8217;t modify what they say. …… But it was still great to have hope that I could do something about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem. I will leave you to it then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Afterwards, the baggage was safely delivered to the student council office.</p>



<p>I left Iori and returned to the classroom, where Aisaka called out to me that I was late, and just then the teacher in charge of the next class came in.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It might be rude to call it inertia, but time passed by as I took the class in such a feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sasaki, try to solve this problem.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..I can&#8217;t&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Then, Otonashi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana stood in front of the blackboard in place of Shu, who had been assigned by the teacher and was unable to solve the problem.</p>



<p>The teacher nodded in satisfaction as she neatly and smoothly wrote down the answers, which seemed to be correct.</p>



<p>&#8220;Great work, Otonashi, you can go back now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The two are really quite contrasting.</p>



<p>I clearly feel that there is such a difference between an undependable hero and a dependable heroine, which is common in the form of manga and novels, but in reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuwaa….&#8221;</p>



<p>Tired, I want to sleep, but I cannot neglect my studies for the future.</p>



<p>Even if this body is not mine, I still think it is important to take responsibility for it because I am Towa now.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>While I was taking classes like this, the time passed quickly and it was after school.</p>



<p>Today, too, Shu was taken away by Iori, who showed up just after school, but Ayana and I decided to go home right away because Shu told us at that time that it was okay to go home first today.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to stop somewhere today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I think I&#8217;ll just go straight home. Is there anything you want Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, anything is fine with me as long as I&#8217;m with you, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana hugged my arm to her chest.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;ve been swept along, haven&#8217;t I?)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s already obvious that something is going on between me and Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>And yet, while I would like to know it, I never take any definite action against Ayana.</p>



<p>This is probably because I feel comfortable with my current situation.</p>



<p>The moment I get close to Ayana is when there are no familiar faces around, including Shu, and I am happy to be spending time with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Hey, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>A gaze that made me think, &#8220;Please say anything,&#8221; shot through me.</p>



<p>Something whispers to me that I should just drift away with her once more, not caring about the surroundings, not thinking about anything difficult, but simply enjoying what is given to me.</p>



<p>At that moment, I was about to start thinking something like &#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s okay…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Eh?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong……Ah&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a sight that I happened to see.</p>



<p>We were walking on a sidewalk in the city, and there was a lot of car activity on the nearby streets.</p>



<p>In such a situation, a girl is waving her hand to the other side of the crosswalk.</p>



<p>(…..What&#8217;s going on?)</p>



<p>It is a scene that could be seen anywhere.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off the girl who was waving at the group of people, probably her friends.</p>



<p>It was a kind of chest-thumping, it seemed, that became the worst reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Watch out!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana and I shouted at about the same time.</p>



<p>The traffic light for pedestrians was still red, but the girl started walking toward the other side of the street.</p>



<p>I ran out and left Ayana behind the moment I knew what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, wait, Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard Ayana&#8217;s voice, but I did not stop.</p>



<p>The people around me started to notice something was wrong, but it was already too late, and a car drove toward the girl.</p>



<p>The sound of the horn sounded right after the car, the girl stopped moving as she was petrified.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Goddamn you!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>At this point, I was desperate to save the girl.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t care what happened to me, I didn&#8217;t even have time to think about it, I managed to get to the girl in time and hugged her small body.</p>



<p><span class="uppercase">[Towa-kun!!]</span></p>



<p>&#8220;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as I hugged the girl, a strange scene appeared in my mind.</p>



<p>I extended my arms to the stunned Shu, and then……..</p>



<p>&#8220;……!&#8221;</p>



<p>The only thing I could sense even with my eyes closed was the sound of the horn and emergency braking, and the commotion around me, but I didn&#8217;t have time to think about what was going on.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Are you all right?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The driver got out of the car in a panic and called out to us.</p>



<p>I thought he was going to yell at us, but the driver seemed to be a very kind person and seemed to understand the situation.</p>



<p>The scene was noisy for a while, but since everyone was safe, it didn&#8217;t turn into a big trouble and the crowd became sparse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Be careful from now on, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yes…… Thank you, Onii-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ou&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure if her parents were nearby, they would scold her for this, I thought with a wry smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad for now. Truly.&#8221;</p>



<p>I returned to Ayana, relieved that nothing had happened.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, I finally realized the gravity of the situation when I got here.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun……you&#8217;re okay, right!? You didn&#8217;t get hurt…right?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana hugged me with tears streaming down her face.</p>



<p>It was a dangerous situation, and I was very sorry for making Ayana worry. However, to be clear, Ayana&#8217;s condition was abnormal.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re alive… you&#8217;re alive. You&#8217;re not injured… I never want to experience something like that again… Towa-kun… Towa-kun, Towa-kun, Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>She hugged me and buried her face in my chest, mumbling to herself the whole time.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand there for long, so I put my hand on Ayana&#8217;s shoulder and asked her to leave for a while so we could start walking.</p>



<p>I had no plans to go anywhere, so I decided to head to my place right away to calm Ayana down. I was going to go to my house to calm Ayana down, because she was acting so strange.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>I was not able to get a glimpse of Ayana&#8217;s expression because she was still in my arms and not speaking.</p>



<p>Eventually, things continued as they were, and when we arrived at my house and entered my room, Ayana finally seemed to have calmed down enough to speak and talk.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to cry like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s completely fine. I made Ayana worried, that&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course I don&#8217;t think it was wrong to save that girl.</p>



<p>But I know that I was the cause of what happened to Ayana, and the worst part is that I didn&#8217;t think anything of it at the time.</p>



<p>(…… I think it&#8217;s admirable that I helped her. But I didn&#8217;t think about myself …… in front of a girl who grieved so much…)</p>



<p>If the car hadn&#8217;t stopped, there was a possibility that I would have shown the worst moment to Ayana, and above all, it would have deeply saddened my mother, who always thinks about me…</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I hugged Ayana, who was still shaking, she also put her arms around my back and hugged me, as if seeking reassurance.</p>



<p>(……Ah, it really calms me down when I&#8217;m like this.)</p>



<p>It feels like she&#8217;s the only one in this world, the only one, Ayana.</p>



<p>I was feeling such comfort, but at the same time, I was sure that I was getting a lot of information that was worrisome to me.</p>



<p>(The vision I saw at that time …… of Towa trying to save Shu. What was the meaning of the words that Ayana uttered?)</p>



<p>As I was quietly thinking about this, I heard a voice in my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I thought I might lose you, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>I listened to her voice as if she was trying to push away her bitterness.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When she looked up, her eyes were red and swollen, and they were so bloodshot that I could see how much I had saddened her.</p>



<p>Ayana continues to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;To me, Towa-kun is more important than anyone else. I&#8217;ve been living my life as I&#8217;ve been told all my life, and you took my hand and taught me many things. …… I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>She told me that she loved me, and my hands tightened as I held Ayana in my arms.</p>



<p>Even though it was Towa, not me, who expressed affection for her, my body moved of its own accord as if I had been told so.</p>



<p>It was as if my own soul and Towa&#8217;s soul overlapped, and I felt as if something was born inside me that made me think it had been Towa all along.</p>



<p>I continued to hug Ayana for a while, and she finally regained her normal composure and pulled away from me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Towa-kun, but it&#8217;s all right now. &#8220;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I see. I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reflexively, I reached out and stroked Ayana&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>The feel of her silky black hair feels so good, and it makes me want to stay like this forever.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… kind of reminds me of the old days when you do this&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The old days?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. That …… was a totally different situation then than it is now, but it reminded me of my time with Towa-kun, who found me crying and called out to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana then began to talk.</p>



<p>As if reminiscing, Ayana told me about the time when Towa and Ayana first met, a time that was never mentioned in the game and that no one ever knew about.</p>
