<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>(…… where am I?)</p>



<p>I muttered to myself as I looked around at the scenery around me.</p>



<p>There are rare moments when I realize that I am dreaming of the scenery I am seeing, but I recognized this moment intuitively.</p>



<p>The room, which was white and had a lived-in feel to it, seemed to be a room in a hospital.</p>



<p>(…What? Is this a dream?)</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to stay still, so I tried to get out of bed, but then I realized that my body was in a state where I could not move.</p>



<p>My arms were bandaged and my legs were hung so that they were immobilized. It felt as if my waist was also stiffened.</p>



<p>The dream was so realistic that I began to wonder if it was really a dream.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The external sensations in my body, of course, but also the reality of the experience made me feel as if I had experienced it myself.</p>



<p>(Aaaah, test…I can&#8217;t speak at all!)</p>



<p>Since I cannot move my mouth, I cannot speak, so I can only speak from my mind like this.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t move my body and I can&#8217;t talk,…… but if I am dreaming, there must be a lot of dreams where I fly in the sky, use swords and magic, and beat my enemies to a pulp, but that&#8217;s not very thoughtful.</p>



<p>The door to the hospital room opened just as I was thinking about what I would do if I didn&#8217;t wake up.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Ah Towa!!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Shu who entered.</p>



<p>He looked a little younger than he does now, but I couldn&#8217;t say anything, so I had to wait for him to say something.</p>



<p>Seeing me on the bed, Shu&#8217;s expression gradually became distorted and he began to cry, tears streaming down his face and snot dripping down his nose.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;m sorry …… I&#8217;m sorry Towa! I……I was looking the other way, and Towa was!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was just looking on and didn&#8217;t understand why Shu was crying.</p>



<p>But for some reason, my heart is boiling hot with anger, and I feel that this anger is probably directed at Shu.</p>



<p>Of course, I didn&#8217;t know anything about this anger,……, but somehow it seemed to me that there was nothing wrong with having this anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Shu.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mouth moved of its own accord.</p>



<p>I was surprised at myself for suddenly speaking up, but I just told Shu the words that came out from inside me.</p>



<p>&#8220;That means this kind of thing can happen. Don&#8217;t worry too much, Shu, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;re okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>[….. why …… Why are you crying so much? I&#8217;m the one who wants to cry!?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Apart from the words I uttered, my voice overlapped with his, as if in a double voice.</p>



<p>On the surface, I was concerned not to worry Shu, and yet secretly, my rage against him was in control.</p>



<p>This was definitely the anger held by Towa, which became one as if it assimilated with me.</p>



<p>(…… Aah, it&#8217;s this!)</p>



<p>Then I began to remember.</p>



<p>I remembered why I was on the hospital bed, why my body was in such a mess, and why I was so angry at Shu.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s simple &#8212;- I had an accident.</p>



<p>I was in a daze and ran out into the road, and I took his place in the accident.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is terrible. I can&#8217;t move my body properly. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;m embarrassed to have the nurses take care of me.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>[Why …… Why this time of year! The tournament is around the corner …… I worked so hard to make my mom happy!!!]</p>



<p>Tournaments……Yes, there&#8217;s a soccer tournament coming up soon.</p>



<p>The whole club worked hard, practiced hard, and a lot of people cheered us on, and I&#8217;ve been trying my best to live up to that support!</p>



<p>My mom even took time off work to come cheer me on! Ayana said she would definitely come to support me too!!!!</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s disgusting… my emotions are mixed up…)</p>



<p>It was weird because I felt like me and Towa&#8217;s emotions were getting mixed up in a jumbled mess.</p>



<p>When I was unable to even utter that weak sound, and was still facing the two mixed emotions, a person who seemed to be the doctor entered the hospital room.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>The doctor looked as if he was having difficulty saying it, but began to speak slowly, as if he was firmly reminding me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yukishiro-kun, let me be frank with you. The fractures in your limbs are serious, but above all, your back is far worse. It may be difficult for you to play soccer in the next tournament, and perhaps even to exercise for a year or so.&#8221;</p>



<p>The doctor&#8217;s words easily cut into my heart.</p>



<p>I was shocked as if I had been stabbed through the chest with a knife,……, but in order to keep my composure, I opened my mouth with a laugh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of….course. It&#8217;s impossible for me in this state. …… hahaha, it can&#8217;t be helped&#8221;</p>



<p>[……]</p>



<p>I no longer hear the voice that is controlled by rage.</p>



<p>My mouth moves without my permission, words are spewed out without my permission, and tears do not flow even though my heart is a mess and I can&#8217;t do anything about it.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is due to Towa&#8217;s own strength or because he is so shocked that he cannot accept the reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll leave you.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…. yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The teacher then went to the door and was replaced by Ayana and Osamu&#8217;s mother, Hatsune-san, who came in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is everything okay ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s eyes were bright red as she approached me at once and held my hand.</p>



<p>Seeing her like that made me cry so much, and I felt so sorry for having caused her unimaginable worry.</p>



<p>&#8220;I made you worry ……, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course you did! When I saw Towa-kun who collapsed and stopped moving, I …… uaaaahhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s head, which had started to cry, was gently stroked with the one hand that was moving.</p>



<p>It was a little inappropriate, but I was happy to see her cry like this, and I tried to smile because I didn&#8217;t want Ayana to cry any more.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But then I heard Hatsune&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu, stay outside with Ayana. I need to talk to him.&#8221;</p>



<p>At Hatsune&#8217;s words, Shu nodded his head and went outside, but Ayana didn&#8217;t move from her spot, as if she would never leave me.</p>



<p>Although she gave me a troubled look in response to Ayana, Hatsune-san immediately turned her reproachful eyes on me.</p>



<p>I know that Shu&#8217;s family, including Hatsune-san, and Ayana&#8217;s mother don&#8217;t think well of me because of my past history of taking Ayana around. …… So what will she say to me?</p>



<p>&#8220;What would you have done if either Shu or Ayana-chan had been injured? It&#8217;s a good thing it was only you who got hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>For a moment, I didn&#8217;t understand what she had said to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana seemed to be in the same boat, raising her face from its prone position with a start and looking at Hatsune-san as if she were looking at something unbelievable.</p>



<p>I was stunned, but Hatsune continued to speak to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, I don&#8217;t need you. Shu has Ayana, and Ayana has Shu. You are a foreigner, and you have come in, so you must have been punished.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hatsune-san! What on earth are you saying!?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I listened to Ayana&#8217;s loud voice, I too wondered what in the world she was talking about.</p>



<p>I was only there with them as their friend,…… what in the world did I do?</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Oh, I see. I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did I say anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I see, their world is complete on its own.</p>



<p>The world in which Shu and Ayana are united, that is the world these people want, and they will not tolerate any other …… ah kusu, for some reason that makes me laugh.</p>



<p>It would be a nearly impossible idea, at least in the world I lived in, but I guess it&#8217;s because of this world that there can be people with such broken personalities.</p>



<p>(…… I wonder what Towa thought about this.)</p>



<p>Unlike me, who can look at this situation objectively to some extent, even though I am linked to Towa&#8217;s emotions, I wonder how Towa felt when he received these words.</p>



<p>Did he resent it or simply give up?</p>



<p>After that, Hatsune-san seemed to have finished what she wanted to say and left the hospital room, leaving an air of inexpressibility between Ayana and me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d hate me that much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun,…….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>While I don&#8217;t think she needed to say so much, I understand the idea that Towa is like a pest that is destroying their box garden,…… although I never want to understand, I understand the idea that they have.</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>I was downcast, but now my heart was supported by Ayana, who was right there by my side.</p>



<p>When I reached out to Ayana, she immediately wrapped her hands around me, and I was able to feel the warmth of her arms.</p>



<p>With this sense of security in my heart, I asked Ayana for a favor.</p>



<p>This is something I would never have said under normal circumstances, but now is the time to say it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… can I have a hug? Is it okay if I cry?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……..I&#8217;m fine with it.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>I rested my face on Ayana&#8217;s chest.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The soft touch on my cheeks and the good scent make me feel at ease. …… Ayana&#8217;s warmth envelopes me as if to heal the wounds I had received in my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Kusu…… Kusu……!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>And I cried.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t cry any more as I was held in Ayana&#8217;s arms, and she let me cry profusely, as if to say that I had let all my tears out.</p>



<p>The whole time I was crying out loud, Ayana never let go of me.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what Ayana looked like, but even so, I was truly saved by her presence.</p>



<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>After a while, I finally calmed down and tried to move away from Ayana, but she wouldn&#8217;t let me go.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I called her name and heard the coldest voice I had ever heard.</p>



<p>This is ridiculous. Why should Towa-kun have to go through this? Why do you have to be talked down to like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s words did not stop and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though Towa-kun is the one suffering the most… I wish I could take your place if I could. Why did she say such terrible thing about you&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;…………….&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana seems to have felt my indignation too.</p>



<p>I believe it is the utmost kindness one can have for others, to be able to grieve for others.</p>



<p>I would be just as angry at Ayana if something happened to her. …… However, it seems that Ayana&#8217;s anger has a slightly different meaning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are those people …… huh? Are those people? Are those…… people like us? No, those things are not people. …… those things are …… those people are…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana kept mumbling in a voice that had lost its intonation.</p>



<p>I sensed a strange atmosphere from Ayana, and I moved away from her as if to put a little strength into my body.</p>



<p>Ayana was staring at me with her eyes rolled back, perhaps in a slight shock, and the atmosphere she had been in earlier was gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;……fuuu&#8221;</p>



<p>Although I missed the feeling of Ayana&#8217;s embrace, I lay down on the bed with my back to her, exhausted even though it was only a dream.</p>



<p>Ayana was very attentive to me as she laid me down on the bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay a little longer. I&#8217;m sure Mimi will be here in a little while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. …… Mom is supposed to be at work.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa-kun was in an accident, so it&#8217;s only natural that she would come.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….Right&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder if my mom will cry too,……I&#8217;m sure she will.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll have to comfort my mom somehow then, and it looks like I&#8217;ll have to do my best to do that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I come every day to visit you. I don&#8217;t want you to feel lonely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that, but I don&#8217;t want you to come every day. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No can do. I&#8217;ll definitely come every day.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s firm determination loosened my cheeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I ask you for a favor, then? I want to talk to Ayana every day too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>She finally smiled at me.</p>



<p>The sad look on her face was gone, and the smile she had always shown me came back to life.</p>



<p>(……I remember this dream? Will I forget it when I wake up?)</p>



<p>I was worried about whether I would forget this dream, which definitely got to the heart of Towa, but somehow I felt it would be all right.</p>



<p>I would never forget this, I had no proof, but I was sure of it.</p>



<p>I had a dream in which I learned about Towa&#8217;s hidden past, and at the same time, it was a painful dream that tore my heart out of my body.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… Ayana, I will…&#8221;</p>



<p>I vowed more and more strongly to protect her …… and to protect her heart.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>I woke up when I felt a light shine on my eyes.</p>



<p>I stared at the ceiling with my fuzzy head for a while, but soon I turned my attention to my hands and feet, which should be moving properly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember …… everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>I clearly remembered everything I had seen in my dream.</p>



<p>I remember the accident I caused by protecting him, the tournament I had to give up because of it, and the heartbreaking words she said to me. I knew things that were never mentioned in the game.</p>



<p>Perhaps it is because of what Ayana told me about her past, or perhaps it is because of my current dream, that I feel as if my heart has become one with Towa&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange ……, but I think it&#8217;s better this way now.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The reason is that I feel that the desire to live as Towa Yukishiro, who exists in this world, has become even stronger, while my consciousness as me remains.</p>



<p>Although my hatred for Shu and his family certainly overflows as I get closer to Towa himself, it&#8217;s not so much that I can&#8217;t stand it because I still have a sense of who I am.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Rather, it doesn&#8217;t seem like Towa holds that much resentment,&#8221;</p>



<p>That accident must have certainly been a painful experience for Towa. But I also know that he was certainly happy that Shu was safe.</p>



<p>In the end, Towa remained kind and continued to wander aimlessly.</p>



<p>I was lost too, I couldn&#8217;t accept the fact that I was reborn in this world, and I didn&#8217;t really look at Ayana and the others.</p>



<p>A dream is a dream, reality is reality…… I slept with Ayana…….&#8221;</p>



<p>I vividly recalled yesterday.</p>



<p>After Ayana told me about her past, I wanted her tremendously and ended up getting physical with her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I lay on my body with Ayana, I remembered my first experience with her, and this also revealed that Towa had already had a relationship with Ayana after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana&#8217;s body was so soft. And …… she was really cute and adorable.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a sense, it&#8217;s only possible during puberty to remember and bask in the afterglow of an affair.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t even nighttime yet, and Ayana and I continued to have s*x until just before my mother came home, and then we had dinner with her and I dropped her off.</p>



<p>Ayana looked so sad when we parted that it was hard for me to let go of her hand that was clutched in mine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heave-ho&#8221;</p>



<p>I stood up and peeked into the mirror.</p>



<p>I am still in doubt about whether it is my face or not, but I also think that my face is quite cute when I wake up from sleep.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Hey Towa, did you feel this way too? Is that why you took Ayana away from him like that?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that I&#8217;ve come this far to take away from him.</p>



<p>I have changed my mind about Ayana and how I want to be with her, and I want to stay by her side.</p>



<p>But of course, there are new things that are bothering me.</p>



<p>[I …… can&#8217;t live without Towa-kun. If Towa-kun is not here, I …… cannot live.]</p>



<p>These are the words she uttered in my arms after the act.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s instability was highlighted by the fact that she would surely break down when I was no longer around.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but understand that I was a support and important presence for Ayana, but honestly, her state at that time was abnormal.</p>



<p>Maybe that&#8217;s the meaning she mentioned before with “master”, maybe that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s putting so much weight in her mind on Towa that she would say that.</p>



<p>[I will take it all away from you.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, I was hit by a strong headache and fell to my knees.</p>



<p>But just like any other day, the headache was fleeting and I was able to get up quickly.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… was that Ayana&#8217;s voice I just heard?&#8221;</p>



<p>The voice that I heard earlier, it certainly sounded like Ayana&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>I laughed at Ayana&#8217;s voice, which was so low and cold that it even sounded ruthless, as if she was cutting off everything and everyone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana wouldn&#8217;t make a sound like that. I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking.&#8221;</p>



<p>I headed for my mother, who was probably making breakfast, thinking that Ayana would never do that.</p>



<p>When I headed to the living room, breakfast had just been prepared, and my eyes met Mom&#8217;s as she was folding her apron.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Good morning, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>After exchanging greetings with Mom, I sat down on a chair and started to eat breakfast.</p>



<p>It is not that elaborate because it is breakfast, but I am happy at this moment when I can really taste the deliciousness because I can see that my mother&#8217;s love has been put into whatever it is.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy because you eat it so deliciously.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s really delicious. Thank you for everything, Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I told her this, she laughed and looked really happy.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, when I had just become Towa, I was in a bit of a panic, but now it&#8217;s like this.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel uncomfortable talking about anything anymore, and I am aware that everything is normal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;……It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was cooling my hot miso soup, I noticed my mother staring at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I really think Towa is looking better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s doing well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re feeling better.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t quite understand the meaning of those words, but my mother continued speaking like this.</p>



<p>After the accident, Towa was down for a while, you know? Towa acted quite bravely in front of me, but it was pretty obvious.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Heh, really?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A quick answer?&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt strange when I saw my mother laughing and trembling her shoulders.</p>



<p>Knowing what words to say, what things to communicate, it naturally goes out in words.</p>



<p>&#8220;But even though you are like that, thanks to you, Ayana started coming to our house more often and became brighter. I really appreciate that about her. Yesterday, she showed us a lot, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Uuh, that&#8217;s….&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana gave me a few &#8220;ahhh&#8217;s&#8221; at dinner. My mother was smiling as she watched, but I was embarrassed, of course.</p>



<p>A man&#8217;s stature in such a situation is very small, and I felt it keenly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for the food&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for the food&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to go back to my room to get ready for school when my mother suddenly called out to me.</p>



<p>Mom, with an ever-serious expression on her face as she looked back at me, said something like this to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a really good girl, that Ayana. She&#8217;s such a good kid that it&#8217;s hard to believe she&#8217;s still in high school. But somehow, just somehow, it seems like she&#8217;s carrying something inside her. So, Towa, please keep a close eye on her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I know. It&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>I nodded my head strongly, saying that I intended to do so even if she hadn&#8217;t told me.</p>



<p>She nodded in satisfaction at my response and was about to wash the dishes again when she muttered something that I couldn&#8217;t help but ask back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana told me about what happened at the hospital a long time ago. So I once unintentionally thought about taking a baseball bat and hitting her in the face~!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t do it, did you?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;m well aware that Mom has affection for her son, but I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d go that far. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m worried&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course not. I just heard that when I asked Ayana to bridge the gap without telling you, she said something stupid to my son. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tighten her up that old hag~♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What did you say?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry～♪ Well, it was just the last vestiges of my Yankee days that came out. &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>What do you mean by &#8220;Yankee days&#8221;? Mom used to be a Yankee?</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, when I was searching the house to assess the situation, I came across a photo of my mother that made me think she was quite flashy back in the day…Don&#8217;t tell me that the woman who sometimes comes to visit my mother is my mother&#8217;s sister?</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew you were powerful, Mom. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I will ask for more details if there is any opportunity to do so at some point.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Then I got ready and left the house, but I have a feeling that the way I spend my time will not change that much once I reconnect with Ayana.</p>



<p>Still,…… I still think I&#8217;ll move on as I see fit.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still kind of stuck with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The past that was hidden from Towa, the feelings that Ayana had hidden, and the relationship that was uncovered,……, I understand what has happened so far, but I still have a strange feeling that something is stuck in my throat.</p>



<p>[……Nasty. Ayana is in trouble.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I suddenly thought I heard someone&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>It was a voice that evoked a sense of nostalgia, but I never heard it again.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think I can just dismiss it as my imagination, after coming this far.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Every little thing I do is connected to this world.</p>



<p>And above all, there is a strong possibility that it is something that awakens memories that have been covered up in me. …… So I think it is important to pay attention to it as much as possible.</p>



<p>When I headed to the usual meeting place, they were already there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Good morning, Shu. Ayana too.</p>



<p>I was so happy to see Ayana, even after what happened yesterday, she was just as usual.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s the same for me, but still, with the new change of heart, I&#8217;m sure something will change drastically.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly why I was getting the feeling that the relationship between the three of us was about to change drastically.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Corner him….. Corner him…..</p>



<p>Make him suffer…… Make him suffer….</p>



<p>And finally, take away the most precious thing. …… Then there will be nothing but despair, no?</p>



<p>I will never forget the words that you guys uttered.</p>



<p>I will never forget the tears he shed.</p>



<p>So I will [rob you of everything].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;….What is this?&#8221;</p>



<p>The man who tried to play the fan disc he received immediately tilted his head and muttered to himself.</p>



<p>The moment he installed the game and started it up, the above text appeared and disappeared like the opening movie.</p>



<p>Now it was already on the title screen, a slightly lonely but fantastic song was playing, and Ayana was shown wearing a black hood.</p>



<p>The beginning is totally different from the last one.</p>



<p>In the previous work, the title was read out by a random heroine to the boisterous music, but that voice was not recorded this time.</p>



<p>The man composed himself and selected &#8220;From the Beginning&#8221; to start the game.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He played the contents of the fan disc all the way through without taking a break.</p>



<p>Then, staring at the ending screen, he let out a gasp, leaned back deeply against the back of his chair, and opened his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Nasty. Ayana is in trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the word I finally managed to squeeze out.</p>



<p>It was a work that had received many high ratings on the Internet, and was as complicated as the fact that it was originally a fan disc of a cuckold game, which made him reluctant to buy it.</p>



<p>However, after actually playing the game, he thought about it, which was all contained in the words that the man had just uttered.</p>



<p>&#8220;This kind of erotic game is not common. Who could have predicted such a thing?&#8221;</p>



<p>The fan disc of &#8221; I was robbed of everything &#8221; &#8212; it was a story centered on Ayana, who was not depicted in the main story, and it was a story of revenge against those who despaired of Towa, whom she loved so much.</p>



<p>The men could not have been more surprised to learn that Ayana was involved in all the cases of his Senpai, junior, her younger sister and her mother, who were portrayed as cuckold heroines, and that her meeting with Shu and her subsequent guidance in building a relationship with him were carefully explained.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Although it was shocking to see Ayana driven by hatred to a degree that could never be imagined from the main story, she was always smiling and very cute and endearing in front of Towa.</p>



<p>[I love you, Towa-kun. …… I love you.]</p>



<p>In addition to flirting behind Shu&#8217;s back, there were also numerous intense scenes, and the number of H scenes, which had only occurred once in the main series, had increased to the point where it seemed like a lie.</p>



<p>Of course, Ayana&#8217;s appearance was only in front of Towa, and the sight of her enjoying happiness and pleasure in a disorderly manner was truly a privilege reserved only for Towa.</p>



<p>&#8220;For Ayana, Towa was that special. …… I see, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s pure love.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man finally understood what it meant that it was not a cuckold but pure love, that was written in the impression.</p>



<p>The men chuckled at Ayana&#8217;s hidden nature, or rather, since the fan disc is mainly from Ayana&#8217;s point of view, it is possible to understand what is on her mind.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s true feelings were revealed, and she was really foul-mouthed about things she didn&#8217;t like, though less frequently.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, this scene…..&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s voice echoed as soon as the man began to replay the scene that bothered her.</p>



<p>[You gotta be kidding me, that b*tch! You interrupted me and Towa&#8217;s time!]</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s voice is heard in the scene.</p>



<p>Since the contents of the fan disc are complementary to the main story, the linking of all kinds of scenes also thrilled and excited the men.</p>



<p>The bad-mouth moment is when Ayana goes home with Towa and runs into Kotone by chance, and after they say a few things to each other.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s use of honorifics was originally a barrier to keep her distance from Shu and the rest of his family, but playing the role of her polite self has a way of repressing that.</p>



<p>The story of how Ayana came to use honorifics and the release of her repressed feelings by becoming a badass with a bad mouth was also an interesting setup that left a strong impression on the audience.</p>



<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that men have liked Ayana since the main story, but they like her even more now that they have played the fan disc.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Oh, I never imagined this kind of thing.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The man dove into the Internet to write down his impressions of the fan disc and found the developer&#8217;s comments on the official website.</p>



<p>Normally, he would not be interested in such things, but since they were the creators of the game, he was curious and went to the page, and was astonished.</p>



<p>[I think people who played the game probably felt the hate for Shu and his family. There were a few scenes that I honestly thought were too much, but when I tried to express Ayana&#8217;s madness in detail, it ended up that way. The staff regretted that they felt sorry for Senpai and the Junior. Now, have you played the second round of the game? The ending of the second lap changes the direction a little.]</p>



<p>This was the developer&#8217;s comment.</p>



<p>&#8220;What?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The comment fell on deaf ears to the man.</p>



<p>Leaving the page behind, the man started up the game again and took advantage of the skip to get to the ending at once.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m at the end, and it&#8217;s the same ……, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>There is no particular change in the scene where the credit is being played, and the picture of Towa and Ayana holding hands and walking toward the light is also unchanged.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the picture of these two happy people began to change.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s figure disappeared and all that was left was Towa, and then Towa&#8217;s figure also disappeared. These words appeared on the screen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana is in my arms. She is smiling all the time. Seeing her smile makes me happy too. But …… is this really the right thing to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>The words disappeared and then reappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;She acted out of love for me. But in a real sense, it was me who broke her heart because I couldn&#8217;t …… notice anything. Maybe it was also …… myself who took that kind girl away from me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The game ended with those words as the real ending.</p>



<p>The man was stunned for a moment, but then he came to himself and turned his gaze back to the developer&#8217;s comments section again.</p>



<p>[In fact, Towa doesn&#8217;t know what Ayana did in the main story. So this is a feature that the staff added just for the fun of it, in case he would realize it later. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that Ayana was already broken and couldn&#8217;t stop herself from doing what she did. This is the end of this game, but …… yes I guess so. If there had been someone with a more special perspective, not Towa or Ayana in the game, I think it would have been a much happier ending for both of them. Revenge gives you a sense of accomplishment for a moment, but all that comes after is a feeling of emptiness. Well, no matter how it turns out, it will be a bitter ending for Shu (Lol).]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The developer&#8217;s comment concluded.</p>



<p>&#8220;A third party with a special point of view……huh&#8221;</p>



<p>The man muttered quietly and thought about it.</p>



<p>The end of the game is ostensibly a happy ending for Towa and Ayana, but at the root of it all, nothing is resolved and Ayana is left broken.</p>



<p>The fan disc talks not only about Ayana, but also about Towa, who truly loved Ayana with all his heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;……. I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t forgive her. If Towa knew about Ayana…&#8221;</p>



<p>The man nodded his head and nodded that he would surely not allow it.</p>



<p>The man&#8217;s impression of Towa had changed dramatically, he was just a kind-hearted boy who had feelings for Ayana.</p>



<p>But Towa didn&#8217;t realize until the end that Ayana had always been trapped in her past and hatred for him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would have been nice if there had been some kind of trigger ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, if there had been a chance, Towa and Ayana would have been able to walk towards happiness in the true sense of the word.</p>



<p>If there was an event that accepted the environment surrounding Towa and then overcome the sadness and hatred as Towa pulled away from Ayana&#8217;s hand, then surely there would have been…….</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, I can&#8217;t help thinking this way&#8221;</p>



<p>This game is now complete, so there is no point in any kind of imagination.</p>



<p>Still, because of their emotional involvement with the characters, the men dreamed of such a world that could possibly have come true.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>The man looked into the computer screen as if he had noticed something, but nothing in particular.</p>



<p>Tilting his head in a funny way, the man left the room, but shortly thereafter, the computer screen glowed suspiciously.</p>
