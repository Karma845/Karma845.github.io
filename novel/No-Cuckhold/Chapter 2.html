<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Shu is on a roll, I turned my attention to his mutterings.</p>



<p>&#8220;This Sasaki guy has been on a roll lately, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? Why is that guy close to Honjo Senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go get him, shall we?&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was three relatively conspicuous looking guys.</p>



<p>They talked about it, but he was also taken away by Iori, who appeared as soon as the end of the day&#8217;s assembly was over.</p>



<p>Although Shu was taken without question, Shu did not look uncomfortable because the other party was Iori.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Well, this is another firestorm.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I was even impressed that Iori simply showed up like a storm and took Shu away, but apparently the people around him didn&#8217;t take it that way.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a little cocky for someone who&#8217;s not very smart.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard he is close with a cute junior from last year, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s teach him some manners.&#8221;</p>



<p>I just referred to them as the three attention-grabbing individuals, but their appearance and atmosphere really do make them seem like typical good-looking guys with a high sense of pride. They&#8217;re so envious of how someone as seemingly average as Shu can be so close with someone like Iori, who&#8217;s such a beauty.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Haa.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a small sigh as I looked at them.</p>



<p>Regardless of who may have feelings for whom, it&#8217;s not something others should interfere with. They should know that, but their pride is probably getting in the way and causing the situation to escalate.</p>



<p>As Shu&#8217;s childhood friend and closest confidant, I couldn&#8217;t just stand by and watch.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Come on, don&#8217;t get so worked up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Yukishiro&#8221;</p>



<p>I approached the group and put my hand on the shoulder of the boy with his back turned to me. He turned around, surprised, and I think his name was Somiya. He looked at me with a little bit of unease and looked away awkwardly.</p>



<p>Maybe he lost his nerve because I&#8217;m so close with Shu. I don&#8217;t mean to take advantage of this situation, but since I&#8217;ve acted, I need to make sure to drive my point home.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of who may have feelings for whom, that&#8217;s not something for others to talk about. You should know that stirring up trouble or taking action just because you&#8217;re frustrated won&#8217;t lead to anything good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Somiya and the others must have understood this.</p>



<p>Even if they&#8217;re feeling jealous of Shu&#8217;s close relationship with the beautiful girls, that won&#8217;t do them any good. Our high school is a decent school with a good reputation, so using violence or anything like that will reflect poorly on our internal evaluations.</p>



<p>&#8220;But still&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is he&#8230;.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The noisy atmosphere of a few minutes ago has subsided, but it seems that the jealousy toward Shu has not disappeared yet.</p>



<p>To be honest, I was afraid that I might be called annoying and beaten up when I spoke to them, but when I thought about it, it was no mistake that Towa was the center of the class, along with Ayana.</p>



<p>Their excellent looks attracted both men and women alike, and their attempts to protect their childhood friend Shu was well received by their classmates.</p>



<p>All of this has been mentioned to some extent in the game, but when I think about it objectively, I realize once again that Towa is a character without any ostensible flaws.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever hit anyone out of jealousy. It won&#8217;t do you any good, and above all, don&#8217;t lower your self-worth with such nonsense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to tell them that humiliating or hurting someone can also damage your reputation, which is why I told them not to do it.</p>



<p>One more push and I could make them give up on Shu,…… and just as I was thinking that, I heard another voice behind me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Speaking badly of someone will never lead to good results. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been in this class, but everyone, including myself, thinks of you as important classmates.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Ayana who approached us.</p>



<p>Ayana smiled at me and then turned her attention to Somiya and the others.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-kun is …… flattering, but he&#8217;s never been good at interacting with people. But for me and Towa, he is a childhood friend who has been with us for a long time. I naturally want to protect him, and I don&#8217;t want you to make a choice that you will regret.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s words were very polite, but she also thought carefully about the other party, so Somiya and the others listened attentively.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because not only me but also Ayana gently told him off, but already Somiya and the others showed no hostility toward Shu, and on the contrary, they were even talking about changing their attitude toward him.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it looks like there&#8217;s nothing to worry about now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</p>



<p>With just me, I wasn&#8217;t sure if they would have listened to me so honestly, and I have Ayana to thank for that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about it, but I&#8217;m glad that Honjo-senpai cares about Shu-kun. It&#8217;s not just us. It means that there are other people who see the good in Shu-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana closed with these words.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s soft smile at that time was quite destructive, and Somiya and the others, who were looking at Ayana from the front, turned red and looked down at once.</p>



<p>Ayana was a frightening girl who could smile in such a way to steal the hearts of others in an instant, even though she probably had no intention to do so.</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like we&#8217;ve come to a good agreement, Somiya and the others! How about going to karaoke with me and my friends after school? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll feel better if you sing as much as you can!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s friends nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>The air was relaxed, and I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu. Seriously, Ayana did a great job.&#8221;</p>



<p>No, no, not at all …… haha.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana also seems to be tired enough to let out a sigh.</p>



<p>However, I really think it was good that everything turned out alright… But I realized that the protagonist&#8217;s personality, in a sense, makes it easy for him to create enemies.</p>



<p>Still, after seeing Ayana in such a state, I think the number of people who will try to give Shu a hard time will decrease.</p>



<p>(A happy ending for Shu is happiness that goes beyond the ending of the game. …… There are many things to think about with the other heroines, but for now, just think about Shu and Ayana.)</p>



<p>I still have no idea how I ended up as Towa and I have no idea why.</p>



<p>But because of the cuckold game world I played, I will reach out to an unseen, non-existent happy ending!</p>



<p>After that, Ayana and I waited for Shu to possibly come back, but there was no sign of his return.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is not back&#8221;</p>



<p>Right. I thought he&#8217;d be back soon, but I guess I was naive.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>Basically, the end-of-school assembly at our high school ends around 3:30, but the clock was about to strike 5:00.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>?&#8221; ……, Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>The classroom was already quiet, with only Ayana and I in the room.</p>



<p>I was under the illusion for a moment that Ayana in front of me was really her when she called me and I looked at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the two of us ……, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah….&#8221;</p>



<p>She stood in front of me in a chair, but she sat on my lap as if she were in close contact with my body.</p>



<p>She sits with her legs wide open in a way that does not suit her neat and clean appearance.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;O-oi….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was even closer to me, and the scent that wafted through the air smelled good, not to mention the softness that was directly transmitted to my body.</p>



<p>I was so stunned by the suddenness of it all that I couldn&#8217;t say anything, just taking in the sensations Ayana was giving me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done this. I can smell your scent, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>

<p>What the hell….?</p>



<p>I felt terribly lightheaded when I was doing this with Ayana.</p>



<p>It may be because I have felt the rich sexuality that I have not seen from Ayana in her usual life, and I have felt it in this one as well.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu♪&#8221;</p>



<p>She laughed bewitchingly, buried her face in my neck, and continued to use her tongue to lick me.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s moving her hips around, which makes me feel even weirder ……, but this may have confirmed it.</p>



<p>The reason for the discomfort I felt in the morning and afternoon is probably that Towa and Ayana are having some sort of relationship at this stage of the story, which has not even begun.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>When we stare at each other, everything seems to be unimportant.</p>



<p>Moreover, the girl in front of me looks incredibly attractive, and perhaps my spirit is being pulled by my body to be swept away.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The chime that brought me back to my senses sounded just as Ayana&#8217;s face was slowly approaching me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah……&#8221;</p>



<p>I put my hand on Ayana&#8217;s shoulder and helped her to her feet, pulling her away from me.</p>



<p>Ayana looked disappointed, but I think the chime really saved my life because even I didn&#8217;t know what would have happened if I hadn&#8217;t done that.</p>



<p>(……It&#8217;s weird. There&#8217;s no doubt that I&#8217;m confused by all of that, but it&#8217;s only for a moment. Hey Towa, what the hell did you do?)</p>



<p>I asked myself, but of course there was no answer.</p>



<p>Eventually, we waited for a while after that, but Shu didn&#8217;t come back, so Ayana and I decided to go home first.</p>



<p>As we walked out the front door and on our way home, I glanced at Ayana, but she looked the same as usual.</p>



<p>&#8220;…….Tsk&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but click my tongue to make sure Ayana didn&#8217;t notice.</p>



<p>As long as I am living in the present as Towa, I never thought it would be so frustrating not to have a clear understanding of what happened in the past.</p>



<p>The way of life of Towa left in this body and its memories are also half-baked, and if there really is a God who guided me in this world, I want to ask him what on earth he is looking for.</p>



<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>While I was thinking about this, the phone in my pocket trembled.</p>



<p>I picked it up and looked at it to see that I had a message from my mom, asking me to buy some food because the fridge was getting lonely.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh. It&#8217;s from Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>I showed Ayana the message from Mom.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When it comes down to it, it looks like I&#8217;ll have to part ways with Ayana and head for the shopping district, and since I&#8217;m not going to refuse my mother&#8217;s request from the get-go, I&#8217;ll head there as soon as possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to do some shopping and go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said goodbye and started to walk away, but Ayana was right next to me.</p>



<p>I looked at her and wondered what was wrong, and she laughed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me help you with your shopping. I probably know more about the shopping district than Towa-kun, and I know that at this time of the day, there are stores where meat and vegetables are cheap.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I&#8217;m starting to think it would be more convenient for Ayana to stay with me in many ways.</p>



<p>It seems like it would be better if Ayana were here.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I was a little worried about whether it was okay to be together, because the image of Ayana from earlier passed through my mind, but in the end, I nodded&#8230; or rather, I was made to nod.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help. Rather, let me help&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;d like to stay together a little longer. Is that okay&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Please.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was impossible to refuse when a cute and pretty girl said such a thing to me.</p>



<p>I headed to the shopping district with Ayana, and there, I saw a scene that made me truly think that I was glad to have her with me, where I could see her homely side, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d call it.</p>



<p>&#8220;This meat is fresh. Shall we go look at the fish over there next? And just now, cabbage and Chinese cabbage are on sale, so let&#8217;s go there next.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was completely familiar with this shopping district.</p>



<p>I looked at Ayana, who was putting ingredients into her shopping basket one after another in front of me, and simply thought she was amazing.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;? What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; how should I put it, I&#8217;m thinking that you have a really homely side.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, is that so♪&#8221;</p>



<p>After that, I went around looking at ingredients with Ayana by my side.</p>



<p>It was a fun time to learn how to look at things and how to choose the right one, although I never seemed to be able to remember it all at once.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we shop together like this, we are like a married couple. I am the bride and you are my husband.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tsu…..&#8221;</p>



<p>My heart pounded.</p>



<p>I was unaware that Ayana&#8217;s words made me fantasize about that a little and I thought about how nice it would be to have that kind of future.</p>



<p>Ayana is not only good looking, but she can also study, has the courage to care and protect others that she showed in the classroom, …… and has this family friendly side that makes her a perfect match.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(…… I see, surely this is why she was voted number one in the popularity polls.)</p>



<p>If I remember correctly, they didn&#8217;t delve into her this deeply, but she still has all the elements that make her so popular.</p>



<p>But her position in eroge is only that of a cuckold heroine after all, but does she have any other secrets that made her so popular?</p>



<p>&#8220;…..&#8221;</p>



<p>When I was about to think about it, I was hit by a light headache and stumbled to my feet.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ayana did not see me as I am now, and I was relieved that I did not cause her any unnecessary worry.</p>



<p>After that, the shopping was done without incident and I drove Ayana to a position where I could see her house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me visit Towa-kun&#8217;s house again, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Yeah&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The surroundings are already dark, and it&#8217;s not safe for a girl to walk alone.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, accompanying her. But I started to think unconsciously.</p>



<p>(&#8230;it feels good to be by Ayana&#8217;s side. I don&#8217;t understand many things, but why do I feel that Ayana is so important to me&#8230;?)</p>



<p>Wait, why did I start thinking like that?</p>



<p>I was confused again by an unfamiliar feeling that seemed to be pulling me towards Towa, rather than a change in my own feelings.</p>



<p>(&#8230;Towa, what do you feel for Ayana? What are you looking for in Ayana?)</p>



<p>While walking with Ayana, I kept thinking about it. When Ayana&#8217;s house was getting close, it meant that Shu&#8217;s house, who lives in the neighborhood, was also close.</p>



<p>I took Ayana out at night like this, but even if there was a small chance, it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate to show this moment to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Ayana, thank you for today.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s what I wanted to do. But&#8230; I still don&#8217;t want to leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s figure, lit by the street lights, was somehow mysterious, and if she said such a thing looking up at me, I was also shaken.</p>



<p>When we were looking at each other for a while, a voice came from behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-neechan?&#8221;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p><b>[Shu PoV]</b></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Has Towa and Ayana gone home already?&#8221;</p>



<p>While helping Senpai Iori in the student council room, I muttered this to myself.</p>



<p>Usually, I would go home with Ayana and Towa, but since I was called by Senpai Iori, I couldn&#8217;t decline.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Ha&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I noticed that I had sighed, but I managed to cover it up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Being in the student council room with Iori Senpai alone was very exciting, but Ayana&#8217;s presence was always in my mind.</p>



<p>(&#8230;&#8230;Ayana)</p>



<p>For me, Ayana is a very important childhood friend.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been with her since I was young, and our relationship is very good because we have been together like family for a long time.</p>



<p>[Ayana-chan!]</p>



<p>[Shu-kun!]</p>



<p>When we were young, it was normal for us to call each other by name and be close to each other, and even now, we still visit each other&#8217;s houses like family.</p>



<p>Ayana has become part of my daily life, and being with her is the greatest happiness for me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(I&#8217;ll definitely&#8230;get together with Ayana)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing to put it into words, but I have a certain intuition.</p>



<p>Ever since I was young, Ayana has been by my side, and that hasn&#8217;t changed even now that I&#8217;m a second-year high school student&#8230; She will always be by my side.</p>



<p>[Shu and Ayana are a perfect match.]</p>



<p>[Yeah, yeah! Onii-chan and Ayana are definitely getting married!]</p>



<p>I used to be told often by my mother and younger sister to stop talking about it because it&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230; Well, my younger sister still says it a lot.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but smile when I thought about Ayana and my family.</p>



<p>Iori-senpai looked at me strangely when I suddenly laughed, but I just coughed and pretended it was nothing.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I was so happy to be able to help Iori and returned to the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… haha, I knew they wouldn&#8217;t be here….&#8221;</p>



<p>The two people I thought were waiting for me, Ayana and Towa, were already gone as expected.</p>



<p>I looked at my phone to make sure, and found a message from Ayana, saying that she and Towa are going home first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;ll just go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>I left the school with my bag on my back.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve walked outside by myself like this, but sometimes I think it&#8217;s not so bad to have a day like this.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because my daily life with Ayana and Towa is just too normal for me.</p>



<p>I am blessed not only with Ayana and Towa, but also with my family.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Yes, I was really blessed with my family as well.</p>



<p>I have a mother, a younger sister, and a father who lives far away from home.</p>



<p>My mother always makes me delicious food and lunch boxes, and she makes me happy by praising me for even the smallest things.</p>



<p>[Shu is our pride and joy, okay? Truly a sweet and good boy, I love you so much.]</p>



<p>When she hugs me like that, I feel really safe.</p>



<p>Mom seems to understand it, and she notices me being uneasy right away&#8230; Well, I understand that my mother really values me. Of course, not only my mother but also my younger sister loves me.</p>



<p>[Onii-chan, teach me to study!]</p>



<p>I am not good at studying, but even my younger sister who is in junior high school wants to study with me&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s my younger sister, but she loves being with me. She&#8217;s really important to me and also cute.</p>



<p>&#8220;And my dad is counting on me to be there for them.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>I often talk on the phone with my father who is on a solo business trip, and he always tells me to rely on my mother and younger sister.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a replacement for my father, but since I&#8217;m the only man left at home, I plan to protect both of them firmly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, I will also protect Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Ayana, who has always been by my side as a childhood friend, I will protect her too.</p>



<p>Because she is my important childhood friend&#8230; because she is my beloved childhood friend, I will continue to protect her from now on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana always helped me when I was bullied.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was used to being envied by others because of Ayana since middle school.</p>



<p>So sometimes I was bullied by various people, but every time Ayana protected me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s right, Towa too.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Towa also protected me along with Ayana, I&#8217;m sure that was the case.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa has really helped a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>I also care a great deal about Towa, who I&#8217;ve known for a long time, just like Ayana.</p>



<p>I wish I could have been that handsome, attentive, and …… person that Ayana would have never complained about standing next to her.</p>



<p>[Hey, Towa, I want you to cheer for Ayana and me.]</p>



<p>A long time ago, I once told him that and he nodded his head.</p>



<p>Because of this, I can trust that there is nothing between Towa and Ayana, and I know that Towa has been and always will be on my side.</p>



<p>Perhaps because I had been thinking too much, I had been standing still for a long time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>My stomach rumbled, and I laughed as I rushed home.</p>



<p>On the way home, I heard the sirens of an ambulance, as if there had been an accident somewhere, and I naturally turned my attention in that direction.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..&#8221;</p>



<p>I hate the sound of ambulance sirens.</p>



<p>It is not because the sound is annoying, but because it brings back bad memories for me.</p>



<p>[Shu!]</p>



<p>[…… eh?]</p>



<p>I shook my head and ran out of the house at once, trying to forget the memories that had almost come back to me.</p>



<p>By the time I arrived home and walked through the front door, I no longer cared about the unpleasant things I had almost remembered.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I am home~!&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed that she had not yet returned home, which was unusual today, as I did not see my sister, who usually responded by saying welcome home.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome home, Shu.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if in place of my sister, my mother came out of the living room.</p>



<p>When she saw me, she approached me with a smile on her face and hugged my face to her ample bosom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Mom?</p>



<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t try to pull away. My sweet son is finally home and wants to do this, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes♪&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing to do this kind of thing to a high school student. But since the other party was my mother, I did as I was told.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did something happen today? You were late. Was it a date with Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was accompanying the student council president today. Ayana should have gone home first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh really? Haha, you&#8217;re really great. Helping out the student council president&#8217;s work is not a small task.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not really something to be praised, but I smiled ambiguously at my mother, thinking it was not good to depreciate myself too much.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have prepared a bath for you, so go take a bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>After putting my luggage in the room, I headed for the bath.</p>



<p>While taking a warm shower, I once again think about how I&#8217;m really blessed to have such a wonderful family.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This is something I thought earlier, but I&#8217;m truly grateful for this fate.</p>



<p>In a world where there are many types of families, I&#8217;m definitely surrounded by the best family and it&#8217;s not an exaggeration.</p>



<p>A kind mother, a cute younger sister, a reliable father&#8230; and my best childhood friend who is always by my side. At times like this, I feel like I&#8217;m the protagonist of a game and my cheeks naturally relax.</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>However, there was still one thing that bothered me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure why my family is so kind to me, but for some reason they have a hard time with Towa, or rather, when I talk about him, they make a face that is blatantly unpleasant.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I wonder if something happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>I would like us to be friends, but I think these things are easily resolved when we become aware of them and I believe that someday we will be friends with Towa as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, Towa and I have always been together. That&#8217;s why I hope we can all be friends.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Someday&#8230; if I really do end up marrying Ayana someday&#8230; I would still hope that Towa would speak at our wedding as a friend representative.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, I&#8217;m too impatient. But&#8230; I hope that kind of future will come.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing to say it myself, but it&#8217;s okay to just daydream like this, and no one can say anything about it.</p>



<p>And I believe that this future will really come.</p>



<p>[Shu-kun]</p>



<p>[Shu]</p>



<p>Thinking about the two people who have been together all this time, I finished my bath and returned to the living room where my mother was waiting.</p>
