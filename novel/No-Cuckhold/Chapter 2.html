<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>[I hate them. I’ve always hated them, from the bottom of my heart.]</p>



<p>Those words repeated in my head. While Ayana smiled when she said that, her words expressed a negativity far removed from her smile.</p>



<p>Originally, this world revolved around the heroines growing apart. Given that there was roughly a year of leeway before the story began, there hadn&#8217;t been any events at this stage that resembled the narrative.</p>



<p>However, because I lived as Towa and had glimpsed through his memories, one underlying premise concerning a specific character had already been shattered.</p>



<p>(…Ayana.)</p>



<p>Yes, it was Ayana, the main heroine.</p>



<p>Needless to say, her presence held great significance in my mind, and I had liked her from the time I played the game. Now, I truly loved Ayana, both as Towa and as my original self. Having already engaged in a relationship… well, in that regard, it was something I had from the beginning, but when you love someone and they love you back, it takes on a special meaning in itself.</p>



<p>(That&#8217;s right… at this point, everything has already fallen apart.)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The fact that Ayana and I were in a relationship meant that Ayana didn&#8217;t have special feelings for Shu. In other words, she wasn&#8217;t in love with him, and this deviation from the routes I knew was significant.</p>



<p>When Shu and Ayana&#8217;s relationship progressed, the story&#8217;s curtain would rise, and from there, all the gears would start to misalign. That pivotal moment – when Shu witnessed Towa and Ayana in a relationship, leading to his despair – would mark the ending.</p>



<p>(Let&#8217;s temporarily separate the existence called &#8220;me.&#8221; First, Towa was originally in a relationship with Ayana. At that point, it&#8217;s inconceivable that Ayana would accept Shu&#8217;s confession… after all, Ayana loves Towa so deeply.)</p>



<p>At this point, it was clear that I couldn&#8217;t follow the original route. While in games with a &#8220;netorare&#8221; theme, characters are often portrayed as complete scoundrels, I couldn&#8217;t fathom Ayana taking such actions, especially considering I had observed her from the sidelines. She may have a vulnerability tied to her affection, but she was a kind-hearted girl through and through.</p>



<p>My mother had mentioned that Ayana was clearly carrying something heavy, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to think that it was something wicked.</p>



<p>(…Maybe I should dig a little deeper.)</p>



<p>Just as I had that thought, I arrived at school.</p>



<p>I usually go to school with Shu and Ayana, but today I woke up a bit later than usual, so I asked them to go ahead without me.</p>



<p>In reality, I had been pondering the same thing as before last night, so I probably went to bed well past 2 AM.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had received a message from Ayana, worried if something had happened. I replied that I had overslept, and in response, she sent a cute yet slightly bewildered stamp. It was enough to brighten up my morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I changed my shoes using a geta box, I spotted Iori and Mari changing the printouts on the school bulletin board located just in front of the entrance.</p>



<p>While I found it strange that Mari, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the student council, was working alongside student council president Iori, I stared at them for a moment. But those two knew each other, and there was nothing particularly odd about it, so I quietly accepted it.</p>



<p>While observing them, the two turned to face me at that moment.</p>



<p>Mari flashed an overflowing smile and waved her hand, while Iori, though still offering a modest smile, waved her hand as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I wonder if I&#8217;ll be told something if I wave back casually.&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended up thinking that, so I headed over to them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Good morning, Yukishiro-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>Iori&#8217;s voice was quiet, but Mari&#8217;s was quite loud. It resonated somewhat throughout the morning hallway, but since the hallways in the morning were generally noisy, her voice didn&#8217;t particularly stand out.</p>



<p>&#8220;The president aside, what are you doing, Mari?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Iori was originally changing the printouts by herself, but when I showed up while coming to school, I decided to help her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you that you didn&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, is it really a problem? Besides, I don&#8217;t think Iori senpai has any reason to complain about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Gununu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu♪&#8221;</p>



<p>This looked like a showdown among women over Shu. But still, it was a strange and heartwarming sight when I didn&#8217;t think about the original story.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Mari had little free time due to her club activities, while Iori, who didn&#8217;t belong to any club, could maximize her time with Shu. In my memories, the two of them were depicted as eventually falling to the approaching menace, so people might wonder in which direction the story was heading, but watching them was genuinely enjoyable.</p>

<p>(At this point, I&#8217;m just a game fan, aren&#8217;t I?)</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but smile to myself. Meanwhile, things were developing around me.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, I&#8217;ll help too. My club activities are canceled today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, is that so? Then, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>No matter how much they argued, in the end, they agreed like this. They were love rivals but seemed to have good chemistry.</p>



<p>While it might appear that Mari, a younger student, was being roped into Iori&#8217;s plan, it was an agreeable relationship. Their apparent dispute, at least on the surface, showed a fun and peculiar interaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I halted my conversation with Mari and turned to Iori, she addressed me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to see you and Otonashi-san together with me at some point. If you don&#8217;t mind, would you help us out after school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Help out?&#8221;</p>



<p>Does that mean she is asking for Shu&#8217;s help too? I wondered why other members of the student council weren&#8217;t helping, but they were probably busy with other tasks.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of not having enough hands. I just wanted to spend time together with you and Shu-kun. I asked you to join because I was curious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed like it wasn&#8217;t a matter of lacking manpower; Iori was simply curious.</p>



<p>Mari looked a bit overwhelmed by Iori&#8217;s words, which aligned with her desires, but she was determined to help today.</p>



<p>I had no issue with helping out, but I couldn&#8217;t agree without first discussing it with Ayana since her name came up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Ayana if she can join. If she has other plans, though, it might not be possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re looking forward to it. Does that mean it&#8217;s already decided that we&#8217;re going&#8230;?</p>



<p>&#8220;But that means I might finally have a chance to talk to Ayana-senpai at length!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing Mari smile with delight, I couldn&#8217;t help but think that I definitely wanted to invite Ayana.</p>



<p>With no immediate commitment made, I said my goodbyes to them and headed to the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I entered the classroom, Ayana and Shu, who had been talking near the entrance, called out to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;ve been in touch with Ayana, so I think she knows that I overslept. Yet, when Ayana directly spoke to me, she quietly examined my entire body, as if she wanted to confirm that there really was nothing.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual, isn&#8217;t it? Towa oversleeping.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I stayed up pretty late. Staying up all night isn&#8217;t really my thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying this, I made my way to my seat, and the two of them naturally followed.</p>



<p>Inwardly, I couldn&#8217;t help but smile at the situation. I then shared the recent conversation I had with the Student Council President and Marika.</p>



<p>&#8220;I met the Student Council President and Mari at the entrance earlier…&#8221;</p>



<p>I explained about the request from the Student Council President for help after school and Mari&#8217;s interest in talking with Ayana. Both Towa and Ayana seemed okay with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;d like to see just how close Towa has gotten with Iori-Senpai and Mari♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what makes you say that…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exchange between Ayana and Shu …… is nothing more than an act of childhood familiarity.</p>



<p>It reminds me of the happy couple in the game just by looking at them, and it&#8217;s so amicable that I don&#8217;t think a tragedy will happen like in the game.</p>



<p>However, it is a certain truth that I am having a relationship with Ayana, and I am betraying Shu in that regard.</p>



<p>[I want you to root for me with Ayana.]</p>



<p>Memories of the words she once said to me in the hospital room come flooding back.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to give her to you, and Ayana is my only girl… These mixed feelings are turning black, but the relationship I have with Ayana makes me feel superior to Shu and calms me down. …… This is a really troubling feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm… What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It seems like I was lost in thought again.</p>



<p>I suddenly realize that Shu is nowhere to be seen, and Ayana is gazing at me with a worried expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Shu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He went to the restroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you really not see anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you, I didn&#8217;t see anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>I assure her, and Ayana places her hand gently on my forehead, scrutinizing me closely, as if she&#8217;s making sure I&#8217;m okay.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but smile at her watchful eyes. I hold her hand to reassure her once again that I&#8217;m fine.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, everything&#8217;s okay. Just like I told you when I woke up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But… You sent that random joke last night, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about that…&#8221;</p>



<p>It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing. I couldn&#8217;t explain that I&#8217;d just felt a little concerned about Ayana and sent the message on a whim. Of course, I know that the message was horribly nonsensical and lacked any sense of decorum. I&#8217;m still repenting for that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu… Well, it was quite unexpected coming from the usual Towa-kun, so I was surprised. But I was happy that you cared about me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I was actually thinking about you too. After what happened yesterday evening…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just… I don&#8217;t know how to put it, but it feels like we&#8217;re connected, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a somewhat embarrassing statement. Despite the distance between us, our feelings seem to be connected. It&#8217;s because I felt that way last night that the words just slipped out naturally.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana looks at me in surprise and then smiles with her hand on her lips.</p>



<p>That soft gaze makes me feel like I&#8217;m enveloped in her kindness. It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m being told, just like before, not to overthink things. That&#8217;s the feeling I get.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We are connected… I thought the same thing yesterday, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>In that moment when I saw Ayana&#8217;s smile, all the sounds around me seemed to fade away. If I were to describe it romantically, I&#8217;d say that I was once again enchanted by her smile, an enchantment that had happened countless times before.</p>



<p>I was captivated… yes, truly captivated.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that I genuinely believed there was no one else in the world except for Ayana at that moment, but I reached out towards her.</p>



<p>Ayana smiled even deeper when she saw my outstretched hand and softly called my name.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun.]</p>



<p>[Towa-kun.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, I heard two voices.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I wanted to rub my eyes because, in front of me, it looked like there were two Ayanas.</p>



<p>In addition to the Ayana who was gazing at me with a smile, there was another Ayana who had such a fleeting smile that she seemed like she would disappear at any moment. The second Ayana disappeared immediately, and by the time the sound returned, there was only one Ayana in front of me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Again, it happened… it was a sensation similar to when I saw that woman in the black hooded coat.</p>



<p>Back then and now, every time I experienced such inexplicable phenomena, Ayana&#8217;s expression had likely changed enough to make her appear strange.</p>



<p>(I know very well that it&#8217;s not normal. I understand it. But seeing such a bizarre scene suddenly like this… It&#8217;s hard to keep it off my face.)</p>



<p>Each time, I couldn&#8217;t help but worry Ayana, but I didn&#8217;t know how to explain it with words. Perhaps… no, Ayana might genuinely listen and believe me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>If that&#8217;s the case, maybe I should just tell her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting noisy~. Take your seats~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… I&#8217;ll talk to you later, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our homeroom teacher arrived, and Ayana returned to her seat. Shu also returned a bit later, and since the bell hadn&#8217;t rung yet, nothing was said. Soon after, the morning assembly began.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a whole-school morning assembly over the weekend, so be prepared for that. As for the rest…&#8221;</p>



<p>While listening to the teacher&#8217;s words, I glanced at the notebook.</p>



<p>Not just the setting of this world but also all the strange phenomena that happened around me, I had recorded everything in that notebook.</p>



<p>&#8220;…All right, this should do.&#8221;</p>



<p>What I had just recorded was what I had seen a moment ago.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The smiling Ayana and the fleeting-smile Ayana… It could be a misunderstanding, and even worse, there was a possibility that something might be wrong with me.</p>



<p>Until lunch break, the time passed quickly. Ayana approached me with concern during the break, but I reassured her each time, and in the end, she agreed to relax.</p>



<p>&#8220;Still, I can&#8217;t believe Towa and Ayana will help out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. It seems like we might be interfering with your time, Senpai.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it… I mean—&#8221;</p>



<p>“Ah, it comes with rice~?”</p>



<p>Ayana removed a grain of rice from Shu&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>Shu blushed visibly and gazed blankly at Ayana, but she just smiled slightly, not doing anything more.</p>



<p>This scene alone, if taken out of context, would resemble a scene from a game that I knew well. Shu exchanged an earnest smile, and Ayana&#8217;s knowing smile was enough to make him blush. However, I couldn&#8217;t help but sense a hint of acting somewhere, perhaps just me overthinking it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As if they wanted to charm the other person by presenting their best selves. Maybe I was thinking too much.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun? Why are you staring so intently like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Oh, no, sorry, just thinking…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, could it be… you&#8217;re captivated by me?&#8221;</p>



<p>She said it while smiling. Her smiling expression was the same one she had directed at Shu, but I responded honestly without feeling embarrassed like Shu did.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much being captivated as me being completely enchanted by Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a bit cheesy… Uwaa, it makes my skin crawl!</p>



<p>I regretted saying it as soon as I said it, but it seemed to have some effect. Ayana widened her eyes for a moment but then blushed and looked down.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Her reaction was adorable, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be very amusing to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought the same thing, Ayana! You&#8217;re always cute, Ayana!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu&#8217;s heartfelt words didn&#8217;t seem to resonate with Ayana the way he had hoped.</p>



<p>What I just felt – Shu&#8217;s faithful depiction of himself in the game and Ayana&#8217;s contrasting, somewhat detached demeanor – I had wondered about it before in relation to Shu, but I decided to record it in my notebook again.</p>



<p>Afterward, we spent time together with the three of us even after finishing lunch.</p>



<p>However, Ayana&#8217;s friend happened to pass by and pulled her away, taking her with them. This left Shu and me alone with no conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Even without much talking, it didn&#8217;t feel awkward, and the silence was not uncomfortable. It was almost like reading quietly, playing games, or going to each other&#8217;s homes to do so.</p>



<p>Shu looked at me and continued to speak while staring at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa… Are you rooting for Ayana and me?&#8221;</p>



<p>I fell silent for a moment.</p>



<p>In response to Shu&#8217;s words, there were various things I wanted to say, and feelings of superiority and anger mixed in my chest, stimulating me. But, strangely, that heat quickly subsided, and I found myself smoothly speaking the words that I seemed to have prepared in advance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, maybe. If you dawdle, I might steal her away, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No way! Absolutely not!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely not? Who do you think you are, saying that?&#8221;</p>



<p>After that, the bell rang, and Shu returned to his seat to prepare for the next class. I took out the notebook and began making notes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>While doing so, I found myself thinking as I read the written content.</p>



<p>(Where is my will, ultimately…?)</p>



<p>I should just take action myself, make a decision, but I was just hesitating. When I first awakened in this world, I was determined to bring Shu and Ayana together without influencing the game&#8217;s storyline.</p>



<p>But in the end, I soon felt something was amiss, and I allowed myself to be carried away by the circumstances, yearning for Ayana… enjoying sweet moments hidden from Shu.</p>



<p>(I want to be with Ayana, protect her… That&#8217;s because I already have the memories of Towa, and I felt this from the time I spent with Ayana. I can&#8217;t leave her to Shu; I don&#8217;t want to leave her to him.)</p>



<p>Maybe it would have been so much easier if I were just a player who played the game without thinking about the consequences.</p>



<p>Avoiding this, not allowing that… even if I thought about it, in the end, it was my actions that would lead to a result, and it would depend on how I acted, impacting Ayana and Shu. They had their own will, they weren&#8217;t programmed entities; they were living humans.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Haa&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder who said, Don&#8217;t sigh, the more you sigh, the more happiness escapes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Anyway, now that I think about it, it&#8217;s only been about a week since I clearly awoke as Towa. Considering that, I&#8217;ve managed to stay calm after organizing the facts revealed and the information crammed into my head during this short time. I really should commend myself.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not entirely calm about all the events, but it seems that my soul has become deeply ingrained in Towa&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fuwaa.&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to let my guard down, as a huge yawn escaped from me.</p>



<p>During this time, it was the classical literature class, and a female teacher was in charge. I, who had just yawned so openly, was caught by the teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro-kun? Are you that bored?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be more careful next time, okay? I&#8217;ll cut you some slack this time since you usually have a good attitude in class. But remember, I&#8217;ll be strict next time, so be prepared.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>After the teacher&#8217;s words and the chuckles from the people around me, I scratched my head.</p>



<p>I glanced around, and both Ayana and Shu, who were seated apart, and Aisaka were all laughing. It&#8217;s truly embarrassing… this is what they mean when they say you wish the ground would swallow you up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>During class, there was a mishap when I yawned and got scolded by the teacher, but afterward, time passed without any significant events. </p>



<p>There were no strange occurrences to worry about, and I endured my sleepiness throughout the class. Afterward, it was time for us to help with student council activities, as we had agreed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu led the way as the three of us entered the student council room. This was my second time coming here, and I hadn&#8217;t expected all of us to gather in this place.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome, all three of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-senpai! Hello, Yukishiro-senpai and Ayana-senpai too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, hello to both of you.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Iori and Mari were already sitting in chairs and working on something, and Shu also took a seat next to them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro-kun and Otonashi-san, please sit wherever you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>We were told to sit wherever we wanted, so Ayana and I took seats next to each other.</p>



<p>Shu, of course, was experienced, and it seemed that Mari had helped out a few times before. Ayana had also assisted when Shu introduced her to Iori. That meant I was the only one who didn&#8217;t know what was going on.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach Towa-kun. It&#8217;s not much different from before, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t worry, Yukishiro-kun. Even though we call it &#8216;help,&#8217; it&#8217;s more about spending some enjoyable time with everyone this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Afterward, Ayana taught me the work.</p>



<p>Just as Iori said, it wasn&#8217;t much work – primarily organizing printed materials and checking for errors.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;This one… Hmm, it looks fine. And here…&#8221;</p>



<p>Next to me, Ayana smoothly organized the printed materials.</p>



<p>Shu and Mari, being more experienced, had quicker hand movements. Unsurprisingly, I was the slowest among us. Still, as Iori had said, I worked steadily without getting flustered.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s fun when all five of us gather like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! It&#8217;s so enjoyable with Shu-senpai here!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, Mari!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mari stopped her work and jumped onto Shu, surprising him a bit. He seemed to handle this kind of situation calmly, probably because it had happened before.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara ara, you two are so close.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Shu-senpai and I are good friends!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Please, don&#8217;t speak so loudly in my ear, Mari.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said&#8230;.!&#8221;</p>



<p>The scene in the student council room was getting a bit noisy, but I found it to be a pleasant background to the tasks at hand. </p>



<p>With Iori joining in, things became even livelier. The atmosphere was joyful, and I couldn&#8217;t help but watch the three of them playfully interacting.</p>



<p>(…This is quite a pleasant sight.)</p>



<p>Iori and Mari, who are in a hurry to get close to Shu, by making body touches in their own way, are somewhat …… like that.</p>



<p>It was a scene seen in common romantic comedies, not erotic ones.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too attached!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ara, isn&#8217;t that a bit rich coming from you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Both of you, please! Stop having a heated discussion with me in the middle!&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite his words, Shu wore a mischievous smile. I looked at Ayana sitting next to me, and her gaze was also fixed on the group&#8217;s interaction, even though her eyes were hidden behind her bangs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it always this lively here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Oh, yes. It seems so… It&#8217;s much friendlier than I imagined, and it&#8217;s heartwarming.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had heard that Iori and Mari introduced Shu to each other, and considering Shu&#8217;s less outgoing nature initially, it was clear that Iori and Mari had played a significant role in making him more comfortable.</p>



<p>If Ayana had thought about this, it was further proof of her kindness and thoughtfulness. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel the same way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, it&#8217;s truly wonderful. They&#8217;ve all become so close.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Her smile is so beautiful that I can&#8217;t help but stare at it.</p>



<p>It is natural to be fascinated by the sight, but there is also this other feeling: ……What is really this strange feeling?</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Are you truly able to laugh right now?</p>



<p>Just as I was about to ask her that question, Mari hugged Ayana from behind, causing her to let out a little scream, and the question became a moot point.</p>



<p>Although I thought it was bad timing, I decided to give up for now because I could always make time to be alone with Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-senpai! How can I become a woman with a great figure like you and Honjo-senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A great figure… Is that what you&#8217;re aiming for?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes! I mean… having a large bust definitely gives you a significant advantage when it comes to seducing men, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mari-chan, why are you suddenly concerned about such things?&#8221;</p>



<p>The conversation between the two girls began unexpectedly, and I tried to avert my gaze as I looked at Iori.</p>



<p>She was sitting beside Shu, grinning, and it was clear that she had teased Mari about her own figure. Ayana seemed to have figured it out too and let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mari-chan, a woman&#8217;s charm isn&#8217;t just about her figure. What&#8217;s important is her personality, and, at the same time, her feelings for the other person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feelings for the other person&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Rather than taking Honjo-senpai&#8217;s words too seriously, it&#8217;s better to keep a balance. It&#8217;s for your own good, Mari-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, Otonashi-san, aren&#8217;t you being a bit too harsh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Iori joined in on the conversation at this point.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Shu and I were completely left out of the conversation, and it was difficult for us to contribute to a discussion that was so centered around women&#8217;s issues.</p>



<p>I subtly moved my chair away from the girls, hoping to give them space for their discussion, and returned to organizing the printouts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu, how&#8217;s it going over there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going smoothly. I&#8217;m getting used to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu had significantly fewer printouts to sort through, and both of us were close to finishing our tasks.</p>



<p>Including Ayana, Iori and Mari were chattering away, making it difficult for us to focus on our work. We could have asked them to work too, but it seemed better to let them enjoy their conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Haha&#8221;</p>



<p>Watching the three beautiful girls having a good time together was indeed refreshing. But more than that, the sight of Ayana, happily surrounded by her two friends, was the most captivating.</p>



<p>&#8220;They look like they&#8217;re having fun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; Well then, let&#8217;s finish our part for the three of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s try to complete the rest as best as we can.</p>



<p>However, a few minutes later, Shu and I found ourselves making eye contact and silently wondering which of us should intervene and reprimand them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, both of you! That&#8217;s a bit too much, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? A little tickling never hurt&#8230; Oh, it&#8217;s so soft.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a peculiar sensation, touching someone else&#8217;s ch*st like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>A strange conversation was unfolding in the room, and it left us both at a loss.</p>



<p>In terms of positioning, the exchange is happening behind me, and from where I&#8217;m sitting across from Shu, when I slightly raise my gaze, I can see the interactions between those three.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;!!&#8230;&#8230;!?!?&#8221;</p>



<p>For a while now, she has been sneaking glances and blushing, completely acting suspiciously as if to amuse me.</p>



<p>But …… yeah, I&#8217;m curious about this too.</p>



<p>I close my eyes and focus behind me.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s ticklish voice, Iori and Mari&#8217;s happy voices, the sound of hands crawling on clothes, the footsteps made by writhing…… having played numerous gal and a few er*ge in the past, I can see the picture in my mind&#8217;s eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa? Your expression seems to have changed quite a bit…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re not your usual handsome self anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops, that wouldn&#8217;t be good.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I made an effort to maintain a sharp expression and lightly tapped my cheeks. Despite the continuing commotion behind me that made me want to turn around, I immersed myself in my work as if it were a soothing background music.</p>



<p>Honestly, I&#8217;ve always thought that these kinds of things were troublesome. However, helping someone can be quite nice, and above all, the happiness of seeing Ayana has been my most cherished time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I see… So that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It clicked in my mind as if I&#8217;d solved a puzzle. I realized that in this world, I was drawn to Ayana, and I wished to be with her. I thought about what I could do in this situation. Despite being swayed by circumstances, the core of who I am still revolves around my desire for Ayana to be happy.</p>



<p>(But that&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;m going to protect Ayana… and for that…)</p>



<p>I turned around.</p>



<p>The boisterous spectacle of beautiful girls playfully interacting with each other had already dissipated. Now they were just having a normal conversation, but Ayana was still smiling.</p>



<p>Not only Ayana, but Iori and Mari as well, all had genuine smiles on their faces.</p>



<p>(I want to protect this scene …… Kotone-san and Hatsune-san are honestly difficult, but I&#8217;m sure even Ayana would be saddened if she knew the future of these two unhappy people)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;ve said it many times before, but this world is already my reality. It may not follow the exact path of my memories, and I might experience things that are far from ordinary, even hearing mysterious voices. But let&#8217;s consider that all of this has some kind of meaning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>As I contemplated this, I once again pressed my head lightly.</p>



<p>Two scenes appeared in my mind as if the scenery was switching: Iori and Mari in a scene where they were stained and fallen by a man&#8217;s hands.</p>



<p>(You again…)</p>



<p>And beside them stood someone in a black hood, whose identity flashed through my mind.</p>



<p>The view returned to its original state, and I had merely held my head lightly, so there was no need to worry anyone.</p>



<p>This needed to be documented as well, and I agreed with that.</p>



<p>I still didn&#8217;t understand the meaning of these numerous visions, but I had an intuitive feeling that something was influencing my memories.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you making that difficult face again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not really. I&#8217;d say my mood is quite the opposite.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ou.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. To put it another way, I&#8217;m feeling quite good now.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve finally been able to redefine what I want in my heart.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"/>



<p>[Shu PoV]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;President, I can handle it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, may I ask you to?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was sudden, but even Towa was coming to the end of helping Senior Iori, according to my understanding.</p>



<p>For me,Shu Sasaki, assisting Iori had already become a routine, but for Towa, it was his first time, and he struggled a bit at first.</p>



<p>(But Towa is incredible. He can do anything by the end.)</p>



<p>Towa&#8217;s initial difficulty had disappeared. Of course, the tasks Iori assigned to Towa were simple, but I remembered that when I first started with Iori, I had been desperate for several days, asking her questions and learning how to do things.</p>



<p>(But Towa can do everything already.)</p>



<p>He could even find and complete tasks on his own and was now working together with Iori, shoulder to shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Him helping was a source of happiness for me, and, above all, just having Ayana near me was something that made me happy.</p>



<p>But… but!</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand how our abilities and qualities were highlighted, showing how different we were. It made me feel down, as if I&#8217;d never be able to surpass him.</p>



<p>And, what&#8217;s worse, Ayana was also praising Towa.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun, you really can do anything. It&#8217;s amazing♪]</p>



<p>Why is that? I wanted to shout, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing my best too, you know!&#8221; But it would be embarrassing, and it wasn&#8217;t in my nature to seek praise.</p>



<p>Hey, Ayana, don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m right here, next to you? Why do you only look at Towa without even noticing me right next to you?</p>



<p>I felt an ugly surge of jealousy, something I didn&#8217;t even want to admit to myself.</p>



<p>I was working hard too. I wanted to tell Ayana to praise me, but it was embarrassing and unseemly, and I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to say it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(…And besides…)</p>



<p>In this situation, I remembered what happened during lunch break.</p>



<p>Back then, in the hospital room, I had told Towa that I wanted him to root for Ayana and me. He hadn&#8217;t replied at the time, but he had nodded slightly. However…</p>



<p>[Well now, if I keep dawdling, I might snatch her away, you know?]</p>



<p>He had said this with a provocative expression, showing how well he pulled off the handsome look. It made me think, handsome guys are just cheating. And Towa, in particular, was a real cheat.</p>



<p>He could do anything, he had everything, and he was loved by many. He possessed many things that I didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>I had been so absorbed in comparing myself to Towa that my work had come to a stop.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana was looking at me with a puzzled expression, so I frantically tried to finish my work, as if I wanted to convey that I was doing my best.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-kun, this part is incorrect, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The digits are completely off. And here, the rows are off by one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>I realized my mistakes when Ayana pointed them out. I understood that everyone made small errors while thinking about something else while working, but since I had been asked by Iori-senpai to help, I had to make sure to be careful.</p>



<p>I slapped my cheek as Towa had done earlier, making a satisfying sound. It stung a bit, and I turned a little red, but it re-energized me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-senpai is really fired up now!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, it&#8217;s a good thing to have motivation. Keep up the good work, Shu-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When Ayana praised me, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a sense of accomplishment, even though I hadn&#8217;t sought praise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell me if you need any help, okay? I&#8217;ll assist with anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana leaned over, looking into my face. It was the first time she had looked at me so closely. &#8220;Anything?&#8221; I thought to myself, remembering those words I had seen online. But I knew I would never make any weird requests.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright. I can handle it by myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Waa… You look so cool, Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to show off, but hearing it from Mari made me feel genuinely happy.</p>



<p>Ayana looked surprised at my response.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m just a bit surprised.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you would ask for help right away, Shu-kun. I didn&#8217;t expect you to decline so confidently.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I just wanted to look cool, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221;</p>



<p>I had raised my voice, and I felt a bit embarrassed about it, but I focused on my work again.</p>



<p>I wondered if I might have been showing off a bit too much. I also worried if I might come off as weird. While thinking about this, I glanced over at Towa and Iori-senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s fine like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good to know.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;As for the next set of documents… Can you handle them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, leave it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re reliable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their conversation flowed so smoothly.</p>



<p>Iori-senpai was often seen as cold and distant because of her cool appearance and way of speaking, but she was indeed a kind person.</p>



<p>…But I couldn&#8217;t help feeling a bit uncomfortable about how close she and Towa seemed to be.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana laughed as she watched the two of them.</p>



<p>Even just her profile had a significant impact, and Ayana was most lovely when she smiled like that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I kept watching, Ayana turned her face towards me. When she tilted her head, I couldn&#8217;t help but say:</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey… You&#8217;re smiling more today than usual.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Towa being here definitely contributes, but you seem to have a lot of fun when you&#8217;re talking with Iori-senpai and the others.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh…? Did I say something strange?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana seemed even more surprised by my words.</p>



<p>Ayana appeared completely bewildered as she averted her gaze from me, her focus shifting toward Towa and Iori-senpai. She even began to look at Mari, who was sitting next to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-senpai?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…It&#8217;s nothing, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>She replied, looking down, her behavior obviously out of the ordinary.</p>



<p>I was about to ask her what was wrong, but Towa acted before I did.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Towa. Even though he had been talking with Iori-senpai just moments ago, he naturally approached Ayana like a hero coming to her rescue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, well… I just zoned out for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>Towa leaned over Ayana&#8217;s face with a worried expression. Even someone of the same sex as me had to admit that Towa looked cool. Yet, at the same time, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a tinge of jealousy.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Although I realized it too, it seemed that the situation was being dominated by Towa, making me feel left out. Everyone, including Iori-senpai and Mari, was watching Towa&#8217;s actions closely.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really fine. Besides, Towa-kun, you&#8217;ve been spacing out quite a bit recently, so maybe I caught it from you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… not a pleasant way to catch it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had no idea what they were talking about. They were chuckling, and Towa had a slightly worried expression, a conversation that only the two of them seemed to understand. I felt like an outsider.</p>



<p>Despite thinking that, I chose not to point it out, wanting to avoid making things awkward. We pushed through and finished our tasks. By the time we were done tidying up, everyone seemed satisfied. I felt a strong sense of accomplishment, even more than usual.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, it was great that we got to chat not only while working but also with Ayana and Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. I usually have club activities, so I don&#8217;t get many opportunities like this. It was really enjoyable!&#8221;</p>



<p>Iori-senpai and Mari seemed content. As the tasks were completed, it was time to disband. However, I found myself pulled away by Iori-senpai and Mari, losing my chance to leave.</p>



<p>&#8220;You really did your best today, Shu-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah, I guess so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely! You were amazing, Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahaha… Thank you, both of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although I had been shown as a cool guy to Ayana, I couldn&#8217;t deny that it was a bit of an overstatement. Nevertheless, I felt a strong sense of achievement, and the warm sensation of my arms being wrapped by both of them enhanced the feeling.</p>



<p>(But…)</p>



<p>Even amidst all this, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder about Ayana&#8217;s bewildered expression. I had never seen her like that before. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what she was thinking at that moment.</p>
