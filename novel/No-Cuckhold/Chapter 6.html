<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>&#8220;…. Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I suddenly woke up and sat up, I found myself calling her name. I didn&#8217;t quite understand why, but it felt like she had called for help, like she had said, &#8220;Help me.&#8221; However, it was not Ayana who welcomed me as I awoke; it was our teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, I&#8217;m Otonashi-san? Are you disappointed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… It&#8217;s not like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m just kidding. But it seems like you&#8217;re feeling better, right? Your complexion looks better than when you arrived.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I might have just been really tired. I&#8217;m completely fine now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I struck a muscle pose to show off, and the nurse chuckled. However, when I checked the clock, I was surprised—several hours had passed since I had come to the infirmary, and it was already lunchtime.</p>



<p>&#8220;I slept quite a bit.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Every time I glanced at you, your sleeping face was so cute. I found it soothing. And also, make sure to thank Otonashi-san properly, and show her your lively self soon for peace of mind. She&#8217;s been coming here during every break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana… she definitely had a sudden health issue, and I seemed to have caused her a lot of worry. After thanking the teacher again, I tried to leave the infirmary.</p>



<p>But just as I reached for the door, it swung open with a loud noise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>We both exclaimed and stared at each other, frozen in place.</p>



<p>The one who opened the door was Ayana. Even though it had just become lunch break, it seemed she had come to check on my condition before having lunch.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ooh!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a thud, she came forward and hugged me tightly. I could sense the teacher grinning in the background, but I placed my hand on Ayana&#8217;s shoulder. That&#8217;s when I noticed something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana… did something happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked, and Ayana&#8217;s eyes widened in response.</p>



<p>From that reaction, it was clear that something had happened, and I could somewhat predict what she would say next. She would probably say, &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, it&#8217;s nothing, you know? I just worried too much about Towa-kun.♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Her response was just as I had expected, so there wasn&#8217;t any real surprise. But even her smile at the end seemed like a facade to hide her true feelings.</p>



<p>(…Is this what Towa was talking about, Ayana&#8217;s hidden feelings…?)</p>



<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t matter. Regardless, I needed to have a proper conversation with Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I remembered everything from the dream, including what I had talked to Towa about. It was possible that it was all just a dream and my imagination, but at this point, it seemed unlikely, and I felt it with a strong sense.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both of you can have your lovey-dovey moments, but make sure to have a proper lunch, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>We separated from the hug and left the infirmary. Once we were out in the school corridor, Ayana&#8217;s actions were not as intense, but our eyes met, as expected. Every time that happened, we both smiled involuntarily.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right… I&#8217;ll protect this smile.</p>



<p>Not a forced smile, not a smile hiding something behind a mask, but a genuine smile that I would protect from now on. To do that, I needed to talk to Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayana, can I have some of your time after school today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, Towa-kun. I&#8217;ll make as much time as you need for you♪&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Haha, thanks, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>I secured an after-school appointment with Ayana and returned to the classroom. When I got back to the classroom, several classmates approached me and asked how I was doing. I felt a bit apologetic for making them worry, but it reminded me of the joy of having so many people concerned for me.</p>



<p>Aisaka naturally came over, and Shu also greeted me. However, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that Ayana gave Shu a slightly disapproving look, but I didn&#8217;t ask anything intentionally.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Yukishiro-kun, you&#8217;re back. I heard you weren&#8217;t feeling well. I was worried, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m completely fine now!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I got it. You don&#8217;t have to push yourself today. Just relax and focus on your classes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oops, that was basically the same as telling me I could go to sleep… Why did I think that way? I scolded myself internally.</p>



<p>My interaction with the teacher amused my classmates, and the class returned to normal.</p>



<p>(…When I can focus on my thoughts like this, I can think about various things. It seems like I&#8217;ve merged even more with Towa&#8217;s soul than before.)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had never felt uncomfortable living as Towa, but now, as Towa had told me in the dream, it seemed I was almost fully integrated into this world as Towa.</p>



<p>Maybe the encounter in the dream was the final push I needed. I had been a bit worried about whether I would revert to being Towa when I woke up, but that was just an unnecessary concern. It seemed that I had settled into Towa almost completely.</p>



<p>To move forward, to clarify my ambiguous relationship with Ayana, I needed to have a conversation with her.</p>



<p>At least, I hoped that Towa would hear my plea. I might not be able to reach him with my voice anymore, but I felt a warm feeling in my chest, and I smiled, feeling reassured.</p>



<p>The time until the end of the school day passed quickly. When I was organizing my things, Iori appeared in the classroom and took Shu away. Soon after, Ayana came to me with her bag in hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, could you come to that park at around 4:30?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That park… Got it. And, it&#8217;s not a date, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, sorry if you were hoping for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not at all. I&#8217;ll head there at the agreed time.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I waved goodbye as Ayana left the classroom, and I let out a sigh. Now that I had made this appointment, there was no turning back. But I wasn&#8217;t planning on running away in the first place, and my determination to have a proper conversation with Ayana remained unwavering.</p>



<p>After a quick visit to the restroom, I went home directly from school. I placed my bag on the living room sofa, headed to the fridge, and grabbed a bottle of juice.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Puhaaa&#8221;</p>



<p>As my throat quenched its thirst, my body tingled with a refreshing sensation. I checked the clock and confirmed I had plenty of time. Then, I headed to the storage room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh… I thought it would be all dirty and dusty, but it&#8217;s quite clean. Maybe Mom cleans it regularly.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had expected a certain level of dirt and dust since it wasn&#8217;t a frequently used space, but it was cleaner than I thought.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t supposed to know about the storage room&#8217;s existence or what was kept inside. However, due to my strong connection with Towa, I had come to understand these things.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, there it is.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>What I was looking for at the moment was a soccer ball.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey there, old buddy. I&#8217;ve left you alone for quite a while, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p>I had virtually no experience with soccer, as I had mentioned to Towa in the dream. Nevertheless, holding the ball in my hands made it feel like a trusted companion that had been with me for years.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a final boost of determination, I left the house.</p>



<p>Carrying the soccer ball by my side as I walked, I was surprisingly calm during this time, and there was no sign of nervousness.</p>



<p>However, to say there was absolutely no nervousness might be a bit of an exaggeration. But anyway, I was going to do what I could do—clear Ayana&#8217;s troubled heart, put an end to our half-hearted relationship, and take the first step together to move forward, for both of us.</p>



<p>I headed to the park.</p>

<p>After a while, I arrived at the park. It was still early, not even five o&#8217;clock, and, for today at least, there were no other people around. There were only a few distant figures walking along the road outside the park.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I placed the soccer ball I had brought in a shaded area and took a deep breath to calm my nerves. I gazed at the park, reflecting on how it was where our story began—not just Towa&#8217;s, but mine as well.</p>



<p>One holiday, I was bored at home, so I left home to go to an arcade run by an old man I knew… and that&#8217;s how I met Ayana at this park I passed by.</p>



<p>[What are you doing here all alone? Your eyes are really red, are you crying ……?]</p>



<p>When I saw Ayana raise her head and say that, that&#8217;s when our time together began.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t understand it at the time, but there are things I understand now.</p>



<p>&#8220;From that moment, I think I&#8217;ve liked you, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly love at first sight, but there was something special about our meeting that day. I didn&#8217;t understand it back then, but now I do.</p>



<p>&#8220;From that time, we&#8217;ve been together for years. Ayana has always been there by my side.&#8221;</p>



<p>No matter what happened, Ayana was always there. She had been there in the past, and I hoped she would be there in the future. I needed her with me, and together, we would move forward.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Just a bit longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>I only had to wait a little longer until our appointment. I took out my smartphone and made a call.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that you, Towa?&#8221;</p>



<p>I had called Shu, even though I didn&#8217;t really have anything to talk to him about. But there was one thing I needed to tell him right now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Shu. I need to cancel the promise I made back then then. I love Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Eh? Towa&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>Without waiting for his response, I ended the call, and at that moment, Ayana appeared at the park entrance. When she spotted me, she ran over, a bright smile on her face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting, Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her cheerful greeting made me smile, and I couldn&#8217;t help but be touched by her presence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ayana, for coming.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come anywhere if Towa-kun calls for me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana moved closer, her warm smile illuminated by the setting sun. The scene felt almost magical with the sun&#8217;s warm light surrounding us. However, I could see through her forced smile. I knew that something was bothering her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to find out what was causing Ayana&#8217;s unease, so I need to talk to her. But what I was about to say might, in a way, invalidate everything she had done until now. I was afraid of how she would react to my words, but I had already made up my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to talk to you again, Ayana. About something important… about our future.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Our future… Something important? Is it, by any chance…?&#8221;</p>



<p>She blushed and fidgeted, making it clear that she understood where the conversation was heading.</p>



<p>Certainly, my choice of words could be misconstrued as a confession or something similar. I apologized to her for that, but I proceeded with the conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lately, I&#8217;ve been really concerned about you, Ayana. I&#8217;ve been wondering about the reasons behind your smiles, especially the ones with a hint of sadness that you show from time to time, or the smiles that seem forced.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s expression noticeably changed. The cheerful smile she wore moments ago had vanished, replaced by a perplexed look. She kept her gaze fixed on me. I continued without averting my eyes, determined to speak my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, you might have been carrying something all this time, something that you shouldn&#8217;t have had to bear. The anger and sadness that you&#8217;ve been carrying might have been mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s eyes widened, and her reaction was clear confirmation. I had already known from my own memories and what I had heard from Shu, and this world&#8217;s revelations aligned. I had been right all along.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It seems like I wasn&#8217;t wrong, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be honest, it would have been easier to reveal everything, but it wouldn&#8217;t change anything for them if they knew it was a video game world. Besides, it was my private memory, something that only I knew, and it just felt wrong to talk about another world.</p>



<p>After a while, Ayana took a deep breath and then raised her voice with intense emotion.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not something that I shouldn&#8217;t have to bear… that! Those people said such terrible things to you, Towa-kun! I can&#8217;t stand it… How could I let the person I love be treated like that!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana rarely raised her voice like this. She only showed such raw emotions when something concerned me. When I had saved a little girl or helped Seina-san, she had worried about me too. This time, her emotions were even more intense.</p>



<p>&#8220;At first, Hatsune-san said terrible things to Towa-kun! Kotone-chan did the same when she met Towa-kun! Even my mother&#8230; And that accident happened because of Shu-kun&#8217;s carelessness, and he was laughing about it! There&#8217;s absolutely&#8230; absolutely no way I can forgive them!&#8221;</p>



<p>I apologize for the confusion. Here&#8217;s the corrected translation:</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ayana.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s eyes were filled with intense anger, and she glared as if she were looking at someone other than me. She spoke rapidly, and her shoulders heaved as she caught her breath. Sweat dripped from her forehead, and her composure had completely disappeared.</p>



<p>The eyes that gazed at me contained not only the anger she mentioned earlier but also a plea, much like the eyes of a child about to cry.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m sorry, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…?&#8221;</p>



<p>She widened her eyes in surprise when I suddenly apologized. Given the current situation, Ayana must be wondering why I was apologizing. There was a clear reason behind it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t notice it all this time. I didn&#8217;t realize it until you became like this… I&#8217;ve been basking in the happiness of having you by my side, but I haven&#8217;t truly seen you.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was a statement I could make because my soul had merged with Towa. I was Towa, and Towa was me. Therefore, Towa&#8217;s past was also my past.</p>



<p>Ayana shook her head, insisting it wasn&#8217;t true.</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, that&#8217;s not true! Towa-kun has always been watching over me!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>No, it was evident that Towa hadn&#8217;t been paying attention, considering Ayana&#8217;s current state. I had been selfish, enjoying the happiness of having Ayana by my side and neglecting to see the darkness she carried within her.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the end, I was just like Shu. I&#8217;ve been depending on your kindness all along.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong! Towa-kun isn&#8217;t anything like that guy!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana kept shaking her head, refusing to accept the words. The cheerful girl who was usually by my side had disappeared, replaced by the Ayana who vehemently denied everything I said.</p>



<p>(I feel terrible… I don&#8217;t want to see Ayana like this. Not like this…)</p>



<p>My heart ached, and I had a strong urge to embrace her, even stronger than before. But, I managed to hold myself back.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s different… it&#8217;s different! Towa-kun is…&#8221;</p>



<p>Pressing her forehead against my chest, Ayana finally raised her head. It seemed she wouldn&#8217;t give me any opportunity to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry… Towa-kun. It&#8217;s going to be fine! Please leave everything about those people to me. I will make sure they regret it… That&#8217;s why… that&#8217;s why!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She had finally disclosed her intentions, even if she hadn&#8217;t provided a detailed explanation. She was planning to take action behind the scenes to make Shu and the others regret their actions. It was likely a plan similar to the scenarios in the game, something Ayana was orchestrating and executing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Finally, you&#8217;re talking to me, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe Ayana didn&#8217;t even understand what she was saying.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s plan was likely to continue without ever telling me anything and handling everything on her own in secret.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not over yet.</p>



<p>Ayana will probably find a way to take action and persuade it. In the end, Ayana is a person with the power to do so, driven by her unwavering and heavy love for me. It&#8217;s embarrassing to say it myself, but it makes me happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s Ayana, you were probably planning never to talk to me, to finish everything on your own, and carry the burden of that event by yourself, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why…&#8221; </p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana seemed visibly shocked by how much I understood her feelings. Without dismissing her feelings as mere deception, I continued to express myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, there&#8217;s no need for you to do something like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>The moment I spoke those words, Ayana&#8217;s expression shifted from surprise to despair. Her biggest fear is my rejection. This reaction was her response to me denying her intentions.</p>



<p>While still gently stroking her head and maintaining eye contact, I began to recount the dream I had in the infirmary that day. </p>



<p>&#8220;Today, you know, I had a dream while I was asleep in the infirmary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A dream…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. It was about a future that would come to pass if I did nothing. It was an incredibly convenient dream, but I saw a future where you were suffering alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That… is…&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana seemed even more shocked. However, her reaction was different from what I expected. She didn&#8217;t seem to find the concept of the dream strange, and it appeared as though she had some inkling about it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but ask.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could it be that you also had this dream?&#8221;</p>



<p>Although it seemed impossible, I couldn&#8217;t resist asking. Ayana took a moment and then nodded in affirmation.</p>



<p>(Could there really be something like that? But considering how I felt about Ayana when I saw her after waking up, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a lie.)</p>



<p>Perhaps, this was another miracle that had touched Ayana&#8217;s heart. Nevertheless, it appeared that Ayana had a different perspective. I know it might be too strong to say this at this point, but Ayana was resolute.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so, even if you had such a dream, it won&#8217;t change anything! I don&#8217;t mind how much I suffer! I just want to live for Towa-kun&#8217;s sake&#8230; even if I&#8217;m in pain, as long as Towa-kun is happy, that&#8217;s enough!&#8221;</p>



<p>Upon hearing her words, something inside me snapped. I had never expressed such anger towards her, and the intensity of my emotions was overwhelming.</p>



<p>&#8220;WHERE&#8217;S THE GOOD IN ANY OF THAT, AYANA!&#8221;</p>



<p>She was startled by my outburst, and I firmly gripped her shoulders, an expression on my face unlike any she had seen before.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As evidence, Ayana had been continuously looking at my face, and her visible fear was quite apparent.</p>



<p>I continued to speak as words flowed out of me, as if I were expelling all the frustration I had been feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of world allows a man to endure seeing the girl he loves suffering? And to make matters worse, it&#8217;s because of his own actions! Imagine it from the opposite perspective, Ayana. How would you feel if I were working hard for your sake, only to get hurt in secret?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed that Ayana could imagine it, and she lowered her head once more.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t that right? Ayana must feel the same way, right? Her attitude is the proof. She was trying to do the same thing to me.</p>



<p>Even after speaking so strongly, Ayana refused to leave my side. We had never engaged in such exchanges before, and Ayana probably didn&#8217;t know what to do, so she clung to me.</p>



<p>I smiled and gently caressed her head as I continued,</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for speaking so strongly, but I needed to say it. You know, Ayana, you can be incredibly stubborn when it comes to me. It&#8217;s frustrating, yet at the same time, I appreciate it.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Are you… mad?&#8221;</p>



<p>I held her by the shoulders and looked into her eyes. She was still crying, but our recent conversation seemed to have softened her expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you hate me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate you. I welcome being strongly cared for by the girl I love.&#8221;</p>



<p>I patted her head and then gently placed my hands on Ayana&#8217;s shoulders.</p>



<p>We gazed at each other once again.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>Ayana was still crying, but her expression had softened thanks to our recent conversation. I thought to myself, &#8220;This is it,&#8221; and started to act to make Towa&#8217;s and my conversation a reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayana, today I want to overcome the sadness from my past right in front of you. And at the same time, let&#8217;s move forward together. Let&#8217;s not be trapped by the past but aim for the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I held a ball that I had hidden in the shade away from Ayana.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise at the sight of it. Well, it&#8217;s understandable that she was so surprised. If my memory serves me right, I haven&#8217;t touched a ball since I was discharged from the hospital, which must have been one of the reasons for her surprise.</p>



<p>(To be honest, even if you told me I was playing soccer, it wouldn&#8217;t have rung a bell… But now I know what to do… No, that&#8217;s not it. I know what I want to do.)</p>



<p>From there, I simply followed my instincts.</p>



<p>I placed the ball on the ground and skillfully balanced it on the tip of my toes, then began juggling it. It was a strange feeling, as if my body remembered the skill as if I had done it before. I was adept at controlling the ball, just like I had been in the past.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Alright! Ho! There!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I continued to juggle the ball, memories of the past flooded my mind—memories of the first time I met Ayana. I wanted to cheer up the downcast Ayana and did everything in my power to make her smile. I wanted to see that smile again, the one that was the beginning of my feelings for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… <em>sniff</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>While skillfully handling the ball, I glanced at Ayana, who was in tears. But her teary face wasn&#8217;t solely filled with sadness.</p>



<p>And then, I saw it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was smiling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, do you remember? How I tried to make you smile when you were on the verge of tears… I did this because I wanted to see you smile!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes… yes! I remember, of course… After all, that was when I first met you, Towa-kun!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I nodded as I continued to juggle the ball.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right… from that moment, our time together began, and we&#8217;ve shared so many moments since then. But this isn&#8217;t a story that ends somewhere—it&#8217;s a story that we don&#8217;t want to end. The story that started from our meeting continues to stretch on.</p>



<p>I stopped juggling and kicked the ball as I stood in front of the soccer goal. The reason I chose this place to spend time with Ayana was that it held so many memories, and the presence of a soccer goal felt symbolic.</p>



<p>As if this place was saying, &#8220;Use me,&#8221; everything was coming together perfectly, making it a suitable starting point for both Ayana and me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I still have remnants of sorrow and anger from that accident… It&#8217;s natural to have moments when I think, &#8216;Why did this happen to me?'&#8221;</p>



<p>The sadness and resentment that Towa held still smoldered within me. But isn&#8217;t it enough now? Even if I can&#8217;t change the past, I can overcome it. Let&#8217;s show that changing Ayana&#8217;s crumbling future is as simple as that.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, I&#8217;m going to overcome it! That&#8217;s why, Ayana, you should stop being trapped by the past here. Let&#8217;s overcome it together—because I&#8217;ll be just fine… So there&#8217;s nothing you need to carry in my place!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun…&#8221;</p>



<p>With Ayana&#8217;s watchful gaze fixed on me from behind, I focused my stare on the goal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;<em>&#8230;.</em>Fuuaa&#8221;</p>



<p>I took a deep breath to steady myself. It might seem like an overly simplistic notion or something too trivial, but for now, I needed to settle the negative emotions that had lingered in my heart. Because it was my own feelings that I held, and only I could deal with them.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m going for it… I can do this, Towa.)</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if he was still within me, but I sensed a presence nodding in agreement. I swung my leg, sending the ball straight into the goal with a powerful kick. </p>



<p>The ball sailed directly into the net, making a satisfying &#8220;swish&#8221; sound. It was a sensation I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time, and it brought a sense of freshness, as if something that had been clinging to me had been blown away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice shot.&#8221;</p>



<p>I nodded to myself; it was indeed a great shot. While I was self-praising, Ayana suddenly embraced me from behind, her arms wrapping around my stomach.</p>



<p>For a moment, I was surprised by the unexpected impact, but it was quickly replaced by overwhelming love for her. The euphoria of scoring that goal began to subside.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d never see Towa-kun playing again… Showing me that now, it makes me happier than anything. I really loved watching Towa-kun play soccer.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I feel the same… I loved seeing you and Mom cheering with your megaphone.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we reminisced about the past, I gently unwound her arms from my waist and turned to face her again. I held her, just like I had earlier.</p>



<p>(…I&#8217;m really happy. To hold the person I love in my arms like this.)</p>



<p>After holding Ayana for a while, I looked into her eyes once more.</p>



<p>&#8220;I said this before, but I&#8217;m really okay now. With this, I say goodbye to the sad past and the difficult times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… … … …&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Once again, Ayana… You don&#8217;t have to carry anything. You really don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But…&#8221;</p>



<p>Even after all I had said, Ayana still couldn&#8217;t bring herself to accept it. As I thought earlier, she was really stubborn.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle, thinking that I must look like the protagonist struggling to win over a stubborn heroine. Nevertheless, I continued to address Ayana earnestly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t carry it, don&#8217;t bear it. Ayana has always been like that, and I know it&#8217;s not something that can be easily discarded. So, I won&#8217;t deny those feelings… I&#8217;ll be there for you, constantly trying to heal those emotions.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, I will teach Ayana that there&#8217;s no need for past hatred or sadness. If one of us is happy while the other is miserable, that&#8217;s not the right way. It&#8217;s not either of us&#8230; We both have to be happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s meaningless if only one of us is happy. If we truly want the other to be happy, we must find happiness ourselves. I believe this is the way we can both be happy and truly hold each other&#8217;s hands for the future.</p>



<p>&#8220;I invited Ayana here today because I wanted to talk about this. And there&#8217;s one more thing I want to tell you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Is there more than this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course… Oh, but this one might be more important.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I hadn&#8217;t received an answer from Ayana yet, but I would let her hear what I had to say now and let her decide. What I was about to share was necessary to end our current ambiguous relationship and take a step forward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… So… well…&#8221;</p>



<p>Why am I getting shy now? I&#8217;ve been holding Ayana like this, said a lot of embarrassing things, and even had intimate moments… So why am I hesitating now? I took another deep breath and finally voiced the words.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it… I never really told you, did I? We&#8217;ve just sort of drifted into this relationship… So, let me say this… I love you, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>Honestly, this is a part where I should complain about the original me.</p>



<p>Originally, Ayana and I just went with the flow and didn&#8217;t properly communicate our feelings&#8230; Of course, we said we loved each other many times, but it was ultimately just words that went with the flow of the moment.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I made a real confession now.</p>



<p>This is my answer, after thinking about how to overcome the past and move forward.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…Towa-kun, you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a truly mysterious person, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, Ayana once again placed her forehead against my chest.</p>



<p>Her hug became tighter, conveying her strong feelings for me. </p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly… I didn&#8217;t expect all of this to happen. Not only did you notice the things I&#8217;ve been carrying all this time, but you also showed me the side of you that I wanted to see again. And on top of that, you said the words I wanted to hear the most.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana lifted her head and looked straight into my eyes as she continued,</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, I&#8217;m a terrible person. I wanted to make those people regret what they did, and I considered using Shu-kun&#8217;s feelings to further my own goals. I even thought about using people who had nothing to do with it as pawns. But with just your words, I wavered so easily. I&#8217;m a fickle person… But even with that, Towa-kun…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you. No matter what kind of person you are, I love you. I can say it as many times as you want—I love you with all my heart.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I firmly conveyed this, and Ayana nodded in response.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you too, Towa-kun. I love you so much it&#8217;s unbearable. No matter what happens, I don&#8217;t want us to be apart. That&#8217;s how much I love you. Even if you think I&#8217;m a heavy girl, I don&#8217;t mind. I love you that much.&#8221;</p>



<p>With Ayana&#8217;s sincere words and the feelings in my chest, I felt joy swelling within me. While we had expressed our feelings to each other many times before, the words we exchanged now held a different, deeper meaning.</p>



<p>As I gazed at Ayana, she gently closed her eyes. In response to her signal, I leaned closer to her and kissed her lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>We exchanged a kiss, then parted slightly and said our names, each kiss feeling like a confirmation of our love.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kisses really make you feel this happy, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, they do. I&#8217;ve always felt this way, but this kiss was even happier than any other time.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I agreed with her sentiment. Now, there&#8217;s just one more thing… One more thing I have to say.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you be my girlfriend? Will you go out with me? I want you to be with me from now on, always.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d like that. I want to be in a relationship with you… I want to be with you always.&#8221;</p>



<p>Having conveyed our feelings, I breathed a sigh of relief. Regardless of the complications and difficulties we might face in the future, I was content.</p>



<p>&#8220;A bit tired, aren&#8217;t you, Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… Let&#8217;s sit on the bench for a bit and take a break.&#8221;</p>



<p>I sat down on the bench with Ayana, just like we had done before. It was getting a little dark, but it seemed that Ayana had no intention of leaving. As a sign of that, she hugged my arm tightly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(&#8230;It&#8217;s really comforting. Just being together with Ayana like this.)</p>



<p>It was indeed comforting, but considering everything that lay ahead, I couldn&#8217;t help but think about how challenging it might be. However, I had a strong conviction that with Ayana by my side, we could overcome anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was lost in thought and accidentally used formal language.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu♪&#8221;</p>



<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be so absorbed in my thoughts with someone by my side, but for now, I hoped she&#8217;d allow it.</p>



<p>She placed her hand on her mouth, stifling a chuckle. &#8220;It&#8217;s unstable how you switch between speech patterns!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Geez! It just means I&#8217;m so happy!</p>



<p>In response to Ayana&#8217;s request, I leaned closer and kissed her again. We kissed as if trying to reduce the distance between us each time we broke apart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you… Ehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>To me, Ayana had always been cute, beautiful, and attractive from the beginning. But now, she seemed even more charming than before. I couldn&#8217;t help but be anxious, wondering if my fondness was becoming too evident on my face. Nevertheless, I considered this happiness I had finally grasped as one of my treasures.</p>



<p>Still, there was one thing that concerned me.</p>



<p>(Both in the game and in this world, Ayana was plotting to torment Shu and others, but could she really have achieved it all on her own?)</p>



<p>Though it had been mentioned in the fan disc that Ayana had arranged for a different guy for each heroine to compete over, it seemed unlikely that she could have orchestrated it all by herself. However, now was not the time to dwell on this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana called my name, and I turned my attention to her.</p>



<p>She gazed up at the sky, not meeting my eyes, making her look like a beautiful moon goddess. Although we had arranged to meet here in the late afternoon, it was already getting dark. It was about time to go home, but I wanted to talk to her a little longer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, you mentioned that the way I&#8217;m doing things is cruel. To be honest, I agree with you… What I&#8217;ve been trying to do is make Shu-kun despair by showing him the degradation of people who&#8217;ve become close to him, and in the end, I wanted to make him believe that I was never with him from the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>It felt strange to hear these words directly from her. Her words meant that she intended to cause cruel consequences, yet the atmosphere she exuded was so gentle that it didn&#8217;t make me fear her. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that Ayana would never really do something like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I still have feelings of not being able to forgive those people… But Towa-kun has been there for me, comforting me and saying that we should move forward together… So I will do my best to overcome those feelings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;From the beginning… From the very beginning, I didn&#8217;t need to bear it alone. But I had always thought, as strange as it may sound, that I could do it on my own. I had this conviction that I would definitely get my revenge on those people. Somehow, I just knew that I could. It&#8217;s puzzling.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes… It&#8217;s really strange.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps it was the will of the world that had made Ayana feel that way.</p>



<p>But still, because we&#8217;re living in this world, this is our reality, and that&#8217;s precisely why talking like this can change the future as much as we want.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana is my girlfriend… My girlfriend, huh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite that, when I acknowledged our current relationship again, it made me grin. Ayana chuckled and playfully poked my cheek with her index finger while saying,</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy too, so please contain yourself. Otherwise, my cheeks might get all loose and never return to normal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lucky, you know. You look cute even when you make that face.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, if you say that, Towa-kun, you&#8217;re still handsome, so it&#8217;s unfair.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>And like that, spontaneously, we both shared a laugh. This feeling was really, truly amazing. Even though being with Ayana was the same as always, there was a freshness and innocence to our current situation.</p>



<p>I mumbled softly, looking up at the slightly reddened sky,</p>



<p>&#8220;…I wonder if this is good for now… Phew.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps Ayana still wasn&#8217;t entirely reconciled like me… But it should be alright now.</p>



<p>I muttered that unconsciously, my voice barely audible, but Ayana seemed to have heard it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright. After all, there&#8217;s no way I would do something so foolish as revealing my plans to the person I love.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Does that mean you would have done it if it weren&#8217;t known?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Of course. It just shows how strong my feelings were!&#8221;</p>



<p>…Geez, her words may be wicked, but because she&#8217;s already at ease, it just makes her look adorable.</p>



<p>&#8220;You mischievous little devil.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, if you don&#8217;t punish me, I might do something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>I was running out of vocabulary to describe how adorable Ayana was. </p>



<p>After gazing into each other&#8217;s eyes for a while and sharing another kiss, we stood up to head back home.</p>
