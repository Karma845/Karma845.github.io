<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p><b>[Ayana PoV]</b></p>



<p>I, Ayana Otonashi, had a boy with whom I was very close since I was a little girl.</p>



<p>His name was Shu Sasaki, and he was the kind of boy who always followed me around.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take that long for Shu-kun and I to become friends, partly because our mothers were very close.</p>



<p>[Ayana, let&#8217;s play together!]</p>



<p>[Yes, sure.]</p>



<p>At the time, I thought Shu-kun was cute as he followed behind me, and I wondered what it would be like to have a younger brother.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>It was surprisingly early in elementary school that I began to realize that such a world of me, my mother, Shu-kun and his family …… was a very small one.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t mind taking care of Shu-kun myself, and if I had no particular plans, it had become the norm, so I didn&#8217;t mind &#8211; however, if it didn&#8217;t go on forever.</p>



<p>[Where are you going? You can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve already talked to Shu-kun&#8217;s mother about you going to him.]</p>



<p>[Eh? But I promised to play with my friends. ……]</p>



<p>[You&#8217;ll have to do that next time. Your childhood friend Shu-kun is more important, right?]</p>



<p>[But ……]</p>



<p>[Do you understand?]</p>



<p>[…… yes]</p>



<p>I had nothing planned, which is why I had made plans to hang out with my friends.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But my mother told me to cancel it and go to Shu-kun, and in the end I couldn&#8217;t disobey her.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my friends laughed at me and said it couldn&#8217;t be helped, but I was really sorry.</p>



<p>[….. What is a childhood friend?]</p>



<p>Even though I was in elementary school, I had such a question.</p>



<p>People around me had said many things about me growing up faster than normal kids, and I thought to myself, now that I think about it, that may indeed be true.</p>



<p>And it was here …… that I began to question the existence of childhood friends.</p>



<p>[Ayana is Shu-kun&#8217;s childhood friend, so put him first.]</p>



<p>[Shu-kun is a good boy, right? That&#8217;s why Ayana should get along with him.]</p>



<p>Every day I go to Shu-kun&#8217;s house to spend time with him and his sister and return home to finish the day.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>On days when school is in session, I head home to wake him up and we head to school together, side by side.</p>



<p>If I think about it, all of these things were just me doing what my mother told me to do, without thinking about it.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here, Ayana-san. Will you become Shu&#8217;s wife?]</p>



<p>[Ayana, let&#8217;s do it! Onii-chan&#8217;s wife!]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t you two talk nonsense!]</p>



<p>I watched with a somewhat cold heart the scene of their group happy-dancing unfolding before my eyes, in which my mother joined in and happily talked about the future.</p>



<p>[….I]</p>



<p>I was fed up with my mother who always said &#8220;Shu-kun, Shu-kun&#8221; in everything she did.</p>



<p>I was also depressed that his mother and sister would praise me for taking care of Shu-kun, lifting him up in a way that was unimportant to me. …… And above all, I began to think that even Shu-kun, whom I had thought was cute not so long ago, was a bother to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Yes, I began to think that all of them around me were unpleasant.</p>



<p>[Who am I…… What am I?]</p>



<p>What am I? I wanted to shout that to someone.</p>



<p>I wanted someone to tell me,…… I wanted to ask anyone who would listen about the existence of Ayana Otonashi.</p>



<p>But as a young girl, I could only keep them bottled up inside, and before I knew it, I was putting on a masked smile for them.</p>



<p>[Ayana and I have a lot of fun together.]</p>



<p>[I see. Me too.]</p>



<p>[Hey, hey, Ayana-chan. Come play with me, too!]</p>



<p>[Yes. What shall we do?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[Ayana, are you already learning to cook? That&#8217;s amazing.]</p>



<p>[Thank you.]</p>



<p>When I was dealing with them, I felt comfortable when I started thinking of myself as if I were a stranger.</p>



<p>I am not an individual, and I can simply play the role of Ayana Otonashi that they want me to play without thinking about anything else.</p>



<p>If I nodded my head in agreement with what they said and did nothing to disobey them, they would not complain.</p>



<p>Only I know what I really think, and if I build a wall inside and outside myself like this, no one can step inside me …… and my world was protected in that way.</p>



<p>[You love that manga, I see!]</p>



<p>[Yes, yes! It&#8217;s so funny!]</p>



<p>[I wish I had a cool boy like that by my side!]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[You call them childhood friends? I think it&#8217;s great!]</p>



<p>At the time, there was a popular girls&#8217; manga, the title of which I don&#8217;t remember.</p>



<p>My friend used to tell me that she couldn&#8217;t get enough of the sweet and sour, exciting, and sometimes painful experiences they went through to get together with their childhood boy friend.</p>



<p>[Is that so? Sounds interesting]</p>



<p>In the end, I didn&#8217;t borrow any manga from my friends after that, but it was more convenient for me &#8212;- I didn&#8217;t feel anything about the manga they talked about.</p>



<p>[…… Childhood friends are not a nice thing.]</p>



<p>I disliked manga that depicted romance with childhood friends.</p>



<p>The only thing I could see about the opposite sex who were devoted to their childhood friends was that they were just dolls without wills performing prescribed actions, and I never felt any good about the cool childhood friend guy that everyone liked.</p>



<p>When I read those kinds of stories, I even think twistedly that she was brainwashed at an early age to like her childhood friend.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[What is a childhood friend?]</p>



<p>That has always been my life&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>And if there is one thing I can say about my days, it is that my childhood friend was a &#8220;curse&#8221; for me. ……</p>



<p>However, there was one day when I reached the limit of my patience.</p>



<p>[Ayana, today, too, at Shu-kun&#8217;s house&#8212;]</p>



<p>[No! I won&#8217;t listen to you anymore!]</p>



<p>[Ayana!?]</p>



<p>I tried to remain indifferent and thought I could live with the walls in my heart.</p>



<p>But my heart was not as strong as I thought it was, and I resisted for the first time, not even caring that my mother would be angry with me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The reason why I ran away while crying to a nearby park is probably because I was afraid to go far away by myself.</p>



<p>[Gusu,…… I …… don&#8217;t want to do this,…… I …… don&#8217;t want to do this!]</p>



<p>I sat on the swing and just kept crying, alone.</p>



<p>Even if I continue to cry like this, the tears will soon dry up and I will return to those people of my own accord. …… My little resistance is only for this moment, and my heart still grows cold when I think that I will give up and accept that the days will return as usual again.</p>



<p>[What are you doing alone? Your eyes are really red, are you crying ……?!]</p>



<p>But that day was different.</p>



<p>That day was a turning point in my life that changed everything for me, a day I will never forget.</p>



<p>[Uhm, …… what am I supposed to do in a case like this?]</p>



<p>A dazzling light shone on my world that I thought nothing would ever change.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Yes, it was him ……Towa-kun appeared in front of me.</p>



<p>[……You are……uuuu!!]</p>



<p>[I should not cry! Uhm…… Ukaaaaaaa!!]</p>



<p>This was the first contact between me and Towa-kun, and I&#8217;m sure I embarrassed him to no end.</p>



<p>I was in a park where no one was there except for me, and from Towa-kun&#8217;s point of view, he must have been in trouble because he was concerned about a girl who was crying alone there and started crying even more when he approached her.</p>



<p>[Uhm, …… this is what I do in these situations!&#8217;</p>



<p>[……Ah!]</p>



<p>As I continued to cry, Towa-kun clumsily patted my head.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to do, but I could tell that he was trying to cheer me up in a way that somehow came to mind, so I naturally stopped crying, even though I was surprised.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[What&#8217;s happened to you?]</p>



<p>[…. actually.]</p>



<p>I told him honestly what had happened.</p>



<p>It must have been a very difficult story for Towa-kun. It was a terrible thing to discuss such a thing with a man of his age in the first place.</p>



<p>When Towa-kun heard what I had to say, he crossed his arms and groaned, as if it were already difficult for him to do so.</p>



<p>[….You have had it hard]</p>



<p>I would have laughed now, but I was still a small child at the time, so I was about to cry again.</p>



<p>Towa-kun became very panicked when he saw me teary-eyed again and scurried around to see what he could do about it.</p>



<p>And then he looked at the thing that made him yell out, and that was the soccer ball he was rolling around with his foot as he walked into the park.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[Hey, look what I found.]</p>



<p>[Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Towa-kun said and started lifting the ball.</p>



<p>I also watched TV, so I knew that what he was doing was a technique to control the ball without dropping it on the ground.</p>



<p>But I had only seen celebrities do it on TV, and I had never seen it up close like this.</p>



<p>[Yotoh! Ho! That&#8217;s it!]</p>



<p>[Waa! Amazing, amazing]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know much about soccer, but what Towa-kun was doing seemed amazing to me, and I knew that he was desperately trying to cheer me up, so I was very happy.</p>



<p>Towa-kun never dropped the ball on the ground for a while after that, and when he finished with a cool pose at the end of the game, I involuntarily applauded.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[So cool! That was awesome!]</p>



<p>[Haha, thank you! But it&#8217;s not as big a deal as it is with adults in general.]</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s not! It was really cool!]</p>



<p>[…..Hehe, thank you!]</p>



<p>Thinking back, this was the first time I had talked like this with a boy other than Shu-kun.</p>



<p>The freshness of a different world spread through my chest, and something inexpressible filled my heart.</p>



<p>[I have a place to go now, do you want to join me?]</p>



<p>[Yes! I want to go!]</p>



<p>With a nod of my head at Towa-kun&#8217;s suggestion, I was no longer thinking about Shu-kun or my mother.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Towa-kun held my hand and took me to many places, but the one that left the biggest impression on me was the game center.</p>



<p>[Uncle, I&#8217;m interrupting!] [TL: This is the Uncle she was referring to]</p>



<p>[S-sorry for interrupting….!]</p>



<p>[Hey, Towa buddy, is this your girlfriend?]</p>



<p>I wondered if the man in charge of the arcade was an acquaintance of Towa&#8217;s, and from the moment I met him, I could sense that they got along so well that they were even exchanging light banter like that.</p>



<p>The atmosphere was friendly, as if they were father and son, and their stories were funnier than I had imagined, and I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.</p>



<p>[She laughed at you because you&#8217;re an idiot.]</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t want to be called an idiot by a toe-wagging boy, now?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[My mom called you an idiot too.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[Mimi-chan, how terrible of her!]</p>



<p>[Fufu…..Ahaha!]</p>



<p>It was a really breathtaking exchange.</p>



<p>Towa-kun made fun of him, and he reacted, and I laughed at him, and he blushed as if he were embarrassed,…… and it was really fun.</p>



<p>[…….There&#8217;s all kinds of stuff out there.]</p>



<p>The game arcade was an unknown place for me.</p>



<p>Perhaps, but I believe that not many elementary school students, and girls, come to these places.</p>



<p>There were many things I did not understand, but I played with all my might for about an hour while Towa-kun taught me many things.</p>



<p>[…..Ah]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But the time of fun comes to an end.</p>



<p>When I saw the clock on the wall, I thought it was time for me to go, so I told Towa-kun that I had to go home.</p>



<p>I was so happy to see him, and he said he would take me home as an apology for taking me around.</p>



<p>[….So warm]</p>



<p>The warmth of Towa-kun&#8217;s hand that held mine again, I selfishly did not want to let go of his hand.</p>



<p>[…..]</p>



<p>I also noticed at this time that the warmth coming from his hand was making me nervous.</p>



<p>My house will soon be in sight, and at that time, Towa-kun took something out of his pocket and handed it to me.</p>



<p>It was a bear keychain …… that, let me put it this way, looked pretty ugly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[I took this earlier when Ayana was absorbed in a game. You can throw it away if you don&#8217;t want it.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not throwing it away!]</p>



<p>I accepted the key chain and held it to my chest.</p>



<p>This is not the first time I have received a gift like this, but even so, the gift I received from Towa-kun was warmer than anything I have ever received before.</p>



<p>[Thank you, Towa-kun!]</p>



<p>[….Ou]</p>



<p>Towa-kun was very cute and shy as he scratched his cheeks, and I was very thrilled to see him like that.</p>



<p>It was very sad to think that my time with him, whom I met for the first time today, would soon come to an end, and although I wished that this time would last longer, it was impossible.</p>



<p>[….]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My and Shu’s mothers were panicking in front of my house.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure she was looking for me, but she would definitely get angry if I headed over there now. ……Towa-kun gently held my hand again, as I couldn&#8217;t take a step forward.</p>



<p>[It will be fine. Let&#8217;s go]</p>



<p>[……Yeah.]</p>



<p>I nodded to Towa-kun, who smiled at me and said it would be all right, and headed for my mothers.</p>



<p>Shu-kun and Kotone-chan ran up to me when they saw me, and the mothers who had been watching them followed suit.</p>



<p>[I am sorry. I took Ayana around unintentionally. We had so much fun playing together.]</p>



<p>Towa explained the situation.</p>



<p>It really should have been all my fault, but these words from Towa-kun were like saying it was his fault, and my mothers glared at him as if they thought it was Towa-kun&#8217;s fault that I was gone.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[T-that&#8217;s&#8212;]</p>



<p>I tried to say in a loud voice that I was wrong, but Towa-kun stopped me.</p>



<p>He whispered to me again that it was okay, and then looked back at the mothers, who were much bigger adults than he was.</p>



<p>As expected, the mothers did not want to yell at Towa-kun, who was in elementary school, and nothing was said at the time, but after returning home, they nagged me to never see Towa-kun or play with him again.</p>



<p>[Towa kun…..was cool]</p>



<p>When Towa-kun defended me in front of my mothers, I thought it was really cool.</p>



<p>I was about to end my day with a different feeling than usual as I touched the key chain given to me by Towa-kun and thought back to today&#8217;s encounter.</p>



<p>Shu-kun and Kotone-chan seemed to be saying something to me, but it didn&#8217;t cool my heart.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun, when can I see you again?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I left Towa-kun without deciding how we could meet or where we could meet, or even where we could meet.</p>



<p>I was wondering if we would ever see each other again, but it turned out to be a groundless fear.</p>



<p>[Eh? Ayana-san?]</p>



<p>[Towa-kun?!]</p>



<p>I had no idea that we had gone to the same elementary school.</p>



<p>So, the story of Towa-kun and I began from this point, and we would spend a lot of time together.</p>



<p>Shu-kun would join us, and the three of us would always spend time together.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>The things that Ayana told me about her past were things that I really didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>I wondered how small the world was for Ayana, the time she had spent with Shu and his family since she was a child, and the way even her mother had forced her to do things.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry for talking about the past for so long, even though you know about it to some extent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know….right&#8221;</p>



<p>I was not surprised that she said that.</p>



<p>I was indeed stunned by her story, but for some reason my mind took it in stride and processed the information.</p>



<p>It was as if my mind had convinced itself that this was indeed the truth and that I had known it from the beginning.</p>



<p>(……? This is ……)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I listen to Ayana&#8217;s story, and as I hold her in my arms now that I have finished listening, a certain memory comes up in my mind.</p>



<p>It was what Ayana had told me earlier, and my encounter with Ayana came back to me vividly.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Aah right. It really was.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, my memories came back to me, but they were transformed into my life&#8217;s experiences.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that it was someone else&#8217;s memory, it became mine to the point that I was convinced that it had always been my memory.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>I am me, and yet, as I said before, I certainly feel as if something is linked with Towa.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why I feel more protective of Ayana than ever before.</p>



<p>I want to keep an eye on her, and I want her to smile like she does now, from the bottom of her heart.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>I put my hand on her cheek.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know why I decided to do that, but when she saw my hand on her cheek, her eyes were moistened as if she was anticipating something.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I honestly thought of them as nothing more than characters in a game,…… and no, there&#8217;s still a little of that.</p>



<p>However, I am not the only one who is moving with a will, and these women are human beings living in this world, no different from me.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>You really are a cute little girl, you know that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Hahiii!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her expression changed from one to the other, and she was really cute.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that she was my favorite character from the time I was playing the game, but still, when I look at the girl Ayana Otonashi again, that&#8217;s the impression that comes to mind.</p>



<p>(….I don&#8217;t seek the meaning of being reborn in this world. But the only thing I want to do now is, I don&#8217;t want to make this girl …… Ayana cry)</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve been thinking about the meaning of my rebirth into this world for a long time.</p>



<p>I was thinking that there must be some meaning to it, but because I was sure that if I went on like this, it would surely be the same as the ending of that game, I was thinking that I would lead her to a happy ending.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m Towa Yukishiro,…… but I&#8217;m not just a character that shapes this world. Then I will do what I want to do. I want to protect the beings I want to protect with my own hands. I want Ayana to keep smiling.)</p>



<p>And if I could be selfish about one more thing…… I would like to stay with this girl</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…..I see&#8221;</p>



<p>When I think about it, this may be the first time I have felt such a strong desire to be by her side.</p>



<p>Of course, to a certain extent I am being influenced by Towa&#8217;s consciousness, but this is the first time I have strongly wished to be by her side on my own volition.</p>



<p>After staring at Ayana for a while, I decided to calm down a bit and went to the refrigerator to get a drink.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… This.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was still in the same position, however, and I was able to face my feelings, which seemed to take my mind off things.</p>



<p>I tried to stand up, but I stupidly broke my knees and fell, pushing Ayana down with me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry Ayana…..?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I immediately apologized and looked for something suspicious about her, but a touch on my right hand stopped me in my tracks.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It felt so soft and warm in the palm of my hand. …… So my right hand was placed on Ayana&#8217;s ample bosom.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>Let go hand, I thought, but my hand wouldn&#8217;t leave Ayana&#8217;s chest.</p>



<p>When my hand touches her chest like that, even the thumping of her heart can be felt through my palm.</p>



<p>It may be a strange thing to think about at a time like this, but it made me think that she is after all alive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, I want you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said that much and I huffed.</p>



<p>I corrected myself and tried to move away from her, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t the right thing to say after pushing her down in an accident, but …… I still didn&#8217;t want to move away from her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana had been blushing and looking unusual earlier, but when she heard my words, she tangled with me using all of her hands and feet.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Towa-kun. Please do whatever you want to me without thinking about it right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s expression was very sexy when she said that.</p>



<p>I was so excited to see Ayana&#8217;s face, and I could not help but notice that she had a very gentle and receptive expression on her face, as if she was trying to embrace me.</p>



<p>I brought my face close to Ayana&#8217;s lips as she stared at me, and dropped a kiss on those soft lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Un…..Chuu&#8221;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t remember what it was like in my previous life, but this is definitely the first time I&#8217;ve kissed a girl in my life.</p>



<p>I am sure that the slightly salty taste along with the soft texture is because Ayana was crying all the time just a while ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit salty, maybe because you were crying?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… It&#8217;s because of that thing that happened. Towa-kun made me cry, so please take responsibility♪&#8221;</p>



<p>I laugh at Ayana who has blocked my escape route by asking me to take responsibility.</p>



<p>To be honest, there is still a lot for me to know, and most importantly, there are probably more hidden things between me and Ayana.</p>



<p>But for now, I just want to love the girl in front of me.</p>



<p>I lay my body on top of Ayana&#8217;s, driven by the love for her that overflowed in my heart, and following my own feelings of wanting to protect her.</p>



<p>After some time, we were naturally naked and embracing each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Fufu&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I knew I liked doing it this way.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ehehe, Ayana laughed and I stroked her head.</p>



<p>I thought she was like a cat as I watched her narrow her eyes pleasantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;You look like a cat, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A cat? Nyaa~n♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, did that work on you? Did I find a new area to explore?</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call it a new area to explore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s smiling face is just so enthusiastic, but I chuckle and think, well, that&#8217;s the same for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Akemi is still not home yet, huh?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;She said she was going to be a little late. I think it will be another hour or so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Then we can stay like this a little longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana buried her face in my chest again.</p>



<p>I was a little surprised to see Ayana&#8217;s naked body, but when I looked at her face again ……, I was honestly impressed with her style, which is both beautiful and erotic.</p>



<p>We hugged each other for a while and then decided to get dressed and wait for my mom to come home.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>While we were relaxing together like this, Ayana suddenly asked me this question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could you please try to call me by every possible name you can think of?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Eh? …… sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was puzzled by the question, which was more cryptic than meaningful, but I followed her words and tried to say what I would call Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana,…… Ayana-san,…… Ayana-chan,…… honey?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Pfft!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh!&#8221;</p>



<p>I know &#8220;Honey&#8221; was a bit too much, but please don&#8217;t laugh!</p>



<p>Ayana said she was sorry, but her shoulders were shaking, and it seemed that my words had hit the nail on the head.</p>



<p>She laughed more than I expected and was on the verge of giggling, but Ayana took my hand and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun has always been like that. You never call me &#8220;you,&#8221; you know? I know you might say I&#8217;m just being self-conscious, but even the way you call me makes me feel like you think I&#8217;m important, and that makes me happy.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah~…… no, you can&#8217;t call a girl &#8216;you&#8217; like that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if they were very close, but it was impossible for me to say &#8220;you&#8221; to a girl as close to me as Ayana.</p>



<p>I asked a similar question a while ago,……, but I guess Towa-kun never changes, right? You&#8217;ve always been so kind to me,……, and I&#8217;ll always love you for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana then kissed me on the cheek.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that there was probably no deep meaning to the question she had just asked me, I was still happy to hear Ayana say so in response to my own answer.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s bask in the afterglow for a while longer.</p>



<p>Feeling her presence close by.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p><b>[Shu Pov]</b></p>



<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>After school, I was helping Iori-senpai with her work again.</p>



<p>I was about to finish it when I felt something that I can&#8217;t describe in words, but in the end I couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.</p>



<p>Iori was tilting her head at me, but soon took her gaze away from me to concentrate on the rest of her work.</p>



<p>After a while of silence, we both finished our work for the day.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu, good work, Shu-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;No, no, good work, Iori-senpai.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Fufu♪&#8221;</p>



<p>When I told her this, for some reason Iori-senpai smiled happily.</p>



<p>As I was thinking that Iori-senpai is still a person who smiles beautifully, Iori-senpai looked straight into my face and said this to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I call you, you look like you&#8217;re in trouble, but when the work starts, you concentrate on it and help me until the end. I think you&#8217;re wonderful like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….Thank you&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt the heat building up in my cheeks when she told me I was nice.</p>



<p>To tell the truth, as Iori-senpai just said, it is true that I feel that it is troublesome, but I do not dislike the fact that she relies on me like this ……Because I am rather happy, I want to live up to her expectations as much as possible.</p>



<p>(…… though I also have a bit of a sense of superiority)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Iori-senpai is adored by many students as the beautiful student council president at this school.</p>



<p>It was no surprise that she was adored by the guys, and I heard from her that she had received numerous confessions of love from guys.</p>



<p>While many people are attracted to Iori-senpai in this way, I feel a sense of superiority in the fact that she depends on me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>I left the student council room with Iori-senpai and headed for the entrance.</p>



<p>It is already reasonably dark, and the only people in the school are the students who are outside doing club activities and the teachers who are still in the staff room.</p>



<p>Ayana and Towa should have already left, so I am alone today.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu-kun, since we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s hold hands.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Why? Before I could even ask such a question, my hand was in hers.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t bear to look away from Iori-senpai, who was holding my hand and staring at me intently, but Iori-senpai was looking at me and giggling.</p>



<p>This person is always like that… it bothers me like this, it bothers me… but I didn&#8217;t mind having her treat me like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is your heart pounding?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu….Does that mean I have a chance?&#8221;</p>



<p>Iori-senpai is always saying such things that make me nervous.</p>



<p>To tell the truth, I don&#8217;t even know why she thinks so highly of someone like me. It&#8217;s because I am not a match for a beautiful woman like Iori-senpai.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I once asked her why she cares about me so much, and here&#8217;s what she said.</p>



<p>[If you go out with me, I&#8217;ll tell you, but what do you want to do?]</p>



<p>Would I go out with Iori-senpai? I remember that I was naturally attracted to her words, but from the way she looked at me, I thought she was absolutely joking, so I said okay then.</p>



<p>(No matter how far I go, I&#8217;m just a normal human being… I just don&#8217;t have any redeeming qualities.)</p>



<p>Towa would tell me not to be so down on myself, but even so, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be able to fix this personality of mine unless I have a lot of problems.</p>



<p>I am aware that I have low self-esteem and that I look down on myself too much, but I have always been like this, so I can&#8217;t easily fix it.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s true that Iori-senpai is a beautiful woman,……, but I like Ayana. She is always by my side. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t have that kind of relationship with Iori-senpai.)</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a guy too, so I sometimes get carried away by Iori-senpai&#8217;s sweet words. But I still love Ayana.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to give up on her, she&#8217;s been by my side all this time and I&#8217;m going to make her happy from now on. …… Yes! I&#8217;ll make her happy!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Iori-senpai, we should move quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</p>



<p>I was thinking about Ayana, and I wanted to see her so badly.</p>



<p>Just as I was thinking about stopping by Ayana&#8217;s house once before going home, I heard a voice behind me that was not mine and Iori-senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Mari?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew it was Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Mari, a junior, who called my name and came running up to me.</p>



<p>Compared to the more mature Iori-senpai, Mari is a boyish, slender looking girl who is more often described as cute and pretty than beautiful.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Are you leaving now, too? Can I join you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure. Shu-kun, is it okay with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure. Shall we go home together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mari replied happily and cheerfully and got in line next to me, but then she quickly closed the distance between us and took my arm.</p>



<p>As if to counter Mari&#8217;s shy but happy smile, Iori-senpai also let go of my hand that was holding hers and closed the distance even more as she hugged my arm.</p>



<p>(…… soft)</p>



<p>I almost feel my nose stretch out at the discreet and loud touch.</p>



<p>As if to put up at least a semblance of resistance, I somehow managed to mend my expression and did my best to bluff that I wasn&#8217;t aware of anything in particular.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Uchida-san, aren&#8217;t you getting a little too close?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Honjo-senpai, aren&#8217;t you too close? Please move away from him.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two of them were fighting each other as if they were competing for my attention.</p>



<p>If Ayana saw me in such a moment, she would misunderstand me, and I was thankful that she was not by my side for now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t want you two to argue too much with me in between.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….Right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course&#8221;</p>



<p>I said this, and they both stopped arguing.</p>



<p>I let out a relieved, if slightly disappointed, breath as they not only stopped arguing, but also let go of my arm that was holding me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of feelings the two of them have for me. But I wonder if this is what it feels like to have people fighting over me, and I am a little troubled.</p>



<p>(…..I&#8217;m so self-conscious!)</p>



<p>I&#8217;m ashamed of myself for thinking like a harem hero.</p>



<p>No matter how much Iori-senpai and Mari may like me or appeal to me, I have Ayana …… So don&#8217;t get weird expectations of me, Shu Sasaki!</p>



<p>I was in the midst of putting myself to the test in my mind when Iori, looking at Mari, said something like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the connection between you and Uchida-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to answer, but Mari answered first.</p>



<p>&#8220;I often run on weekends and holidays. I met Ayana-senpai when I used to run as well, and she introduced me to Shu-senpai. I&#8217;ve always been devoted to club activities, so I really enjoyed talking with the two of them. …… ehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I listened to Mari&#8217;s words, I too was remembering those days.</p>



<p>That day was an ordinary day off and I was just lounging around at home, but Ayana contacted me and asked if I wanted to meet her now.</p>



<p>I was so nervous when I first met Mari that our conversation was awkward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Told you, Shu-kun, Mari is a good girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>By having Ayana follow up and interact with Mari as well, I was able to get to know her as well as I do now.</p>



<p>The two of us have been meeting more and more often without Ayana, and sometimes I accompany Mari on her runs. …… Of course, I couldn&#8217;t keep up with her stamina and gave up early on.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a coincidence, isn&#8217;t it? It was thanks to Otonashi-san that I met Shu-kun, and it was thanks to Otonashi-san that I met Shu-kun, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It is true that it was thanks to Ayana that I was able to get to know Iori-senpai as well.</p>



<p>When we had class discussions, Ayana would often take the initiative in leading the group and organizing the opinions of everyone.</p>



<p>Ayana asked me to accompany her to the student council office, and that&#8217;s where I met Iori-senpai.</p>



<p>（I already heard about Iori-senpai, but I had the impression that she was a cold and scary person.)</p>



<p>At the time, I was scared because of that, but thanks to Ayana, who is good at dealing with people, being by my side, we became friends in the same way as I did with Mari.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how I became friends with Iori-senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, I guess Otonashi-san is the Cupid between us, Shu-kun.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true! …… Well, Shu-senpai doesn&#8217;t seem to notice me at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want you two to stare at me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>They looked at me, flustered, not knowing how to react, and both of them let out a sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Not good&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not good indeed&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did I do something wrong?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but to make a loud comment.</p>



<p>It was loud and the two of them apologized for making fun of me too much, but it was nothing to apologize for. ……</p>



<p>I have gotten to know them both through Ayana and have become good friends with them, and I can say without a doubt that they are a very big part of my life.</p>



<p>(I don&#8217;t dislike it, in fact, I love it.)</p>



<p>The days I spend with Ayana and Towa, and the days I spend with Iori and Mari are really important to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Well, after all, I feel most at ease when I am by Ayana&#8217;s side ……I guess?</p>



<p>Then I wondered if it was wrong that I was thinking about Ayana, and I noticed that Iori-senpai and Mari were giving me indescribable stares.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8216;No, I just thought that Otonashi-san is a formidable opponent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true. Ayana-senpai is too strong!&#8221;</p>



<p>Why did Ayana&#8217;s name come up there……</p>



<p>Although I felt as if she had read my mind, there is no doubt that in a way I am always thinking about Ayana.</p>



<p>She understands me so well because we have spent our entire lives as childishly familiar people.</p>



<p>She is always smiling next to me, and her smile is truly my treasure.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;……I love Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>I whispered so that the two of them could not hear me.</p>



<p>I may get laughed at for saying it this way, but I can tell that our parents are close to each other.</p>



<p>Ayana has been by my side all this time without a single look of disapproval, so I&#8217;m sure this thought will reach her. …… so I&#8217;m sure it will be fine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s right, Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Otonashi-senpai is the same, but Yukishiro-senpai is also amazing, right!&#8221;</p>



<p>I nodded my head.</p>



<p>Thinking back, this was the first time Mari had asked me about Towa, and I was about to answer whatever she asked me, as long as I knew what she was talking about.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I had a chance to talk to him before, but there was something I couldn&#8217;t ask him at that time. Yukishiro-senpai is a very good soccer player, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike Iori-senpai, who reacted as if she was interested, I felt as if a shadow covered my heart.</p>



<p>Towa is my best best friend,……, but even so, the topic of soccer between us is kind of a taboo.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was in junior high school, I went to a different school, but I still remember that there were rumors that he was a very good soccer player. However, I heard that he had an accident and was seriously injured and had to quit playing soccer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although she asked me if I knew the details of that time, I could not immediately answer Mari&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>Because that incident was …… no, it was already over.</p>



<p>Even Towa forgave me, and it&#8217;s over!</p>



<p>[I guess that means these things can happen. Don&#8217;t worry too much, Shu, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;re okay.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>See, even Towa in my memory says so ……, so it&#8217;s okay.</p>



<p>But still I decided to muddle my words to Mari.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d …… go that far either. I&#8217;m sure it must be frustrating for Towa, and I don&#8217;t think you should pry too much into it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I concluded that this would probably be better for Towa.</p>



<p>The two women did not ask me any deeper questions about this topic after hearing my words, and they soon moved on to other topics.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Phew&#8221;</p>



<p>I was relieved that Towa&#8217;s topic was over.</p>



<p>Keeping a calm demeanor while conversing with them, I thought to myself that Towa is my best friend.</p>



<p>Yes, …… Towa is my best friend.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>(But the truth is ……)</p>



<p>I was …… jealous of Towa, my best friend, who can do anything.</p>



<p>I was very envious of Towa, who was good at studying, good at sports, had many friends, and got along very well with Ayana.</p>



<p>I envied him for having everything I didn&#8217;t have, but at the same time I was jealous.</p>



<p>[…Eh?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, but you won&#8217;t be able to make the tournament, and soccer might be difficult.]</p>



<p>When I accidentally overheard words coming from Towa&#8217;s hospital room and saw the dumbfounded expression on Towa&#8217;s face through a small gap, I couldn&#8217;t help but think, &#8220;Serves you right.&#8221;</p>



<p>But that was not my true intention, it was just my jealousy that drove me.</p>



<p>Still, I laughed and giggled at the sight of Towa on the bed, devastated by the painful reality of his situation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>(At that time, I certainly did laugh at Towa. And at that time, I also felt a slight sense that someone else was there.)</p>



<p>Maybe someone saw my laughing face at that time. ……</p>
