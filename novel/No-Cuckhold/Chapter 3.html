<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Ayana-neechan, is that you?&#8221;</p>



<p>The voice I heard from behind me made me turn around.</p>



<p>There was a girl, a little younger than us, about the age of a junior high school student.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Kotone-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana mentioned her name Kotone, her full name is Kotone Sasaki, and as her surname suggests, she is Shu&#8217;s younger sister.</p>



<p>She had a black bob cut, a worn-out school uniform, and was small in many ways, which is something I can&#8217;t say too loudly.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve only seen her a handful of times since I became Towa, but personally, she was not someone I wanted to see much.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing so close to our house?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She took her gaze away from Ayana, looked at me, and said coldly.</p>



<p>The reason I didn&#8217;t want to see her that much was because, as her attitude showed, Towa seemed to be hated by Shu&#8217;s family …….</p>



<p>I am sure Towa gets along well with Shu, but why he doesn&#8217;t get along with his family is something that is not mentioned in the game and I don&#8217;t know anything about.</p>



<p>And one more thing: she has a major role to play in this world.</p>



<p>(Kotone Sasaki, the cuckold heroine in the younger sister category)</p>



<p>Yes, she is another girl who, like Ayana and Iori, leaves Shu.</p>



<p>Kotone loves Shu very much, and Shu also loves her very much, so they have a very good relationship.</p>



<p>However, even she has a tragic fate awaiting her.</p>



<p>I was about to think about what was going to happen to Kotone when I felt a sharp pain in my head and held my temples.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Nothing, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana, who was next to me, had worried enough to make her scream more than she usually does, but the pain went away quickly and I told her I was fine.</p>



<p>For now, I will say goodbye to Ayana for today.</p>



<p>I knew that if I stayed here any longer, Kotone would probably just curse at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana just took me shopping.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I told her this, Kotone looked at me as if I was looking at trash.</p>



<p>I smiled at her and asked myself how much she really disliked me, but then I turned my attention back to Ayana and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then. I really appreciate your help today.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah …… yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Smiling at her at the end, I walked past Kotone, soothed and healed by her smile.</p>



<p>But as I passed by, she said this to Ayana as she approached her, in a voice loud enough for me to hear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-neechan, it must have been a disaster for you. You were forced into this, right? He looks like a womanizer, and you should stay away from him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana will never be sympathetic to this.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think I deserve to be told that much either, but I already have my suspicions about Towa, so in a way it sounds like a good argument, which is sad.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I don&#8217;t know why Towa and Shu are such good friends and yet he is such a bad friend with that family.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I remember that in the game there were depictions of Shu coming to visit Towa&#8217;s house, but never the other way around.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..I have no idea.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I wondered if there was something that wasn&#8217;t depicted in the game and that was the reason why Towa never went to Shu&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, what the heck, why bother?&#8221;</p>



<p>I went home right after that because I thought I was keeping my mom waiting.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am home~&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome home, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>I opened the front door and walked in, and my mom greeted me.</p>



<p>I was able to learn about Towa&#8217;s family relationships in the game, but now that I had been reincarnated, I was able to learn about the unknowns.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m late. Ayana helped me with the shopping.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. You really are good friends with Ayana.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When I told her that I was with Ayana, she laughed cheerfully.</p>



<p>She is almost in her forties, but she looks so young and beautiful that one might believe her even if she were in her twenties.</p>



<p>Akemi Yukishiro, that&#8217;s her name.</p>



<p>Go ahead and take a bath first. Dinner will be ready as soon as you get out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>After that, I finished my bath and ate dinner as my mother told me to.</p>



<p>I told her that I had gone shopping with Ayana, and most of what we talked about was about Ayana.</p>



<p>I managed to get through some questions that were difficult to answer, but when I got back to my room, I sat down in my chair and took out my notebook because I had something I wanted to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well…Frankly, I know it&#8217;s a waste of time, but I&#8217;ll try to organize the information again. …… But first, I&#8217;ll send a thank-you message to Ayana.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I picked up my phone and sent a thank-you note to Ayana, then turned my attention back to the notebook again.</p>



<p>As I said before, this is about organizing information, so I decided to write down as much information as I could remember about this game in my notebook.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… So what was really going on with Ayana today?&#8221;</p>



<p>Like the fact that she called me master, and the way she closed the distance between us when we were alone, it&#8217;s obviously too much to think that there&#8217;s nothing going on, to be honest.</p>



<p>There is certainly something I don&#8217;t know about, but it&#8217;s odd that I&#8217;m now trying to believe that Ayana&#8217;s attitude is normal and that nothing is wrong with it.</p>



<p>Because I&#8217;m being pulled by Towa&#8217;s body, I&#8217;m afraid I won&#8217;t be able to question things like this before long…</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;m going to write it down anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>With pen in hand, I write down what comes to mind in my notebook.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu Sasaki, Ayana Otonashi , Iori Honjo, Kotone Sasaki …….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;ll write down some of the details along with the names of the people I&#8217;ve met most recently.</p>



<p>There is nothing of particular interest in between, and there is no information that would make one&#8217;s head spin.</p>



<p>As for Shu, the main character is the same as in any other story, and as for Ayana and the others, the only things that come out are their styles, personalities, what they like and what they don&#8217;t like.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way there&#8217;s any information about [I Was Stolen From Everything] in this world.</p>



<p>Naturally, there is no official website for the game in this world, but I was able to recall the introduction of the characters rather vividly.</p>



<p>I smiled as I recalled my memories and felt a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>I suddenly realized that the pages of the notebook I was writing in had quickly become covered with words.</p>



<p>I chuckled, thinking that I was concentrating too hard, and as I looked at the letters, my thoughts began to wander.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t have anything to say about Shu. Well, that&#8217;s not how it is for the protagonist of an erotic game.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>There really isn&#8217;t any remarkable information about Shu, and on the contrary, it&#8217;s quite refreshing to see.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s exactly the same with regard to the heroines, Iori and Kotone, and the other two I have yet to meet in this body of mine are similar.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… So this is what Ayana looks like.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wrote about Ayana in her introduction.</p>



<p>I was surprised to find out that I was able to write this one word for word exactly the same as what was written on the official website.</p>



<p>&#8220;She is Shu&#8217;s childhood friend and neighbor. Her appearance is good-looking and her personality is kind, and she is popular among her classmates. She and Towa get along well, as does Shu, and are often seen going to and from school together. Ayana has extraordinary feelings for Shu, and is looking for an opportunity to confess them to him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Extraordinary feelings ……huh. That&#8217;s how much it&#8217;s officially known that Ayana has strong feelings for Shu.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then I knew that her attitude towards me was strange no matter how I thought about it.</p>



<p>I put down my pen and folded my arms, trying to think of anything I could remember, but all that came to mind were Ayana&#8217;s expressions and gestures as depicted in the game.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[Shu-kun, I&#8217;m going home with you today, okay?]</p>



<p>[Shu-kun, you&#8217;re really no good without me. Here, please be firm.]</p>



<p>[Shu-kun, do you like me ……?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ll always love you……always……]</p>



<p>The Ayana in my memory is really all about the beautiful expressions on her face.</p>



<p>In Shu&#8217;s daily life, where nightmares gradually invaded his life, she was the only one who kept cheering him up by his side without really changing.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I guess that&#8217;s my favorite scene.&#8221;</p>



<p>I recall as I slowly sink into the sea of memories.</p>



<p>I think the best of all is that scene.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Although Ayana eventually walks away from Shu, there were a number of scenes that I recall liking it. Among them, that scene may be the best.</p>



<p>This must have been rather early in the story. It was also a scene that showed how well they got along after being together for so many years.</p>



<p>The scene shows Ayana talking with Shu one day after school, with the evening sun in the background.</p>



<p>[What do you want to do in the future, Shu-kun?]</p>



<p>[Well, …… I think I&#8217;ll just stay with Ayana for now.]</p>



<p>The moment when Ayana looks down at the courageous words of Shu.</p>



<p>She looked up and giggled, probably out of embarrassment, and replied to Shu.</p>



<p>[You never change, Shu-kun. You always say such things …… Fufu, no matter what kind of person I am, Shu-kun, you would feel that way about me?&#8221;</p>



<p>[O-Of course! No matter who you are!!]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I remember the corners of my mouth rising as I felt the vibrations of a romantic comedy, which is unbecoming of an erotic game.</p>



<p>At that time, there was no description of anyone leaving Shu&#8217;s side yet, and there was nothing disturbing in the girls&#8217; personal perspectives either.</p>



<p>And most importantly, Towa was also in the position of being a really great best friend.</p>



<p>[Shu-kun, I am not the good girl you think I am. There are things I can&#8217;t say, things I hide, just like anyone else. Even so, I really like you for saying that you would accept me.]</p>



<p>[…..!]</p>



<p>The two ended their exchange with these words, but if one thinks about it, Ayana&#8217;s line of dialogue at that time gave one a lot of things to think about.</p>



<p>Ayana was a kind and independent girl.</p>



<p>She was the kind of girl who always came when Shu called her and was the first to notice when he was in pain and comforted him…….</p>



<p>[When everyone else moves away, Ayana asks me to come to a nearby park.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>No matter how hard it was, Ayana would always be there for him.</p>



<p>The music was warm and cheerful, not to mention that it was a moment of hope not only for Shu, but even for those of us who played the game.</p>



<p>However, it was also that scene that shattered such expectations.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun is the only one I want ♡ I don&#8217;t need that shy and pathetic childhood friend ♡]</p>



<p>The destructive power of that line was like a hail of bullets.</p>



<p>She had been gentle, but now she had a disheveled expression on her face as if she was melting with pleasure, and she was expressing joy with her whole body at Towa&#8217;s body slamming into her.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Well, the ending was certainly unsalvageable, but I&#8217;d still like to play it again to clear my memory in various ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>That wish has already come true, though.</p>



<p>After comparing the reality and the Ayana in my memory for a while, I found that there were no major new revelations, so I wrote down as much as I could remember about myself &#8212;- about Towa Yukishiro.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…..Something like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>{He is Shu&#8217;s best friend and a reliable male student for Ayana. He is a popular person among both men and women because of his looks and personality and is looked up to by his classmates as much as Ayana is. He used to play soccer until the second year of junior high school, but for some reason he quit and is now a homecoming club member.}</p>



<p>As I stared at this sentence, I then looked at my own face in the mirror.</p>



<p>A handsome man who is so good-looking no matter where I go, even the face that I&#8217;m struggling with now is tinged with a melancholy that would make him attractive to women.</p>



<p>When I first started the game, I could not imagine Towa as a cuckold character from his standing picture and introduction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, he&#8217;s a cuckold! I am so surprised.&#8221;</p>



<p>I can vividly remember that time.</p>



<p>I was thinking about this when I remembered that Towa used to play soccer, but it didn&#8217;t seem to make any sense, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious about a certain circumstance, but …… hm~mm.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I told myself not to worry about it, so what am I going to do about it?</p>



<p>But, I don&#8217;t know why, but when I thought of the word &#8220;soccer,&#8221; I felt an indescribable pain in my chest.</p>



<p>In the end, it was only for a moment, so I didn&#8217;t care after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;After that, there&#8217;s Mari Uchida, a junior, and Hatsune Sasaki, Shu&#8217;s mother. …… Seriously, there&#8217;s nothing useful hereeeeeeeeeeeee!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I scratched my head and screamed loudly.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my voice didn&#8217;t seem to have reached my mother, which was a relief, but I already had no energy left to think.</p>



<p>I decided to fold up the paper with the information and keep it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll take that as a yes. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be seeing it again.&#8221;</p>



<p>I chuckled as I said this and put my hand on the drawer of my desk to see what I thought.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It was not something I was really conscious of, but as if my body naturally moved, I opened the drawer and took out an album.</p>



<p>&#8220;An album, huh.……Heh&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked inside and found a photo of young Towa, Shu, and Ayana.</p>



<p>For me, this is the first photo I&#8217;ve ever seen, and this is another one I&#8217;ve never seen in the game at all.</p>



<p>I was so fascinated that I didn&#8217;t expect to see such a picture of Shu and Ayana when they were young, and I was so absorbed in the album that I started to flip through it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahahah, This one is rare.&#8221;</p>



<p>What caught my eye was a picture of the three of us playing soccer.</p>



<p>Ayana was about to kick the ball and probably kicked it in the air and fell down on the ground, and Towa and Shu were looking at her and laughing as they held their stomachs.</p>



<p>[Mou, stop laughing already, you two!]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>For a moment, I thought I heard a young voice of someone.</p>



<p>I glanced around and wondered if I was imagining things, but then I wondered if it might be a memory from the past that had seeped into Towa&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana……huh&#8221;</p>



<p>I have no memories of my past with Ayana.</p>



<p>Even so, looking at the photos like this made me feel nostalgic, and perhaps because I saw the photos like this, I wanted to hear her voice.</p>



<p>Something led me to pick up my phone and tap Ayana&#8217;s contact information.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Wha oi!?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Since it was already past ten o&#8217;clock after much thinking and looking at pictures, I thought it might be a nuisance to call her at night, although it was possible that she was not yet asleep.</p>



<p>I tried to hang up the phone as soon as I heard the ringing, but the first call connected me to the other party.</p>



<p>[Hello, Towa, can I help you?]</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ehh, ……I&#8217;m sorry for calling you so suddenly, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana answered the phone so quickly that I was quite surprised.</p>



<p>I thought about the possibility that Ayana might have been thinking about calling me, but I chuckled, thinking that it was not a quirk.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s totally fine. Actually, I was wondering whether I should call Towa-kun. Because of the way we parted like that.]</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah~&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It was certainly not a pleasant way to part.</p>



<p>Well, I still don&#8217;t know why Kotone hates me so much, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to find out, although I&#8217;m curious.</p>



<p>[Fufu, I was wondering whether to call you or not, but I was also thinking that maybe Towa-kun would be the one to call me. I guess my wish came true♪]</p>



<p>&#8220;…..&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s words just made my cheeks hot.</p>



<p>How can this girl say such embarrassing words so easily, and most of all, does she know how much those words make my heart beat with joy?</p>



<p>I know that in Ayana&#8217;s case, these words are not calculated, but are sincere and genuine.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking on my own.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Yes.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;So when I decided I&#8217;d had enough for today, I grabbed my phone and unconsciously made a call to Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt a little embarrassed after saying it, but well, I meant it.</p>



<p>After I told her that, Ayana fell silent for a while, and while I was wondering what was going on, I heard something flapping around.</p>



<p>[Mou Towa-kun! I&#8217;m so sorry, but is Towa-kun on the other end of the phone right now!! If you&#8217;re by my side, I&#8217;ll squeeze you as hard as I can!!]</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s …… too bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Yeah! The distance between us is troubling.]</p>



<p>Ayana is probably lying on her bed right now, talking on the phone.</p>



<p>I thought the earlier flapping sound might have been her feet slamming against the bed, but it was a rather cute and endearing sight to see Ayana making such a childish gesture.</p>



<p>&#8220;……, Ayana.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[Yes, what is it?]</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t see her face, but I feel like she is smiling and laughing gently, wanting me to say anything.</p>



<p>I was thinking lightly that it would be okay to say something a little racy, though somehow, really somehow, I was saying something like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next time we meet, can I hug you as hard as I can?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Of course you can! If it&#8217;s Towa-kun, you&#8217;re always welcome!]</p>



<p>Although I felt embarrassed after saying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… haha, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>I simply replied.</p>



<p>[Yes♪]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I heard another loud flapping sound.</p>



<p>Apparently, Ayana gets excited, or perhaps she has a habit of flapping her legs to dissipate her happy feelings when she reaches her limit.</p>



<p>But I see …… next time I see her, I can hug her as hard as I want.</p>



<p>(Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m now in this body, but even the smallest thing with Ayana makes my heart sing or makes me very happy. Does that mean I&#8217;m Towa Yukishiro after all?)</p>



<p>I sighed as I thought about Shu.</p>



<p>I was glad that Ayana was not in front of me when I was in such an ambivalent mood, but I enjoyed chatting with her for a while after that.</p>



<p>Then, around eleven o&#8217;clock, I began to think that it was time to end the call.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun.]</p>



<p>&#8220;……What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s voice took on a serious tone.</p>



<p>I was surprised at the change in her voice, which I could sense even through the phone, but I waited patiently for Ayana to tell me what she was going to say.</p>



<p>Then she told me something like this.</p>



<p>[I love you no matter what kind of person you are. It was not out of pity or sympathy that I offered my love to Towa-kun at that time. I offered it to you because I wanted to be by your side and support you.]</p>



<p>&#8220;……That&#8217;s&#8221;</p>



<p>What on earth is Ayana talking about? What is she saying?</p>



<p>As I was thinking about the meaning of those words, suddenly the headache I sometimes feel in this body hit me again.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t that bad, but it was as if the pain was trying to drag something out of the back of my head.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… what is this?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>[Towa-kun?]</p>



<p>The memory that came back to my mind became an image and I saw it.</p>



<p>Ayana was defenseless, and Towa was wrapped around her, as if he were attacking her, but while Towa&#8217;s expression was very painful, Ayana had a beautiful smile on her face, as if she was ready to accept everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..I-I&#8217;m sorry. I was a little sleepy and spaced out.&#8221;</p>



<p>[We certainly talked a lot.]</p>



<p>Ayana was giggling and seemed to be really enjoying herself.</p>



<p>I was so caught up with Ayana that I couldn&#8217;t help but smile, and since she pointed out that I was sleepy, I thought it was a nice touch and told Ayana that I was going to bed.</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t want to. I want to talk to you more…… Is it not good?]</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Really, this girl …… I let out a small sigh and we both made up our minds that we should go to bed today.</p>



<p>&#8220;l see you at school tomorrow, okay? So let&#8217;s call it a day.&#8221;</p>



<p>[……I understand.]</p>



<p>Well, I made the call and this is what happened.</p>



<p>After that, I managed to finish the call while staying with Ayana, who was reluctant to hang up the phone until the very end.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Fuuu&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt as if I had just finished a job, but it was very satisfying to be able to exchange words with Ayana.</p>



<p>When I talk to her, something inside of me starts to seek out Ayana, as if whispering to me that I don&#8217;t care about Shu, but I&#8217;m thinking there must be some meaning to this feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah, I think I&#8217;ll go to bed for now. I&#8217;m too sleepy.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;m going to be in trouble if I&#8217;m late tomorrow because I&#8217;m thinking about it too much.</p>



<p>I lay in bed and looked at the darkened ceiling of my room and wondered what I should do, but sleepiness got the better of me and I soon fell asleep.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>This is a story of another world.</p>



<p>A man is sitting in front of his computer. The man was not happy …… to see the ending of the game he had just played, but he was lamenting.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… what the hell is this game? No, I knew that? But to bring Ayana&#8217;s fall scene to the very end? How devilish is this game!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man complained as he silently stared at the staff roll, but then he decided to dive into the Internet to write about his impressions of the game after completing it.</p>



<p>The man found a certain thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fan disc for &#8220;[I Was Robbed of Everything] …… Ayana&#8217;s Story?&#8221;</p>



<p>What the man found was a fan disc that could be called a sequel to the game he had been playing until now.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He was curious about it, but the game he was playing was a cuckold game, and he had suffered a certain amount of emotional damage, so he was not very interested in getting his hands on the sequel to that game.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s relive her story that wasn&#8217;t depicted in the main story …… is that one anyway, right? It&#8217;s an in-depth look at Ayana, who only had one sex scene, right? How could I possibly want to see any more scenes of Ayana&#8217;s intense corruption!&#8221;</p>



<p>To be honest, the truth behind Ayana, the beautiful heroine who had always been by the hero&#8217;s side, was quite traumatic.</p>



<p>Well, it is only one&#8217;s own responsibility to get emotionally scarred by playing this kind of genre of game, but still, the girl Ayana was so heroine that men would go so far as to say so.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Well, I won&#8217;t buy it, but I&#8217;ll have a look.&#8221;</p>



<p>But he still wanted to see something new.</p>



<p>The man himself had no intention of buying the fan disc, so he jumped to the page to at least see what people thought of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Amazing, that&#8217;s a really high rating……..&#8221;</p>



<p>The higher the number, the better the rating.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Most of the reviews were on a five-point scale, which means that the people who played this fan disc were very satisfied with its contents.</p>



<p>At this point, regardless of spoilers, he wanted to know the details of this high rating, so he decided to look at the reviews in order from the top to the bottom.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>I was curious about this story because it was not depicted in the book, so I bought it. What can I say, ……It was amazing. I was surprised to see how different the viewpoints are, and how much my impression changes when I delve into the events that were not depicted in the main story.</em></li>



<li><em>If you have any feelings at all about Shu, don&#8217;t buy it. It&#8217;s really not redeeming and above all, it will change your impression of Ayana.</em></li>



<li><em>The only thing I can think of is that the story is not about the girl who is a cuckold, but about the girl who is a goddess. ……</em></li>



<li><em>Poor juniors and seniors who were caught in the middle because they were close to Shu. But I&#8217;m satisfied because I got out of it.</em></li>



<li><em>Is this the heroine who is cuckolded in the main story? It&#8217;s just pure love.</em></li>



<li><em>I&#8217;m just scared of Ayana. But I wanted to have a girlfriend like her. Where can I meet her?</em></li>



<li><em>I didn&#8217;t think the soccer setting would play such a role. Towa, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about. Be happy with Ayana.</em></li>



<li><em>I feel like a new world opened up for me. I think there will be no more stories where the heroine who is cuckolded in the main story is portrayed as the main character in the fan disc. The story was great and so were the erotic scenes.</em></li>



<li><em>It&#8217;s a shame that her mother was overlooked because of Ayana&#8217;s mercy. As a lover of M*LFs, I wanted a scene with Ayana&#8217;s mom.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Etc.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I see?&#8221;</p>



<p>The man who muttered this with a clear face slowly moved the cursor to the purchase button.</p>
