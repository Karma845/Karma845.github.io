<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>&#8220;…Heh, so there was a setting like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a room now shrouded in darkness, a man sat at his desk, muttering to himself. His gaze was fixed on the computer monitor in front of him, displaying a certain website.</p>



<p>The site contained discussions and developer comments about an adult PC game titled &#8220;I Was Robbed Of Everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was quite a sensational game in its time. Playing it doesn&#8217;t reveal everything, so having it all summarized like this is quite helpful.&#8221;</p>



<p>On his desk lay the packages for both the main game and the fan disc of &#8220;I Was Robbed Of Everything.&#8221; Living alone meant he could leave such games out in the open without concern.</p>



<p>&#8220;…What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>



<p>He spent the next few minutes scrutinizing the site.</p>



<p>What became clear, once again, was that there were events in the game only involving Towa and Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>To anyone who played the game, this fact would be evident, but the developer&#8217;s comments provided further clarification:</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a story from Ayana&#8217;s perspective, so the fan disc contains a significant amount of content involving Towa. However, in our concept, Towa only gets involved with Ayana. There are no heroines like Iori or Mari among Ayana&#8217;s close friends. If Ayana were to become friends with them, she would also be unsure about what she should do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, he nodded in agreement. </p>



<p>In the main story, aside from that, the fan disc goes into great detail from Ayana&#8217;s perspective. By unraveling the past between the two of them, there may be no room for clemency when it comes to Kotone, Shu&#8217;s younger sister, and his mother, Hatsune. </p>



<p>But, when it comes to Iori and Mari, who were inadvertently drawn into Ayana&#8217;s quest for vengeance, it&#8217;s honestly hard not to feel sympathy for them.</p>



<p>Sympathy… no, it&#8217;s more like they&#8217;re truly pitiable.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s because she was driven by the desire for revenge that Ayana focused solely on that. The sorrow that may come from the vengeance she orchestrated for Towa was completely overlooked, and all she cared about was bringing it all to an end.]</p>



<p>To eliminate any obstacles for Towa&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>Ayana used whatever things were necessary to destroy the family itself, including Shu, and even Iori and Mari, who were close friends, became part of the cogs and performers in her revenge play.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…Ayana&#8217;s formidable side was depicted entirely, but if Towa were to find out, he&#8217;d surely put a stop to it. The more you play the fan disc, the clearer it becomes… Towa is an incredibly kind person.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man continued to read the developer&#8217;s comments.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s our shared understanding that aside from Ayana, Towa doesn&#8217;t have much interaction with anyone else. He might have a few conversations here and there, but if he were to get close or seem to be having fun with Ayana&#8217;s friends, he&#8217;d surely cause Ayana to hesitate.]</p>



<p>When he read that comment, the man could easily imagine such a scenario.</p>



<p>The fan disc was Ayana&#8217;s story of revenge but also depicted her internal struggles so intensely that he couldn&#8217;t help but feel deeply immersed in it.</p>



<p>As an outsider watching the story, he had thought endlessly about making Towa aware of Ayana&#8217;s feelings. He truly liked Ayana as a character and wanted her to find genuine happiness.</p>



<p>[Ayana always prioritized Towa, and she loved him dearly. It was pure, straightforward love that drove her, and that&#8217;s how she could endure even when her heart was breaking. As people often say, we&#8217;re not thinking about future stories… or alternate scenarios. Please, in your own imaginations, let them find happiness.]</p>



<p>With that, the developer&#8217;s comments came to a close.</p>



<p>It was already decided that there would be no sequel, let alone an alternative story, as per the official announcement. The disappointment was evident in the online community&#8217;s reactions.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The man sat in a daze for a while but eventually moved his mouse and launched the fan disc&#8217;s files.</p>



<p>The first image that appeared was of Ayana, wearing her familiar black hood, under a pitch-black sky with eyes that didn&#8217;t shine even a glimmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still hazy… the more I get to know this character, the more I wish she had found happiness. Even if nothing had happened, she would have ended up with Towa. There would have been some struggles with Shu, but it wouldn&#8217;t have been insurmountable. Ayana would choose Towa over Shu, and Towa would choose Ayana… that&#8217;s all it would&#8217;ve been.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana on the title screen remained still, but if you gazed at her for a while, it seemed as if she was shedding tears.</p>



<p>Then, the man played the game again, almost as if he were immersing himself in memories.</p>



<p>There were many moments that made him chuckle, and as long as he didn&#8217;t think about Shu, Towa and Ayana were all smiles.</p>



<p>However, the story continued to progress, with suspenseful moments when Towa almost encountered people who would have caused him distress.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun, should we go this way?]</p>



<p>[Eh? Oh, okay.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, thanks to Ayana&#8217;s advance notice, Towa was able to lead peaceful days.</p>



<p>He never had any contact with Kotone and Hatsune, who had verbally abused him in the past. There was also no interaction with Ayana&#8217;s mother, who indirectly uttered derogatory remarks.</p>



<p>Not only from Ayana&#8217;s perspective but also from Towa&#8217;s, there was really not much interaction with the other heroines. So, whatever happened to them, Towa wouldn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ah, it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>



<p>After watching Towa and Ayana&#8217;s lovey-dovey moment, the ending showed them walking towards the light. The man continued to watch silently, and as Ayana&#8217;s figure disappeared, Towa&#8217;s monologue began.</p>



<p>[In my arms, there&#8217;s Ayana, always smiling. Looking at that smile, it makes me happy. But… was this really the right choice?]</p>



<p>Those words disappeared like fleeting moments, and the next sentence appeared.</p>



<p>[I was the one who she acted for, but what truly shattered her heart… was that I couldn&#8217;t realize it. I might have been the one who took away that gentle girl from myself.]</p>



<p>If Towa had realized… it was as if this function, inserted as a playful gesture by the developers, was his heart&#8217;s cry.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>After gazing at the screen for a while, the man let out a sigh.</p>



<p>He leaned back in his chair, resting against the backrest, and muttered softly.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I were Towa… well, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;d do anything so heroic. But I guess I&#8217;d still move for Ayana, even if I didn&#8217;t understand a thing. Haha, it&#8217;s pointless to think like this, but it&#8217;s okay to entertain these thoughts, right? After all, it&#8217;s a story that made me feel this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t implying he could replace Towa, but he wanted to save Ayana nonetheless. Feeling this level of empathy for characters in a game might seem strange, but it was a testament to how much he loved this story.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"/>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to doing this. My shoulders are a little stiff.&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered this while massaging my shoulders.</p>



<p>We had been working in the student council room earlier. Even though I had gotten used to it to some extent in the latter part, doing something I didn&#8217;t usually do was tiring. However… to put it simply, I had enjoyed that time.</p>



<p>It was still part of our duties and not just play, but working together with someone was undoubtedly part of the typical student life, and it was truly a pleasant experience.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most significant reason was that she was by my side.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I suddenly glanced toward her, and she looked up at me. Our gazes met, and though she seemed surprised for a moment, she soon smiled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was just thinking that I had fun during that time earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu. It was sort of a coincidence that we ended up doing this, but… yes, it was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>She mentioned it was fun, but Ayana still had a somewhat gloomy expression. She quickly put on a smile again, not wanting to worry me. Her smile was cute, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think it was better not to ask.</p>



<p>Since Shu had gone with Iori and Mari, there were just the two of us. Now would be a good time for us to have a serious conversation that we couldn&#8217;t have at school.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, can we talk for a moment?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. What&#8217;s on your mind?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She smiled sweetly and agreed, but I couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that something was bothering her.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to see her like this, so I decided to take her hand and lead her to a nearby cafe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome! Just the two of you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please have a seat over there. When you&#8217;re ready to order, just let us know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following the waitress&#8217;s instructions, we headed toward a table further inside.</p>



<p>We looked through the menu while we waited and decided to start with some tea and cake. While waiting for our order, we engaged in light-hearted conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here it is!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Our order arrived, and we stopped our conversation to enjoy the flavors.</p>



<p>The tea was perfectly sweet, and the cake tasted excellent. Ayana was savoring her dessert too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, may I try a bit of your chocolate cake?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. Shall we exchange a bite of that strawberry shortcake too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>



<p>We cut our cakes into bite-sized pieces and shared them with each other.</p>



<p>After finishing our cakes and sipping some tea, we both settled in for a moment. I gazed directly at Ayana and broached the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Is there something you&#8217;re not telling me? Something you&#8217;re carrying inside?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>She gazed at me intently and tilted her head slightly.</p>



<p>She had a genuinely puzzled expression, which, because she looked good in any expression, even in one that emphasized her pure curiosity, appeared attractive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, you&#8217;re… always smiling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m with Towa-kun. Every day is fun, and I&#8217;m happy… under those circumstances, I don&#8217;t have any expressions other than a smile. Well, I&#8217;m still a human, so it&#8217;s a bit much to say that I don&#8217;t have any other expressions besides a smile.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.…&#8221;</p>



<p>She giggled, her shoulders shaking slightly.</p>



<p>Her expression seemed genuine, just like the smile she always showed, but there was something different about it. Even though it was supposed to be my favorite smile, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice a shadow in her smile.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Ayana really genuinely able to smile from the heart?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Fumu&#8221;</p>



<p>The way I was asking was delving even deeper into her inner thoughts. But Ayana didn&#8217;t appear disturbed or concerned in the least; instead, she placed her hand on her chin and took my question seriously.</p>



<p>&#8220;From the bottom of my heart, I can truly smile, you know? Look, does the smile where Towa-kun says I&#8217;m cute seem fake to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, Ayana broke into a broad smile.</p>



<p>Honestly, it was vexing, but I had no choice but to wholeheartedly agree with her words, and I had an intuition that this was indeed a smile from her heart.</p>



<p>Was I overthinking it? No, there was no way I was overthinking it. That&#8217;s what I believed.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Observing Ayana as she smiled sweetly, my heart felt not only cleansed but also the thought of wanting to gaze at this smile forever filled my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun? What&#8217;s really going on? The serious expression on Towa-kun is lovely, but I don&#8217;t want you to make a complicated face in a place like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right…&#8221;</p>



<p>That was the silent plea behind the pouting Ayana, who was clearly signaling that she didn&#8217;t want any heavy conversation in this cozy cafe. So, I apologized.</p>



<p>This way, no matter how much I asked, Ayana wouldn&#8217;t answer. And perhaps most of all, I was beginning to doubt if it was just a misunderstanding on my part.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I&#8217;m going to the restroom for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, take your time.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got up from my seat and headed to the restroom.</p>



<p>While taking care of my business and washing my hands, I looked at myself in the mirror. The reflection staring back at me clearly showed my discontent at not getting a satisfactory answer from Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Am I rushing too much? What do you think, Towa?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I asked that question, the reflection of me in the mirror, of course, remained silent and gave no response.</p>



<p>I kept staring, but nothing changed, and time just passed by. I chuckled at my own thoughts and then returned to Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back. What should we do now? Ready to leave?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right. We&#8217;ve had our cake and tea.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, after paying the bill, we left the cafe. I had been observing Ayana subtly during our time there, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything unusual. Maybe I was just overthinking it. </p>



<p>Haa&#8230;..What a ridiculous thing to do, only to be noticed by Ayana, who is sensitive to such matters.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, how about going to that shop on our next day off? There&#8217;s a little item I want to check out, and I&#8217;d also like to get a small present for Akemi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing. I&#8217;ll make sure to clear my schedule for it.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>While replying to Ayana, I let the thoughts from earlier come back to mind.</p>



<p>The moments when Ayana interacted with Iori and Mari, and how she seemed to enjoy it.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s seemingly reluctant reaction to Iori&#8217;s advances was quite amusing. Her gentle expression when she looked at her cute junior who was struggling with how to be more like her was also quite lovely.</p>



<p>&#8220;And also… Towa-kun? What are you grinning about?&#8221;</p>



<p>See, I knew this would happen. Well, at least she didn&#8217;t see me worrying. Instead, she saw me grinning foolishly, which is also embarrassing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, I wasn&#8217;t thinking anything perverted or anything like that. I was just thinking about what happened in the student council room earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Again? It was indeed fun, but… Ah, now I can&#8217;t help but remember when Iori-senpai fondled my br*asts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah… I had a bit of a reaction.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>There wasn&#8217;t a scene like that when I was watching them, but I saw…Shu&#8217;s face turned red.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to see that… What kind of expression are you making?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, just kidding. Anyway, since we&#8217;re here, shall we go find a quiet spot for a bit of touching time? I won&#8217;t mind at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make it sound like you&#8217;re flaunting it! I mean, we were talking about br*asts!&#8221;</p>



<p>By the way, we&#8217;re in a crowded public area, so it&#8217;s not the place for this kind of conversation.</p>



<p>After we laughed for a bit, we both regained our composure and started walking.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Kuku&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ufufu.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>We both chuckled for a while, and then we continued walking after our laughter subsided.</p>



<p>During that time, we didn&#8217;t exchange a single word, but the atmosphere was far from uncomfortable. In fact, the silence was strangely comfortable.</p>



<p>As we walked together, I suddenly stopped. Matching my pace, Ayane naturally halted and looked up at me, waiting for my next move.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s like this. What I asked you earlier was, in a way, a kind of resolution for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A resolution?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; </p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to protect Ayane&#8217;s smile, and after seeing you having fun in the student council room, that feeling has grown stronger.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since there were still people around, we moved to a quieter spot. Even though we shifted, the evening streets were bustling with people, and there was no escaping the crowd.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>We positioned ourselves at the edge of the road, and I faced Ayane directly.</p>



<p>&#8220;You see, I really… I love seeing you smile. Not just in front of me, but like the way I saw you being friendly with the Student Council President and even with Mari earlier… It&#8217;s a precious sight. In today&#8217;s terms, I guess it&#8217;s something like &#8216;teehee&#8217; or something?&#8221;</p>



<p>Teehee… It&#8217;s a trendy phrase these days, right?</p>



<p>As I thought that it would be a good phrase to use in such a situation, there were no words coming from Ayane in response. </p>



<p>I began to wonder if I had missed the mark, but when I looked at her, she seemed somewhat dazed.</p>



<p>She appeared to be taken aback, as if I had conveyed something unexpected or surprising to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayane? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>She stammered and seemed dazed.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8230;.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Ayane?&#8221;</p>



<p>She lowered her gaze and took a step back, as though distancing herself from me. It almost felt like rejection. I reflexively reached out to her but then pulled back.</p>



<p>I began to doubt if I had done something wrong or said something inappropriate. I revisited our recent conversation in my mind, but I couldn&#8217;t pinpoint any obvious cause for her reaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayane&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>I might be misunderstanding something, but the way she distanced herself from me hurt like a sharp blade piercing my heart. It was as if a heavy, suffocating atmosphere filled the space between us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… I…&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayane lifted her head, but her expression remained somber. The awkward silence lingered when, just then, someone appeared, seemingly to break the tension.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>&#8220;Osuu~! I knew I saw Yukishiro-kun and Otonashi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Waving from a little distance away was Aisaka-kun. He was in his uniform, so he must have just finished a club activity. He approached us with a smirk.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? It&#8217;s not that unusual to see Yukishiro-san and Otonashi-san together, but were you on a date by any chance?&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka-kun playfully nudged my shoulder, which irritated me slightly, but he quickly realized that he might be intruding if it were a date and hastily apologized.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to apologize, don&#8217;t bother interrupting in the first place.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, really… You know, I&#8217;ve been so caught up with practice lately. I haven&#8217;t had much time to hang out with friends, and then I saw you two. I just felt like saying hi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that all it is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just that… Yeah.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In response to my question, Aisaka scratched his head.</p>



<p>Ayana is a classmate of Aisaka&#8217;s, but they don&#8217;t talk much, so the jovial sports boy is a bit intimidated in front of me.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, considering the subtle tension between Ayana and me, Aisaka&#8217;s arrival provided a breath of fresh air.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aisaka, isn&#8217;t it a bit unusual for you to be on your way home from club activities? Isn&#8217;t your house in the opposite direction from here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom asked me to pick up some groceries. If I complain about being tired from baseball, she&#8217;ll kill me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of mom is she?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s like a demon – well, not quite.&#8221;</p>



<p>Referring to your own mother as &#8216;a demon&#8217;?</p>



<p>Well, I&#8217;ve never been to Aisaka&#8217;s house, and I don&#8217;t know what his family is like.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;She might be a demon, but she&#8217;s still my mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess a mother&#8217;s request is hard to refuse.</p>



<p>Although Aisaka and I get along well, I&#8217;ve never been to his house, and I don&#8217;t know anything about his family.</p>



<p>But I see, it&#8217;s a request from his mom… I get along pretty well with Aisaka, but I&#8217;ve never been to his house, and I don&#8217;t even know what his family is like.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s because of Aisaka or not, it&#8217;s hard to refuse a mother&#8217;s request, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s been making me bentos and taking care of me all the time, so I&#8217;ve probably been a bit of a bother too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems like both of us have trouble saying no to our mothers.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve never really had the opportunity to talk about our families like this before, even though we&#8217;re students.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Fufu, Aisaka-kun, you really love your mom, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say &#8216;love&#8217; because it sounds embarrassing, but I definitely don&#8217;t dislike her, I think that&#8217;s pretty normal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Towa-kun also loves Akemi-san… I mean his mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You look like you love your family too, Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of face is that?&#8221;</p>



<p>I lightly poke Aisaka&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really glad Aisaka came along… Maybe if he hadn&#8217;t, things could have been awkward between me and Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you two leaving already?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes, we were just about to head home.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana smiled her usual smile and walked up to my side. In that moment, Aisaka voiced a question that seemed to have been on his mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;In class, you&#8217;re always taking care of Sasaki, right, Otonashi-san? But it seems like you and Yukishiro-kun go better together…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, thank you, Aisaka-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana smiled sweetly, and I could see Aisaka getting a bit flustered. While I understood that being smiled at by such a beautiful girl as Ayana could have that effect, I distinctly remembered that Aisaka had someone he was interested in, particularly a younger girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Aisaka, about the shopping…&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as I was about to ask if everything was alright, a powerful voice echoed that caught Aisaka&#8217;s and my attention.</p>



<p> We quickly turned our heads in that direction, surprised and even a bit alarmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, let go of me!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>A university-aged guy was making advances towards a young woman. The woman clearly showed her discomfort, but she didn&#8217;t back down and instead confronted him with a strong gaze and voice, trying to intimidate him. In contrast, the guy didn&#8217;t seem to be fazed at all and just grinned.</p>



<p>He hadn&#8217;t approached her in a friendly manner; it was clear that he was interested in the woman&#8217;s body, and his expression was lecherous.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nampa, huh… &#8221; [TL: Nampa = Hitting on women, seducer, etc]</p>



<p>Nampa attempts weren&#8217;t particularly unusual in the city. However, the woman in question was not someone we could simply ignore. She was someone I recognized and stirred up memories of my past as Towa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that Seina-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Seina Otonashi, Ayana&#8217;s mother. She was around the same age as my mother, probably in her forties. Despite that, she looked remarkably youthful, almost like a college student. She shared a similar beautiful appearance and aura with Ayana, which made it even more surprising that someone would attempt to hit on her like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seems like that guy is making Otonashi-san uncomfortable&#8230; Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aisaka?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Putting the luggage in its place, Aisaka heads to Seina and the man.</p>



<p>Most people might choose to ignore such a situation, but Aisaka&#8217;s nonchalant response seemed to reflect his sense of justice. Seeing him like that also inspired me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going with him. Ayana, I know youre mother doesn&#8217;t think well of me, but she&#8217;s still your mother, and that&#8217;s reason enough to help… Ayana, you wait here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if she doesn&#8217;t have a high opinion of me, that&#8217;s not a reason not to help. She&#8217;s Ayana&#8217;s mom, and I felt like I would regret it if I didn&#8217;t do anything.</p>



<p>But… what&#8217;s this?</p>



<p>As I tried to head over to Seina-san, my legs felt heavy, as if I were stuck in quicksand up to my knees.</p>



<p>(Just like back then…)</p>



<p>I remembered the feeling from when I watched Shu and Iori carrying bags. In the end, I did nothing and went home with Ayana.</p>



<p>I forced my feet to move.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As if something had clicked in my mind, I found myself standing next to Aisaka.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t ignore this feeling, but the urgency to help Seina-san overrode it. That&#8217;s what filled my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, Aisaka.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Yukishiro-kun, are you coming too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s Ayana&#8217;s mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh… eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka blinked in surprise at my explanation. It was understandable; it&#8217;s not often you see someone so young-looking having a high school daughter.</p>



<p>We headed over to the two people who were arguing. The first one to notice us was Seina-san, and she seemed surprised when she saw me, not Aisaka.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough. Can&#8217;t you see she&#8217;s not interested?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Do you really have the nerve to do this in such a public place?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Who the hell are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>The guy stared at us menacingly, but when he realized there were two of us, he seemed a bit taken aback. He released Seina-san&#8217;s hand for a moment. I didn&#8217;t let that chance slip by and quickly pulled Seina-san away from him.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say anything now and let me help you.&#8221;</p>



<p>But deep down, I was anxious. Considering the words I&#8217;d heard from Kotone and Hatsune-san, I didn&#8217;t expect to hear anything more shocking. However, I still didn&#8217;t want to hear anything harsh from the mother of the girl I like, so I preferred if she didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;You brats, it&#8217;s none of your business.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go into details, but we&#8217;re involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just give it up. It&#8217;s not cool.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The man&#8217;s anger flared up even more at Aisaka&#8217;s words, and he picked up a traffic cone nearby.</p>



<p>Seeing this, Seina let out a small scream, and I quickly placed my hand on Aisaka&#8217;s shoulder, pulling him forcefully to our side.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re playing baseball, right? It&#8217;d be trouble if you injured yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stay back!&#8221;</p>



<p>But here was where my shortcomings became apparent. While my intention was to protect them, I hadn&#8217;t thought of a clear course of action. By pulling Aisaka strongly, I put some distance between him and Seina-san, which was reassuring. However, Seina-san, who was standing right behind me, was still in danger.</p>



<p>As the commotion continued to attract more attention, people started to make a fuss. For now, I needed to endure a blow to the head or back… or did I?</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get cocky, you bastards!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I shifted my gaze away from the man swinging the traffic cone, I saw Seina-san, her eyes wide open, staring at me in shock. Aisaka was about to rush towards me. Seina-san&#8217;s expression was particularly striking, though.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Well, the memories of direct conversations with her are from Towa&#8217;s past memories, and they aren&#8217;t featured much in the game, so I can&#8217;t say if &#8220;fresh&#8221; is the right word, but it felt that way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>I closed my eyes and braced for impact. I just hoped it wouldn&#8217;t hurt too much. However, I didn&#8217;t feel any pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU DARE TO DO SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO TOWA-KUUUUUUUUUUN!&#8221;</p>



<p>That was indeed Ayana&#8217;s enraged shout.</p>



<p>I turned around at the sound of something dull hitting the ground, and I saw the traffic cone falling to the ground. The man was crouching, clutching his groin, and Ayana stood with her back to us, between the man and me.</p>



<p>With her back turned and standing right in front of us, Ayana had a stance that resembled a battle-hardened warrior. Aisaka and I exchanged glances.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana… san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Otonashi… san?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>We… were we the side characters? I was genuinely overwhelmed by Ayana&#8217;s presence, as were not only Aisaka and me but also, as I briefly glanced behind, Seina, who was wide-eyed, seemed to find Ayana&#8217;s current appearance quite unusual or something she hadn&#8217;t seen much before.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>For now, there was no need for either of us to ask about what had just happened with Ayana.</p>



<p>What mattered more was that while the scene had calmed down, both Seina and the Ayana were present. This became evident as Seina&#8217;s voice broke the silence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana… What just happened? Or rather, why are you with this child?&#8221;</p>



<p>The words &#8220;why are you with this child&#8221; obviously referred to me. In the end, it was Ayana who had repelled the man, but I couldn&#8217;t help but find it amusing that she hadn&#8217;t said a word of thanks to me, who had protected her at my own expense.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to thank Towa-kun first? He went so far as to protect Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would I… What kind of joke are you making?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana snorted as she looked at me. To be honest, I had no idea why she disliked me, or rather, Towa, so much. Even if I were to ask her, she probably wouldn&#8217;t tell me, no matter what reasons there might be. I wished I could say something that would strongly affect her, but as I was thinking about it, Ayana began speaking. She unleashed a barrage of words that hit harder than a right straight, a high-powered attack.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It was the same back then, wasn&#8217;t it? Even though I was the one in the wrong, Towa-kun comforted me, and you treated him coldly. Even when Towa-kun got injured!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana took a deep breath and continued in a calm voice, as though she hadn&#8217;t been raising her voice just moments ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not only can&#8217;t you say thank you, but you even said such horrible things to Towa-kun. I don&#8217;t just dislike you; I don&#8217;t even want to think that we share the same blood.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A… Ayana…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s words left Seina-san dumbfounded, as if she couldn&#8217;t believe it. She stared at Ayana as if she had forgotten that Aisaka and I were even there.</p>



<p>(Isn&#8217;t this a bit too much of a fireball straight?)</p>



<p>As far as I was concerned, all I had were unpleasant memories of Seina-san. However, that didn&#8217;t mean I thought, &#8220;Serves you right&#8221; when I heard Ayana say that. That would be a petty way of thinking.</p>



<p>Now, what should I do in this situation? As I pondered this, I noticed that Ayana had a scratch on her hand—probably from her exchange with the man earlier, where his nails had likely grazed her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seina-sa… cough, I&#8217;m sorry, can you please give me a hand?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to call her name, Seina-san, but I stopped myself just in time. </p>



<p>When I approach her in her stunned state, she seems to be properly conscious as only her gaze follows my face …… well, of course she is.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a scratch. I don&#8217;t have any antiseptic cream with me, so please wash it and take care of it when we get back home.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wrapped a handkerchief around the scratch, and while I expected her to resist or brush my hand away, she simply watched me go about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, that should do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>After finishing the simple first aid, I released Seina-san&#8217;s hand. I didn&#8217;t know what to say to her. There was a flood of emotions and questions, but I had no idea how to approach this situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we go, Towa-kun? You too, Aisaka-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana held my hand tightly as we started walking. </p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Aisaka seemed to have forgotten that Ayana had once been the one to hit him with that heavy blow. He probably still didn&#8217;t know the full story, and I wasn&#8217;t about to tell him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… haha, it feels like a lot happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Once Seina&#8217;s figure disappeared from our view, Aisaka chuckled with a perplexed smile. He had no idea about the circumstances, and he was understandably bewildered. Nonetheless, I appreciated that he was making light of the situation and trying to ease the tension.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Aisaka-kun. Well, you know, a lot happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, even without knowing the details, it was pretty obvious just by seeing that. Well, both Otonashi-san and you are unharmed, so that&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>We agreed on that point.</p>



<p>But, anyway…</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>With Aisaka and me staring at her, Ayana looked uncomfortable and shrank into herself. It was a far cry from the confident and powerful presence she had displayed earlier.</p>



<p>I had a sense that this was a side of her I hadn&#8217;t seen before. Although my past memories of her and the games didn&#8217;t portray her in such a way, she was definitely acting differently today.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Ayana… When she gets angry, she becomes like that, huh? That… um, I don&#8217;t know, it felt kind of different from her usual self.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly… I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s a bad person, but that&#8217;s just how she acts. Her mother didn&#8217;t even thank you for what you did. And, she said such harsh words for no reason…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how to respond. In a way, I understood her better now, but it didn&#8217;t make the situation any less awkward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we go, Towa-kun? Aisaka-kun too.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana gripped my hand tightly, and we resumed walking.</p>



<p>With Ayana leading the way and holding my hand, I couldn&#8217;t help but look back at the situation. However, Aisaka&#8217;s didn&#8217;t seem to have any intention of following us or saying anything to us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, well… ha ha, I&#8217;m not sure how to feel about all this.&#8221;</p>



<p>We walked a bit further, and Aisaka smiled, trying to ease the atmosphere.</p>



<p>He must be quite confused, not knowing any of the circumstances, but even so, I was grateful that he could smile like this, as it helped ease the tension in the air.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Aisaka. Well, you know, a lot of things happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if you saw that, even if you were incredibly dense, you&#8217;d understand. Well, that goes for that person too, but I&#8217;m glad that neither of us got seriously injured.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>I agreed with him on that point.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Well, that being said… when it comes to who was responsible for us not getting seriously injured, it was undoubtedly her, moving like an Amazoness.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s the matter…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana looked uncomfortable and made her body smaller as Aisaka and I stared at her.</p>



<p>Considering her loud voice from a moment ago and how she effortlessly took down that man with a single blow… I realized that Ayana was much stronger than I had thought. Her sudden use of rough language was also unexpected, as it didn&#8217;t seem to fit her character.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well… I had no idea Ayana could get like that when she&#8217;s angry. Uh… I mean, I didn&#8217;t see anything dangerous, did I? Will I get killed for that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who would kill you! Please don&#8217;t treat people like dangerous freaks!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Kuku.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana bit back at Aisaka&#8217;s joking remark, her face turning bright red.</p>



<p>Aisaka laughed, looking troubled as he glanced at Ayana, who seemed unamused. Then, he turned to me and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to make it clear that I&#8217;m not involved in this. I&#8217;m curious, but I won&#8217;t ask anything. Still, I don&#8217;t think Yukishiro-kun is the kind of person who would be disliked for no reason. So, I&#8217;m hoping for some improvement in your relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… thanks, Aisaka.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehe, well, then… shopping! I almost forgot!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka hastily waved his hand and ran off.</p>



<p>Given the situation, it felt like the storm had passed, but being told such things made my face turn slightly red.</p>



<p>Ayana held onto my arm and stared at me intently.</p>



<p>There had been that exchange earlier… I thought that if I sent her home today, things might become awkward between Seina-san and her. So, I proposed that she stay over at my house.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to visit… I&#8217;ll leave early tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>In that case, it seemed like I would be taking her home tomorrow and then going to school. My mother was likely already home, so I should call her before taking Ayana with me and let her know that Ayana would be staying over.</p>



<p>[Hello?]</p>



<p>[Mom? I&#8217;m sorry for this sudden request, but Ayana will be staying over today—]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll make a bit more food then.]</p>



<p>My mom agreed without asking for any reasons, which was wonderful.</p>



<p>Ayana, who was close by, seemed to have heard my mom&#8217;s voice that leaked out, and she quietly held my hand while chuckling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Towa-kun. I should also thank Akemi-san.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;You really don&#8217;t need to thank her. But it&#8217;s more about my mom… She gets all excited when someone stays over, and it can get annoying, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m used to dealing with a tipsy Akemi-san when she&#8217;s had a bit of alcohol♪&#8221;</p>



<p>That was… really reassuring, and I smiled wryly.</p>



<p>I was soothed by Ayana&#8217;s excitement at being able to meet her mother and Ayana being by my side. I took her with me and returned home to where my mother was waiting.</p>
