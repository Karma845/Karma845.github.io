<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>I never thought that I would be reincarnated in a game world. Living a normal life, growing old in the usual way, and eventually passing away – that was the human life, the everyday norm. I, too, was supposed to live in such a manner.</p>



<p>However, I suddenly found myself reincarnated into the world of an eroge with the title &#8220;I Was Robbed of Everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t the protagonist but rather the man who would steal heroines from that protagonist – Towa Yukishiro and Ayana Otonashi.</p>



<p>Reincarnation brought confusion and doubt, of course, but it was as if my consciousness gradually adapted to this world through the body of Towa Yukishiro.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t spent many months in this world yet, but there&#8217;s a certain feeling within my heart.</p>



<p>I want to protect the smile of Ayana Otonashi, the heroine who is deeply familiar with the protagonist of this world. I want to walk through life together with her.</p>



<p>No matter what troubles she carries or the mysteries hidden in this world&#8230;. even if they are concealed in darkness, I will definitely grasp them.</p>



<p>I believe that there must be a reason why I came to this world.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"/>



<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I should have resolved to do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to know the hidden truths of this world and what Ayana was carrying, but this overwhelming tenderness was dissolving my determination.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re alone, let&#8217;s take our time.&#8221; </p>



<p>I looked at the voice whispering in my ear.</p>



<p>The girl sitting next to me, Ayana Otonashi, held my arm and smiled as she gazed at my face.</p>



<p>Today, after having an unusual lunch with my friend Aisaka, I found myself with some free time and thought it would be a good opportunity to gather my thoughts, so I came to the rooftop alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun. You were here, huh?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I was leisurely lost in thought, the door opened, and she popped her head in.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t explain it, but there was no feeling of someone being behind me or any sensation of being chased, so even though she had a smile on her face, her sudden appearance surprised me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun&#8230; Towa-kun ♪&#8221;</p>



<p>As if to say, &#8220;Now that we&#8217;re alone, it&#8217;s my turn,&#8221; she closed the distance between us and leaned in closer.</p>



<p>Even though I had wanted to get lost in my thoughts and think about the future, the truth is that, deep down, I desired more than anything to spend time with her. In such a situation, resistance was futile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe about twenty more minutes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. We still have plenty of time to enjoy each other, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana blushed and her eyes were filled with anticipation as she looked at me.</p>



<p>Her appearance was incredibly charming, and her allure was overwhelming. I gently placed my hand on her cheek and leaned in to kiss her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; <em>Kyuuu</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Hardly any students visit the rooftop, and apart from us, there was no one around. Let&#8217;s put aside any complications for now and, as she suggested, let&#8217;s enjoy this moment.</p>



<p>Her long, silky black hair was devoid of split ends, and not a single strand clung to my fingers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your hair, Ayana, is beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. It&#8217;s a lot of work to maintain its length, but if Towa-kun says that, it makes all the effort worthwhile ♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Why is she so good at making me feel happy and appreciated? I gazed into her jewel-like eyes.</p>



<p>Ayana still seemed to want more kisses, but to be honest, continuing any further would be risky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s head back now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Are you sure we can&#8217;t stay a little longer? Besides, isn&#8217;t &#8216;from now on&#8217; what we&#8217;re looking forward to?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;From now on&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, &#8216;from now on&#8217; ♪&#8221;</p>

<p>With her eyes glazed over, she exuded an even sweeter atmosphere than before.</p>



<p>When I first recognized myself in this world, I was puzzled by why she was so close to me. It almost felt nostalgic, even if it was in the context of the current situation.</p>



<p>(On that day… my feelings for Ayana grew stronger.)</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t deny that I was influenced by the circumstances, but back then, I genuinely yearned for Ayana. The events of that day strengthened my feelings for her, and I had a clear goal of wanting to be with her. But for now, I had to steel my heart and distance myself from Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it is school after all. Not that I can say much, considering I&#8217;ve been the one kissing…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ehh~, but you went all the way with me in the audiovisual room before, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;?!?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I opened my eyes to see the disappointment in her muttered words.</p>



<p>While I&#8217;ve been re-experiencing memories related to Towa and getting to know Ayana and the others, there were still many things I couldn&#8217;t remember. What Ayana just told me was like a bolt from the blue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… about that…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Muuu…!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt the cute and cuddly cheeks, but may I say something? Hey, Towa! What are you doing in school? School is a place to learn, not a place to do that kind of thing, you know that!</p>



<p>No, no, if you&#8217;re told that you&#8217;ve been kissing at school, there&#8217;s nothing much you can say. But still, I can&#8217;t help but think…right?</p>



<p>(School? Is this like something out of an *roge… Oh, right, this is the world of an *roge.)</p>



<p>With that realization in mind, I made my way back to the classroom, trying to persuade Ayana.</p>



<p>Ayana was off to enjoy the remaining time with her friends, and she headed in that direction.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I watched her walk away, a male student approached me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Were you with Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>Standing next to me was Shu Sasaki, the protagonist of this world.</p>



<p>I nodded at Shu&#8217;s question, then headed to my seat. Shu followed me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You disappeared right after lunch. I see, if she was with Towa, that&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, we were just talking for a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t tell him about the kiss or the deep conversation. Originally, when I first recognized myself in this world, I had the thought that I wouldn&#8217;t do anything for Shu and Ayana. However, as I spent time as Towa, my thoughts on that matter changed significantly.</p>



<p>I want to protect Ayana. I want to protect her smile. I&#8217;ve become strongly determined not to let anyone, not even Shu, take on that role.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I averted my gaze from Shu.</p>



<p>While I continued my secret relationship with Ayana, knowing his feelings… despite feeling guilt and superiority in some ways, there was still a considerable burden in my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>But I still feel a not-so-slightly big tug in my heart.</p>



<p>I need to know what this strange feeling of having a lid on my memory, not to say that it&#8217;s coming up to my throat, is …… I need to know.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, it&#8217;s time to go back because class is starting soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah, I got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu walked away, and it became quiet again.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this world almost constantly while preparing for class, but concentrating on my thoughts isn&#8217;t a bad thing.</p>



<p>When class began, I was diligently copying the content from the blackboard into my notebook.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The words on the blackboard distorted, and out-of-place words appeared:</p>



<p>Corner them …… corner them.</p>



<p>Make them suffer …… make them suffer</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>



<p>I reached up to rub my eyes, feeling like I might be tired, or perhaps sleep-deprived. I muttered something under my breath, and a classmate sitting next to me looked at me with a puzzled expression. So, I managed to smile vaguely, trying to dismiss it as a mistake.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, Yukishiro, try solving this problem.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wondered if someone noticed that I had been spacing out. However, as I turned to the blackboard and began solving the math problem, I realized it was a bit of a challenge, but with Towa&#8217;s capabilities, I managed to solve it correctly.</p>



<p>The teacher nodded in satisfaction, and just before I returned to my seat, Ayana, who had briefly met my gaze, was looking at me with a worried expression. I wondered if she had noticed the earlier strange occurrence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered that in my mind, but Ayana nodded quietly. It was surprising that my thoughts had somehow reached her, but with Ayana, it didn&#8217;t seem too mysterious.</p>



<p>I continued my thoughts while paying attention to the teacher&#8217;s lecture and didn&#8217;t let any part of the class slip by me. After class, it was time for afterschool.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew~! I&#8217;m tired today!&#8221;</p>



<p>Right after the closing remarks, my friend with the shaved head, Takashi Aisaka, said so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good job. But you have club activities now, don&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ll get tired from that.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Nah, I like baseball, so it&#8217;s no big deal. At least it&#8217;s hundreds of times better than sitting in a chair listening to a boring lecture.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s… certainly true, I chuckled.</p>



<p>As we chatted with Aisaka, a clear voice echoed from the entrance of the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I apologize for intruding. Is Sasaki-kun here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only Aisaka and I but also the remaining students in the classroom turned our attention to the entrance.</p>



<p>Peering inside from the doorway was Iori Honjo, our student council president, and one of the heroines in this world, just like Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…No.&#8221;</p>



<p>I found myself staring at her, Iori&#8230;&#8230; It puzzled Takashi, and I tilted my head. </p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but think, not just about Ayana, but about how all the heroines in this world, including Iori, were strikingly beautiful. It wasn&#8217;t just her looks; her purity of heart was evident when you spoke with her.</p>



<p>(There were exceptions, of course.)</p>



<p>Yes, there are exceptions.</p>



<p>Shu&#8217;s younger sister and mother, and Ayana&#8217;s mother, for instance. But now wasn&#8217;t the time to dwell on that.</p>



<p>Iori is right in front of us, and Shu comes up to her when he hears her name called.</p>



<p>After talking about something as it was, Shu went off with Iori, so I guess he had to help her after school again today.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, are you okay with skipping club activities?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that would be a problem. I&#8217;ll be going then.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I watched Aisaka leave the classroom in a panic, Ayana came to my side as if to replace him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Shall we go home?&#8221;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…sorry, I&#8217;m going to go to the bathroom for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>I walked out of the classroom, thinking with a wry smile that I wasn&#8217;t going to wait for Shu.</p>



<p>On the way, I passed a Senpai who was one year older than me, which is rare on this floor, but I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it and went straight to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“…Fui~”</p>



<p>After I had washed my hands, I looked at myself in the mirror.</p>



<p>My body in this world …… Towa Yukishiro has a neat face, but Towa&#8217;s reflection in the mirror is giving me a somewhat distracted look.</p>



<p>I gently reached out my wet hand and touched my reflection in the mirror.</p>



<p>But of course, the reflection of me in the mirror only performs the same action.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;….Really, what am I doing&#8221;</p>



<p>I laughed bitterly at myself for doing something so stupid, taking advantage of the fact that I was the only one there.</p>



<p>On the way back to Ayana, I wiped my hand with a handkerchief and remembered the letters I saw in that class.</p>



<p>&#8220;… corner them… corner them… torment them… torment them…&#8221;</p>



<p>As I just said it out loud, it certainly seemed that way to me.</p>



<p>At that time, I was surprised by the suddenness, but in the end I thought it was just my imagination, but I don&#8217;t know what to do… This phrase strangely sticks in my head.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like the feeling you get after listening to a memorable song.</p>



<p>(I don&#8217;t get it. …… but I guess the fact that it&#8217;s bothering me like this means there&#8217;s something to it. It&#8217;s worth remembering, I guess.)</p>



<p>When I returned to the classroom thinking like this, the senior I had passed earlier was standing in front of Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hey, Otonashi-san. Could you please make some time now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for this. Please leave me alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that. You&#8217;re alone now, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>The interaction between Ayana and a Senpai is enough to understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that he has the energy to come all the way to the classrooms of the lower grades based on his charming appearance, but if possible, I would like him to at least realize that he is causing trouble to the girls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana&#8221;</p>



<p>“Ah, Towa-kun!”</p>



<p>Wait and see? I&#8217;m not going to do that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The remaining classmates looked at me with relief, and Senpai looked at me in surprise in response to Ayana&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I kept you waiting for a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s totally fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana smiled and, as if Senpai  didn&#8217;t even exist, she slung her bag over her shoulder and lined up next to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, wait, Otonashi-san&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, it seems Ayana doesn&#8217;t have that intention, so please give up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Though my tone remained soft, my gaze sharpened, carrying the meaning that I wanted him to consider her feelings and the inconvenience he was causing.</p>



<p>Senpai let out a small click of his tongue and glared at me, but he must have realized &#8211; we were not the only students left in this classroom, and Ayana&#8217;s friends were also present, directing disapproving looks at him. Senpai finally understood the situation wasn&#8217;t in his favor and hastily left the classroom.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Shall we go then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes♪&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>Afterward, I walked down the hallway with Ayana.</p>



<p>Her expression had completely changed from what she had shown to Senpai, and she seemed to be in high spirits, with a continuous smile on her face.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m sure&#8230; she must have received confessions from various people in that manner.)</p>



<p>This time was just a summons, but if you counted it as a confession, there must have been quite a few&#8230; Ayana was such an attractive girl that many boys wouldn&#8217;t leave her alone.</p>



<p>And above all, because of my past, I can&#8217;t help but feel a little satisfaction in seeing Shu&#8217;s predicament, which makes me think I&#8217;m a terrible person.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>While walking in the hallway with Ayana, I noticed Shu and Iori carrying heavy bags.</p>



<p>Although they didn&#8217;t notice us, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if their bags were too heavy and watched them intently.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Should I offer to help… I thought, but strangely, my legs wouldn&#8217;t move.</p>



<p>(Why…?)</p>



<p>I was perplexed about why my feet wouldn&#8217;t move. However, Ayana was the one who took my hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, Shu-kun and Iori will be fine, so let&#8217;s head home.&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as I heard Ayana&#8217;s words, my legs, which had seemed glued to the ground, began to move.</p>



<p>It was as if her gentle warmth in the palm of my hand and the reassuring tone of her voice were whispering to me that I should just trust in her.</p>



<p>The farther we distanced ourselves from Shu and Iori, the more the discomfort I had felt earlier disappeared, and by the time we left the school building, I no longer had anything to worry about.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are we going to do now? Are we heading straight home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t that be a bit boring?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;So, does that mean… you want to spend more time with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana playfully placed her index finger on her lips and said it with a hint of charm.</p>



<p>No matter what gestures she made, she always looked stunning, and as if it were the most natural thing in the world, I nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, let&#8217;s make this date a memorable one!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right… let&#8217;s enjoy my date with Ayana to the fullest.</p>



<p>However, we hadn&#8217;t decided on what to do or where to go, so we would likely be wandering around with Ayana following her whims today.</p>



<p>As we walked a little further from the school gate, I noticed the track and field club members running.</p>



<p>It seemed like they had just finished running outside, and among them, I spotted a familiar face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Oh, Ayana-senpai and Yukishiro-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite running and being out of breath, cheerful greetings came from Mari Uchida &#8211; our junior, and one of the heroines, just like Ayana and Iori.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Mari-chan. You&#8217;re working hard, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! I always give it my all! That&#8217;s my motto!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mari, who continued to move her legs as if doing high knees even after stopping, was like a bundle of energy. When I first talked to her, I thought the same thing: her boundless cheerfulness was infectious, and I couldn&#8217;t help but smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, where&#8217;s Shu-senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s helping out with the student council.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Mumu&#8221;</p>



<p>Mari blatantly looked dissatisfied with my response, but it suited her because she had an inherently cute face, and any expression she made only emphasized her cuteness.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hey, Uchida! We&#8217;re still in the middle of practice!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right! Well, then, both of you, let&#8217;s talk again sometime!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m looking forward to that.&#8221;</p>



<p>After seeing Mari off, we headed towards the bustling downtown area.</p>



<p>As I mentioned before, we didn&#8217;t have a clear purpose, so we were just going to spend time walking around aimlessly with Ayana.</p>



<p>(…But, you know, that&#8217;s not so bad either.)</p>



<p>Just being with Ayana made my heart leap with excitement.</p>



<p>What can I do for her&#8230; it&#8217;s not that serious, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder what I could do right now to make her even happier. What should I do?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Oh, are you two on a date, Onii-chan and Nee-chan? How about some takoyaki?&#8221;</p>



<p>As we walked together, a guy making takoyaki called out to us.</p>



<p>Takoyaki&#8230; hmm.</p>



<p>I felt a bit hungry, so I looked at Ayana and she nodded, saying we should go for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, we&#8217;ll take eight pieces, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing. How about mayonnaise?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Definitely!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takoyaki without mayonnaise is unthinkable, after all!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>So, we received the piping hot takoyaki from the guy and sat down on a nearby bench.</p>



<p>We both blew on them to cool them down, being careful not to burn ourselves, and it was no surprise that eating them was a bit of a struggle due to the heat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hot&#8230; it&#8217;s hot!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, hot&#8230; hot!&#8221;</p>



<p>We both exclaimed it&#8217;s hot as we tried to roll the takoyaki in our mouths without burning ourselves.</p>



<p>Despite being hot and not easy to eat, the taste was truly exceptional.</p>



<p>Soon, we finished all eight pieces of takoyaki and relaxed with a cold drink in hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thank you for what you did earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Earlier&#8230; Ah, you mean about that senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems her thanks were for what happened with that senpai.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t as if things had escalated into a physical altercation, and that guy backed down immediately, so it really wasn&#8217;t something to be thanked for.</p>



<p>I reached out to touch Ayana&#8217;s cheek naturally while I continued speaking.</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to thank me. I knew that Ayana was bothered, and above all, I couldn&#8217;t just let that happen right in front of me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana happily loosened her cheeks and enclosed my hand with her own, savoring the touch as she held it in place.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Can we stay like this for a while?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a princess&#8217;s request like that, I can&#8217;t say no.</p>



<p>But&#8230; Ayana is indeed a strange girl, or rather, she possesses an astonishing level of charm, almost at a bewitching level.</p>



<p>Although it&#8217;s not something I don&#8217;t care about, I find myself thinking that I can just let go of everything and enjoy a carefree life as Towa Yukishiro.</p>



<p>(That must be an easy path&#8230; simply living as Towa Yukishiro without thinking about anything&#8230; it&#8217;s probably the entrance to a sweet daily life.)</p>



<p>As a human, it&#8217;s only natural to choose the easier path if one exists instead of a difficult one.</p>



<p>However, something inside me screams that it&#8217;s not right—so I mustn&#8217;t become a passive, drifting entity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, may I take the lead this time?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I gently released my hand from her cheek, placed it on her shoulder, and pulled her closer.</p>



<p>As I held Ayana in my arms, a strange thing happened—my feelings of affection for her surged strongly in my heart.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just as it always is&#8230; that&#8217;s for sure.</p>



<p>But this determination residing in my heart is not something half-hearted. I can&#8217;t just go with the flow; that would be wrong. Two conflicting emotions fight within me, almost making me want to laugh, but my strong determination is the only thing that&#8217;s certain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright! Thank you, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, Ayana, your surprised expression is cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you…?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana wasn&#8217;t just wide-eyed; she also blinked rapidly, and it was utterly adorable.</p>



<p>We spent about an hour strolling through knick-knack shops, and when it was past 5 o&#8217;clock, we decided it was time to head home…</p>



<p>However, at that moment, I witnessed something that left me speechless.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>Who I had witnessed… was clear as day from their backs.</p>



<p>[You know, you&#8217;re not needed.]</p>



<p>[Ayana Onee-chan, it was a disaster wasn&#8217;t it]</p>



<p>As if to trigger an old wound, those voices echoed in my mind.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The two people with their backs to me—Shu&#8217;s mother, Hatsune Sasaki, and his little sister, Kotone Sasaki.</p>



<p>I had met Kotone once since I became Towa, but I hadn&#8217;t met or spoken to Hatsune … although I remembered the conversation we had in a dream in the hospital, I had nothing but unpleasant memories associated with them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, come over here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Softly, Ayana led me by the hand.</p>



<p>For a split second… just for a split second, I thought I saw Ayana&#8217;s expression turn stern. But I quickly dismissed it as my imagination and just as I tilted my head in confusion, everything around me suddenly went quiet, as if the sound had been turned off.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on…?&#8221;</p>



<p>It felt like I had been isolated from the world, as if I were the only one left.</p>



<p>Ayana was still leading me by the hand, and everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. What on earth…?</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana—&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you feeling right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked that question in an instant, and as I did, someone passed by me.</p>



<p>In this strange situation, I couldn&#8217;t help but be drawn to that presence. A person in a black coat with a hood, an unusual sight that didn&#8217;t reveal their expression or identity, yet I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off them.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned to follow that presence, it had vanished.</p>



<p>As if it had never existed to begin with.</p>



<p>I was left speechless by this surreal experience. But when I turned my gaze to where I had just been looking, Kotone and Hatsune-san were still there, with their backs turned.</p>



<p>Corner them… Corner them</p>



<p>Make them suffer… Make them suffer&#8230;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Someone whispered in my ear… a girl&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>And it seemed to be reciting the same text that had appeared on the chalkboard during class today, resonating in my eardrums.</p>



<p>&#8220;…!&#8221;</p>



<p>I put my hand to my forehead and stopped in my tracks. Suddenly, an image from the past flashed before my eyes.</p>



<p>A still depicting Kotone and Hatsune being r*ped and corrupted by men respectively in the game, and their depravity, where they talk about Shu, whom they loved so much, as if he were an obstacle. …… and.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was snapped back to reality when my name was called. I had thought we hadn&#8217;t walked that far, but apparently, it was all my own confusion. We were quite a distance from Kotone and Hatsune-san. How could I have been so absent-minded?</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay? You seemed lost in thought.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine… yeah. I&#8217;m fine. Sorry, Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;………&#8221;</p>



<p>Geez, I shouldn&#8217;t have worried Ayana!</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t need to worry about anything, and I want her to know that. So, I took Ayana&#8217;s hand and started walking, silently letting her know that I was okay.</p>



<p>We headed to that park, a place filled with memories for both of us.</p>



<p>Since it was late in the evening, there were no children playing around like usual, and except for us, there was no one in sight.</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>Ever since we came here, or perhaps from the moment I took her hand, Ayana has been like this. Although she usually wears a smile when she&#8217;s by my side, now she&#8217;s just looking down in silence.</p>



<p>The cause is probably my reaction when I saw Kotone and Hatsune-san… I hug Ayana and pat her back gently.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m okay. I was just surprised, and…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;………&#8221;</p>



<p>She said it was a lie, and I fell silent. Since I was holding her, our faces were very close as we looked at each other, and her dark, cloudy eyes locked onto mine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s your very own Ayana, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her voice was very gentle, but her eyes were frightening, and I felt like averting my gaze.</p>



<p>Ayana wrapped her arms around my back, hugging me tightly, and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Towa-kun. I promise, I&#8217;ll take care of everything.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What do you…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;ll be fine, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fine. The sound of those words was like a sweet melody invading the depths of my heart.</p>



<p>Even though her demeanor was different from usual, and there was something scary about it, I still accepted her embrace and held onto her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana… how do you feel about those two?&#8221;</p>



<p>She answered my words with a smile and a chuckle.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate them. I&#8217;ve always hated them, from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>&#8220;Phew…&#8221;</p>



<p>After dinner, I let out a small sigh in my room.</p>



<p>After that, I dropped Ayana off near her house.</p>



<p>Originally, I had gone to the bustling city for an after-school date with Ayana. However, the day ended on a somewhat sour note after witnessing those two.</p>



<p>Well, by the time we said our goodbyes, Ayana had already returned to her usual self, so I was relieved. But it was still the first time I had seen her like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;… What was that all about?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was certainly concerned about Ayana, but what bothered me even more was the strange phenomenon that occurred when I saw Kotone and Hatsune-san. </p>



<p>It felt like I was isolated from the world, and I saw a woman wearing a black hood. When I turned around, my thought process was interrupted because Ayana called me, but I definitely saw the same figure that was present when those two fell.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Write down everything that&#8217;s bothering you. There might be a hint.&#8221; </p>



<p>I organized the information about this world, the protagonist, Shu, and the heroine, Ayana, in a notebook that I took out from the desk drawer.</p>



<p>I documented everything that happened after school, as well as events at school. As I looked at the pages, they seemed like strange messages, and I chuckled.</p>



<p>&#8220;What was that phrase… I wonder what it meant?&#8221;</p>



<p>I recalled the phrase that was etched into my memory and repeated it:</p>



<p>&#8220;Corner them… Corner them… Make them suffer… Make them suffer…&#8221;</p>



<p>To corner them and make them suffer &#8211; these words had nothing but negative connotations. I whispered these words to myself repeatedly, and something strange happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>As if the sentence continued, my hand holding the pen moved on its own.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Corner them… Corner them…</p>



<p>Make them suffer… make them suffer…</p>



<p>And then, take away the most important thing… and they&#8217;ll have nothing but despair. Right?</p>



<p>My hand unconsciously composed these words. I didn&#8217;t understand the meaning behind these words or how they appeared on paper. However, there was something about these words that felt familiar.</p>



<p>I sat in the chair for a while, staring at the words I had written, but I couldn&#8217;t recall anything beyond a faint sense of familiarity.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Damn it&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s frustrating, way too frustrating.</p>



<p>Still, I remained motionless as I tried to trace my memory, trying to remember something, but after more than ten minutes, I had reached the limit of my patience.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take it anymore!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I can not continue! I can&#8217;t remember anything. Aaaghh! </p>



<p>I half-threw my notebook, closed it, and headed to the living room to drink something cold to cool my head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>I initially assumed that my mother had already gone to her room, but she was leisurely watching TV. She looked surprised when I suddenly appeared, but then clapped her hands and went to the refrigerator, pouring barley tea into a glass and handing it to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here you go. You wanted this, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… How did you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re my son. It is only natural.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is it only natural…?</p>



<p>Well, I got it because she offered, so I thanked her and then quickly drank it all.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good drinker.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me have it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s just a cup, and I can do it myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to trouble her that much, so I took the initiative and started washing the cup.</p>



<p>During that time, my mother just smiled at me the whole time. It was a bit unnerving and made me pause.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m sorry. I just can&#8217;t help but think my son is handsome no matter when I look at him.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s… well, since I&#8217;m Towa now, I&#8217;m bound to be handsome. It&#8217;s not like I can help it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Even though it had been several days since I became Towa, every time I looked in the mirror, I couldn&#8217;t help but think I was quite the good-looking guy.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, being told I was handsome still made me feel good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m your son, so it&#8217;s only natural, right? I&#8217;ve inherited the beauty of my beautiful mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Towaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>



<p>She pounced on me in an instant.</p>



<p>I tried to endure the shock that surged through my entire body and was relieved that the cup in my hand didn&#8217;t fall.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just too good-looking, even your personality! Always saying things that make me happy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, a little personal space here! And don&#8217;t kiss me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Not good at all! I lightly chopped her on the head to push her away.</p>



<p>She seemed quite dissatisfied as her cheeks puffed up. I almost wanted to say, &#8220;Think about your age,&#8221; but I refrained, as they say it&#8217;s a taboo topic when it comes to women&#8217;s ages.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m heading back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright&#8212;&#8211;Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Right before I left the living room, my mother called me to a halt.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you ever need anything, just rely on me, okay? You can tell me anything you can&#8217;t tell Ayana-chan, and I&#8217;ll be here to help with anything you need.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yeah. Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess she noticed when I was lost in thought during dinner. My mother truly loved me and cared for me. She was always ready to support and help me with anything.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but feel grateful for the people in my life. Towa, you probably felt the same way, didn&#8217;t you?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"/>



<p>[Ayana PoV]</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh? It feels like something good happened to Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>While lying on the bed, I──Ayana Otonashi murmured.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not pretending to be a psychic, but I have a strange sense that allows me to understand Towa-kun&#8217;s feelings somehow.</p>



<p>There might not be anything going on, but the intuition I&#8217;ve developed over the years has caught Towa-kun&#8217;s sense of happiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I must admit, this feels a bit creepy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though I love him, I realized this was a bit creepy, so I reflected on it.</p>



<p>In my hands, I held a single photograph – a picture of Towa-kun and me, both smiling.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>I kissed the Towa-kun in the photo.</p>



<p>As always, it&#8217;s the same. Just thinking about him makes my heart leap with joy, and I feel so happy. That&#8217;s why, even a hint of malice toward him, and my head boils over with anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tsk&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why, when I thought about what happened after school, I couldn&#8217;t help but click my tongue.</p>



<p>My date with Towa-kun was a sweet time, a moment filled with love, like a return to the time we spent during lunch.</p>



<p>It was fun, endearing, and blissful&#8230; In our world, filled with such emotions between Towa-kun and me, those people stepped into it with their muddy boots.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t forgive them&#8230; I won&#8217;t forgive them, won&#8217;t forgive them, won&#8217;t forgive them, won&#8217;t forgive them, won&#8217;t forgive them, won&#8217;t forgive them!&#8221;</p>



<p>Those people didn&#8217;t notice&#8230; Towa-kun.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Still, when I saw the distorted look on Towa&#8217;s face when I saw those people, I thought to myself: After all, those people have to be cleaned up.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re late? Were you playing with Shu-kun?&#8221; </p>



<p>My mother called out when I returned, but I couldn&#8217;t stand her connecting everything to Shu-kun.</p>



<p>While my mother has never directly spoken harsh words to Towa-kun from the past to the present, when she conveyed unkind words to me about Towa-kun, she was guilty by association.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Shall I go outside for some fresh air?&#8221;</p>



<p>I got up from the bed and went out to the balcony.</p>



<p>Despite the turmoil in my heart, when I raised my head, the beautiful starry sky was gazing down at me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure that what I&#8217;m about to do… No, what I&#8217;ve already started is by no means a beautiful thing. My heart is tainted in stark contrast to this beautiful starry sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun… I&#8217;m your…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Is it appropriate…?</p>



<p>Thinking that, I suddenly snapped back to my senses, realizing I can&#8217;t stop my actions any longer. I lightly slapped my cheeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I can do it … Definitely.&#8221;</p>



<p>I will bring despair to those who tormented Towa-kun, in a cruel way. I&#8217;ve thought this before, but Towa-kun is so kind that I can never tell him. That&#8217;s why I want those people to fade away without him realizing.</p>



<p>Only they will change… I won&#8217;t change at all.</p>



<p>I will always be by Towa-kun&#8217;s side… I can be by his side.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange, isn&#8217;t it? Why does everything seem to go so well?&#8221;</p>



<p>Now is the time to sow the seeds, and it will be a little while before the seeds of despair will sprout.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most people would never think about it, but I&#8217;m convinced that this is the ultimate way to achieve the worst possible result, and strangely, it always seems to work, even when success is uncertain.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Corner them… make them suffer…&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll corner them. I&#8217;ll make them suffer… and then I&#8217;ll hit them with unbearable despair.</p>



<p>After thinking like this for a while, I received a message from my beloved.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>I wondered where the Ayana Otonashi from just a moment ago had disappeared to; my thought process had completely shifted.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it~? What can I do for you? Ufufu~♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Slightly… Just slightly, I also have something I think about, and that something is related to Towa-kun. It&#8217;s not too disturbing when others are around or when someone is nearby. But when I&#8217;m alone like this, I have the confidence that I can get as disturbing as I want.</p>



<p>[The futon flew away.]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.??&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>I was surprised when I received a message from Towa-kun.</p>



<p>&#8220;The futon… flew away?&#8221;</p>



<p>I vocalized my thoughts to understand the meaning.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s one of those old, worn-out puns, and I thought about whether there was a hidden meaning because Towa-kun had sent it. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t come up with an answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t! If I can&#8217;t grasp this intention, I&#8217;ll be disqualified as a woman for Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>But… but, but, but, but, I have no idea at all! Towa-kun sent this message suddenly, and I don&#8217;t understand the meaning at all!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, uhm… an orange on top of an aluminum can…&#8221;</p>



<p>No, I definitely don&#8217;t need to reply with such a lame pun. Huh?</p>



<p>Could it be that there&#8217;s an intention behind this, aimed at getting me to say it?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Mumumu… as I was struggling to respond, I received another message from Towa-kun.</p>



<p>[Sorry. Sorry for sending such a weird message out of the blue.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t apologize! You don&#8217;t need to!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though Towa-kun wasn&#8217;t here, I was shaking my head vigorously.</p>



<p>[Sorry about the sudden weird message. I was thinking about going to sleep, and then I thought, &#8216;Hmm, Ayana might be feeling down.&#8217; So, I sent that awful pun. I&#8217;m sorry; my sense of humor is a total disaster.]</p>



<p>Knowing the reason for why he sent such a message, I once again felt my heart race for Towa.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Certainly, it was a bit of an unusual pun to send on the spot. However, I was happy because he had thought of me and sent that pun. We are truly connected, and I believe that from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps I made Towa-kun worry about the situation as well.&#8221; </p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Today, I clearly told Towa-kun that I disliked Shu&#8217;s family, for the first time. Since Towa-kun is kind, he probably thought he would worry if he knew that I, a close family member, felt such aversion. Well, he could probably have guessed it considering everything that&#8217;s happened so far, but I didn&#8217;t actively tell him. However, today, I felt it was fine.</p>



<p>In the end, the conversation ended there, and Towa-kun probably won&#8217;t ask further. So, the only thing left is for me to act and eliminate those people and turn them into bitter memories.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, it&#8217;s almost over… just a little more.&#8221;</p>



<p>No one will be there to torment you anymore.</p>



<p>Once achieved, the world that Towa-kun and I want will be there&#8230;Aaa ♪ With that, the days of being able to flirt with Towa-kun will begin.</p>



<p>Anywhere, anytime… Mufufu♪!</p>
