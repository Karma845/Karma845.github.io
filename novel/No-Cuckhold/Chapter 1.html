<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>[I was robbed of everything.]</p>



<p>Do you know a game with such a title?</p>



<p>As you may have guessed from the name, this is what is commonly referred to as an eroge game, and the genre is classified as &#8220;cuckoldry&#8221;.</p>



<p>The story centers around an ordinary protagonist, and the women who gather under the protagonist&#8217;s care are taken away one after another by the male cocksuckers in an indescribably dominant scenario.</p>



<p>The heroine of such games is usually a familiar childhood friend or a classmate encountered at school, and is usually a relatively single person.</p>



<p>In this game, however, there are five heroines, in other words, women who are corrupted by a man who is different from the hero.</p>



<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the game targets a wide range of people, including childhood friends, senpai, juniors, younger sisters, and mothers.</p>



<p>In the beginning, the game depicts the heroines and their friendly daily lives, but as the story progresses, dark clouds gradually begin to loom over the story, and the promise of a cuckold game awaits the player with open arms.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>The beautiful illustrations, the excellent performances of the voice actors, and the sequence of events in which beautiful women are transformed into hideous figures have been quite popular and were the talk of the town on social networking sites for a while.</p>



<p>In particular, the scene in which the main heroine, Ayana Otonashi, has fallen broke the hearts of many players.</p>



<p>The character of Ayana had a reason to make players feel a great sense of loss that was not felt by other heroines.</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, Ayana had only one H scene.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike other heroines, Ayana stayed by the side of the protagonist throughout the game.</p>



<p>Ayana is depicted at the center of the game&#8217;s package, and although she is a childhood friend who is the first to be taken from him in a cuckold game, there is not the slightest hint of such a scene with her.</p>



<p>Perhaps Ayana was not a cuckold heroine from the beginning, or perhaps she was a new character that would bring some relief to the cuckold genre, but either way, there must have been some players who held out some hope.</p>



<p>Buying a cuckold genre eroge means that the player has such a taste, but even so, Ayana&#8217;s existence was still very different from the others.</p>



<p>However, as the story comes to a close, that hope is shattered.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In the aforementioned one-time sex scene, Ayana has already fallen far from the beautiful figure she had shown in the past &#8212;- in other words, she has already dropped.</p>



<p>Moreover, the man with whom Ayana was having sex was a man who was a close friend of the protagonist, whom he considered to be closer to than any of his friends.</p>



<p>The main character was shocked by the disappearance of the women he had been close to and the cruelty of their appearance, but the game ended with Ayana&#8217;s appearance, which was completely irredeemable for the main character, and many players, similar to the main character, were brokenhearted by this unexpected turn of events. The game ends there, and many players, just like the protagonist, were broken by the unexpected turn of events.</p>



<p>Although it is a common genre of cuckoldry, the heroine is a beautiful childhood friend who is not depicted as a fallen woman until the very end of the game. Ayana Otonashi became very popular.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;……Fue&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, after I finished babbling in my head about things I have nothing to say to anyone, I let out a big sigh.</p>



<p>Where I&#8217;m standing now is the path leading to the high school, and what I&#8217;m doing is simply waiting for someone.</p>



<p>After passing the time with my phone in hand for a while, I see a man and a woman out of the corner of my eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>They were the two people I was waiting for, and as soon as they caught sight of me waiting patiently, they came running up to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting!&#8221;</p>



<p>The first person who said so was a boy who gave the impression of being lazy, and his name was Shu Sasaki.</p>



<p>The girl standing next to Shu was beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry for being late. I&#8217;m sorry, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the second time, the girl is beautiful.</p>



<p>Her long, shiny black hair was silky and shimmering in the wind without a single hair break, and she had a well-defined face, but most impressive of all was her gentle gaze.</p>



<p>Her style is also out of this high school age girl&#8217;s league, as can be seen from her ample bulge that naturally draws one&#8217;s eyes to it even from above her clothes.</p>



<p>Her name is Ayana Otonashi, yes, that Ayana Otonashi.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(……I wonder why she is like this. How did I end up like this?)</p>



<p>I muttered tiredly in my mind as I was being stared at by the two people.</p>



<p>Ayana Otonashi &#8212; I was surprised that she has the exact same name as the heroine from the eroge I talked about at length earlier, and to top it off, she has the exact same appearance.</p>



<p>It was unbelievable, but I had experienced a reincarnation.</p>



<p>In this case, it might be more appropriate to call it a possession rather than a reincarnation, but when I woke up a little while ago, I was in this body.</p>



<p>At first, I was naturally confused, but to my horror, the confusion quickly subsided and my brain accepted the situation.</p>



<p>It was as if the will of the world itself had interfered and told me not to worry about such things.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the memories of this body&#8217;s owner are still present, and I have no trouble understanding how I spent my daily life.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s not that I remember everything, and I still can&#8217;t recall the details of how close I am to the two people standing in front of me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But even so, I clearly understood that this was the world of &#8220;I was robbed of everything,&#8221; and I knew who I was and what I was like.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana urged me to move my feet.</p>



<p>The name she mentioned was my current name, Towa.</p>



<p>(…… Shu, Ayana, and Towa)</p>



<p>Shu Sasaki is the hero of this world and Ayana Otonashi is the heroine.</p>



<p>I, Towa Yukishiro, am Towa&#8217;s best friend, and what that means is that I&#8217;m the guy who cuckolds Ayana from Shu.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but stare at Ayana&#8217;s face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing. Let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was so nervous that she looked at me strangely, but I told her to go quickly and started walking.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Haa&#8221;</p>



<p>I sighed and wondered how this had happened.</p>



<p>Hey God, whether it&#8217;s reincarnation or possession, I think this kind of thing deserves something more deserving.</p>



<p>The so-called otherworldly fantasy world of swords and magic is supposed to be the high road, but what does a cuckold genre eroge world want from me?</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa~? You&#8217;re behind~?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… something really happened, right?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The two guys who were walking ahead of me worried about me again.</p>



<p>Aside from Shu, who knows me well as my best friend, Ayana was glancing at me as I was slightly behind.</p>



<p>She is indeed a heroine, and it seems that her kindness is not only directed at Shu but also at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;ll follow you, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying this, Shu turned his head forward, but Ayana still seemed to be concerned about me.</p>



<p>When I told her with a crack of my mouth that it really was okay, Ayana finally nodded her head and started walking forward again.</p>



<p>&#8220;……At any rate, I already know that this world is a world of eroticism. If that&#8217;s the case, then there&#8217;s only one thing for me to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have no intention of interrupting the two people who are talking amicably in front of me.</p>



<p>Chronologically, the story will begin a year from now, which means there is still a little time left before the story begins to unfold.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I have no interest in cuckoldry. Neither is it my hobby.&#8221;</p>



<p>I bought the game in a previous life simply because it was a hot topic.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m confident in saying that I don&#8217;t like cuckolds or cuckoldry, and in fact, I loathe it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-3.png?fit=377%2C536&amp;ssl=1"  /></noscript></figure></div>


<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, what are you doing after school today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm~, I don&#8217;t think I have anything to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Towa~!&#8221;</p>



<p>On the way to school, Shu and Ayana would mainly talk and I would join in if they wanted to talk to me.</p>



<p>After repeating this, Shu seemed to need to go to the bathroom and ran into a nearby convenience store.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I bet he is pooping&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Well, there&#8217;s no need to be embarrassed, because everyone does it.</p>



<p>But when it comes to this, it was going to be a bit of a wait.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to wait a little bit, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess….so?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was startled to hear Ayana&#8217;s voice so close to me.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, Ayana was standing right next to me, and she quickly took my hand and held it in hers.</p>



<p>I was so thrilled by this shell-connection, as lovers often do, that I forgot my own position and let my gaze wander over to Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Fufu♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Her smile is so beautiful that it stimulates a man&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what she is thinking, but for some reason I feel somewhat relieved to be in contact with her right now.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s warm. Towa-kun&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana once untied my hand and wrapped it in both of hers, muttering to herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Ayana, I&#8217;m going to go buy some juice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah….I will come too&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand the inexplicable yet incredibly ticklish atmosphere, so I pulled my hand away from Ayana&#8217;s and went inside the convenience store.</p>



<p>I bought some juice and put it in my bag, just as Shu was coming out of the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you buy juice?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ll have some at recess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll get one too.&#8221;</p>



<p>The three of us bought some drinks together and walked out of the convenience store and back to the school.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… what was that about earlier?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was still bewildered by Ayana&#8217;s sudden change, her sudden closeness to me.</p>



<p>The only thing is that Ayana is now walking next to him because Shu is there and they are having a friendly conversation exactly the same way as before.</p>



<p>In the end, I headed off to school, still puzzled by what had just happened.</p>



<p>I was late getting into the classroom, but Shu was lying motionless on his desk, and Ayana was standing out in the middle of the group, talking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Yukishiro-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yoo.&#8221;</p>



<p>I greeted my classmates back and sat down in my seat.</p>



<p>As I was taking my study materials out of my bag, I thought back to the fact that compared to Ayana, who is surrounded by many friends, Shu tends to be alone more often than not.</p>



<p>Ayana is the sunny one, while Shu is the negative one.</p>



<p>Ayana is beautiful, good-natured, and kind, so there is no reason for her not to be popular, and Shu, who gets along well with her, is not considered very pleasant to be around.</p>



<p>(Ayana helps Shu out of trouble and chastises him for it a couple of times.)</p>



<p>Ayana has helped Shu many times because he is her precious childhood friend.</p>



<p>At the same time as helping him, Ayana also earnestly asks him to stop doing such things, so Shu has not been particularly isolated until now.</p>



<p>Well, even though there are some people who were scolding Ayana for it, they still look at Shu with jealous eyes when Ayana makes lunch boxes for him…</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I suddenly remembered something.</p>



<p>(…… No, it was also Towa who was also being blamed)</p>



<p>There was indeed a scene in the game recollection where Towa was also lined up with Ayana to deal with the harassment against Shu.</p>



<p>From Shu&#8217;s point of view, Towa is really a person of character.</p>



<p>He helped Shu, gave him advice, and even helped him and Ayana develop a relationship.</p>



<p>However, the fact that such a reliable best friend of Shu&#8217;s was actually having a physical relationship with Ayana was a real surprise to me when I first played the game.</p>



<p>[It has to be Towa-kun♡ I don&#8217;t need such an annoying and pathetic childhood friend ♡.]</p>



<p>These were the words that Shu heard when he witnessed the act between Ayana and Towa.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The game comes to an end with Shu leaving the scene in despair after hearing these words.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what happened to Shu, who was told that he was no longer needed by the girl he loved and trusted, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s not a good ending.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it is true that he&#8217;s an oaf.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Ayana mentioned, it is not wrong to say that Shu is a bit of a wimp.</p>



<p>One wonders why Shu is so popular with so many women who like him but do not think deeply about it and just go with the flow, but it is a game setting, so there is no point in quibbling about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was comparing reality and the game in this way, my eyes met Ayana&#8217;s. She looked happy that our eyes met and waved her hand.</p>



<p>She waved her hand at me with a fluttering smile, happy that our eyes met, and I waved back, feeling my mouth relax a little.</p>



<p>I glanced back at the people around me as well as at Ayana and took my gaze off of them, but apparently that wasn&#8217;t the answer Ayana wanted.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana got up from her seat and came to my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Usually you come over here, but lately you haven&#8217;t been coming at all. I thought there were days like this, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to continue like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah~&#8221;</p>



<p>I see, it seems that Towa was in that group.</p>



<p>Unlike the main character Shu, Towa&#8217;s friendships were never mentioned in the game, and there was no text about him leaving the group, so I was unaware of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it would be nice to spend some time together in peace and quiet. Ayana doesn&#8217;t have to worry about me either, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Since I am now inside of Towa, it is not strange that I do not act the same way as Towa used to.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Well, Ayana has no way of knowing that, so it&#8217;s a difficult story.</p>



<p>I had meant it in the sense that she should spend more time on Shu rather than worrying about me, but Ayana&#8217;s reaction was a little odd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? What do you mean I shouldn&#8217;t care ……? Why did you say that?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled my face in close to hers.</p>



<p>I was so close to her that we were staring at each other, and people around us were looking at each other, wondering what was going on.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to. …… Please don&#8217;t say that. It&#8217;s impossible for me not to care about Towa-kun,……!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Uhm…&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana looked as if she was about to burst into tears.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I couldn&#8217;t understand why Ayana had such a look on her face, but since Shu was in the same classroom, I decided to calm her down, thinking that staring at such a distance would give an unintended misunderstanding.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was sorry. I just wasn&#8217;t in the mood. I like the bustle of the place, but I don&#8217;t like the quiet either. If you want, Ayana can come over here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I can spend my time quietly, and Ayana smiled as soon as I told her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t tell me not to worry about you. I was about to lose my mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I can breathe a sigh of relief when I see the smile on Ayana&#8217;s face, but I wonder what kind of feelings she really has for Towa.</p>



<p>The story itself has not started yet and Towa has not done anything to her. That&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t understand Ayana&#8217;s feelings that she was so desperate, including about the morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;But after all, socializing with classmates is important, so if you feel like it, Towa-kun can come over here too, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana nodded at me and turned her back to me, seemingly satisfied.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s funny that I said that, but for some reason I couldn&#8217;t help but reach out to Ayana as she moved away from me.</p>



<p>It was as if my body was seeking Ayana, but I shook my head and averted my gaze from her.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I feel tired somehow&#8221;</p>



<p>I mumbled and leaned my back against the back of the chair as hard as I could.</p>



<p>I was relaxing like that, when a hand was placed on my shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yoo, It&#8217;s rare to see you alone&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Aisaka huh.&#8221;</p>



<p>The person who put his hand on my shoulder and spoke to me was Takashi Aisaka, a student in the same class and a friend I talk to to a certain extent because we are seated close to each other.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The most distinctive feature of Aisaka is his round-cropped head.</p>



<p>He is a member of the baseball club and seems to be quite good and active.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Fumu&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked at Aisaka, who looked at me and nodded, and I looked at him.</p>



<p>Aisaka put his hand on his chin and thought for a moment, then looked straight back into my eyes and said something.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed a little? I don&#8217;t know exactly what&#8217;s changed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka was a baseball fool, but he also had a sharp point of view.</p>



<p>I shrugged my shoulders at those words and gave a wry smile, then retorted like this.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ve become a completely different person on the inside?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha! Even you would say something like that only in a manga! How can such a thing exist in this reality?&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka&#8217;s words made me nod my head in agreement.</p>



<p>Well, that can&#8217;t be reality is happening to me right now, but it&#8217;s not something I can explain to anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The moment I tell anyone about it, I&#8217;ll probably end up being labeled as a crazy person.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah, Sasaki-kun is getting involved with Otonashi-san again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka said this as he looked away from me, and I followed his gaze.</p>



<p>Ayana was supposed to have been in the circle of friends earlier, but before I knew it, she was standing by Shu&#8217;s side, taking care of him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Shu seemed embarrassed when Ayana pointed out that he had a clear mark on his cheekbone, probably from sleeping with his face down.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really understand. Why does Otonashi-san care about Sasaki-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve known each other since childhood. Being close is a good thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two of them have been friends for a long time, and they are bound to be together if I&#8217;m not involved.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so. But unlike Sasaki-kun, good-looking people get what&#8217;s coming to them when you&#8217;re around Otonashi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good looking?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… are you for real?&#8221;</p>



<p>Aisaka looked at me with a puzzled look as I asked him back.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Ah, so that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>I clapped my hands with a pop and was convinced.</p>



<p>My body now belongs to a character named Towa Yukishiro, who is quite handsome in my opinion.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought about that since I&#8217;ve been in this body, but apparently I should be happy because I&#8217;m apparently pretty good looking now.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>While I was talking with Aisaka, I was looking at Ayana who was taking care of Shu. …… For a moment, just a moment, Ayana seemed to have a terribly inorganic look in her eyes.</p>



<p>I tilted my head for a while to see Ayana&#8217;s eyes, which were clearly different from the ones she had been looking at me with.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Time flew by and it was time for lunch break.</p>



<p>As soon as the teacher who had just been in charge of the class left the classroom, the desks rattled and groups of students formed to have lunch.</p>



<p>As I took out the lunch box my mother had made for me from my bag, I heard a beautiful voice in the classroom that sounded like a bell being rung.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse me. Is Sasaki here?&#8221;</p>



<p>The classroom, which had been quite noisy, became quiet as soon as the voice echoed.</p>



<p>The voice was coming from the entrance of the classroom, where a female student was looking around the classroom, looking very regal.</p>



<p>To say that the girl is a stranger at this school might be a bit of an exaggeration, but considering her position, it is hard to say that she is generally wrong.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She is the president of this school and her name is Iori Honjo, a senior girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah, there she is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iori Honjo &#8211; let&#8217;s call her Iori for a moment, since it&#8217;s been so long &#8212;- having found Shu, she heads straight for him, but in the meantime, several boys try to stand up to talk to her, but all of them stop, as if they have given up.</p>



<p>The reason for this is that Iori&#8217;s cold atmosphere overwhelms them, making it difficult for them to talk to her.</p>



<p>But even Iori&#8217;s expression relaxed slightly when she saw Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with you not responding right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……No, I just felt like I might get into some trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Shu-kun. Can you come with me? Take your lunch box with you&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about my veto&#8212;&#8220;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;No&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My veto….&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no veto, or so he was told, and Shu let out a big sigh and stood up.</p>



<p>He looked at me and Ayana, but I guess he didn&#8217;t want to disobey Iori any further under the circumstances, so he was quietly taken away.</p>



<p>As I watched their backs as they disappeared, I felt a gaze fixed on me, and I turned my attention toward it.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Ah~&#8221;</p>



<p>The true identity of the gaze is Ayana.</p>



<p>She was holding her bento with both hands and staring at me, while her friends on either side of her giggled and smiled at her.</p>



<p>I felt the steel in Ayana&#8217;s eyes that she would not eat lunch unless I asked her to, and I beckoned her to come over.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>At that moment, with a big smile on her face, she ran up to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it, Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you already know it, dont you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand unless you tell me. I&#8217;m an idiot.&#8221;</p>



<p>If Ayana, who ranks in the top single digits in her class in every regular test, is an idiot, then most of the class, including me, are brain dead.</p>



<p>I get up from my chair and make room for Ayana to sit by borrowing the empty seat next to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we eat together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes♪&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a wonderful smile that could make the opposite sex fall in love with her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(……The destructive power is too much)</p>



<p>I&#8217;m on the verge of sinking into the energetic reply and the smile that seems to captivate everyone.</p>



<p>Even though I understand what&#8217;s going on in this world and have sworn not to interfere with the two of them, I still get nervous when I see a smile like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing. Let&#8217;s eat quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, I started having lunch with Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was so excited. Yesterday&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh. That&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>I was eating my lunch while chatting with Ayana, but apart from the girl in front of me, I was thinking again about Iori from earlier.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(Iori Honjo, …… A cuckold heroine in the senior slot)</p>



<p>Yes, Iori is another one of the heroines in this world.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know how she came to like Shu or not, but even so, that cold beautiful student council president recognizes Shu as an equal friend and her feelings should sublimate into a love affair between now and the beginning of the original story.</p>



<p>However, the scenario of eroge is a tough one, because even such a girl will eventually be cuckolded.</p>



<p>(As I recall, she goes off to college and joins a yarisaki club. It happens all the time.) [TL: university club for socializing and having s*x]</p>



<p>It is a common practice in the erotic entertainment industry to join a yarisaki club and be assaulted.</p>



<p>The story starts off on a high note in the eroge industry: a girl joins a yarisui club without realizing that it is such a club, is given a considerable amount of alcohol at a drinking party, and then is photographed while she is asleep.</p>



<p>There are many things I would like to say, such as to be on the lookout for such a circle, or to do some research about it beforehand, but basically, erotic heroines tend to have a few screws in their heads, so it&#8217;s useless.</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I was sorting through the information about Iori in my head, I felt something touch my feet and I looked up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ehehe♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was taking off her slippers and rubbing her own foot against my foot.</p>



<p>It tickles a little bit, and if anything, it&#8217;s very embarrassing to have this done in the classroom.</p>



<p>The other classmates didn&#8217;t pay any attention to what was going on under the desk, so it was completely just me and Ayana.</p>



<p>(……Why is Ayana so …… appealing?)</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-4.png?fit=520%2C739&amp;ssl" /></noscript></figure></div>


<p>Ayana&#8217;s gaze at me is somewhat passionate,……I don&#8217;t know if this gaze is called hot because I have no experience with it, but even so, there must surely be a meaning to this gaze that stares at me while touching my body like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ayana?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes. What is it♪&#8221;</p>



<p>When I called out her name, Ayana leaned in to close the distance between us.</p>



<p>The two desks are between us, so it is impossible for her to get close to me. Still, if I reached out my hand, even just a little bit, I could touch Ayana&#8217;s cheek.</p>



<p>&#8220;……..Ayana&#8217;s bento looks delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? My bento?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a hard time for me to stare at her.</p>



<p>I was not averse to being stared at by a beautiful girl like Ayana, of course, but I knew that in a classroom setting it would stand out and might make Shu feel uncomfortable later on, so I forced the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you like to try some?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>I decided to have an omelette as the lunch box was presented to me.</p>



<p>I was so excited that I could not wait to see what she had in the box.</p>



<p>So, this is truly Ayana&#8217;s homemade lunch box.</p>



<p>&#8220;Amu……mogu……yeah, it&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The omelet that Ayana gave me was moderately sweet and right to my taste.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you like, I can make Towa-kun&#8217;s lunch too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For real?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>For high school boys, a handmade lunch box made by a girl is something they yearn for.</p>



<p>I had a temptation dangling in front of me that made my heart flutter a little, but I still didn&#8217;t nod my head.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I&#8217;ll pass. My mom seems to enjoy making bento every day, and she says it&#8217;s more fun to make than anything else.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was a little reserved, but that was the main reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Of course. It&#8217;s a little disappointing, but I don&#8217;t think I can compete with the taste of that bento.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s true that it was delicious, you know? I would eat it anytime if I could.&#8221;</p>



<p>These were words without any falsehoods or pretenses.</p>



<p>After Ayana thought about something, she whispered something like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, please call me anytime. For Master&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll always head over there♪&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… Master?&#8221;</p>



<p>Who&#8217;s master…….</p>



<p>Ayana, whether or not she knew I was stunned or not, continued to speak with a slight flush on her cheeks, which caused me no small amount of bewilderment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master is Master. Even if you try to treat me like anything other than just a bento, it&#8217;s totally fine… Kyaa♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>I am not trying to be clueless, but I don&#8217;t have any idea what she just said.</p>



<p>When I hear Ayana&#8217;s words and consider her appeal, or her touch on my body, I feel like something is connecting.</p>



<p>(…… I don&#8217;t think so, but Towa Yukishiro? You&#8217;re not going to tell me that you&#8217;ve already done something to her, are you?)</p>



<p>I shouted grandly in my mind.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana went back to her normal self soon after that, but I had to think about it for a long time.</p>

<p><b>TL: Changing name of Shiyuu to Shu</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>Then lunch break was over and the first lesson of the afternoon was PE.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re having PE right after lunch, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. Can&#8217;t they think a little more about it….&#8221;</p>



<p>After lunch, there was still some food in my stomach, so I was not interested in having PE as the first class of the afternoon if at all possible.</p>



<p>Still, there was nothing we could do about it by complaining about the schedule, so we had to take the class quietly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad it looks so easy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The main part of the physical education class is mainly exercise, but today we are going to exercise indoors, so the place was switched to the gymnasium.</p>



<p>The other students were delighted to see the netting in the middle of the gymnasium, where the boys and girls were divided into groups to play their favorite ball games.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;In other words, it&#8217;s bonus time!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not that we&#8217;re skipping it, but it&#8217;s kind of like a break!&#8221;</p>



<p>Since not everyone in the class can play any ball game at the same time, the class is inevitably divided into those who are physically active and those who are not.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……You really are.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apart from my classmates who were sweating volleyball in the court, there was Shu beside me in the rest group.</p>



<p>Shu did not see the boys exercising, but glanced at the girls on the other side of the net.</p>



<p>(Well, I don&#8217;t know how I feel about it.)</p>



<p>It is correct that Shu&#8217;s target is definitely Ayana, but the other girls are also at a moderately high standard because they are in the world of games,…… No, they are all high standard.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Many of them are not only cute and pretty, but also outstanding in style.</p>



<p>It goes without saying, but the one who shines the brightest among them is none other than Ayana, whom Shu is staring at intently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you that interested in her?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Towa…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu said to me as he squared his shoulders with a stiff grip.</p>



<p>He would not answer to any of his other classmates, but since he was dealing with me, Shu nodded and nodded without any particular concern.</p>



<p>While thinking that he&#8217;s an honest guy, he&#8217;s not tactful enough to pay attention to me because we&#8217;re in the middle of a class,……, In the first place, there are a lot of boys who are looking at the girls and expressing their excitement, in addition to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, Ayana is beautiful whenever I look at her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Yes, she really is.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Nodding at my words, Shu turned his attention to Ayana again.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Good grief&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned my gaze to Ayana as I followed Shu, but seeing her like this reminded me of the lunch break we had just had.</p>



<p>Although the true meaning of her words and gestures are still a mystery, from my perspective as a mere bystander, Ayana really did seem like a beautiful and lovely girl.</p>



<p>Ayana is currently working hard at basketball with her classmates, and the mere movement of her body causes her large breasts to jiggle in the eyes of the opposite sex, and not only Shu but also the other boys are fascinated by this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wawaaa…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu, who blushes and is embarrassed but does not avert his gaze firmly, is a quirky guy.</p>



<p>Seeing Shu like that, I grinned and whispered in his ear.</p>



<p>&#8220;What cups do you think Ayana has?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Uhm …… Hmm?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha, you&#8217;re way too surprised&#8221;</p>



<p>The look on Shu&#8217;s face was so funny that I laughed and quivered my shoulders, wondering what I was suddenly asking him.</p>



<p>With no girls nearby, and because we are not strangers to each other, I can ask this kind of thing …… Well, whether or not Towa was talking about this kind of thing with Shu, I am the owner of this body now, so I can be forgiven for this kind of playful attitude!</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm……… you sometimes look at Ayana that way too, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Does that mean I can&#8217;t look at Ayana in a lewd way no matter what?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably what Shu meant when he said those words, but I&#8217;m a guy too. Even though I don&#8217;t look at girls in an obvious and lewd way, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t think about them in my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a man, too. Of course I would do something like that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I see. …… that&#8217;s right. There is nothing strange about it.</p>



<p>Yes, there&#8217;s nothing strange about it.</p>



<p>I was standing alongside Shu, watching Ayana play basketball, while listening to the excitement of the boys and girls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana receives the ball from her teammate and shoots a beautiful parabolic shot.</p>



<p>As her teammates gathered around her and shared their joy, she turned her attention to me and Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We made eye contact.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He should have at least waved back, but he looked down, perhaps feeling embarrassed that he had been noticed watching, and I let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>You should at least wave at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Y-yes&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu discreetly waved his hand, and I followed suit, waving to Ayana.</p>



<p>Ayana smiled even more, and after saying something to her teammates, she approached us.</p>



<p>It seems that Ayana is going to take a break now, just like the rest of us, just in time for a change of team members.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good work, Ayana. Are you taking a break now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll leave the rest to them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana then moved under the net to this side of the room and sat down there, sandwiched between me and Shu.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s coming to this side was not a problem, and since gym class would soon be over, more and more people, both men and women, were free to do whatever they wanted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Sasaki! You haven&#8217;t done anything today, so switch places!&#8221;</p>



<p>He was walking to the court, but then he turned around and looked at us as if he was sorry for leaving us behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hang in there, you&#8217;re almost there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Just a little more exercise and you&#8217;ll be done.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>I chuckled at his reluctance, but Ayana and I were all together looking away from Shu&#8217;s back.</p>



<p>After that, Ayana stayed by my side for a short time until the physical education class ended……but I glanced at her profile.</p>



<p>(…… She really does have a beautiful face, this girl.)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Although I have been thinking about the morning and about her master&#8217;s comment, Ayana has enough charm to make me think that such thoughts don&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>The fact that her hair is sticking to her skin after a workout, perhaps due to sweat, makes her look strangely glamorous, and I think Ayana smells good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….No&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder if she would have noticed me even if I had been staring at her gently since I was at such a close distance.</p>



<p>I was not sure what I should say to her, and then I blurted out something like this in a straightforward manner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you looked sexy when you are sweating, and you smelled …… good, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said exactly what I was thinking with all my might, and I was surprised that I didn&#8217;t panic …… and was strangely calm myself.</p>



<p>Ayana was momentarily taken aback, but then she gave me a meaningful look with a chuckle and a shiver on her shoulder.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to smell it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana said as she scooped up a handful of her long hair and showed off the nape of her neck.</p>



<p>Normally, a girl wouldn&#8217;t like the smell of sweat, but Ayana doesn&#8217;t seem to care about it at all… Well, her cheeks are slightly red, so maybe she does care about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I had not expected such a proposal, but to save me from freezing up, the chime rang to signal the end of class.</p>



<p>Ayana kept staring at me for a while, but then she muttered a few words of regret and let her hair down.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered while trying not to let Shuu notice my excitement, and I parted ways with Ayana and returned to the classroom… I&#8217;m really excited by each of Ayana&#8217;s actions, and I realized again how amazing she is.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>(……There are so many things to think about. But …… Ayana is too erotic).</p>



<p>The thoughts that I could never say to her to her face leaked out in my mind.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s completely purely my impression as a player of the game, not as Towa, but no one should be able to come up with any other words than this when looking at that Ayana.</p>



<p>Of course, she is erotic because she is the heroine of an eroge, but… the erotism that is produced by someone else&#8217;s hands is not as impressive as the erotism that she exudes herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;…What am I thinking by myself?&#8221;</p>



<p>But in a way I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;m a boy too.</p>



<p>I was so sleepy that I felt like I was going to fall unconscious the rest of the class time.</p>



<p>After trying my best not to fall asleep, I was about to finish the end-of-term assembly when an event awaited me that, in a sense, I knew was coming.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, that Sasaki guy is on a roll, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard him muttering something like that.</p>
