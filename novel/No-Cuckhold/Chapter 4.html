<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ayana PoV</strong></>

<p>[Not only can I not thank you, but for whatever reason, I hate Mom for uttering those awful, awful words.…… I don&#8217;t even want to think that I have the same blood in my veins as you.]</p>



<p>When I said that, my mother looked at me as if in utter shock. It was as though she hadn&#8217;t even remotely expected me to say such a thing, or to hear those words coming from me. Despite the guilt I felt, there was a sense of satisfaction that I had said it rather than a sense of wrongdoing.</p>



<p>But… Towa-kun moved to help my mother.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ll go too. Ayana&#8217;s mother may not think highly of me, but she&#8217;s still your mother, and that&#8217;s reason enough to help her. Ayana, stay here.]</p>



<p>Towa-kun didn&#8217;t know about the terrible things my mother had said, but he knew she didn&#8217;t have a good opinion of him. Even so, Towa-kun, being kind as he is, didn&#8217;t hesitate to help my mother. Despite being told to wait, I couldn&#8217;t help but act and kick the man in his vulnerable spot.</p>



<p>[Get lost already.]</p>



<p>I was desperate, and that&#8217;s why such strong words came naturally to me. I had kept it hidden all this time, but for the first time, I showed it in front of Towa-kun, my mother, and my classmate. To be honest, I felt more embarrassed than relieved for doing it, but there was still a little sense of relief.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>If asked whether I liked or disliked my mother, I could firmly say that I disliked her. She had raised me, and I knew she had been through a lot due to my father&#8217;s infidelity and the subsequent divorce. But Towa-kun was far more important to me than any of those things!</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey there! What&#8217;s Ayana-chan thinking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kyaa!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Was it because I was lost in thought that Akemi-san, who had somehow appeared behind me, embraced me. Not only did she embrace me, but she also started massaging my bre*sts without reservation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Akemi-san! I&#8217;m washing dishes right now!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, then, let&#8217;s stop for a bit and have some quality time together~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I stop, it&#8217;ll never end!&#8221;</p>



<p>I said so in a slightly raised voice, and Akemi-san pouted and backed away.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m the one who needs to be sulked like that&#8230;. but since she&#8217;s also Towa&#8217;s mother and my favorite person too, Akemi-san&#8217;s appearance like this is also very cute and adorable, a gap from her usual appearance.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>(I wanted to take a bath with Towa-kun…)</p>



<p>When I come to Towa-kun&#8217;s house, I want to be by his side as much as possible. I&#8217;d even say I&#8217;d want that in any place except the bathroom. Is that normal?</p>



<p>I tried to convince myself, and I expected to be able to sleep next to him at night.</p>



<p>I thought I was quite a maiden, I suppose.</p>



<p>I was a bit intoxicated, so I resumed household chores in place of Akemi-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-chan, are you really okay with not helping out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. You&#8217;ve already prepared the meal, so let me do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm… Ayana-chan, you might be the only one who can save Towa from becoming a useless human. He should be careful, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d welcome Towa-kun becoming a &#8220;useless&#8221; person if that means he&#8217;ll never leave my side, and I&#8217;ll have to take care of him. Isn&#8217;t that the best future plan?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Well, I think Towa would never let himself become a &#8216;useless&#8217; person, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>Akemi-san laughed heartily.</p>



<p>I completely agreed with her opinion. Towa-kun would never let himself rely on others entirely. If he had any troubles, he would share them, and if he was worried, he would seek advice.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>I suddenly changed my expression, and Akemi-san noticed.</p>



<p>I put on my best smile, as if to dispel her suspicion, but she continued to stare at me while sipping her beer.</p>



<p>I felt a little uneasy.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Towa-kun shares his troubles, and he interacts with me at school. This was something I realized through recent events.</p>



<p>&#8220;I… I…&#8221;</p>



<p>Not just Towa-kun but also Shu-kun said the same thing to me. They said it seemed like I was really enjoying my interactions with them, and that they sensed my happiness from it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I had fun… I enjoyed those interactions…&#8221;</p>



<p>I had to admit it. When I was interacting with them, I felt a sense of enjoyment. Even though they should have been nothing more than stage props to make Shu-kun despair, that perception hadn&#8217;t changed.</p>



<p>(If that&#8217;s the way it should be, but why ……?)</p>



<p>I stopped washing the dishes, shook my head, and thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m wrong, I&#8217;m wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>Doing this could make Towa-kun worry when he returns from the bath, just like at the café, and I&#8217;d make him uncomfortable again. I don&#8217;t want that. I always want Towa-kun to see me with a smile on my face!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-chan, stop.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My hand, which had been washing dishes, was tightly held by Akemi-san.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t the Akemi-san who had been drinking beer contentedly a moment ago. Now she was standing beside me, looking at me seriously.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know I handed it over to you earlier, but I&#8217;ll take care of the rest. Ayana-chan, take a break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Take a break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>Uh, it&#8217;s not like I meant that, but I was genuinely scared by her serious stare.</p>



<p>I entrusted the remaining dishes to Akemi-san and sat down where Akemi-san had been sitting before. I kept an eye on her. Well, she is drunk now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayana-chan.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been briefly hearing about what happened from Towa. You really said something quite bold, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t told Towa-kun not to talk to anyone about it, and, more than that, it was very unusual for him to stay overnight on a day when we had school the next day. So it was quite natural for him to talk to Akemi-san for that reason.</p>



<p>But personally, I didn&#8217;t want Akemi-san to know. I didn&#8217;t want to be thought of as barbaric or mean, and I didn&#8217;t want to leave a bad impression. It could affect my future, you know!</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… Was I too harsh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see… If Towa said the same thing to me, I think I&#8217;d rather die.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh…&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked down, feeling downcast, and Akemi-san smiled wryly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Just as she finished washing the dishes, she wiped her hands and took mine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we move to the sofa? That way, I can hold you more closely, Ayana-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um…&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, it suddenly feels ominous… Towa-kun, please come back soon!</p>



<p>I can just imagine Towa-kun right now, relaxing in the bath with the perfect water temperature.</p>



<p>As soon as I sat down on the sofa, Akemi-san embraced me firmly, and the smell of alcohol stung my nostrils.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about the alcohol smell.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sure it bothers you, but it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s Akemi-san, after all.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I get that &#8216;It can&#8217;t be helped&#8217; look, I feel like I should distance myself suddenly.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Fufu, no worries!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to be concerned about the smell, but Akemi-san&#8217;s pleasant scent was also mixed in. Plus, I liked it when Akemi-san held me like this. I hugged her back tightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really cute, Ayana-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that, Akemi-san patted my head, and I couldn&#8217;t help but recall my childhood. I used to be comforted like this by my mom. It felt like I had experienced that a lot, especially before I met Towa-kun.</p>



<p>But even with that past in mind, I couldn&#8217;t help but think:</p>



<p>&#8220;How happy would I be if Akemi-san were my mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>I let slip such words without even using polite language. Akemi-san might be at a loss when hearing those words out of the blue, but I had genuinely spoken them.</p>



<p>After a brief silence, Akemi-san spoke up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-chan, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re carrying something heavy.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that is. No matter how much I try to express it in words, I doubt you&#8217;ll tell me.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was a painful thing to hear. I considered myself good at hiding my true self. Neither Shu-kun, his mom, Hatsune-san, Kotone-chan, nor anyone else really knew the real me. So I thought I was good at concealing myself. But Towa-kun and Akemi-san saw through it immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;Still, I have a feeling you&#8217;ll be okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Akemi-san gazed at me with a gentle look in her eyes as I raised my head.</p>



<p>Despite her flashy appearance that could intimidate some people, she was a genuinely kind mom when looking at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because Towa is by your side. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d rescue you no matter what situation you&#8217;re in… I have that kind of confidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yeah. And of course, it&#8217;s not just Towa. I&#8217;m always ready to lend a helping hand. So, Ayana-chan, always remember that you&#8217;re not alone. Keep in your heart the fact that there&#8217;s always someone you can rely on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah&#8230; those words are comforting. Yes, I will keep them in my heart.</p>



<p>But all of that can come after everything&#8217;s over—then, I&#8217;ll decide to rely on Towa-kun. Once you&#8217;re assured that there&#8217;s no longer anyone to hurt you, it&#8217;ll be safe to feel that way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Akemi-san…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…May I be a bit spoiled right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>I buried my face in Akemi-san&#8217;s chest, and just as I said, I indulged myself for a while.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back~! Mom, you&#8217;re really spoiling Ayana, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, welcome back, Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Towa. Umm&#8230; I got a bit spoiled.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shortly after, Towa-kun came out of the bath&#8230; and, well, I apologize for the rather eccentric choice of words, but the way he dried his hair with a towel, with his cheeks flushed, was rather sensual, and it made my heart race.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana-chan is giving off a scent of mating!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What are you talking about?!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fine for me to flirt with Towa-kun on my own&#8230; but to have it noticed and pointed out by his mother, Akemi-san, was embarrassing enough to make me want to disappear on the spot.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about&#8230;? Ayana, go take your bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood&#8230;!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Towa-kun probably sensed that I was feeling embarrassed, so he kindly urged me to go to the bath. I nodded in agreement and quickly stood up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana seems like a guest, huh? There are some pajamas and underwear placed here. I forgot because it&#8217;s too common.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thanks to the kindness of Towa-kun and Akemi-san, I have several sets of underwear and pajamas stored here, so I can have a spontaneous overnight stay like today without any problems</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aiyo.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Have a safe trip.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just before leaving the living room, I overheard Towa-kun being pestered by Akemi-san, and it was quite amusing. With a chuckle, I headed to the changing room and undressed before entering the bathroom.</p>



<p>While taking a warm shower and feeling the water on my head, I suddenly glanced at the mirror.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>For a moment, I felt like there was someone behind me, wearing a black hood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who…!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Bathrooms are generally places where you relax and let your guard down, so I was startled and quickly turned around. However, there was no one there, and I wondered if I had just imagined it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>But I definitely saw it, clear as day. The face concealed beneath the black hood was probably… mine. It had eyes filled with an endless sense of despair, as if seeking help from someone. I felt like I was looking at myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Is it because I&#8217;m tired?&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if I were tired after everything that had happened today. I was lost in thought for a while, but then hurried to clean myself up because Akemi-san would also need to use the bath later.</p>



<p>By the time I soaked in the tub, I had forgotten about the strange vision I had seen earlier. When I got out of the bath, I was thinking about what Towa-kun and I would do next.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Towa-kun♪&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It seemed like my thought processes significantly deteriorated when it came to Towa-kun.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, this is love, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s all because of love! No matter what anyone says, it&#8217;s because of love!</p>



<p>I made a strong fist inside the bathtub, and I spent my time in the bath healing and thinking only about Towa-kun.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></>

<p>When Ayana stayed over, the question of whose room she&#8217;d sleep in seemed rather unnecessary at this point. I had set up a futon right next to my bed, more in the center of my room, creating an environment where Ayana could sleep comfortably.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to sleep in your bed, Towa-kun…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahaha, I thought so too, but it can&#8217;t hurt to have it ready just in case. We might find it a bit cramped, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… It&#8217;s not painful at all for me to sleep snuggled up with you, and I can&#8217;t imagine giving up such happiness willingly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That much, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana squeezed her hand into a strong fist to emphasize her determination, and I chuckled.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Fumu&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But I crossed my arms and thought for a moment. It was the first time I had invited her to stay in my room since I had become Towa, and it was true that I felt excited and eager to be as close to her as possible right now.</p>



<p>However, more than that, I was overwhelmed by the joy of her being there. Even though this time together was unusual, I felt the most happiness from being able to make eye contact with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana asked, voicing her question, and her smile conveyed that being intently stared at made her happy.</p>



<p>Her smile was not only cute but also seductive, wrapped in her pink pajamas. The full curves underneath emphasized her concealed allure, showcasing a completely different side of her from her usual school uniform or casual clothes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. But more importantly, you seemed to get along really well with my mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh… Yes, that&#8217;s right. We had a very pleasant conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t miss the momentary darkening of Ayana&#8217;s expression, of course. I patted the space next to me on the bed and told her to come here, and she immediately stood up and sat down next to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>I moved my hand, which was initially on her shoulder, to her head and gently stroked her while continuing to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have some idea of what my mother talked to you about. She cares a lot about you, just as I do… don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;m very happy to be thought of in that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although her voice lacked its usual cheer, Ayana said this with a smile.</p>



<p>As we continued to gaze into each other&#8217;s eyes, Ayana suddenly let out a small yelp and picked up the smartphone that had been placed on top of the futon to check something.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought maybe my mother had sent me a message or something, but it seems not.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana would normally be at home, so the fact that there was no message from her could be interpreted as her being too cold or too shocked by something Ayana said. There was no way to confirm that now.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, just as Ayana was gazing at her phone, a call came in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? You can answer it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t answer regardless of who was calling, and I had no intention of saying anything like that. But I was certainly concerned about who it could be.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I wanted to say I didn&#8217;t care at all, but I asked myself not to be concerned. Nonetheless, it appeared that the other person was someone I was concerned about.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&#8212;Shu-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed the person on the other end of the line was Shu, and the conversation seemed like the usual casual talk.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of expression Ayana has on her face as she turns her back to me, but the tone of her voice gives me the impression that she&#8217;s having a somewhat troublesome conversation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Did you need something? You just wanted to talk, right?&#8230; I wonder how much of a freeloader you think I am in your mind, Shu-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu hadn&#8217;t thought of her as a freeloader but simply wanted to chat with Ayana.</p>



<p>With nothing else to do, I decided to read a manga, but then I learned something about my own feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I don&#8217;t like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although I had said it was okay to answer the phone, I was regretting it now.</p>



<p>I realized I was much smaller than I had thought. I had conflicting feelings: one was the feeling that I didn&#8217;t want Ayana to talk to another man while I was there, and the other was the feeling that Shu was interfering with our time.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing right now? I&#8217;m not doing anything special…&#8221;</p>



<p>The two voices, like a devil and an angel whispering from both sides of my head, argued within me. I was responding to the whispers of the devil.</p>



<p>I stood up and walked over to her, still seated on the futon, hugging her back.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Kyaa!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was taken by surprise since she had been relaxed.</p>


<p>By approaching her like this, I can faintly hear Shu&#8217;s voice through the smartphone, but I don&#8217;t pay it any attention as I hold Ayana in my arms tightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing. So …… are we still going to talk about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana, although surprised for a moment, didn&#8217;t complain, didn&#8217;t voice any objections, and didn&#8217;t even protest by hitting my arm.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, I won&#8217;t sleep just yet, right? But it&#8217;s tiring to keep talking on the phone for too long, isn&#8217;t it? I want to relax before sleep, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure Shu hasn&#8217;t even considered that Ayana is in my house. I feel no guilt whatsoever about getting closer to Ayana like this, and I can&#8217;t help but feel somewhat inappropriate emotions while she&#8217;s in my arms.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana&#8217;s voice, full of allure, escapes her as she seems to enjoy my touch from behind.</p>



<p>As I touch her provocatively from behind, I remember a similar scene from a game. I try to recall where that was when Ayana tells Shu goodnight and ends the call.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No more, Towa-kun! I can&#8217;t stand it anymore!&#8221;</p>



<p>She then surprised me by leaning in and kissing me. Her kiss began gently, almost pecking, but it grew more passionate, and our tongues intertwined in no time.</p>



<p>When our lips finally parted, a silvery thread of saliva connected us for a moment before it broke.</p>



<p>&#8220;Doing that during a phone call, Towa-kun, you&#8217;re such a bad boy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Don&#8217;t laugh at me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Right now, it&#8217;s just the two of us&#8230; That&#8217;s why I wanted you to focus on me only.&#8221;</p>



<p>She replied with a clear and honest voice, and Ayana covered her mouth with her hand, giggling.</p>



<p>Her laughter wasn&#8217;t mocking; it was a gaze that was looking only at me. I am Towa, but there&#8217;s another person inside me&#8230; even so, Ayana never doubts that I am Towa.</p>



<p>(…Will I be able to stay here forever&#8230; Or will I disappear once I&#8217;ve fulfilled some kind of purpose&#8230;?)</p>



<p>Thinking about this, I suddenly feel a chill.</p>



<p>I am Towa Yukishiro now, and I believe in it. I have a strong sense of being established in this world as myself. However, by experiencing reincarnation, I have already witnessed the impossible happening—suddenly disappearing and returning to the way things were.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>I placed my hand on Ayana&#8217;s head and pulled her close, wrapping my arm around her back.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to let go of this warmth, I want to be by this girl&#8217;s side; I truly feel that way. She is an important presence for me, and she&#8217;s not just a girl who exists only within a game.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…Towa-kun, this might be the first time you&#8217;ve wanted me so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked at Ayana with surprise.</p>



<p>She gently placed her hand on my cheek and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, I love you very much. I love you so much that I&#8217;d do anything for you, and I truly love you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, she kissed me again, and I pushed her down.</p>



<p>We were on a clean, white futon. I could easily imagine what this futon would look like in a few hours. But I intertwined with her again, my arms outstretched, my eyes slightly moist, and we shared unforgettable moments.</p>



<p>A few hours later, I was looking out of the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s breathing so peacefully…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I watched the adorable sound of her regular breathing as she snuggled under the covers.</p>



<p>She had fallen asleep soon after our passionate encounter, but her determination to sleep with me in bed until the very end seemed to have dissolved.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh, a bit dramatic, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>After chuckling to myself, I returned my gaze to the view outside the window.</p>



<p>The only thing visible from here was the neighboring houses with their lights off and the night sky filled with stars.</p>



<p>&#8220;….&#8221;</p>



<p>However, as I gazed at the night sky, my mood started to calm down.</p>



<p>In the moments after a passionate encounter with Ayana, I found myself gazing out of the window. The view was simple, consisting of neighboring houses with lights turned off and a night sky filled with stars.</p>



<p>The serene atmosphere outside made me realize that my worries were insignificant, perhaps even trivial. However, I knew that I couldn&#8217;t simply dismiss my concerns. I had to address them.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ayana… I love you too. That&#8217;s why I want to protect you. As Towa and as myself, I want to be able to see your smile for a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>I reached for a notebook I had with me, the one where I recorded events and thoughts from the moment I recognized myself in this world. It was like a detailed diary that would be utterly incomprehensible to anyone else, as if I were aspiring to become a novelist.</p>



<p>With a pen in hand, I jotted down a few words: &#8220;To protect Ayana. Because I want to keep seeing her smile.&#8221;</p>



<p>I closed the notebook and moved closer to Ayana, gently caressing her head. She squirmed playfully, and her reaction was incredibly endearing. I could watch her like this forever.</p>



<p>In that moment, I felt a strong desire to be with her, to have her by my side. Her presence was so dear to me that I couldn&#8217;t imagine my life without her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought earlier that I might disappear someday… But no matter what happens, I want to be with you.&#8221; </p>



<p>I admitted with all my heart.</p>



<p>There was one more thing I had been thinking about while making love to Ayana—a sensation that I had almost forgotten. It felt like something within me was on the verge of unlocking, like a sealed door was about to open.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuwaa… I&#8217;m getting sleepy too. We can sleep in bed, but we might as well stay close together…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, just as I was about to continue my sentence, a sudden, excruciating headache hit me.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I clutched my head as pain coursed through it. Bright sparks seemed to fly in front of my eyes. Despite the agony, I witnessed a strange sight.</p>



<p>A black-hooded woman, an unexpected presence, was standing beside Ayana, gazing at me as I touched Ayana&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is…you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>In the midst of enduring the intense pain in my head, I couldn&#8217;t help but think, &#8220;Is this a ghost?&#8221; The throbbing in my head began to subside, allowing me to focus on this mysterious presence.</p>



<p>As the pain lessened, I looked at her face, still hidden beneath the black hood, and what I saw left me utterly shocked.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ayana&#8230;.?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes&#8230; the face I saw beneath the hood was that of Ayana.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Her features were almost identical to Ayana, who slept beside me, but her eyes were different. Instead of the bright, lively eyes of the sleeping Ayana, these were pitch-black, filled with despair. The sight was distressing, and I hesitated to reach out.</p>



<p>However, when I reached out my hand to touch the figure hidden under the hood, I was jolted back to reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The hand reached out into emptiness; there was nothing there. It was just my ordinary room, nothing out of the ordinary. There was no Ayana with a black hood.</p>



<p>I wondered if I might be more tired than I thought, but a realization suddenly dawned on me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know her&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen that Ayana before&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>As this thought crystallized, I felt something click into place. The figure I saw wasn&#8217;t an actual presence; it had stimulated some kind of memory within me. It was a key to a part of my past, a piece of the puzzle I had forgotten.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa&#8230; kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard my name, and when I looked toward the source of the voice, it was Ayana herself. But this Ayana was asleep, her mouth drooling as she smiled contentedly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The sight of her, so different from her usual self, left me with a wry smile. I wiped away the drool and turned off the room&#8217;s lights.</p>



<p>(Maybe&#8230; Maybe there&#8217;s something I can remember&#8230; just a little more, and I&#8217;ll be able to recall it.)</p>



<p>Before I could retrieve my memories, there was much to ponder, such as why Ayana seemed to despise me so much. Even after unlocking my memories, there would be many questions to answer. However, if Ayana was there with me, I felt like I could overcome anything.</p>



<p>I closed my eyes, preparing for sleep, and reflecting on my day. But then&#8230;</p>



<p>[Towa-kun]</p>



<p>&#8220;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, a voice echoed in my mind.</p>



<p>The voice called my name, but Ayana was still asleep, and I was unsure of what to do. It sounded so sad and desperate, making me want to help, but I didn&#8217;t know how.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Why? Why are you calling my name …&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The voice was filled with sadness, and it almost made me want to say, &#8220;Why?&#8221; It sounded so painful.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t just leave it be. I had to do something, but I had no idea what to do. Anxiety and restlessness mingled, wrapping around me, causing even my heart to beat faster and making it hard to breathe. It was so suffocating that I wanted to shout for help…</p>



<p>&#8220;Haah… Haah…&#8221;</p>



<p>But, it quickly subsided. Though it had been just a few minutes, I was drenched in a cold sweat, and my head felt foggy. I was terrified and desperate for help, and it was almost unbearable.</p>



<p>However, that feeling soon dissipated. I tried to calm myself down and regulate my breathing, hoping to fall asleep.</p>



<p>As I lay still, gradually, drowsiness began to overtake me. But the sense of unease never completely vanished.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"/>



<p>The next morning, my wake-up call was a kiss from Ayana. I felt something moving on top of me, and as I struggled with sleepiness, I opened my eyes to find Ayana&#8217;s face right in front of mine. It was a cheeky, playful &#8220;you found me&#8221; look as she stuck her tongue out, and she leaned in for a kiss. If it had been a holiday, I might have been quite worked up from such a stimulating wake-up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Ayana. It&#8217;s still early, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Towa-kun. It is morning, but we have plenty of time?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8230;.Geez! She&#8217;s not only cute but also quite naughty. I sighed, letting out a breath and took a deep breath to calm down my racing heart.</p>



<p>As Ayana had mentioned, there was indeed plenty of time, but I still had a slight urge to go back to sleep, considering I&#8217;d woken up so early.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s time to get up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, let&#8217;s get up. Instead of Akemi-san, I&#8217;ll make breakfast today! I&#8217;ll do my best!!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a determined fist, Ayana, still in her pajamas, left the room.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Oh, right. When I think about it, I don&#8217;t really need to go home unless I&#8217;m going back for my school uniform.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had originally planned to send her back in the morning, but considering she had some clothes and things here, there wasn&#8217;t a pressing need to send her home.</p>



<p>However, Ayana did mention that she was planning to go back after school today. In that regard, I didn&#8217;t want to cause any concern for her mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When I tried to get up, my head spun a little. It wasn&#8217;t due to a cold or any illness. However, it reminded me of the discomfort I felt last night.</p>



<p>&#8220;…What was that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it was such a minor sensation that I soon stopped worrying about it. Fortunately, neither Ayana nor my mother expressed concern for me.</p>



<p>After enjoying a delicious breakfast prepared by Ayana, we set off together without meeting up with Shu. Ayana continued discussing how much fun she had during her overnight stay, seemingly unconcerned about her interactions with Akemi.</p>



<p>My mind, however, was still preoccupied with the events from the night before.</p>



<p>(That voice&#8230; What on earth was it?)</p>



<p>It was a voice that sounded just like Ayana&#8217;s but filled with sorrow and suffering. It wouldn&#8217;t let go of my thoughts.</p>



<p>As we walked towards school, my head was filled with questions. I was so deep in thought that I hardly noticed Ayana beside me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Ayana!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Good morning, Otonashi-san!&#8221;</p>



<p>After exchanging greetings with friends, I watched Ayana&#8217;s back as she headed towards them, still oblivious to my distracted state. Though Shu and Aisaka tried to engage me in conversation, I remained lost in thought.</p>



<p>The morning assembly concluded, and classes began. I absentmindedly looked at my notebook, the page filled with unrelated notes.</p>



<p>&#8220;…FD?&#8221;</p>



<p>I tilted my head at the two letters I had unconsciously written in my notebook. </p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t understand what these letters represented or why I had written them. However, given the recent mysterious events, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that these letters might hold some important meaning. </p>



<p>So, I made a mental note to remember them.</p>



<p>Then, as I looked up at the blackboard, a voice once again echoed in my mind, just like the previous night.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry. You have nothing to do with this; you were just caught up in it. But what does it matter? You look so comfortable right now, don&#8217;t you? Come on, keep using that body of yours a little more. Because if you do, that boy who &#8216;used to like you&#8217; will come.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a single word; it was a lengthy voice message. </p>



<p>As I heard it, a sharp headache hit me, causing me to instinctively hold my head. </p>



<p>I had the urge to kick my desk but managed to restrain myself. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, my current state was noticed by my classmate in the adjacent seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro-kun? Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>He asked with a worried tone, and I reassured him that I was fine. The headache subsided, but a lingering feeling of discomfort remained in my chest. It wasn&#8217;t nausea, but a strange sensation, like floating in the air. I was feeling unwell, though not to the extent of needing to throw up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew…&#8221;</p>



<p>I took a deep breath to calm myself, and gradually, the discomfort lessened.</p>



<p>(Good, it&#8217;s getting better… Well, I guess I&#8217;m fine now)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I muttered to myself, feeling some annoyance for my earlier outburst.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t long before I was caught up in another episode. As soon as the break began, I slumped forward onto my desk. The headache was gone, but the unsettling feeling returned.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry. You have nothing to do with this; you were just caught up in it. But what does it matter? You look so comfortable right now, don&#8217;t you? Come on, keep using that body of yours a little more. Because if you do, that boy who &#8216;used to like you&#8217; will come.]</p>



<p>And the voice returned.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the voice; even if I closed my eyes, I could see hallucinatory images. I was overwhelmed by it all.</p>



<p>I was frustrated not just because I didn&#8217;t understand what was happening, but also because I had a nagging feeling that there was something I should remember.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Damn it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I cursed softly. I couldn&#8217;t even reprimand myself for using bad language.</p>



<p>The break was only about ten minutes long. I knew I had to prepare for the next class, so I took out my textbook, hoping to refocus my mind.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But then the voice returned once more.</p>



<p>[She might be the one I took her from… me.]</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t Ayana&#8217;s voice this time. Could it be my own voice?</p>



<p>I instinctively placed my hand on my forehead, just as I had done before. The classroom was noisy, but those nearby quickly realized that something was wrong with me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukishiro-kun. I&#8217;ve been watching you since earlier. Are you really okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Like the classmate who noticed my strange behavior during the previous class, Aisaka and…</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun? What&#8217;s wrong…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Not even realizing that the two of them had been standing nearby, I was clearly absorbed in my own thoughts. </p>



<p>When I raised my head towards the two people standing next to me, Ayana and Aisaka&#8217;s expressions changed, as if they had changed in appearance&#8230;Ayana&#8217;s change was especially noticeable.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Your face is completely pale!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the infirmary!&#8221;</p>



<p>Both of them tried to lead me, but as I was about to say I&#8217;ll be fine, my words got stuck in my throat.</p>



<p>As for me, I couldn&#8217;t help but think that if my condition had become known to so many people gathered here, it would be quite worrisome for anyone who looked like they were unwell in the middle of class. Well, that&#8217;s true, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Since it had come to this, I reluctantly managed to stand up and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the infirmary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aisaka-kun, I&#8217;ll take Towa-kun there&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;No, but it would be better if a guy helps—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just me is enough… okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what expression Ayana had when she looked at Aisaka, but Aisaka saluted crisply.</p>



<p>Her upright and unmoving posture reminded me of someone who had undergone training in the Self-Defense Force… well, I&#8217;ve never had any experience with the Self-Defense Force, but I could somehow imagine it.</p>



<p>Ayana quickly slipped into my side and supported me by wrapping her arm around my shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aisaka-kun, please inform the teacher that I might be a little late.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Understood!&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder what kind of look Ayana gave Aisaka…</p>



<p>After that, as I was about to leave the classroom with Ayana, I wanted to convey that I was fine and didn&#8217;t need all this help, but Ayana beat me to it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t listen to that. I&#8217;ll go with you to the infirmary.&#8221; </p>



<p>With her words, I understood and nodded as if giving up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>I received questioning looks from those around us as we made our way to the infirmary, and I reported my symptoms to the teacher before lying down on the bed.</p>



<p>The teacher handed me a thermometer, suspecting it might be a cold, but my temperature was normal. Perhaps I was just tired, so teacher suggested I take a short nap. So, I decided to rest without reservation.</p>



<p>Ayana placed a chair by my side and stared at me intently.</p>



<p>As Ayana had mentioned to Aisaka, she didn&#8217;t immediately return to the classroom but seemed to be watching over me for a while.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Ayana . I caused you trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s trouble. I&#8217;d do anything for you, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those were undoubtedly words filled with Ayana&#8217;s affection, but they also revealed a hint of vulnerability.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>She seemed composed, but was she actually a bit anxious due to my unusual condition?</p>



<p>I thought that, but Ayana&#8217;s gentle gaze remained the same, and the warmth of her hand, as she reached out and held mine, was unchanged.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>When she did this, I felt reassured… but it&#8217;s true that humans tend to become a bit emotionally fragile when their physical condition is poor. While tightly gripping Ayana&#8217;s hand in return, I voiced something I didn&#8217;t quite understand myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, are you… happy now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Happy… why did I suddenly ask her something like that? She was smiling just now. I could tell she was carrying some burdens, but Ayana smiled before me. So, even though I knew this question was meaningless, I still asked it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. Just being by your side, Towa-kun, that alone makes me happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the bottom of her heart, she said this with a smile that seemed to say she believed it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Of course, her happiness is naturally something that makes me happy too… </p>



<p>Taking into account the words she had just said, I asked her like this:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, what about your own happiness? If you think about it without me in the picture, can you say you&#8217;re happy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>



<p>No good… My eyelids are getting heavy.</p>



<p>Until the moment I fell asleep, Ayana didn&#8217;t answer my question.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t know what kind of expression she wore or what answer she would have given.</p>



<p>&#8220;…My own happiness doesn&#8217;t matter to me. I belong to Towa-kun… Towa-kun alone. My happiness is tied to Towa-kun being happy. And isn&#8217;t that alright? That&#8217;s the purpose of my life.&#8221;</p>
