<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;……? Feels like I had some kind of weird dream.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was the first thing I said when I woke up.</p>



<p>I remember that I went to bed last night after talking with Ayana after sorting out some things about this world.</p>



<p>After that, I think I had some kind of strange dream between the time I fell asleep and the time I woke up now, but I can&#8217;t …… remember it at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, I think I&#8217;m going to get up. I think Mom is making breakfast.&#8221;</p>



<p>I left the room and headed for the living room, trying to cheer up my body, which was still complaining that it wanted to sleep a little more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Towa&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mom.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I opened the door and walked in to find a delicious aroma wafting through the air.</p>



<p>The breakfast menu was the same as any other family&#8217;s, but I could tell that my mother&#8217;s love had been put into it.</p>



<p>(She also makes delicious bento boxes, as well as her regular meals.)</p>



<p>I guess it&#8217;s also because she is a mother and knows her son&#8217;s preferences.</p>



<p>I was staring at my mother&#8217;s back as she was scooping the miso soup into the bowl with a ladle and pouring it into the bowl.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Nothing&#8221;</p>



<p>It must be strange for me to be staring at her like this.</p>



<p>Mom stared at me and I wasn&#8217;t sure what to say, but the words that came out of my mouth were words of thanks to her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thank you for everything, Mom. Your lunches and meals are the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I told her this, she was still even more puzzled.</p>



<p>I was not lying when I said these words of thanks, but I was just overflowing with the feeling of wanting to tell my mother this.</p>



<p>(Is this also Towa&#8217;s emotion? Family…… something about wanting to reassure or please his only remaining mother).</p>



<p>At least I knew a lot of what was going on because it was my own family for me now.</p>



<p>First I explained that she was the only remaining mother, but it&#8217;s not that my father left me because he cheated on her or got divorced or anything, it&#8217;s just that there was an unfortunate accident and dad …… passed away.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand how it feels to mourn your beloved partner. And yet, I think my mother is a truly amazing person for overcoming such a past and caring for her only son.</p>



<p>(There are so many things I really don&#8217;t know about her. I hope I will be able to remember from now on.)</p>



<p>I was so busy thinking about this that I didn&#8217;t notice my mother, who was standing beside me before I knew it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Towa!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was surprised at the sudden movement, but I knew it was her.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Mom hugged me and I was surprised, but I felt very comfortable and at ease because she was the one who had hugged me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You say things that make me so happy! As a mother, I&#8217;m really happy to hear my son say that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I had breakfast with my mom.</p>



<p>I think it was because of the exchange we had just had that Mom was in such a good mood the whole time, and she kept grinning at me to the point that I was almost embarrassed.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>（She&#8217;s so gorgeous)</p>



<p>This is what I thought when I saw her grinning like that.</p>



<p>She has brown hair and earrings in her ears, and for someone with a son who is old enough to be his age, she would be considered flamboyant compared to the average person.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t give the other person a negative impression of her, and if anything, she comes across as a woman who gives the impression of being a big sister.</p>



<p>Towa, you can take it easy if you want, but are you sure about the time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, I hurried when I saw the clock.</p>



<p>I quickly finished brushing my teeth and got ready to go outside and I ran out of the house.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m going to be later than expected today.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The words were no lie, and when I headed to the usual meeting place, I found Shu and Ayana waiting for me, chatting amiably.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Honestly, you two really get along.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wish that scene could go on forever, and the more I think about my role in it, the more I feel a little pain in my heart.</p>



<p>At the same time, I think about the joy and fun I had yesterday when I talked with Ayana,……, and I wish I could keep it to myself forever.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..This feeling, I wonder who I am.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have memories of my previous life, or rather, memories of my previous world.</p>



<p>That meant that there was a life before for me, and that was proof that I was a different person, not Towa.</p>



<p>But every time I feel the pull of my body after becoming Towa in this way, I am not sure if I am me or Towa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aa~aah, what is this feeling?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I am troubled like this, but my mood soon calms down after all.</p>



<p>After all, no matter who I am, I can&#8217;t change or stop myself from being Towa already.</p>



<p>&#8220;O~i Towa! What are you doing~!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun! Come here quickly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah! Sorry, sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was called by the two, so I headed that way immediately.</p>



<p>I joined them and they started walking, but just like yesterday, they were walking ahead of me and I was walking a little behind them.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, my mother was wondering if you could come over today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Today huh? Hmm….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana was troubled by Shu&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>It is not unusual for Shu and Ayana to go back and forth to each other&#8217;s homes since they live close to each other. It is also common for them to have dinner at either of their homes.</p>



<p>In the end, Ayana declined the invitation, saying that she wanted to do some shopping and that she would like to do it some other time, but Shu was not happy about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that a higher priority than coming over?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm….&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was troubled by Shu&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>I was listening from the side, but I thought it was not a good way to ask, so I put my hand on Shu&#8217;s shoulder and interrupted him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana has her own personal business to attend to, right? There&#8217;s even a saying, &#8220;Even when you&#8217;re close to someone, be polite,&#8221; so don&#8217;t ask too many questions like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Shu apologized obediently when I said that, but he still didn&#8217;t like it, and our conversation was extremely limited from then until we headed off to school.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I&#8217;m sorry, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana apologized to me for making the atmosphere worse, but it&#8217;s nothing to worry about.</p>



<p>Shu will probably forget about it soon anyway, and he won&#8217;t have to worry about being delirious with Ayana.</p>



<p>In the end, Shu walked away quickly.</p>



<p>We followed behind him, smiling at each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lied about the shopping trip.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I was surprised to hear Ayana say that, sticking out her tongue.</p>



<p>In other words, Ayana told a lie. …… Well, I don&#8217;t believe Ayana is a person who would never tell a lie, and it&#8217;s not uncommon for her to do so when she&#8217;s a human being.</p>



<p>Still, I thought it was quite surprising that she would lie to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are days when I want to spend time alone, too. Of course, I would be happier than anything else if Towa-kun were with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….&#8221;</p>



<p>Again,……, she says such things again.</p>



<p>Thus, when Ayana throws at me words that must be filled with deep meaning, I think back to yesterday&#8217;s phone call.</p>



<p>[I love you no matter what kind of person you are. It was not out of pity or sympathy that I offered my love to Towa-kun at that time. I offered it to you because I wanted to be by your side and support you.]</p>



<p>I was about to ask her boldly what she meant by those words, but Ayana took my hand before I could.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It would be nice to go to school alone like this, but I don&#8217;t want to hear any more complaints from Shu-kun, so let&#8217;s go, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I guess so.&#8221;</p>



<p>I chuckled, thinking that after all, Ayana doesn&#8217;t just spoil Shu either.</p>



<p>As I was walking along, feeling the warmth of Ayana&#8217;s hand on my palm, she suddenly turned her attention to me and opened her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun,……, is there something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt like there was something different about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The words made me stiff involuntarily.</p>



<p>Not only the movement of my body, but even my heart seemed to have stopped,……. What I mean is that I had the illusion that time had stopped.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had changed somehow, and those were the core words that described who I was now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just feeling something, so don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I see&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though I told her not to worry about it, I was surprised and was also nervous that she would find out and reject me.</p>



<p>Ayana put a smile on her face and I was able to regain some sense of my body, but it still means that there are people who will notice the changes that have happened to me.</p>



<p>An emotional upset that I didn&#8217;t have when I was told by Ayana,…… This may be proof that Ayana is that special.</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Uhm…..Did I make you care about that ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ah~&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It seemed that I had been looking stiff for a long time, and Ayana looked into my face with concern.</p>



<p>Ayana continued to speak again before I could tell her that it was okay, that I didn&#8217;t particularly care.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I say that you have changed, I don&#8217;t mean exactly what I said. It&#8217;s true that I thought Towa-kun has changed a little recently, …… but what can I say, I still think Towa-kun is Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha,……, I don&#8217;t know either, but no matter how much people seem to have changed, I know that it&#8217;s you who is present here. My heart will never mistake Towa-kun, and that&#8217;s why I can say that you are Towa-kun as I hold your hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand it myself, Ayana said, laughing and walking away again.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>My hand was being held and Ayana had gone on ahead of me, but even so, her words were a bit reassuring to me.</p>



<p>I felt as if Ayana had told me that it was okay for me to be here in this world full of things that I still don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m always getting anxious and relieved. Yare yare, it makes me think there&#8217;s no point in fretting like this.</p>



<p>Of course, I am troubled by the sudden change in the world in which I live, so only I can understand what I am going through at this point in my life.</p>



<p>I am also in a position to say to the contrary, that it is probably too much to be dithering about such things, and what do I know about such things from a stranger……. Yes, these worries are not a bad thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>I stopped and Ayana was waiting for me a little further ahead.</p>



<p>I was impressed by the look of anxiety on her face, wondering if she had made me concerned again, and I just chuckled, but I knew I was bothering her, so I immediately rushed over to her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Sorry, sorry, I&#8217;m fine now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, Ayana glanced at my face for a while, but soon stopped worrying about it, as if she felt that I really seemed to be okay.</p>



<p>After all this time, the distance between me and Shu was getting farther and farther away, and even though I would have seen his back earlier, he was already gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shu, he is going to fast&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, he is. Hey Towa, can I cross my arms with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>What did Ayana just say?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;m sure she must have uttered the question, but my body moved in response to her and took a form that allowed me to firmly cross her arms.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ehehe♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt Ayana&#8217;s arms gently embrace me as if she were holding a precious object.</p>



<p>Not only the feel of Ayana&#8217;s arms, but also the softness of her ample bulge was directly felt, making me a little nervous.</p>



<p>(……After all, when we are alone together, Ayana instantly becomes closer to me.)</p>



<p>Compared to yesterday&#8217;s after-school activities, it was still not that exciting entanglement, but it still made me feel that there was something between me and Ayana.</p>



<p>It was just the two of us ……, and even if it wasn&#8217;t, I could always ask her questions over the phone or something, but that&#8217;s when I decided to go ahead and ask.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, Ayana-senpai?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I thought I heard such a voice, and then Ayana&#8217;s arms suddenly separated from me.</p>



<p>I turned around, feeling a little sad at the warmth and softness that had disappeared from her arms, and saw that it was a girl from my junior year who was there.</p>



<p>However, that girl was also one that I should be concerned about because I know the situation of this world.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mari-chan? Good morning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! Good morning!&#8221;</p>



<p>The boyish girl who greeted me with a smile was Mari Uchida, the cuckolded heroine in the junior slot.</p>



<p>When she saw me standing next to Ayana, she &#8211; Mari &#8211; rolled her eyes in surprise, but immediately raised her voice and bowed her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you! If I may say so, you are Yukishiro-senpai, right? I&#8217;ve heard about you from both Ayana-senpai and Shu-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? I&#8217;m Towa Yukishiro. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m Mari Uchida! Nice to meet you!&#8221;</p>



<p>What can I say …… she really is a girl like a bundle of energy.</p>



<p>(I see …… that Towa and Mari met here for the first time.)</p>



<p>This part of the story has never been told in the game, so it&#8217;s not impossible that this encounter was brought about simply because of the influence of me becoming Towa.</p>



<p>In addition, in the game, the interaction between Towa and the other heroines is basically limited, and there was no description of his acquaintance with Mari or Iori, so it seems strange to experience a scene where Towa is talking with Mari in this way.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I see,……, I had seen you from a distance, but Yukishiro-senpai really is a very, very handsome man!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Thank you&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Wawawa!&#8221;</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t really smiling or anything, but Mari&#8217;s face turned red.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Now it&#8217;s about my body, but Towa really has a face so good-looking that I often wish I had been born with such a face in a previous life,…….</p>



<p>After that, Mari also decided to go to school with us since we had just met up with her in this way.</p>



<p>That said, Ayana and Mari are basically having a friendly conversation, and I&#8217;m just watching them, just as I did with Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;……She&#8217;s a good, energetic girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve only been conversing with her for a little while, but I can tell that Mari is a very nice person.</p>



<p>The fact that even such a girl can be cuckolded makes erotic game scenarios deep in karma, and the story is truly irredeemable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that girl is ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Mari started going to a gym, and the trainer there started messing with her.</p>



<p>She is a member of the track and field team and is a promising young woman with a bright future ahead of her, so she was supposed to start going to the gym to live up to the expectations of those around her as much as possible.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>

<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/My5CFUVYCeTvu1LgqkefORDjP7O5R71q3TpihB88SM09XRZvro1YQVlMjRRovjvZELPlpY60cAbr5AI6hp2sc-0ZTnq9R1nsNDu9QNBu-9JwFFYu-uaLgXYXvGI6gYZdplae1EfRHEiYxzqngnZy4Ec"/></noscript></figure></div>


<p>[Shu-senpai! The truth is, I&#8217;m going to start going to a certain gym next week!]</p>



<p>She cheerfully told Shu, and the flag was raised to the point where any eroge player with a long history of erotic games would have guessed that this was a no-brainer.</p>



<p>&#8220;…….But it&#8217;s weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>On second thought, with the exception of Ayana, all four of Shu&#8217;s closest female acquaintances began to experience malice toward him at about the same time.</p>



<p>The sequence of events that occur as if they were synchronized with each other gives the impression of something intentional, but I wonder if it is the production team&#8217;s direction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, where&#8217;s Shu-senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told him that I couldn&#8217;t make it after school today, and he sulked. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>When Ayana told her this, Mari laughed.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. But in a way, is it Ayana-senpai&#8217;s prerogative to make Shu-senpai sulk like that?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I wonder&#8221;</p>



<p>I chuckled in spite of myself, not wanting such a privilege.</p>



<p>I had maintained a certain distance from the two of them, and Mari turned her head to me to see if I wanted to have a conversation not only with Ayana but also with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to talk to Yukishiro-senpai like this for a long time. I&#8217;ve always heard from Shu-senpai that Yukishiro-senpai is like a hero!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hero? …… I&#8217;m not like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun is cool. He is a hero without a doubt.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ayana.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even Ayana said so, which made me a little uncomfortable, but my Towa face seemed to make even such a subtle smile look good-looking, and Mari let out an ooh.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-senpai is really handsome… is his personality also good-looking?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that myself. I have a lot of times when I&#8217;m confused and worried like Shu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, the way he answers and the way he acts, he is already good-looking.&#8221;</p>



<p>I think someone should teach Mari what the definition of a good-looking man is.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have made the acquaintance of Yukishiro-senpai in this way, and it is thanks to Ayana-senpai that I have met Shu-senpai. It seems as if Ayana-senpai has brought me many encounters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked Ayana and she nodded her head.</p>



<p>It had been mentioned that Ayana was the reason Iori met Shu, but there was no mention of Mari, so it was only now that I learned that Mari, like Iori, met Shu through Ayana&#8217;s influence.</p>



<p>I was also actively involved in the conversation as we headed to school, where I parted from Mari with the box that had been dropped off and headed to class.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there he is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see he is fast asleep.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was the first one to arrive at the classroom, but Shu was motionless as he plopped down on his desk.</p>



<p>I think it would be nice if he didn&#8217;t create his own world like that when he enters the classroom, but he should have the opportunity to talk with his classmates around him. …… Even I and Ayana can&#8217;t force him to do all that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Aisaka.&#8221;</p>



<p>I greeted Aisaka back and took a seat.</p>



<p>Ayana approached to deal with Shu, who looked up at her and smiled with his hand over his mouth, giggling as he talked to her about something.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It looks like he&#8217;s in a better mood now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was relieved that I was right.</p>



<p>As I took my study materials from my desk I began to think about Mari, who I had just been talking with.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… She really is a good girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>A pure child who did not have the kind of ugliness that all people carry, was the image I had of Mari.</p>



<p>It is a causal story in a sense that both Mari and Iori met Shu through Ayana&#8217;s introduction….and it&#8217;s a story of fate in a sense that they are taken away, but if I can somehow do it, as a person who knows their future. , I thought I could help.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shu approached me with Ayana and called out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;After school we decided to spend some time together until it is time for Ayana to go shopping. I was wondering if you wanted to hang out with us too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I see. So Ayana is following up in her own way.</p>



<p>I was tempted to ask if it was okay for me to be in their private space, but since he invited me like this, it would be rude to ask such a question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure. I will hang with you&#8221;</p>



<p>And so our after-school plans were set.</p>



<p>On that day, Iori came to the classroom and took Shu away, but no one, including Somiya and the others, made any move to harass Shu, probably because Ayana and I had pointed them in the classroom.</p>



<p>On the contrary, I saw a slight change.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey Somiya, what are you going to do after school today?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Eh? Right….Uhm&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you nervous about? We&#8217;re just going to hang out, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……T-That&#8217;s right!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned my attention to the conversation between Somiya and Ayana&#8217;s friend, Uesaka.</p>



<p>Uesaka is the girl who invited Somiya and the others to karaoke at the right time yesterday, but today, I feel that the two of them are very close to each other.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know how it was in the past, but judging by the reactions of people around the two , it seems that today is the first time they are getting along like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana, who was standing beside me, looked at me, nodded her head, and continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard they hit it off better than I thought they would at karaoke. She seemed to be having a lot of fun, so she must have really liked it.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Heh. …….&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a rare combination that I didn&#8217;t …… think was possible.</p>



<p>Both Somiya and Uesaka are flamboyant in appearance, but they are not bad-behaved delinquents.</p>



<p>As for Somiya, although he was malicious toward Shu, he listened to our side of the story……. Well, it would have been nice if he didn&#8217;t do that from the beginning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that the kind of girl you like, Towa?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana said this to me, perhaps because I was staring at Somiya and Uesaka.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was my imagination or if it was really her eyes that showed a hint of jealousy, but Ayana immediately chuckled.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just kidding. I&#8217;ve known what Towa-kun likes for a long time♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>I quickly averted my gaze from her smiling face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This was partly because I simply could not look directly at Ayana&#8217;s smile, but also because I felt that she had seen through my own tastes, not Towa&#8217;s.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s true that I love a clean and neat girl like Ayana,……, but if I may be greedy, such a clean and neat girl may be a bit heavy on love and s*x…….)</p>



<p>When I think about it, my gaze naturally turns to Ayana, and I think …… I&#8217;m so simple.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What would you do if I dressed and acted like a so-called &#8220;gyaru&#8221; (gal) like her? What would you do?&#8221;</p>



<p>These words came as a big shock to me and made me feel as if a thunderbolt had struck behind me.</p>



<p>Certainly in my memory, I have many stories of that kind of gal-ization of a beautiful innocent girl like Ayana preserved in my memory, so based on her current visual, an all too obvious gyaru-ization Ayana popped into my brain ……, but I was sure that I was right. I was most likely thinking that while I thought it was naughty and totally fine, it didn&#8217;t suit her.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, …… I think Ayana should stay the same&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Fufu, I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>I knew Ayana must have known this reply as well, I thought as I looked at her smiling face.</p>



<p>(…… even so)</p>



<p>Once again I looked at Someya and the others and wondered if they were the ones Shu was talking about in the game who were jealous and involved.</p>



<p>The classmates who got involved with Shu in the game were treated as mobs, so their names weren&#8217;t revealed, nor were their appearances explained.</p>



<p>(To begin with, it&#8217;s a year from now, and we&#8217;re in different classes……so I guess it&#8217;s not a good idea to even think about that at this point)</p>



<p>I reset my thinking to that.</p>



<p>There is a princess next to me, who is nearby, but keeps pleading with me not to think, so I should spend my time on that for now.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>It was soon after school and all three of us were out on the town together.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay until about five o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Let&#8217;s play until then.&#8221;</p>



<p>The time limit is quite close to 4:00 p.m., but Shu is still happy just to spend time with Ayana.</p>



<p>Knowing that Ayana had nothing to do, I felt sorry for Shu, but I also thought that it would be nice if Ayana could have a day like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go somewhere right away, Shu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>If time is limited, let&#8217;s enjoy the time with the three of us.</p>



<p>But with only about an hour to spend together, there was only so much we could do, and the three of us just walked around talking nonsense.</p>



<p>(…… but he&#8217;s so happy about all this stuff)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Nevertheless, Shu seemed happy anyway.</p>



<p>He was talking to Ayana so much that he probably didn&#8217;t even need to ask me out, but I&#8217;m sure Towa had been watching them like this for a while now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, they sell ice cream over there&#8221;</p>



<p>We were walking along the street when we spotted an ice cream truck and approached it.</p>



<p>We each bought a different flavor of ice cream, and decided to spend the rest of the day sitting on a bench nearby, relaxing and eating.</p>



<p>I was enjoying chocolate ice cream, Shu was enjoying mint, and Ayana was enjoying vanilla ice cream, when Ayana turned her attention to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;?…..Fufu&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked at him too, and I just burst out laughing at the look on his face.</p>



<p>He was looking at me, wondering what was wrong, and there was ice cream under his nose, as if he had a green beard and mustache.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Shu-kun, please don&#8217;t move for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana took a handkerchief from her pocket and put her hand under his nose.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all right now. &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s behavior made Shu realize that the ice cream had gotten on him, and he thanked her while looking down in embarrassment.</p>



<p>Not only that, but there was also some embarrassment at the fact that Ayana&#8217;s face was so close to his at point-blank range, but it seems that even that much is still too much stimulation for Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m going to look at something else!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Shu-kun.……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Unable to hold back, Shu got up and went.</p>



<p>Ayana, who had been staring at his back, slowly turned around and smiled deeply, as if she had been waiting for Shu to be gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun….ara.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked at me the same way she had looked at Shu earlier.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t tell me that some ice cream got on my mouth without me even noticing it? I thought so and tried to wipe it off with my hand, but Ayana stopped me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stay still for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-ou…..&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana slowly approached me, brought her face close to mine, and licked my cheek with her tongue.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;There was ice cream on you, Towa-kun♪&#8221;</p>


<p>Probably not a lie, but I didn&#8217;t think she would do this to me after wiping off the ice cream from Shu normally.</p>



<p>I am of course embarrassed in front of a smiling Ayana, but the rough feeling of Ayana&#8217;s tongue that just touched my cheek is still there.</p>



<p>(……Thank goodness. Shu didn&#8217;t see it.)</p>



<p>I glanced at Shu, who was still busy choosing his next ice cream.</p>



<p>I was a little worried about what Shu would say if he had seen what she just did, but I also felt a slight sense of superiority toward him.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ayana, you can&#8217;t just do that out of the blue&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufu♪ What if it wasn&#8217;t out of the blue?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s…..&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Ayana was again moving her face close to mine, as she had done earlier, and she had a very attractive expression on her face.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tear my eyes away from Ayana&#8217;s face, and if I were to stare at her lips, I&#8217;d be sucked into her face.</p>



<p>(Damn ……, what&#8217;s this feeling ……, why do I want Ayana so much ……!)</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been whispering in my head that I want Ayana.</p>



<p>Just when I thought I didn&#8217;t know what I would have done if I had stared at Ayana any longer, Shu finally returned.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry. I bought another one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I see. You&#8217;ll gain weight if you eat too much, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>It sounded too toneless for me.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I headed for the nearby restroom to calm myself down in that unsure feeling of whether I was disappointed or grateful that Shu had returned.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… phew.&#8221;</p>



<p>No time to exhale is probably what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>



<p>Too many things have happened with Ayana in the last few days, and I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;d like to stay in bed for a few days and not think about anything else.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how many things I don&#8217;t understand and how many shocking things are coming at me at a furious pace.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about Ayana, and I feel that she&#8217;s important to me.</p>



<p>I spoke to my reflection in the mirror, in other words, to Towa.</p>



<p>Hey Towa, why did I come to this world? Why am I here as you? What the hell do you want from me?&#8221;</p>



<p>With that said, I reached out and touched the mirror, but naturally there was no response.</p>



<p>I stared at the mirror for a moment, let out a sigh, and then returned to the two, but it seemed I was in trouble.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, why don&#8217;t you come play with me instead of this plain-looking guy?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a very nasty-looking flirtation.</p>



<p>The man, probably a college student, was looking down at Shu, while he was directing a lecherous gaze at Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, what are you looking at?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….&#8221;</p>



<p>The man gave him a big shove, and Shu looked down and took a step back.</p>



<p>This is the same as admitting that you will give up on Ayana and give her to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;……What&#8217;s he doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>No, I&#8217;m not in a position to complain after I left that place.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Besides, Shu is not the kind of person who gets into fights, and he is not that strong-willed, so he knows he cannot stand up to a man who is bigger than he is.</p>



<p>But I still wanted Shu to stand up. I wanted him to raise his voice desperately, even if in a haphazard way, to protect Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tsk….&#8221;</p>



<p>I clicked my tongue and immediately rushed over to them.</p>



<p>Just as the man was about to place his hand on Ayana&#8217;s shoulder, I grabbed his hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A~h?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The man looked at me like he was in a bad mood because of my sudden appearance.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m the one in a bad mood, and most of all, I couldn&#8217;t forgive him for trying to lay a hand on Ayana… I glared fiercely at the man as if my feelings of not letting Ayana go were showing on the surface.</p>



<p>&#8220;….What the hell you little&#8221;</p>



<p>The man shook off my hand as if he was afraid and turned his back on us as if to spit at us.</p>



<p>I was sure that I was going to get into a fistfight with him, so I was glad that he backed away from me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I called out to Shu and he nodded reassuringly.</p>



<p>During this time, I thought I felt a strange hot gaze from Ayana, but now I just had to tell Shu.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s not my place to say this, but, Shu… why did you take a step back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because …… I was trying to call for help! Yes, that&#8217;s right!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……I see, well, that&#8217;s not bad. But if you&#8217;d left the place, Ayana might have been taken, and you might have scared her for a little bit, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that… In the end, it was Towa who helped us.&#8221;</p>



<p>……You&#8217;re right, I saved you because you backed away.</p>



<p>I decided to avoid another morning of bad air, so I stopped short of giving Shu a hard time.</p>



<p>Well, the atmosphere was still a little unpleasant, but it was just before five o&#8217;clock and we decided to split up.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re splitting up for the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt a little sorry that I had said too much when I saw Shu turn his back on me and walk away quickly.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>Seeing Shu&#8217;s back, I looked at Ayana with a wry smile on her face.</p>



<p>I was wondering what Ayana was going to do now that she had lied to Shu.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, I haven&#8217;t thought about it♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Don&#8217;t say it with such glee.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was a little disappointed to see Ayana so quickly pull up next to me, but it didn&#8217;t change the fact that I felt a little uncomfortable seeing Shu like that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s weird that I know the truth and feel bad about it, but I suggested to Ayana that I wanted to stop somewhere and change my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayana, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to hang out with you a little longer…&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes. I will stay with Towa-kun♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Ahaha, got it&#8221;</p>



<p>So it was decided that I would spend some more time with Ayana.</p>



<p>But it was already past five o&#8217;clock. I was thinking of killing some time appropriately because I don&#8217;t intend to stay that late,……, but I wonder why I came here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwaa,……, it&#8217;s as lively as usual here&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As usual?&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite tilting my head at Ayana&#8217;s words, the place we were headed for was an arcade.</p>



<p>I know this is not the best place to take a girl, but strangely enough, this place caught my eye as I passed by.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, let&#8217;s have some fun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;O-ou.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana was more enthusiastic than I expected and took me by the hand. We looked around for something we could both enjoy and found a field hockey game.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try this, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play.&#8221;</p>



<p>The battle began with both of us on the other side of the table, but ……uhm it was my overwhelming victory.</p>



<p>Ayana was weak to the extent that I thought I would have to force her to win on purpose, but rather than being weak, I had the impression that she would not be good at this kind of thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lost. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked downcast, but she was not in any way unfaithful. She seemed to really enjoy being with me, and immediately smiled.</p>



<p>Looking at that smile, my own cheeks naturally relax and I feel like I should be enjoying the moment to the fullest.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Towa-kun, how about that one?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana pointed her finger at a game where you beat a drum rhythmically to see how high you can get a score.</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s confidence with the stick in her hands made me think I needed to get into the game as well,……, and I won again by a huge margin over Ayana.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lost this one too. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……………&#8221;</p>



<p>Sadly, Ayana was found to be quite weak in games like this.</p>



<p>Although she was again sullen, she still immediately smiled and looked for the next game.</p>



<p>(…It&#8217;s like this place is very important, or rather, it seems like a memorable place.)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>That&#8217;s what I thought when I saw Ayana after she came here.</p>



<p>I thought I was here with Shu, but apparently not. …… I wonder what it is, I feel myself feeling something in this place.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do that next one, Towa!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ou…Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Didn&#8217;t the honorifics slip out of Ayana&#8217;s mouth for a moment just now?</p>



<p>It is not a big deal to lose honorifics for a moment, but for some reason I felt very nostalgic about it.</p>



<p>There should be no clear old memories for me now, …… so why did I feel such a strong sense of nostalgia for this one moment?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Towa-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Towa?]</p>



<p>&#8220;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought I saw another girl right next to Ayana who was staring at me.</p>



<p>It was as if the Ayana of today had been made smaller than she is now. …… That is exactly how I felt when I saw a line of girls who looked exactly like the old Ayana I had seen in the pictures.</p>



<p>&#8220;……?&#8221;</p>



<p>But of course, it was just an optical illusion.</p>



<p>In the next instant, the girl disappeared, and all I could see was Ayana tilting her head to the side, wondering what was wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..No, it&#8217;s nothing. Hey, Ayana&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This….This is fun, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not every day that I come to an arcade with a girl …… and that&#8217;s exactly why I never had this experience in my previous life.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll simply take this as an opportunity to come back again and repeatedly, but even so, it goes without saying that having Ayana by my side makes these moments more enjoyable.</p>



<p>After that, we continued to enjoy various games with Ayana, and the time approached six o&#8217;clock.</p>



<p>I was so bored that I saw a crane game in the corner of my eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew there was such a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>There were various prizes hanging on the display, but the one that caught my eye was a keychain of a frog with an indescribably ugly face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;….Kuku&#8221;</p>



<p>It looked as if it was asking me to help it and get it out of here, so I pulled some coins out of my wallet.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait for me. I&#8217;ll help you out of there in a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is not easy to get a prize in a crane game, but surprisingly, I was able to get it easily in one hit.</p>



<p>But what am I supposed to do with it now that I&#8217;ve taken it? I&#8217;m not going to put it on my bag or baggage,……. I was just thinking about this when Ayana came back and I offered her the keychain to see how she would react.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey Ayana, I just got it from the crane game, do you want it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? A key chain?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana&#8217;s cheeks relaxed with happiness when she saw the key chain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sooooo cute! Is it okay?&#8221;&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Eh? Y-yeah….&#8221;</p>



<p>This thing is cute? Ayana took the keychain from my hand that had such a question.</p>



<p>&#8220;….. Fufu♪ It has an ugly face, and so is this one. But it&#8217;s cute. Thank you, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was surprised to see Ayana holding the keychain to her chest, but at the same time, for some reason, I also felt nostalgic about her appearance.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>In that moment of nostalgia, I thought I saw little Ayana right next to Ayana again.</p>



<p>In the end, it soon disappeared as if it were an optical illusion, but it was a fact that I felt something special in this place where I played with Ayana. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll bring Ayana with me so often, but if I have time, it doesn&#8217;t seem bad to visit here alone and feel this atmosphere again.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Oh, that&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>



<p>What I saw was a photo booth.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Basically, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always placed in these types of arcades, but it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve never really been a part of, including in my previous life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a picture, Towa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was sure that if I stared at her, I would be noticed, and Ayana was pulling my hand before I could even respond.</p>



<p>Ayana was able to operate the device as if she was familiar with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re good at this, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I often come here with my friends. I like to make her eyes extremely large, but I always end up making a monster.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana seemed to be enjoying herself as she recalled that time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that these things come with processing, but I&#8217;m not sure if even a beautiful girl like Ayana would end up looking like a youkai …… that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m wondering.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Does it bother you? I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana reached into her bag and pulled out a small notepad.</p>



<p>As soon as the cover was rolled up, I was greeted by the photo, which was indeed a face that would convince me if it were called a monster.</p>



<p>It was a bit peculiar to look at, and it would naturally bring a smile to one&#8217;s face if one saw it when one was feeling down.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m ready to go. Towa-kun, please stand next to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>I took some pictures of Ayana and I as we were, without any kind of processing.</p>



<p>Now you have one more memory to add to your collection, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. These are the pictures from the photo booth&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Each photo may be small, but it is a memory that will remain there as a form.</p>



<p>I laughed at the thought that she would probably not put them up anywhere, but keep them.</p>



<p>&#8220;……It&#8217;s getting pretty late&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re right….&#8221;</p>



<p>I had checked earlier and it was six o&#8217;clock, but of course the time had advanced even further, so Ayana and I left the arcade right away.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I wondered if that uncle is gone.&#8221; [TL: Remember this sentence]</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayana looked at the arcade for a bit, but soon lined up next to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I think this gave her enough time to do the shopping she told Shu, but at the same time I felt sorry for Shu and my heart was somewhat buoyant as I felt like I was sharing a secret time with Ayana.</p>



<p>I held her hand as if it was only natural, but I was walking home while holding her hand…</p>



<p>The phone in my pocket trembled, and once I asked Ayana to let go of my hand and pick up the phone, it was a call from my mom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Hello, Towa? I&#8217;m afraid my work is going to take a little longer. I&#8217;m sorry, but can you go somewhere for dinner or make it yourself?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Yeah, okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, okay? But I&#8217;ll be home by the end of the day, so don&#8217;t worry if I&#8217;m late.]</p>



<p>&#8220;All right. Good luck, Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Ah….fufu, there is no mother who can&#8217;t do her best when her son says that to her. See you later♪]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I knew my mom was a powerful woman in many ways, but then I would have to think about what I was going to do for dinner.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Ayana, did you hear me on the phone just now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I could hear it perfectly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course&#8221;</p>



<p>Does the sound leak out if we are so close?</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why Ayana made this suggestion as she puffed out her chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towa-kun, may I go over with you? If Akemi-san is not coming home, I will cook dinner for you. I can also make leftovers for Akemi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>That was a very nice offer.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I thought about it for a while and decided to nod my head at Ayana&#8217;s suggestion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s get going, Towa-kun♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-ou …….&#8221;</p>



<p>I had the strange experience of being led by Ayana, who was the most excited of the day, to be taken to my own house, but… I thought it was a little premature, but I was still impressed by her smile. I just seemed weak.</p>
