<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Saotome-san Won’t Escape</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wh, why would you think that….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The china spoon that fell from Mio-san’s hands hit the bean curd with a splosh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I came to know about it while talking with the people from my former company.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Do Tsuchiya-san and Murasaki-san know about it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It doesn’t seem like they know yet.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is that so…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, she was feeling guilty and worrying about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For an instant there she seemed to be slightly relieved but she cast her eyes down immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Both Tsuchiya and Murasaki are only angry at the company president for causing this trouble for everyone.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, and particularly they are not at all angry with Mio-san’s company.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oh, that’s right. I see.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup, if you are fine with it I can indirectly talk about this with and see how they…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「DON’T DO IT!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thunk. She abruptly stood up from her wooden chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Resembling herself from when we first met, she is looking at me with frightened eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Once everything is over and has been sorted out I will meet them and take responsibility for everything by myself and properly apologise for everything. So you must definitely not do anything now.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Got it. If that’s what you want then I will definitely not say anything.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This should be clearly conveyed and not be left ambiguous. Though this is the same as procrastinating the inevitable, right now, it is necessary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san nodded her head and sat down on the chair. She continued eating while staring straight at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The mediation work is already about 70% complete. Moreover, over the years I have built a steady relationship with the department head who is in charge of this project in the other company. That’s why even in this situation I am able to lend and borrow movies from him. I will definitely go well.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That department was actually from this company…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, this was the thing that made her watch the horror movie like her life depended on it. How thick-skinned, but if it helps reduce the possibility of things turning awry by even one percent then it will be worth it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「By this week.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It will get over by this week?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Things will be settled by Monday next week. This is not a lie or a wish but my honest opinion as the marketer Saotome. That’s why….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Okay, okay. Once that is done let’s call Tsuchiya. I will also be by your side.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…….Okay」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is just my instinct, but I think the future will certainly turn out like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The end result won’t be that different. Telling them later, they will certainly forgive her for this. But Mio-san will not stop blaming herself. She will once again close her heart, go back to the room and continue living all lonely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a bad premonition that it will end up this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「In the first place why Mio-san ended up like this…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who was tired from all the work went to bed early. After sending her off I started doing the dishes while contemplating the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a cheap thing to say but Mio-san is a beauty. She is sharp, has a nice hairstyle and good sense of dressing. If you close in on a single aspect like using chopsticks, it is evident that she is a well-bred lady who has undergone strict education.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why would such a person come to only trust work?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The key to tiding over this crisis should be hidden there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there is no way an acquaintance like me, who has known her for just over a month would know about such things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….hmmm. It’s done.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After washing the dishes, I place them on the shelves and wipe the sink dry. They are small things to do, but if you do it properly, you can slow the process of rusting or limescale formation in the sink for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I wonder if she is already asleep. It’s already so late today let’s think up something tomorrow….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the bedroom and put my ears on the door to confirm if she has already slept. I thought of returning if she had slept, but what I could hear was Mio-san’s voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Help me……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably sleep talk. I wonder who they are addressed to. Could it be a colleague, family or perhaps me?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found the answer right away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aa-chan…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aa-chan again.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then too, when she was delirious because from the fever she kept searching for Aa-chan. I later found out from day mode Mio-san that it was a fox plush toy that she treasured during childhood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She lost it somehow during the autumn of elementary grade 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember seeing it mentioned in the diary too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wait is it……?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autumn of elementary grade 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a thing from about twenty years back. Is it normal to remember in detail regarding a plush toy that you lost all the way back then?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I too have a memory of losing a Senkou Sentai Chibashiga doll. But I only remember that I lost it when I went swimming in the sea. I have no recollection exactly when it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san has a detailed recollection of the incident but she insists that she doesn’t remember the reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see a way to wade through this crisis albeit having little confidence</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There is no way around it, I will have to ask her.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ittekimasu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hai, itteirasshai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sending off a troubled Mio-san, I immediately went to the living room and went through the bookshelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry Mio-san. I will be breaking my promise from last month.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After doing this I won’t be able to complain even if I get sued for privacy infringement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「A diary that has it’s cover replaced and … this one.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the graduation album from the other shelf. The ultramarine hardcover of the album inside the green vinyl coated case had faded a bit because of the years.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That is…. Got it! It should be this period, October of Mio-san elementary fourth grade. This is definitely autumn.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Where is Aa-chan. Mika-chan, why?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Painful words of a child in tears. The date is 24</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> October.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, the graduation album.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to my graduation album, Mio-san’s also had the pictures of every grade from 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of that academic year in order. I carefully flip through the pictures.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pause at the 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> picture.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…. Apart from the hairstyle, Mio-san doesn’t seem any different.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found a picture where a girl with pigtails whom you will be able to recognize at the first glance and her friend were feeding each other omelette from their bento. Looks like the school excursion from first grade.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who was sharing her lunch with the young Mio-san was a timid looking girl with glasses. She looked precocious, sporting an ironed curly, that was quite rare in those times.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s probably this girl.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to individual portraits of students in their alphabetic order and turned over the pages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the pictures of section C which Mio-san was a part of, amongst section D’s pictures I found 『Watase Mikako』. There is not mistake, it’s this girl</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So this is 『Mika-chan』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">From this it’s clear that the organiser of the alumni meet is precisely this “Mika-chan”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now looking through the event photos in chronological order….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lucky, looking through the pictures I was able to find one with Mio-san in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second year. Sports Meet foot race. Mika-chan in fifth place, Mio-san is giving her company and comforting her by placing last<span id='easy-footnote-1-6030' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6030' title='TL: 6th '><sup>1</sup></a></span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Third year. She is smiling on the agricultural field trip with her face covered in mud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fourth year. They are playing by placing on top of each other’s heads the seashells that they picked up during the seaside summer camp.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifth year.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…..Eh」 </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is by herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a photo from an excursion. It’s a scene which shows a tangible and somewhat forceful distance between her and the other groups, she is seen sitting alone and eating her bento by herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sixth year. Probably the biggest event during the entire six years of school life, the school trip.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is alone here as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, she has been left alone. It is clear as day from the picture that she has put some distance between herself and other people, walking ahead by herself even though it is supposed to be a group activity. Even though Mika-chan is in the same group as hers…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going ahead I finally reached the last page of the graduation album.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. Hmm I guess I should stop it here.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last page is a white page that is used for autographs and signatures. Is there something written over there? I am really curious about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then it would be stepping over the boundary of necessity. Deciding such I put the diary and album back on their shelves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Next step would be to….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem comes after this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking that envelope from the mailbox, I dialled the number written on it. After a few rings an adult woman picked it up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Hello?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuu, gulping down some air I started speaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hello, am I speaking to Watase Mikako-sama?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes, I was called Watase before, you are speaking to me.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「By any chance do you remember Saotome Mio-san.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『…. Yes, she is my childhood friend from elementary school』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am Matsutomo and I work for Saotome-san. I wanted to ask you something about my employer.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『She started a company? How surprising.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well a lot of things happened. I wanted to ask about Mio-san’s friends in school. Particularly about her close friend called Aa-chan.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a little weird to be asking about a plush toy. That’s why I purposefully acted ignorant and asked as if Aa-chan is a human friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can hear a surprised and bewildered voice from the other side of the phone. But the words that came out of her mouth were something unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Can we meet?』</span></p>
