<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to Try her Best</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been about a week since that fierce UNO race we had. Today, I am changing the calendar sheets in Mio-san’s house and mine forward by one month.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“July” is written below a photograph where clear blue skies are reflected in the beach resort. The arrival of summer is almost tangible at this point.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After having the first soumen<span id='easy-footnote-1-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5974' title='A type of noodles that is typically eaten in summer. It signifies that summer has arrived, kind of like watermelon or mangoes '><sup>1</sup></a></span> of the year for dinner, Mio-san and I were contemplating how to pass the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「When it comes to summer nights it must definitely be this—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I won’t disagree with you. At the same time I can’t go so far as to agree with you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I get it, it’s the feeling that you won’t be able to go on living if you don’t twist reality to something much more comfortable to you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of Mio-san, who has switched to lighter clothes welcoming summer is a table, and on that there is a blu-ray disc, carelessly strewn about.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The title is 『A Ghost’s Bon curry<span id='easy-footnote-2-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5974' title='Bon curry is a famous instant curry brand in japan, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/160d7e471b203047873e1a3dd366c42e/image_l.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; is coloured mostly red and yellow'><sup>2</sup></a></span>』. It’s a small scale B-grade horror film made using low budget and few people… but the point is….</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You know I heard that this movie was terrifying」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even though you say that, the package looks comical. With it being mostly red and yellow, isn’t this almost the same as a curry box?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The manager of the customer who lent this to me showed him a video of him watching the movie with his family. Do you know what happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「A video of people watching another video huh…. How complicated….. So what did they do? Did they shriek or push over the juice or something?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it is only that much then it’s simple matter for a slightly timid person to have such a reaction. In the first place, it doesn’t have to be interesting to achieve such a result.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well, Matsutomo-san, can you tell me what comes out of one’s face」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What is it, suddenly? Do you mean something like blushing when embarrassed? <span id='easy-footnote-3-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5974' title='TL: The expression for “blushing” when translated into English literally means ‘Fire coming out of one’s face'><sup>3</sup></a></span>」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, I meant liquids that come out of your face. Can you tell me? 」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liquid, huh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s see, from the top it would be sweat, tears, mucus, saliva and….. do you also want to include things like vomit? 」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Everything came out」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Including those?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Including those」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the flow of this conversation, I want to know what “those” include.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see, I see. It’s frightening to a terrifying extent huh. No wonder, no wonder.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It will be alright. Since it was a customer that lent it, I want to watch it. But you know, it’s very difficult. I watched a little once and it was very difficult to watch it by myself」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You mean to say that it is better to watch the entire thing together with me than to survive the experience alone? Even if you say so, don’t women dislike showing such things in front of other people….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will work hard and try not to release any. Moreover, even though it’s embarrassing…. If it’s Matsutomo-san then I am fine with showing everything」<span id='easy-footnote-4-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5974' title='ED: The allusions, the possibilities, the flags, Mio-san is quite dangerous.'><sup>4</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words, a different connotation comes to my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Th, That’s right, why don’t we call Tsuchiya or Murasaki?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two is better than one and three is better than two. I feel bad getting them involved repeatedly but I bet they will be happy to get invited by Saotome-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Today is a no go」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Re, Really?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s because this is something that I must be doing. Even if Matsutomo-san were not available I wouldn’t have called upon them」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I would have attended to them though…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, an uncharacteristically clear reasoning has come out of night mode Mio-san. I was startled at such a rare reaction from her. Looking at my face Mio-san hurriedly waves her hand around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eh, Ah, That, I was simply thinking if we would be disturbing them. Tsuchiya-san and Murasaki-san both seem to have it tough at work」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If it’s them I think they would be glad to meet you…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is that so….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, definitely. Nonetheless, calling them out on a weekday would be bad I guess. Should we put it off for today and watch it over the weekend?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tomorrow I am meeting with the person who lent it to me. So I have to watch it today…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s why I told you that the holiday homework should not be postponed until the last possible moment…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sad fate of a salaryman. You can’t escape from your schedule. It is harder than escaping from the demon king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Preparing myself with the resolve to die a noble death if I can’t escape, I took the Blu-ray disc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will play it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ye, Yes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…… Here I go」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moving from the sofa, I switch off the lights and on the projector and playstation 4. They look like they have been abandoned for two years after a salesperson’s recommendation that should have been something like this “If you want to watch movies and videos then go for this one!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Vrrrrrrrrrr…….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『A Ghost’s Bon curry』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The icon wavers and the title screen is displayed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「As expected, doesn’t it look cheap and not scary at all? Till where have you watched it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Till the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <span id='easy-footnote-5-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5974' title='TL: Fufu superstitious aren’t we'><sup>5</sup></a></span>second」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Much shorter than my estimation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, is it fine if I hold your hands? 」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sure, it’s fine, it’s fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san’s tiny left hand weighs down on my right hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grasping the hands that were placed over me, it strikes me how thin her fingers are. With such tiny hands she is surviving independently in this world. Such tenderness started building up within me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was taken over by such feelings, next to me Mio-san who was taut with tension opened her mouth with a stiff expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「7」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「6」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ummm, Mio-san what is the countdown for?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s actually pretty clear that it is the countdown for the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> second which stumped Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「5」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「4」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the countdown proceeds, the pressure on my hand, which is being grasped, keeps getting stronger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「3」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「2」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What in the world happens at the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> second……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「1」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!??」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ababababababababababababababababbabababababababababababa」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!!!!!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wait, wait, wait. Waahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「NO, NO, NO, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Haaa, Haaa, Haaa, Haaa,」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorryyyyy!!!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ababababababababbababababa」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Abababababababababababababa」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want to go into details as to what happened after that.<span id='easy-footnote-6-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5974' title=' ED: I’m conflicted. I want to know what they saw, but I also don’t want… '><sup>6</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I too was able to take a step forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow we are able to finish watching the 90 minute movie. When bedtime approached, in front of Mio-san’s bedroom door I was holding a Cross and was acting as a doorguard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Pl, please stay there till I fall asleep. You mustn’t move from the door okay?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, Yes I got you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What do I do when I have to go to the to,to,to,toilet」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It will be fine. Or rather I don’t think you will be able to go even if you want to」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『A Ghost’s Bon curry』was a movie about a woman who was betrayed by her best friend. This woman comes back as a ghost to haunt her best friend and makes curry in her<span id='easy-footnote-7-5974' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5974' title='The betrayer’s'><sup>7</sup></a></span> bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In many ways, I think it’s not a movie that should be watched late at night. Mio-san was petrified for five minutes, standing in front of the door, before she could bring herself to enter the bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. Matsutomo-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s the matter?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will try my best. Tomorrow too, the day after tomorrow as well, I will definitely do my best」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san is already trying her best everyday」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…..Thank you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">From then on the silence continued. The hindrance of mystery, fear and comfort were all absent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took one hour after that for Mio-san’s rhythmic breathing to become audible. I confirmed that she truly had fallen asleep, then quietly slipped back to my own room.</span></p>
