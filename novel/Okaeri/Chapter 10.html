<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Saotome-san&#8217;s Reflection Meeting in her House</h3>

<p>「Please listen, Mio-san.」</p><p>「<em>Bue?</em>」</p><p>What a voice. Sounds like her throat is crushed with a sorrow that runs really deep.</p><p>「This kind of crane game you see. It&#8217;s rigged to always be &#8220;So close yet so far.&#8221; It&#8217;s made so that you&#8217;d always fail when it gets really close. Like missing only for a small bit, or even if you get it the stuff falls off halfway, those kinds of things always happen.」</p><p id="L9">「Eeeh!? Then how much do I need to put in so I can get it?」</p><p>Such an innocent question by Mio-san. But, this case is a little different.</p><p>「Probably, the necessary amount of payment was already paid. Considering its beaten up state, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d put this in just to get rid of it.」</p><p>「Then why.」</p><p>「There&#8217;s only one reason for it, Mio-san.」</p><p>「And that&#8217;s?」</p><p>And that is.</p><p>「It&#8217;s because Mio-san is so bad that you always make it harder to yourself.」</p><p>「Matsutomo-san, do you know the word &#8220;oblate?&#8221;」</p><p>「It&#8217;s a thin paper made from dried pregelatinized starch. It was invented in Europe and was spread around the world. Japanese people used Agar to improve it to a shape that is close to that of today.」</p><p id="L29">「Yes, it&#8217;s good that you know that much. Then, what are we going to do?」</p><p>「Well, just watch.」</p><p>I asked Mio-san to move aside and put my hand on the lever of the crane game.</p><p>「The money&#8230;」</p><p>「Don&#8217;t worry about it, since it won&#8217;t take that much.」</p><p>Mio-san already put considerable amount of money, like a lot. After all of that, I should just be able to get it by catching it.</p>

<p>The seasoned lever fits on my hand. The joints are little loose, but this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p><p>Crane Game Maker Co., Ltd. Seisakusho-san is a long-established store founded in Osaka, it is a fierce battle zone in business. A machine that is packed of know-hows will not hinder its operation due to this degree of aging.</p><p>The winning line was, visible.</p><p>「I will prove you that fate is not something you meet by chance, but rather something you grab.」</p><p>That evening.</p><p>Mio-san got off the elevator on the sixth floor of the apartment building, taking care of two bags dearly. One is a cream colored paper bag and other is a plastic bag with a game maker&#8217;s logo.</p><p>「Thank you for today~. Thank you for your holiday work~.」</p><p>「I completely forgot this was a holiday work. You brought me back to reality.」</p><p>A boss who doesn&#8217;t allow something to rust, and someone that treats things properly.</p><p>Eating pasta at a cafe, going to Sunshine Aquarium to see starfish, such memories became related to business, but that&#8217;s okay.</p><p>「These ones too, are saying thank you.」</p><p id="L66">「Is that so? Though I think it was not the right timing for it.」</p><p>「Not the right timing?」</p><p>「Mio-san, you don&#8217;t have to worry about it.」</p><p>Maybe she was more tired than I expected, as she was getting into the night mode earlier. It wouldn&#8217;t have been good if we had stayed on the road even longer.</p><p>A 28-year-old child version of an onee-san with E-cup with proportionately good features would be released on the roads of Tokyo.</p><p>「<em>Haaaai~ </em>These ones are saying that they understand tooo~」</p><p>「You&#8217;re too close Mio-san. Too close.」</p><p>Also, please stop stuffing my face with your stuffed toy with such a good smile. It&#8217;s too close. Also, it smells like game center.</p><p id="L82">「Oh, please take care of them, okay? Specially the cat, you should treat it with some care.」</p><p>「I will doo iit~」</p><p>「What a good girl.」</p><p>Going along the hallway, Mio-san goes to the front of room 603 and I go to room 605.</p><p>「SeeYaa~」</p><p>「Yes, good work. Sweets are only until 9 o&#8217;clock, and please brush your teeth properly.」</p><p>「<em>Haaaai~</em>」</p><p>Seeing her like this makes me concerned, but she was living just fine even like that before meeting me. I don&#8217;t know how she manages it, but it should be okay.</p><p>Well then, since we haven&#8217;t made any promise of eating together, and considering that the lunch was light. I think it should be okay to make something heavy for dinner.</p><p id="L100">「&#8230;.No, maybe just an instant ramen.」</p><p>After all, today&#8217;s balance is -17,000 Yen.</p><p>「I wasn&#8217;t expecting such a hard battle&#8230; No, I won&#8217;t regret it. Yes, I won&#8217;t.」</p><p>This is the money I received today from Mio-san.</p><p>I won&#8217;t regret using this for Mio-san. Won&#8217;t regret even using more than what I have received.</p><p>「&#8230;.Regret?」</p><p>That word tickled my intuition.</p><p>Mio-san usually regress to being child when she feels any kind of psychological stress.</p><p>Considering she regressed that much today means she was really feeling stressed.</p><p>「We went to look for stuffed toy, ate what we wanted, roamed around aquarium, that should have caused her to refresh&#8230;.?」</p><p>It was because she played at the game center that she wasn&#8217;t used to.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that simple, that&#8217;s what I think.</p><p>*PinPoon*</p><p>「Mio-Sa~n? Are you okay?」</p><p>I pressed the doorbell. no reply.</p><p>「I will go in~.」</p><p>Maybe she&#8217;s taking a shower? If that&#8217;s the case then I should go back quietly.</p><p>But what the situation was not the one I was thinking of.</p><p>I opened the door with the spare key that I received. I opened the door quietly.</p><p>「Ｏｈ……」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5498' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5498' title=' He said this in English '><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>Well then. Was my premonition right?</p><p id="L144">「Fuu-chan, dyu knou, I got hated by Matsutomo-san&#8230;.」</p><p id="L146">「At the store right, I forgot about Matsutomo-san and left him alone, I also talked boring things to him. I even splashed some pasta sauce on him. Not to mention I said some embarrassing things to him too.」</p><p>「I am shure, 10,000 was not enough right? I don&#8217;t think he will go with me anymore right?」</p><p>「Even dou my fwends increased by two, now one is no more.」</p>

<p>「<em>Ue, u, Ueeeeeeeen&#8230;..</em>」<span id='easy-footnote-2-5498' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5498' title=' crying noises '><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>She is wrapping herself with a cat and a dog stuffed toy while confessing the mishaps that she did today. She&#8217;s doing all of that while crying.</p><p>This is a Sabbath.</p><p>It&#8217;s a sabbath called reflection meeting is underway.</p><p>「This is not good.」</p><p>Seriously, this is not good.</p><p>Even though she paid money to make this a work, she was still able to care for trivial things and then regret about it.</p><p>Why did God filled her entirely with regret?</p><p>「No, I don&#8217;t care what God knows. It&#8217;s okay, I&#8217;ll show you. Fate is a something, that is born when two people collide with each other.」</p><p>Mio-san, who noticed my voice, shivered and then slowly turned to look towards me.</p>

<p>「&#8230;.Matsutomo-san? Wai are you here? It&#8217;s break time now? U don&#8217;t hab to be with me?」</p><p>There isn&#8217;t much I can do for this person right now.</p><p>No, there is one thing.</p><p>「Mio-san!」</p><p>「 <em>Ue, Aba, Hai!?</em>」</p><p id="L182">「Let&#8217;s play Uno!!」</p><p>After that, we played Uno for four hours, thereafter I ate ramen with eggs and went home.</p><p>We used the rule that allows us to stack draw twos because it was more fun.</p>
