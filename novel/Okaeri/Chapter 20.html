<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to Gift a Truckload of Flowers</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s been an hour since we started playing UNO.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the Saotome household, where the fragrance of milk tea is left over, Murasaki is sitting straight and staring at the desk with an icy face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is dazed with tears brimming in her eyes and I am lost, unsure of how to react to Murasaki’s abilities which has far exceeded my expectations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, you…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Uuh, Geugh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…..What’s the matter」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Krikkrik, Murasaki turned around like a clockwork automaton to face me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her and then said,</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aren’t you too weak…….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry, I am so sorry Murasaki-san. It is definitely not enjoyable to lose every single round. Sorry.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I never thought that there would come a day where UNO could make a person cry」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Place: Me</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Place: Mio-san</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Place: Murasaki</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all the 10 skirmishes we had, the order/ranking remained the same. Even though Mio-san tried her hardest in this battle of wits she was still unable to win. Actually, she tried too hard, so hard that it resulted in her loss.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is tragic that she’s crying with a face similar to that of kids who wanted to help the butterfly out of the cocoon and in the end made it die.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……Yes!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so Mio-san, who shed tears for a short while, held Murasaki’s hands with a determined face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san this is the last measure」</span></p><div class="nonon-umbra-between-content-1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="nonon-1723283736"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5338730734106541" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block;" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5338730734106541"

I thought of not using it today, but looks like I have to lift the ban」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who stood up from her seat goes towards the corner of the living room where Fuu-chan and the rest have been seated obediently on the chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo senpai, what does Saotome-san mean by playing seriously…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san is going to summon her guardian」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Guardian?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right, guardian」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Can you please explain to me in English?」<span id='easy-footnote-2-5941' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5941' title=' Ofc the raw said Japanese'><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「She will be playing UNO while hugging the plush toy」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has told me before that it’s very important to choose whom to hug depending on their condition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most likely today too, she might shake her butt while asking to God, “Whom do I C-H-O-O-S-E”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. Does it even matter, doing that?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it does」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It does have the effect of calming her mind, actually speaking it also increases her victory by over 3 percent, and it isn’t something that can be made light of.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have wanted to refrain from showing this side to Murasaki. But it looks like she decided that it isn’t the time to be fussing over such things</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, it’s fine if you want to go home and bring Akai-san or Tennosuke」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I don’t have such special powers, so I am fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can somehow understand who she is referring to as Akai-san, but who is this Tennosuke?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-senpai also has plush toys. It is very unexpected of you or……EH?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who is in the living room making sure the plush toys are well accommodated. And looking at her figure Murasaki’s expression fluttered about.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why is Shitora here?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Shitora?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That purple coloured cat plush toy」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. It’s Shitora because it’s a purple coloured tiger. <span id='easy-footnote-3-5941' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5941' title=' The reading of the kanji for violet is Shi, Tiger = Tora, hence Shitora = purple tiger'><sup>3</sup></a></span> Though it’s just a cat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if it is normal nowadays to name your plush toys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I caught one for you too right. Feels like it’s been forever, but has it been a little over a month now」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What do you mean by you “too”」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I got mine from Matsutomo-san too」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That day was really hard wasn’t it…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「To Saotome-san as well, the same thing as mine…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What happened Murasaki?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is brooding over something. Don’t tell me, is she the type to mind about things like gifting the similar things to different people?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The same as Saotome-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is that so」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s take a picture together next time」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「A two-shot while hugging matching plush toys…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is holding her arms together. She should be thinking of hugging Shitora.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-senpai」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Thanks a lot」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「U, Uhh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you saying, with such a serious face, Wh, why are you staring at me with stars in your eyes?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If it’s alright with you, should I lend one to you, Murasaki-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hmm, that’s right since you are asking that much, then I want senpai’s Tennosuke, it sounds like a cool name」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wellll, I wonder if his appearance is good enough」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s fine, I am not the person to particularly care about appearances」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aaa, Ah, well I guess looking at it yourself would be better than listening to me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And hence round two started off in a smooth manner. The sweet fragrance of the refilled milk tea stimulates your brain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of us holding our trump camps on our knees, namely myself with Koro-chan, whom I borrowed from Mio-san, Mio-san with Fuu-chan and Murasaki with Tennosuke signalled the outbreak of war.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san, let’s join hands and defeat Matsutomo-san.

Eh? Then that makes us sworn sisters」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup, Let’s go my sweet little sister」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, Onee-sama」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san, did you calculate this beforehand….!?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san has such a smug expression right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did you want to call someone your younger sister that badly. That face says it all, you really wanted to do it huh. Then again, I think Murasaki is Murasaki for falling for something like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……by the way Matsutomo-senpai」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, Murasaki is holding Tennosuke on her knees with a stiff expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I feel bad putting forth a request after declaring war but…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s it about?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「In the end, is it fine if change him with Akai-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ahh, Akai-san feels good to touch you know」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Compared to Tennosuke then yes, definitely」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akai-san is just as the name states, a red octopus plush toy. I took him in when I went to that specialised shop with Mio-san. The texture feels very nice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Tennosuke is a veteran in my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His full name is Sabohara Tennosuke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before changing my job to Mio-san’s place, he was the one that took care of my house. It’s a potted cactus.</span></p>
