<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants Become an Elder Sister</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san are you fine with a café au lait?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, please」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue forward without being able to get used to her elder sister mode. Fighting spirit, is it?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki… ah, you drink black tea right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Senpai, you remembered」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san, you can’t drink coffee?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, various things happened and…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She dodged Mio-san’s question. She is looking around and avoiding her eyes. Looks like it is a difficult memory even for the person herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was a common topic back at the company.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, you know, overdid it by drinking a lot of black coffee when she entered the company」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Senpai」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Because of that she was unable to sleep at night. Then due to lack of sleep she collapsed in the office」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Senpai!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And after that she just stopped drinking any sort of coffee」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo senpai!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s the matter, I can you hear you even if you call me just once」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ara ara」</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ara ara</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">…, Mio-san, this is the first time I am hearing you laugh like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loading a mode that is 300% unfamiliar to me and roaring out loudly like this, how in the world are you so composed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uuu….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, I too would like to have milk tea, if that is fine. Did you already make it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it’s fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san is also really good at making black tea too, let’s have it together, Murasaki-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san…..!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deeply moved, Murasaki was looking at Mio-san. Is it fine like this Murasaki?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like this the younger sister conversion process is advancing steadily. If she remains like this, I am worried that she will be hoodwinked by some religious group.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Coming in—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I place the milk and the sugar on the table and pour the tea onto the cup through the strainer in the teapot. I can understand why this liquid which is written as red tea would be called black tea in English. The dark liquid has now filled the cup to the brim.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The best flavour can only be extracted with having this strong decoction and then adding milk or hot water according to one’s preferences…. Is what I read online, but having tried it out, it didn’t taste much different from normal, so I am just continuing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, I am thankful that there was a teapot that could hold enough tea for three people. It was there from before my appearance into her life, looks like Mio-san too has dreamt of such a gathering.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What a nice smell!&#8230;. This tea has great flavor, which one is this?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「FuFu, Asham!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumbled. Since I am talking about unfamiliar things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Assam!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I corrected myself quick enough but, my face is burning up and selling me out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it’s just Murasaki so it should be fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san is surprisingly a mischievous person. I really admire lovely women like you&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Haha, no, that is」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I was always told that I lacked any womanly charm…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san is really cute, honestly」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she takes to a person, then she will wholeheartedly like them, that’s the sort of person Murasaki is. Since she is already seeing Mio-san through coloured glasses, a few, no, quite a lot of mistakes have become a plus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san, being herself, is looking at it through a weird filter (little sister filter) so the situation feels like a banter between two sisters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now then, the beverages are also ready. Why don’t we start?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right, it’s the perfect time」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We are talking about that right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if answering her queries, I quietly placed a box with a logo on it on top of the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s this (UNO)」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why are you putting on such a solemn atmosphere…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You will get to know soon」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearing out space on the table, I started dealing the cards. Since we’ve been playing with only the two of us so far, just dealing for three people in itself feels fresh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There is nothing wrong with the number of cards right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「O, Okay」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, let’s begin the game!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I began the game with that announcement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Games should naturally be fair to all the players. But here’s the problem, I had an overwhelming advantage over them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san do you recognize this?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Mio-san who was happily smiling as she drew a card and it became my turn to play.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, recognize what?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You have never played UNO with anyone else other than me, so you don’t know the true value of this card」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Giving a sideward glance at Mio-san who is tilting her head in doubt, I choose a yellow card and place it upside down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Removing my hand from it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「『Reverse』Card OPEN!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「EH」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear the sound of Mio-san getting flustered and breathing louder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This card, which didn&#8217;t really have much of a role when it was only two of us, will lead to menacing situations quite often, since now there are at least three people in the game.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Reverse』is a card that changes the order of turns, from clockwise to anti-clockwise or vice versa. According to the game rules, when there are only two players it functions just like the skip card. But according to Saotome house rules, it doesn’t have any function and is a useless cad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore this will be the first time that Mio-san has come to experience the effects of this card. Consequently, now it is again Mio-san’s turn to play. On her previous turn she ended it by drawing a card, as she had nothing suitable to play.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now when I use a reverse without changing the colour from yellow she will have to draw cards again, thereby increasing the number of cards she has. There is a high probability that Mio-san might lose the first game because of this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, what are you going to do Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. Murasaki-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wh, what is it Saotome-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am sorry for doing this when you have only two cards at your hand, but if you have to hate someone then hate Matsutomo-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hoho, you are going to play a card?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saotome-san searches for a card, picks it up and puts it down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels like she just put it down carelessly but the card lands perfectly on top of the card pile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「『Yellow Draw 2』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tch, were you saving it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the Saotome house rules you can stack draw twos and draw fours on top of each other, so you are forced to play one more than the other person does (it’s okay to stack a draw four on top of a draw two, but it is forbidden to stack a draw two on a draw four).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, if someone plays this card, then it is an invitation for an all out war with either side exhausting all their strategic weapons, just like Pearl Harbour.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I was wondering if I should show Matsutomo-san some special consideration since I am always under his care, but if you are going to play this way, then I will gladly respond in kind」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah! Just as I thought, if you are going to expose your thoughts openly like this then I will feel troubled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t really mean it like that and Mio-san realises it as well. But still, it has become like this because she is unable to ease her discomfort.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If you are able to have the leisure to be considerate then I am surprised. I always go at full power」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「As expected from Matsutomo-san. Now, it’s your turn Murasaki-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eh, ah, yes. Red dr, draw two!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have this urge to say something that fit’s the ambience, but for some reason I am not able to think of anything. Anyways, Murasaki, did you try calling out loud now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Nothing like that senpai. Now, now, it’s your turn hurry up」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fuuumu」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at my cards after teasing her, I find three cards on my hand. I am close to finishing the game but that also means that my war potential is very low.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ara, you look quite worried. It’s okay even if you don’t give yourself a handicap you know. My draw has not come to an end yet」</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ufufu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Mio-san is laughing in a weird way that I have never heard before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then, I will go with a draw four」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ue?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「As for the colour… Make it blue」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was saving it for such a situation. My trump card, draw four.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uee….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san lost at the draw war that she herself started and drew 8 cards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, it’s my turn right. There, blue!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki happily placed a blue 4 on top of the pile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, did you know?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Four is number that invites misfortune」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This apartment building also avoids the cursed number, there are no rooms ending in 4. My room is 603 and then it is Mio-san at 605.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And, what does that have to do here…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san, did you say UNO?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki silently drew two cards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Did you get Murasaki? Creating a trap and making people get caught up in the conversation preventing them from saying UNO is an adult’s way of doing things.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Isn’t that just a make-shift off the board tactic….! Fine! I will also get serious and play no holds barred」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fufu, is that worship towards my skill that I am sensing?」</span></p>
