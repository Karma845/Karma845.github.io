<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Want to Make Saotome-san Take a Leave</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You can make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tamagozake </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">at home </span><span style="font-weight: 400">∼</span><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it’s very simple to make with a microwave oven」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「How did you make it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「First you scramble the eggs, then you add sugar and honey to it……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is gulping down the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagozake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> while listening to me with great interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gochisousama</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">∼</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. So this is how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagozake </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">tastes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will teach you how to make it once you get better. Let’s make it together!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Make it!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, it is time for your medicine.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san’s face stiffened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s okay, because we have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Okusuri Nom***ane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> at hand. With this magical product brought by Tsuchiya there is no such thing as an unpalatable medicine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This feeling when you take it out, is simply too good」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Grape flavoured?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it’s grape」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On TV they squeeze out the jelly in a small bowl, add the medicine, then cover it all up with more jelly and then feed it using a spoon. But doing so leads to the usage of one entire cylinder’s worth of jelly. It should be fine to directly use the spoon. (TL: To those interested in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsgIH2OLO1A"><span style="font-weight: 400">TV version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Say Ahhhh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aaaa—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">…… I wonder if this is how it feels to raise a chicklet at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There, you did a good job. Now all that is left is for you is to sleep tight in order to recover」</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">「Un</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, then….</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Don’t worry, I am not going back. I will be in the living room till you sleep」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is probably thinking about the overtime pay. After all this person is someone who worries over such things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…. Thanks」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Oyasuminasai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Oyasumi……</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I switch off the bedroom lights, go to the living room and plop myself down in the couch</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……Yes, yes …. That is so …..Oh, I see…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…….Got it. Now, if you look here…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear Mio-san’s voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she is speaking to someone over the phone. Struggling to open my eyes I notice the morning sun, shining its light through the curtain gaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nnn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">….. Did I end up falling asleep……?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seems like I myself fell asleep on the couch after putting Mio-san to sleep. This couch looks really expensive and true to its appearance, I neither feel any joint aches nor do I have a stiff neck. Ah, this feels great!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tried to get up, I noticed a pink blanket wrapped over me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I wonder if Mio-san wrapped it over me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…….Yes, to the left. So the budget…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t see her as she was in the sofa’s blindspot but I could hear her speaking over the phone in the living room. It is evident that she has already recovered from her fever.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you just look at this aspect of her being busy with a phone call right after the day she was sick, she appears to be a standard workaholic. Well, if you think about it that part too is just like her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I guess it’s also time for me to be doing my job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, will I make it in time if I start making the coffee. I should make one for myself in order to stay awake」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Got it. Aa, Sada-san, could you please bring last year’s accounting files back with you? The one with the budget estimates for the project that you pulled in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">……Eh?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something feels off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructions that she is giving out seem to be clear and concise but it gives off the feeling that she is sitting in her office desk and not at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry to keep you waiting. Yes, then let’s do a preliminary calculation at this place. The yen compared to last year has appreciated by 3 points against the dollar affecting the exchange rate, therefore…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-sannnnn??!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up to have a look at Mio-san who was hidden in the blindspot. It was at this moment that my brain resigned itself to accept reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm, Sada-san did I do something wrong….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who is wearing nothing but her underwear and a blouse, is holding a slipper to her ear with one hand, furiously stirring the natto with the other hand and giving out orders to Fuu-chan.<span id='easy-footnote-1-5881' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5881' title='ED: So that’s why she was looking for Fuu-chan '><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of this highly ambiguous situation, I was petrified.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fuuuuu——Haaaaaaa——」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take deep breaths. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s first analyse the situation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Directing all the oxygen available to my brain<span id='easy-footnote-2-5881' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5881' title='ED: Full power to processing systems'><sup>2</sup></a></span>, I observed every nook and cranny of the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">My thoughts started accelerating and picked up all the necessary information required from the chaotic room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">■ </span><b>Blanket</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san used it to cover me. She was worried that I might wake up and did it with care. Pink coloured, Tarepanda pattern.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">■</span><b>Disordered Kitchen</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Traces of the kitchen being used.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san who woke up, went to the kitchen to make something without waking me up」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">■ </span><b>Dassai</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Has been used.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The famous sake from Yamaguchi prefecture that Tsuchiya brought with him.

But it’s strange that the distinct smell of heated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is not present</span><span style="font-weight: 400">」<span id='easy-footnote-3-5881' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5881' title='ED: Well, there are other ways of using sake, and the way Mio-san is acting&amp;#8230; '><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">■</span><b>Scattered Pajamas</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pajamas from Mio-san’s spring and autumn collection.

Gingham check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">■</span><b>Slipper [Right]</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forsaken in the bedroom.

Left unattended on top of the table</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trial ends here. All that is left is to try and recreate the scene from the past. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yosh,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> What transpired should be…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">―――</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Approximately 15 minutes before</span><span style="font-weight: 400">―――</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s already morning. I still feel a bit feverish but,….. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Un</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I should be able to go to work</span><span style="font-weight: 400">」 </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who just woke up, leaves the bedroom and finds me sleeping in the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Looks like Matsutomo-san slept over yesterday. Let’s not disturb him」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She puts a blanket over me, then goes to the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I want to eat something. I didn’t even get to have dinner yesterday…… That’s right, let’s try to make the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagozake </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">that Matsutomo-san made yesterday. It’s not good to drink alcohol before going to work, but it should be fine since the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagosake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> from yesterday didn’t really taste like or had the effects of alcohol」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san doesn’t know.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that I made sure to reduce the alcohol content even if it took quite a while to prepare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What else, add sugar, honey and ensure to stir well…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After gathering the ingredients Mio-san starts to cook.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of being inexperienced, the fever confused her and the recipe she remembered ended up incomplete. She forgot to heat the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> up using the microwave, she usually wouldn’t make such a mistake.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Something feels wrong…. Well, I can’t expect to make something good like Matsutomo-san right from the start」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please recognise it, Mio-san. Quite a few things are amiss.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Gulp, gulp. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuah. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I thought, I should make sure to properly learn this time. It tastes too much like alcohol, not delicious at all….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s because it </span><b>is</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> alcohol. You have just mixed raw eggs, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and sugar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s get to work, work. Though yesterday was a big turning point, I still have a lot left to do.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Dassai』is 16% alcohol, it is obvious that you will get drunk when you one shot it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Pick out the clothes</span><span style="font-weight: 400">∼</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, I must go to the awfice—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the alcohol starts to kick in, Mio-san staggers to the bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She throws away her pajamas on her way to the bedroom. Mio-san then, from the closet, picks out a blouse and skirt to wear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ahh! That’s right, I have to call the customer—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reached for her smartphone that was near the bed…… I mean the slipper [left] that was underneath it. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hello. Good morning, Saotome here. Yes, thank you for yesterday. As soon as I reach the company I will look at the mail and….. wait a second, amn’t I already in the company?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forget to wear the skirt and continue the call with the slipper in that state. And with that we arrive at the present where Mio-san in her bewilderment mistook home for office.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……Hence, you have in front of you a working Mio-san wearing nothing but her underwear and blouse. Got it, got it.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I do understand what happened, but how did it end up this way?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Particularly that natto, why was it over there. Anyways, I have to put an end to this.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting closer to Mio-san you can see that her eyes are filled with tears, listening to her subordinate Fuu-chan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san, Mio-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, no one is talking with me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn, she has already regressed to a kid from all the stress.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fuu-chan can’t talk in the first place. Please pull yourself together.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aa-chan talked to me…. I can’t take it anymore. I am going to return home already.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This </span><b>is </b><span style="font-weight: 400">your home. There, let go of the natto」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s a lie, this is awfice.

What to do now, she has already used all four packets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ueeee</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">……I can’t do my work without it…. The company will collapse…..!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yosh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I am at my wit’s end」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that it has come to this, there’s no other way. It’s time to enlist someone else’s help. After all, two heads are better than one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take my phone and open the recent call log.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tring tring</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes, Tsuchiya speaking』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s me, Matsutomo. Is it okay to talk now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes, what might you require?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the phone Tsuchiya is full-on business mode.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looks like he already reached the office and most likely has a certain wig-head standing next to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Really sorry for calling you in the midst of work, but I require your wisdom to tide through this crisis. Have you ever used an abacus?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『…….Eh? No, I mean yes, I have experience doing such a thing during my school』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That will do. Let’s put that know-how to use. What do you do to stop a woman who is convinced that natto is abacus and uses it with the intent of saving her company?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Whaat??』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few exchanges, at the end of the strategy meeting, Tsuchiya’s idea was to make Mio-san eat some ice to turn her back to normal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she couldn’t possibly go to office while having a fever and being drunk on top of that, she has to take a leave. I think it should be fine as she is taking leave only because of inexplicable circumstances and because she is sick.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s note: It’s already 5 am by the time I post this out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this the nursing arc is now complete. Next is the 「Night Duel」arc. The pitiable junior who keeps popping out intermittently will make an appearance. Tsuchiya will also be making an appearance.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoroshikuonegaiitashimasu</span></i></p>
