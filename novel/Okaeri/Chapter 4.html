<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Saotome-san Can&#8217;t Hold on</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s been a week since I was head hunted <span id='easy-footnote-1-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5232' title=' work related slang, usually means scouted to work for a company. '><sup>1</sup></a></span> by Mio-san. No, actually it&#8217;s been a week since I&#8217;ve been physically hunted by Mio-san.</p><p>Although it was such a short period of time, I was able to learn few things about her, Mio-san, my employer onee-san.</p><p>「For that matter, I&#8217;ve left everything to Oshiyama and his crew. Yes, I&#8217;ve also looked at the email that I&#8217;ve seen on one of the CCs, so I know everything about it without any missing details. Also it was Oshiyama&#8217;s crew&#8230;. Yes, that project, they are the ones who were responsible. So please rest assured.」</p><p>Her name is Saotome Mio-san. She is twenty-eight years old and apparently, she is part of one of the marketing teams in some company. Although the scale is quite small, it is a company that has respectable results. It was also responsible for the marketing of some huge projects that happened this year.</p><p>Since she is one of the members of said company, this scene, where she holds a cup of coffee while talking to one of her clients, is familiar to me already.<br /> After talking quite seriously on the phone, she put down her phone and shrugged her shoulders.</p><p id="L12">「Coffee got cold.」</p><p>「Like I thought it would happen, so I&#8217;ve already prepared a new one.」</p><p>「Wow, thanks!」</p><p>She has a light make up beside her thick eye make up. Apparently, it is a &#8220;blade&#8221; that she uses to avoid getting underestimated by other marketing groups.</p><p>She looks like a knight who is receiving a coffee from her subordinate.</p><p id="L22">「Well then, if I don&#8217;t go any time soon I won&#8217;t be able to finish my work.」</p><p>「Ok, take care. <em>Itterashai!</em>」</p><p>「<em>Ittekimasu!</em>」</p><p>I sighed, after seeing off Mio-san whose her heels were making noise on the hallway.</p><p>It is also part of my job to prepare coffee for Mio-san, who usually doesn&#8217;t eat breakfast, beside saying &#8220;<em>Itterashai&#8221; </em>to her every time she leaves.</p><p>After suggesting &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it weird for me to say &#8216;Okaerinsasai&#8217; without seeing you off as well?&#8221; Mio-san&#8217;s face went bright while smiling. I can still remember that face even though it has been a week already.</p><p>「Well then! Prepare yourself, floor!」</p><p>I put the two cups into the cupboard after washing them, then returned to the living room.</p><p>I didn&#8217;t expect that I would become a man who&#8217;d say &#8220;Prepare yourself, floor!&#8221; But after last week, I actually became a man who loves a dust-free floor, so I guess I stand corrected now.</p>

<p>「It took me until yesterday to take care of the plastic bottles&#8230;.. So maybe, today I will be taking care of the books inside the boxes.」</p><p>The things I learned about Mio-san, second part: Mio-san&#8217;s sense of hygiene is off. <span id='easy-footnote-2-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5232' title=' off like unnatural, strange, etc. '><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>The room that I thought to be a room full of garbage had no molds growing anywhere, and no bad smell either. According to Mio-san, she had taken care of unsanitary things such as bento boxes and other food garbage, so there is no smell or molds even though the room looked like a garbage dump.</p><p>But, she left things such as empty plastic bottles, opened mails, and unopened packages on the floor.</p><p>The reason for that is because &#8220;They&#8217;re not dirty.&#8221;</p><p>「But look, the &#8216;PET&#8217; in the &#8216;petto bottle&#8217; means Polyethylene Terephthalate! It&#8217;s harmless to the human body, and it does not grow molds on the surface, so it&#8217;s safe to leave it for a while&#8230;.」</p><p>&#8230;or so according to Mio-san. Remembering that cool looking onee-san, and then this kind of onee-san, such a gap is causing my head to scream in pain&#8230;</p><p>No matter what Mio-san says, it&#8217;s not good if the person in cause needs to look for a gap in between clutters of plastic bottles and clumps of boxes just to be able to sleep.</p><p>Because I was head hunted by Mio-san, I started to use my long free hours on cleaning the house five days ago.</p><p>「I, I feel happy about it, okay Matsutomo-kun? But shouldn&#8217;t we share the responsibility? Like isn&#8217;t there something that a male wouldn&#8217;t like to touch?」</p><p>「Look Mio-san. This is indeed your house, but this is also my place of work, okay?」</p><p>「Eh? T, that&#8217;s right?」</p><p id="L64">「I am an employee that&#8217;s been hired under the employee contract, right?」</p><p id="L64">「Yes.」</p><p>「It is both a right and an obligation for employees to improve their work environment.」</p><p>「Abababa.」</p><p>The things I learned about Mio-san, part three: that &#8220;abababa,&#8221; looks like a phrase that the speaker herself doesn&#8217;t understand.<span id='easy-footnote-3-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5232' title=' ED: maybe it is something like the cat girl&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;nya&amp;#8221; '><sup>3</sup></a></span></p><p>「Fortunately, the moving company wrote about the contents on the boxes. I won&#8217;t touch anything that might intrude your privacy.」</p><p>「I understand&#8230;..」</p><p>And so, it was up to my efforts to create a physically open workplace.</p><p>The things I learned about Mio-san, part four: well, it may be obvious but I will mention it anyways.</p><p id="L82">「Hm, it&#8217;s about time for her to come home.」</p><p>“PinPooon~~”</p><p>After freeing up the floor, I went back to my home. I usually go to &#8220;work&#8221; to Saotome-san&#8217;s house when it&#8217;s almost 5pm. Since Mio-san goes off work at 5pm, I won&#8217;t have to wait for her that much if I do this.</p><p>If you do it for an entire week, you would notice when she usually goes off work. Since I&#8217;m here anyways, I cooked dinner and at around 6pm the doorbell rang.</p><p>「<em>Tada, ima~&#8230;..?</em>」</p><p>「<em>Okaerinasai</em>」</p><p>「<em>T, tadaima!</em>」</p><p>「<em>Hai, Okaerinasai.</em> Thank you for doing your best today.」</p><p>「Your&#8217;re here! Matsutomo-san is here!」</p><p>「Of course, since this is my job.」</p><p>「Of course! Because this is your job! Thankfully you have this job!」</p><p>「ahahaha&#8230;..」</p><p>Again, the things I learned about Mio-san, part four, again: Mio-san gets lonely easily, can&#8217;t communicate well, and also kind of takes things backwards.</p><p>Every time she arrives, she stands at the door thinking &#8220;maybe no one is here anymore.&#8221; This kind of conversation happened on each day of this past week.</p><p>「There are many couples in the world who live together before getting married.」</p><p>Also, if she gets tired at work, her mental age drops a little.</p><p>「Yes, yes. it&#8217;s cohabitation right?」</p><p>Though I don&#8217;t understand it that much because I don&#8217;t have any experience.</p><p>「Why is it that you can leave your house when someone said &#8220;love&#8221; to you?&#8230;. Why?&#8230;.」</p><p>「Leave?」</p><p id="L122">「Even though you won&#8217;t be able to do anything once you want to go home but you can&#8217;t anymore.」</p><p>I really do not understand such things well. Also, Mio-san is really strange as well, especially when she suddenly talks about something like this.</p><p>「Well it&#8217;s something like trust don&#8217;t you think?」</p><p>「Trust&#8230;.」</p><p>「Yes yes, a trusting relationship.」</p><p>「Trust, trust you say! Even though you&#8217;re the one who tried to get close to me since half a year ago, manager of XX company!」<span id='easy-footnote-4-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5232' title=' I think she&amp;#8217;s saying that someone is trying to get close to her, I&amp;#8217;m not sure '><sup>4</sup></a></span></p><p>Not good, I stepped on a landmine.</p><p>「Calm down, calm down, let&#8217;s not talk about it on the door step. Why don&#8217;t we talk about it while eating dinner?」</p><p>「Dinner!」</p>

<p>「Today&#8217;s dinner is ginger grilled pork.」</p><p>「Is there Miso soup?」</p><p>「It has fried tofu with soy, with soy, and with soy.」</p><p>「Yaaaaay!」<span id='easy-footnote-5-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5232' title=' ED: I also feel good when I get food, lolz '><sup>5</sup></a></span></p><p>Even if I was away from kitchen for a long time due to my work before, I&#8217;m used to cooking some things because I had to cook for myself when I was a student. As long as there&#8217;s enough time and budget, I have the skills to make a normal dinner.</p><p>Since Mio-san is really looking forward to the dishes that I make, it makes everything worth doing it.</p><p>「I&#8217;m going to get changed!」</p><p>「Ok, ok.」</p><p>「HELP ME!」<span id='easy-footnote-6-5232' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5232' title=' that&amp;#8217;s a nose dive mental age deterioration. '><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p>「No.」</p>

<p>I need to be alert at all times because such infantile responses come out very often. Even if she&#8217;s a kid inside, she has a D or E cup that makes everything hard. Everything will go wrong if I lose my calm.</p><p>That said, I won&#8217;t completely deny the quote &#8220;It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s shame to deny woman&#8217;s offer.&#8221;</p><p>But if that offering is a kid&#8217;s meal, then the guy that eats it is a demon.</p><p>「Look, if you don&#8217;t hurry up the food will get cold.」</p><p>「<em>Haaaai~</em>」</p><p>After seeing Mio-san enter her bedroom, I reheated the Miso soup.</p><p>I thought that from then on, only a peaceful dinner would happen. I think Mio-san thought so too.</p><p>Until that point, when those two black-demons attacked</p>
