<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to go Play</h3>

<p>Today is Saturday. No work.</p><p>Although at my job the boundary between work and private is somewhat ambiguous, but it&#8217;s a proper job where I have to say &#8220;okaerinasai&#8221; to Mio-san.</p><p>Therefore, holidays are provided in accordance to the law. Not to mention, I actually have two-day holidays for the weekends. <span id='easy-footnote-1-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5358' title=' It&amp;#8217;s usual for a company to have a work until Saturday, leaving Sunday their only rest day '><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>I started working at my previous job because I was baited by the &#8220;two-days rest.&#8221; It&#8217;s a funny story now that I remember it. <span id='easy-footnote-2-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5358' title=' Most likely the rest days he would get were only 2 days overall. '><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>The difference between full-rest and non-full-rest. According to the law, the number of holidays in June 2009 should be &#8220;ten-days&#8221; but the non-full-rest would only get &#8220;six-days.&#8221; From just there, you can see the huge difference between the two.</p><p>「Well, it&#8217;s almost time for the &#8220;Matsuri&#8221;<span id='easy-footnote-3-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5358' title='festival'><sup>3</sup></a></span> to start.」</p><p>It is now different from a long time ago, when I was depressed due to not getting enough rest.</p><p>Now that I am in a full-rest job, there&#8217;s always some idle time. Because I got weekends as holidays in accordance to Mio-san&#8217;s schedule, there&#8217;s an abundance of free time for me, so that I can start guessing what the contents in T.V. shows would be.</p><p>Looks like there are these group of adults arguing about who missed a beat in a rhythm game during today&#8217;s contents.</p><p>It&#8217;s amazing, the actual situation is filled with excuses from this rhythm game mania, and due to that, the contents of the program are no longer clear. This is why I can&#8217;t stop trying to guess the show&#8217;s contents.</p><p>「<em>Fuu</em>, I had a fulfilling start for Saturday.」</p><p>Even if I have a lot of time to spend on holidays, it still can&#8217;t defeat this nuance that I get from working. <span id='easy-footnote-4-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5358' title=' Well, you&amp;#8217;re working for Mio-tan, of course it&amp;#8217;s different. '><sup>4</sup></a></span></p><p>Moreover, even if Mio-san is prone to loneliness, it should be stressing for her to be with someone who she just met a week ago, every day. <span id='easy-footnote-5-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5358' title=' You underestimate Mio-tan. '><sup>5</sup></a></span></p><p>I&#8217;m sure there are days where she just wants to live her days alone, peacefully.</p><p>*Ping-Poon*</p><p>「Matsutomo-san, are you there?」</p><p>But it seems that such days do not exist.</p><p id="L37">「Mio-san? What&#8217;s wrong? It&#8217;s quite early in the morning.」</p><p>「I&#8217;m sorry for intruding on you even though it&#8217;s a rest day. I just have something to say.」</p><p>In front of the entrance was Mio-san, who was dressed with a tight t-shirt and a pair of short pants. Her thighs are dazzling in the morning sun. <span id='easy-footnote-6-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5358' title=' Hohooh, I see, you&amp;#8217;re a man of culture as well. '><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>

<p>「What would that be? Is there something that you&#8217;re curious about?」</p><p>「Yes, well&#8230;.. It&#8217;s about yesterday&#8217;s night.」</p><p>「&#8230;.Indeed, things were hectic yesterday.」</p><p>Well, Mio-san.</p><p>I am not really sure about this Mio-san.</p><p>Do you really want to talk about that Mio-san?</p><p>There are some tacit rules between Mio-san and I.</p><p>Most adults don&#8217;t want other people to see their child regressing mentally and acting spoiled. But at this job, that is something you should always expect to happen.</p><p>Also, Mio-san and I are at least working adults.<br /> What happened at night, you shouldn&#8217;t talk about it in the morning. Such unwritten rule was settled between Mio-san and I.</p><p>However, Mio-san came and started breaking it. This is the very first case of that happening ever since the start of the work.</p><p>Well, I guess things such as hugging someone while she is in her underwear should not be something to just skip over.</p><p id="L70">「Well then, this will be the continuation about the conversation we had yesterday.」</p><p id="L70">「O, okay.」</p><p>Mio-san took something from the pocket of her short pants.<br /> It is a red thing with a yellow logo on it.</p><p>「Wanna play Uno?」<span id='easy-footnote-7-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5358' title=' &amp;#8230; '><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p>It&#8217;s Uno. <span id='easy-footnote-8-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-5358' title=' ED: The shock might have been too much, and now she either forgot, or she has regressed her mental age, forever. Or she just doesn&amp;#8217;t mind it. I believe we all want such a job '><sup>8</sup></a></span></p><p id="L81">「So you&#8217;re talking about that. Did you want to play Uno with &#8220;no stacking of draw twos&#8221; rule?」</p><p>「&#8230;.Sorry, I was just kidding.」</p><p>I&#8217;m sure that was completely serious. Aren&#8217;t your eyebrows frowning?<br /> It&#8217;s all the same Mio-san even if she&#8217;s currently in her Morning-mode Mio-san right now. <span id='easy-footnote-9-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-9-5358' title=' Morning mode Mio-san is the one that works.

So let&#8217;s play it later.」</p><p>「Oh is that so, that&#8217;s nice of you to consider.」</p><p>Although her mouth is saying morning-mode Mio-san&#8217;s words, her face is smiling happily like how night-mode Mio-san would do.</p><p>「So what is the thing that you&#8217;re really here for?」</p><p>「Well, about that.」</p><p>She took something from the other pocket.</p><p>Ah, amazing. It&#8217;s a wallet where you can only put bills and cards. It&#8217;s my first time seeing someone using it. <span id='easy-footnote-10-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-10-5358' title=' A wallet where you can&amp;#8217;t put any coins or anything. Pure slits only for cards and bills. '><sup>10</sup></a></span></p><p>Mio-san grabbed a 10,000 Yen bill from her elite-looking-elite-only wallet. Then she passed it on to me, elegantly.</p><p>「I will pay you 10,000 Yen. So would you consider coming with me to buy some stuffed toys?」</p><p id="L106">「Although I understand what you&#8217;re saying, but at the same time, I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re saying.」<span id='easy-footnote-11-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5358' title=' You understand the meaning, literally, of the words. But you don&amp;#8217;t understand the feelings or motive, behind the words. '><sup>11</sup></a></span></p><p>「?」</p><p>Oh, this is something that I need to use my imagination for.</p><p>I understand the second half. Even if you&#8217;re an adult, I understand that you still would want stuffed toys sometimes. Mio-san herself has a stuffed toy named &#8220;Fuu-chan&#8221; in her room, I understand if she wanted to get more.</p><p>I also somewhat understand that she&#8217;d invite an acquaintance to buy that.</p><p>But the problem is the first half.<br /> What do you mean &#8220;pay 10,000 Yen.&#8221;</p><p>Wait, what day is it again today? Oh right, it&#8217;s Saturday, which is a holiday.</p>

<p id="L121">「Maybe that 10,000 Yen is for overtime work in holidays?」</p><p>「Eh? Is there anything else for it?」</p><p>I was right. This person is trying to apply labor-management contract to go out on Saturday.</p><p>「Why should you pay? I could just go out with you for shopping anytime you want.」</p><p>「Impossible.」</p><p id="L131">I got denied instantly.</p><p id="L131">「By impossible, you mean?」</p><p>「I mean?」</p><p>「It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re completely strangers, you can always just invite me for shopping, can&#8217;t you?」</p>

<p>「I think you don&#8217;t have the proper perspective Matsutomo-san. Imagine it. Going for a shopping with me for an hour. <span id='easy-footnote-12-5358' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5358' title=' Hmm, pure bliss?

'><sup>13</sup></a></span></p><p>「Well, I find it fun?」</p><p id="L147">「I know right? You&#8217;ll be disgusted.」</p><p>She denied me again.</p><p id="L151">「I would at least think &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s getting bored.&#8221;」</p><p>「<em>Haaah.</em>」</p><p id="L155">「I mean, Matsutomo-san would surely continue shopping together with me until the end right?」</p><p id="L155">「Well, that&#8217;s for sure.」</p><p>「I think I won&#8217;t be able to endure the guilt I&#8217;d feel for making you go with me.」</p><p>I forgot.</p><p>This person, is that kind of a person. Someone who won&#8217;t believe anyone would do something for them without a proper reason.</p><p>「Working on holidays requires an agreement between the employee and the employer, but since both employee and employer are here already, I think it&#8217;s possible to make agreement on that. Isn&#8217;t handy?」</p><p>「Well, I guess so.」</p><p>「Well? What will be your answer?」</p><p>A date between us is now decided.</p><p>Since it&#8217;s too much to explain what is about to happen, I decided to just call it that.</p>
