<h3>Chapter 32 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to Iim for the World</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am off!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Irasshai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not sure if the tofu diet had it’s effect or not, but we have made it to the sea safe and sound. Mio-san is having fun with Murasaki playing beach volleyball. Well, I am not sure if you can call a game that has it’s rallies shorter than two turns as volleyball but, Wow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Grea…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, definitely……..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s bouncing wildly. Whenever Mio-san jumps or dives, I will refrain from stating what, but it bounces around wildly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the extent of capturing one’s line of sight along with the ball when she jumps around to hit the ball. Anyways, the sunlight shining on her white skin and the contrasting black leaf-patterned pareo swimsuit she is wearing is a feast for the eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki, who is also going after the ball, is wearing a light purple shaded one-piece swimsuit that suits her small build. Her dark brown hair unlike usual is not put together with an ordinary scrunchie but is held together by a white frill which accentuates her profile. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hey, Tsuchiya, are you fine with not joining them? You are good at sports aren’t you?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well, me joining in, huh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The both us are staring at them like dumb fools sitting under the parasol.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Of course, why would you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But, I am waiting」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For what?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For the rogues」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You want to get hit on?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, his precious pre-pickup waiting scene is it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oi, Matsuuu, what nonsense are you spouting」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry, I myself just realised how weird that sounded」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Isn’t it obvious that I am waiting for Saotome-san and Murasaki to get hit on by rogues!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. I see, got it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Summer conversations between men is something that only requires this much to facilitate comprehension.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wide, free summer sea. Warm sunlight shining through. Beautiful women in swimsuits who bring upon a smile to the face.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just an imagination, but who knows, considering this situation such an incident might happen.<span id='easy-footnote-1-6093' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6093' title='ED: We take a break at this point to visit a little fantasy'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Whoa~~! Are you ladies here by yourselves~?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wh, what do you people want? Do you people have any business with Saotome-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We are the young lads who got our hearts struck by the beautiful ladies~!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will be speeeeding on my water bike now! Y’all wanna join?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm, we uh, those things……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s fine, it’s fine, don’t worry, it ain’t scary at all~! You will get addicted to it once you get on one!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wait, forcing us like…!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ababababa」</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can vividly picture Mio-san and Murasaki getting bewildered at rogues who suddenly appear and start hitting on them in force.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That kind of a thing was bound happen, wasn’t it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Of course it would happen!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And that will be our cue I guess」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it would be OUR cue」</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would walk towards those four who are arguing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san, Murasaki, is there a problem?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tch, they came together with men. They look all weak, it shouldn’t be a problem」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We were only asking them to join us on a ride on our water bike, and the ladies were also interested!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Me and Saotome-san never said anything like that….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It seems they are saying something different though」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oi oi, read the atmosphere a bit, a little bit is fine isn’t it~?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Weren’t you taught in primary school that you shouldn’t hog everything to yourself~?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…..Weren’t you people taught in kindergarten that you shouldn’t treat girls like objects?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tch, Shaddap. Just quietly take three steps back」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Don’t you know that in life it is normal to take two steps forward and then take three steps backward? Eh?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-senpai……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「D, Don’t push yourself」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s fine you two. Rather, my work here is nowhere near done」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(With a thud I grab their shoulder)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oi, you two, got a problem?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hikk」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Watanabe Ken<span id='easy-footnote-2-6093' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6093' title='TL: A famous actor. He also played Lord Katsumoto in the movie “The Last Samurai”'><sup>2</sup></a></span>?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I ASKED you if you had any problem」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ssor」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorrryyyyyyyy!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(The rogues make a run for it)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Heh, they ran away」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Seriously, those guys were the absolute worst」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Senpai is so cool~」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fantastic!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"><span id='easy-footnote-3-6093' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-6093' title='ED: And back to real li&amp;#8230; slice of life'><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……. Un, that’s how it would go, it’s obvious!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wait a minute, tell me which part of you even remotely looks like Watanbe Ken. The only common point is the fact that both of you are male homo sapiens!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Summer will work it’s charm on me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What charm, you will need enough power to coalesce the four major Hawaiian islands for that to happen」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well, without being fussy about details, on the whole that’s how it will go. It won’t be too late to join Mio-san afterwards」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving Tsuchiya who is placidly preparing for it aside, Mio-san and Murasaki are playing volleyball enthusiastically, capturing all eyes on the beach. Sweat droplets fall, gleaming like jewels, giving them a refreshing and healthy feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This time I am going to serve it, Ane-sama」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, just trust me and drive it in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realised that Mio-san had fully entered her elder sister mode, but before I knew it Murasaki had also completely entered into her little sister mode. It was the same during the UNO meet as well, I guess it is human nature to end up saying things you normally never would when the tension dies down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Summer is incredible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Serve!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Receive!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Toss!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Toss!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Rolling receive」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki fell into the sand, face first.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is reckless of an amateur to try a rolling receive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Are you alright?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am fine! That aside we have already reached four turn, we maintained the rally for four turns」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s a new record!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「With this the day we surpass the Witches of the Orient<span id='easy-footnote-4-6093' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6093' title='TL: The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvrkl#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20the%20Japanese%20women&#039;s,to%20beat%20the%20Soviet%20Union.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Japanese women’s volleyball team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; who won Olympics in 1964'><sup>4</sup></a></span> is closer」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Us sisters will have our names remembered by the Gods of Olympics and our fame will resound through eternity」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their ambition is huge. Terrifyingly huge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">By reflex I was about to utter a retort<span id='easy-footnote-5-6093' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-6093' title='TL: Tsukkomi'><sup>5</sup></a></span>. But, in the end I sat down not wanting to be uncouth and intrude upon their sisterly bonding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting next to such a person, Tsuchiya’s expression underwent a 180 degree change and is now looking pensive with a furrowed forehead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What happened, Tsuchiya? Did you eat too much shaved ice or something?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Strange. There is something strange about this」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Japan’s pickup artists are awfully fast. If they spot a beautiful girl then within five minutes their brain compiles a plan to make a move on her」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hmm, I think that’s rude towards all the pickup artists out there」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s told that they start choosing their opening line out of 『Hey ladies, are you alone?』or 『Are you the type to put green onions in your natto?』within a minute of spotting a beautiful woman」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oi」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even with all this to think that there is no voice other than “Say Cheese” being heard around us… strange, something is definitely strange. There is no mistake that something has happened」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What tha hell are you saying?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unconsciously started using dialect, but it is true that something is strange here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter which angle you look at it from Mio-san is a beauty with a great figure, Murasaki as well, though she looks very young she has a very cute face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When these two are playing around by themselves in the middle summer there is bound to be a voice, two, ten or twenty by this time. Why is it there there hasn’t been a single voice even now?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……Hmmm?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are things in this world that you notice only after by being suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s it Matsu?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well, I was just thinking about the nature of the surrounding gazes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san and Murasaki are certainly gathering a lot of eyes on them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But these are not the predatory gazes that they direct towards other women in swimsuits. These feel much less like glaring and rather warm and pleasant.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This ball that was connected with my little sister, as an elder sister I will definitely make sure to return it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Face down into the sand!? Uh, Ane-sama do you have wet wipes with you?」</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…… So that’s how it is」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What, did you figure something out using your deduction skills?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hmm, it’s a straightforward conjecture」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This, they must think that they are siblings who came along with their family」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ahhh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hitting on siblings when their parents are somewhere closeby. In other words, it will be a breach of etiquette and a suicidal move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sibling setting that came out as a result of the summer atmosphere and Mio-san’s desires has unexpectedly ended up protecting them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…… Should we just go and join them」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly speaking I also wanted to try saving the girls from getting hit on. Well this is also fine, they won’t get an unnecessary scary experience this way.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We ended up playing volleyball by the four of us till our stamina ran out at noon.</span></p>
