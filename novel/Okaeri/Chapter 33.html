<h3>Chapter 33 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to Share Content</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This time you guys were almost on the verge of losing your jobs because of the deal with the big company right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, you must be talking about that matter where the president bragged excessively and pulled out later on.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beachside clubhouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This sort of establishment, also called beachside teahouse, dots Japan’s seashores<span id='easy-footnote-1-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6103' title='TL: Something like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oganavi.com/photo/gourmet/191.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span>, and we were finally able to grab a few seats in one of them. Unable to fend off the onset of tiredness, we leaned against the thin table while waiting for our lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most&#8230; actually the only lively fellow, Tsuchiya, has gone to get drinks. Meanwhile I am inquiring about the company’s situation from Murasaki. Mio-san is…. Well, she is completely spent and is lying head down on the table. The excitement from wanting to win the gold medal as sisters has long since died out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It seems that the authorities were suspicious of the big company pressuring us and started an audit. A premises search investigation.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For real? The Subcontract Act huh.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors. In simple terms it’s a law that prevents powerful companies from strong arming or power harassing smaller companies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at it from the perspective of the big company, it’s an extremely absurd claim. How could they foresee that an experienced veteran executive would, wanting to impress a beautiful young lady (Mio-san), overstate the company’s capacity by over 50 times.<span id='easy-footnote-2-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6103' title=' ED: Has a point, but it’s the minions that suffer from such “mistakes” so this act is welcome addition'><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And as you would expect, after the investigation they understood that it was the fault of our president and then&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Rather than “understood”, I think “exposed” would be a better fit.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, welcome back. Sorry for making you run around, Tsuchiya.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There you go, an ice coffee for Saotome-san, next is cola, and after that iced tea for Murasaki.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Thanks.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a stoic face, Murasaki drank the entire iced tea in a single gulp. Slurping on the drink, she tilted her head to find that it had more ice cubes than she had expected, prompting her to shoot a hateful look at the cup.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, your throat was parched to that extent eh…. And then what happened after all that?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The president’s head got Anpanman’ed<span id='easy-footnote-3-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-6103' title='TL: In Japanese getting fired is also expressed as “head flying off”. Now Anpanman(literally red bean bun man) is a kids cartoon character similar to Popeye, only that this fellow is strong from the start and loses his powers if he gets wet. When that happens a comrade of his jumps to the rescue, baking a new head for our Anpanman which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LRCFs_6rDPE?list=PLO1nTYmK2W-FPIv1uD6QO6B8bub9BJ2pJ&amp;amp;t=1126&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;comes flying to get swapped out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. It’s quite popular in japan and almost everyone knows him'><sup>3</sup></a></span>.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wow, then you mean to say that the company actually ended up becoming better.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For now the former president’s wife is filling in, but soon I think a new person will be appointed by the officials.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What?! To think he got fired even before a successor was appointed&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It turned out to be a much bigger case than expected. I am talking as if it is someone else’s problem, but had I still been working there I would have been right in the middle of the storm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, had I not been headhunted by Mio-san none of this would have happened in the first place, so I guess it’s a meaningless hypothesis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Still, all of that is something that only concerns the higher ups. The real issue starts from there.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Issue?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Authorities are people who pay attention to things at the country level right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, they are.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「They said that we would have to graduate from being a black company or risk going under. And you know what, they first took up the annual leave policy and…There!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oh yeah!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san whose body was unable to keep up with the newfound youthfulness of her heart slowly raised her head up from the table affected by the chillness of the ice coffee.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san! Listen to this!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The summer holidays…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Were increased, THREE TIMES OVER!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Three times?! Wow? Isn’t that great, are you planning a vacation somewhere?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is amazed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you are wrong Mio-san. You have got the “base” wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes! One day has now become three whole days of holidays!!」<span id='easy-footnote-4-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6103' title=' ED: well, at least the base wasn’t zero… '><sup>4</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Clubbing it together with Saturday, we get a five day holiday! F-i-v-e・d-a-y-・v-a-c-a-t-i-o-n !!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is th, that so. I am glad.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san, their fight has just started.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Mio-san is right now here on the compensatory holiday that she got for working on Saturday. I too am here on this 4-day compensatory holiday as I matched my work schedule with Mio-san’s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The summer holiday is a 5 day consecutive holiday that we get around the O-bon festival during August. It’s redeeming feature is that it’s a paid vacation, which amounts to 10 days if we include the weekends.<span id='easy-footnote-5-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-6103' title='TL: Not sure if it’s a typo and is supposed to be 9 days, but going to leave it at 10 as it was 10 in the raws'><sup>5</sup></a></span> Ten consecutive days of holiday. It was difficult for me as well to wrap my head around it when I first heard about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is only natural that she wouldn’t be able to understand the emotions of people working in a black company. But, if they have changed this much in the first year then it means the company is also serious about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s clear that it will keep improving from now on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Moreover. Since little baldy was chummy with the previous president and did as he pleased he has now gone straight to the gallows<span id='easy-footnote-6-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-6103' title='TL: Literally “pray by the window” used to refer to employees who have been put in the cold storage and is kept in employment only because they are reluctant to fire them. But they may pressure them to resign'><sup>6</sup></a></span>. With this he should now become a little more meek.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So, it had such an effect as well…… Little baldy?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We have updated the nickname. Section chief bald cuckoo <span id='easy-footnote-7-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-6103' title='TL: Our sweet baldy Hayakawa'><sup>7</sup></a></span> has now been changed to section chief little baldy.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….Ah baldy in a tough spot and hence little baldy huh<span id='easy-footnote-8-6103' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-6103' title='TL: Doesn’t translate well into english the nickname as well, so I modified it, but in japanese it is something like a portmanteau'><sup>8</sup></a></span>. I finally got it.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since he is no longer able to pass on his work to others the Cuckoo has now been put in a tough spot. I wonder who comes up with these nicknames every time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「All of this is happened thanks to Saotome-san!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, not really. Hindsight is 20/20….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even if that might be true, it is a fact that the company has become a better place because of Saotome-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is that…. I see….. that’s how it was.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I thought even though she said that the situation has been resolved, it looks like it was still a thorn on Mio-san’s side. It is evident because she let out a sigh of relief after seeing that the situation developed favourably afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry to keep you waiting! Here’s your order, one mega size omusoba and four corndogs.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right when the atmosphere was becoming solemn, we heard a voice from behind. A waitress wearing a swimsuit came to deliver us our order.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Huh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eeh…….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tsuchiya? Murasaki? What happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wait, I will have look from the side.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood why Murasaki and Tsuchiya are frozen stiff after staring at the plate on top of the table by pushing me aside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I ordered a mega size as it would be cheaper to share, but……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is it supposed to be like this…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smoky smell of the sauce is drifting about. The omelette is half-cooked and is a delectable yellow. There is no mistaking that it is a delicious omusoba which whet’s your appetite. There is no mistake, it’s just that…..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Big.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s too big.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that it is common in such beachside clubhouses to get disappointed comparing the actual dish with the picture in the menu. Then why in the world is the quantity much larger compared to the picture.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amongst all of us who were lost in thought, surprisingly it was Murasaki who first came to her senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For now, let’s start digging in before it gets cold!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, that’s right! Mio-san, omusoba is also one of your favourites right.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ye, yes.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serving it in a bowl and placing it in front of Mio-san elicited a stare from her with upturned eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It looks extremely delicious but…… how many?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How many.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a strange question when somebody asks this on your trip to the restaurant. But me and Mio-san share a mutual understanding. Basing my calculations on the numbers that I have managed to memorise in the past two days I got a rough estimate. Looking up I raised my thumb.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Taking into consideration the exercise this morning, you are safe by a good margin!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say it’s the calorie count.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I, itadakimasu!!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a smile on her face wide enough to reach the ears Mio-san used the disposable chopsticks and started eating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yummy, it’s delicious.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There is still a lot left so please properly chew your food. We also have a corn dog each.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ok!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, the count was higher by a small margin, but I just can’t ruin such a happy moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After returning to Tokyo I should stock up on tofu.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Come to the sea and in the end watch a movie?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am fine with it, if you stay too long on the beach you might get sunburns.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I wanted to take a rest after the meal and it’s the perfect timing. ….. It would be good to take a rest.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After lunch, we decided that we lacked the stamina to continue any further on the beach and returned to the inn.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s this: 『Your Pancreas: Should I eat it from the top or from the sides』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s that, a horror movie?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cover shows a man on his vacation wearing a surgical gown and standing in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I borrowed from one of my clients. He is a movie buff and lent me a hidden masterpiece before as well.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A hidden masterpiece. Certainly 『A Ghost’s Bon curry』 qualifies as a masterpiece for having made us scream to that extent. As a horror movie that is.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think Mio-san brought this movie on purpose wanting to have as many people as possible to watch the movie with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I like movies too. I enjoy watching them.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Murasaki’s excited face, as her senpai my heart aches for her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Alright! I am playing it.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And 90 minutes later&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uek, wah….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wahhhhhhhh….!!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsuchiya is also crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Weeeee….!!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki is also crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eb, eben after all the showy and pretentious foreshadowing….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I too am crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were caught off-guard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely unaware.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Such a brilliant medical drama, why is it not popular…?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Your Pancreas: Should I eat it from the bottom or from the sides』turned out to be a medical drama and not a horror movie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s the story about an outcast surgeon who refers to “cutting open the patient&#8217;s body” as “eating”. His lover contracts a pancreatic disease and he goes on to operate on her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I insert the scalpel from the bottom or from the side. It is impossible to not be moved to tears while seeing the protagonist agonising and despairing by himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The cover depicted his loneliness where he wasn’t even able to make people understand about the difficulty of the surgery……… Such a tragic prodigy….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But still, miracles do happen don’t they….!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s not some miracle Murasaki, it was his unrelenting efforts and indomitable will that made it possible!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Who cares about the reason, all that matters is that she was saved!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We unexpectedly shed a lot of water, but it was fun.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this it looks like the plan for the evening will also proceed without any trouble.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Guh, what do we do now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「For dinner I have made reservations for barbeque with the inn. It starts from 5pm. And after that, once it gets dark…. Oi, Tsuchiya, you have bought it right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup, naturally.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is the place fine as well? Nowadays quite a few places on the coast are prohibited….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki is making a worried face. This is no oversight there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have specifically booked an inn which has enough space secured for such things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s fireworks time after dinner.」</span></p>
