<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; Won’t Let Her Meet Saotome-san</h3>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to meet you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While I was struggling to figure out what she meant, Watase Mikako divulged information that couldn’t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said『Aa-chan is still with me, at my house』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With endless doubts, eating me out, I got down at the train station near the designated meeting place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting place is the residential district in Yokohoma city, Kanagawa prefecture. It’s near her parent’s house and it is likely that it is Mio-san’s hometown as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, a woman looking similar to the girl in the picture came. After that, inside the bus heading towards her home, Watase Mikako started talking about Mio-san’s past without me asking anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In the first place Mio was a clumsy kid. Apart from me, there wasn’t anyone else she got along with」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding the grab handle tightly, Watase Mikako broached the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Since she was like that, it seems like she was also bullied a lot. Missing things or finding them broken or sullied was an everyday occurrence. In school as well as the abacus class that she used to go to」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the things she is rapidly summarising coincide with the diary entries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And amidst all that you were the only person who was different?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, upto midway that is」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is making a face that looks like she has swallowed a bug.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was threatened that I would also become a target if I kept sticking with Mio. Indirectly that is」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「So what did you do?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was helpless. I wasn’t particularly strong in character as well, I couldn’t save her and there was also a limit as to how much I could protect her. I tried resisting as much as possible but there was no use fighting」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting down the bus, we walk through the residential area. The very normal red-roofed house that is visible at the end of the street seems to be her parent’s house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And then?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In order to clearly break off ties, I stole and hid her plush toy. I mean, we were already in our fourth year, it was high time to move on from plush toys and I thought she would also get it」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then 『Aa-chan』 is?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s the name of that plush toy, it’s not a human」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watase Mikako, who gradually started speaking faster, headed towards the garden as soon as we reached the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when I thought it might possibly be inside the room. Looks like it is in the outdoor storage room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It should be in here… let’s see, that one?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I understand the circumstances which led you to snatch Mio-san’s plush toy. But why would you keep it with you all this time?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wanted to apologise, I might have been forced by the circumstances but I still hurt her after all」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Even though she was crying at that time, I believed she would have definitely understood later on. ….. I wonder where it went」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got an odd feeling looking at Watase Mikako rummaging through the storage room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regretting the bad things you did to your friend long back, wanting to apologise for it and holding on to the thing you stole.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something doesn’t add up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, found it!Ahh…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the object she retrieved I understood why I was feeling that something was amiss.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「….. This is 『Aa-chan』?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It seems like water leaked in… and it isn’t like it’s something that is going to be used after all this while…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks completely different.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filthy and torn apart, even the mechanism inside is visible. It’s in such a condition that even after being told that it is a plush toy, you will barely be able to recognise it as one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking it on my hands I could feel the dampness. It should be one that talks on a battery, but judging from the looks, the circuit should have also been submerged and should be unsalvageable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Would it be possible for me to take custody of it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Sure, please take it along with you. I have always felt like I would be able to get my feelings across when I return it. Phew! I feel relieved」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a bright face, Watase Mikako pushed “That” towards me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put Aa-chan who looked like it would collapse at any moment, into the paper bag that I brought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this my work here is done. I have learnt about all that I wanted to know.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should be returning back immediately, but my legs won’t move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…… the only one who is feeling relieved?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realise that it might not be my place to be saying something like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I can’t just leave without telling anything to this lady in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「At the back of your mind you carried on with the guilt and regret from having betrayed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san and just when you started forgetting about it I called you up. You took this opportunity to discreetly push it onto me, getting rid of the burden. I am right, amn’t I?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is all this, suddenly?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s nothing, it just struck me that you wouldn’t have said such things if you had imagined the pain and bitterness that Mio-san might have through after being betrayed by you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Where is Aa-chan. Mika-chan why?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mio-san, this clump of slightly dirty cloth, cotton and circuits denotes being seperated from something dear and at the same time also embodies the betrayal of a close friend. A trauma haunted her when she was feeling lonely and depressed, delirious due to fever and even in her dreams.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s a person who just superficially felt guilt and showed a bright face, returning it after all this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have yet to become an adult able to flash a fake smile at such a person and move on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Y, you don’t have any right to be saying such things」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, that’s right」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You said that you were her employee right? Are you a private detective or something? If you want to do a background check on me by using Mio as a pretext then I am sorry to disappoint you but I don’t have anything to feel guilty about」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, I am just an employee who has a direct employment contract with Mio-san. Do you want me to show you proof」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am glad that I brought my identification documents along just in case. Watase Mikako stopped from taking my documents out. She then laughed out fearlessly making an understanding face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ok, I got it. You are Mio’s boyfriend right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Boyfriend?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You heard about the past and wanted to do something sweet right? Ah, it must be nice having such deep affection」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigh, this person really.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san became unable to trust people after deciding to trust them once. But this, I think from the outset she wasn’t able to trust people, might very well be the same with Mio-san’s instance as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If you ask me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you actually ask Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I believe a person who without any type of contract whatsoever just keeps saying “I like you” doesn’t have any right to be saying such things」<span id='easy-footnote-1-6045' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6045' title='TL: Looks like he too has started speaking in terms of a contract just like Mio-san'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh…. Then do you mean to say you have such a right? According to which contract?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I didn’t come here because I thought I had a right. I came here because I believe I have a duty to do so」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Duty…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You know what Watase-san, I am getting paid a hefty amount just to smile and say </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tadaima</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">』to Mio-san when she gets back home」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got the plush toy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have also finished saying whatever I wanted to say. There is no more point in staying here now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「By the way, Mio-san won’t be attending the alumni meet. It’s fine if I give it to you directly as well right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pushing the 『Absence』 form from the alumni meet invitation into the hands of Watase Mikako who wanted to say something to me, I left the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My chest still feels stifled with an emotion that cannot exactly be classified as anger or frustration. It can’t be helped, I still have a lot of things left to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, then…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually I had anticipated that it would be in a bad condition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have also thought of a plan in case the situation gets difficult to hand it over to Mio-san directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Of course, I didn’t think the condition would be this bad, but it doesn’t affect what I have to do now.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s 12:30 p.m. now, during regular business hours, this should be the lunch slot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took my phone out, went to the call history and tapped on the name that I have become used to seeing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ywes, Fwat?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I get it, you are eating. Sorry Tsuchiya」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Nah, I am working while eating』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Working?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the other day, this guy went all punk and said “Hence on the contrary, there is nothing that can be done.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You guys starting working?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yup. The coordinator did a great job it seems, so the work started progressing step by step. To salvage the situation from such a bad position, it must be true that she is highly competent』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinator. The marketer who is acting as the mediator between Tsuchiya’s company and the client.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that he is talking about Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I see&#8230; That’s great」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I frankly put across my feelings to both Tsuchiya as well as Mio-san, who is currently somewhere in Tokyo.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Getting a call from you, now isn’t this rare. So, what&#8217;s the matter? You need help with something?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s fine, if you are busy I will somehow get it done by myself」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That, there, is what makes people worry about you. Just tell me』<span id='easy-footnote-2-6045' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6045' title='ED: He’s got a point there.'><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then, I will be taking you up on your offer. You told me about it before remember? When you got your phone run over by a tofu truck and got it serviced by a godly serviceman」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, it even fell into the puddle on top of it, he still managed to restore it back to an almost perfect state. That serviceman is seriously so diligent』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tell me where it is. I have to extract data from 20 years back for Mio-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hoho, Saotome-san’s?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And if Murasaki is nearby pass the phone to her」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ok wait a moment. And hey tell me about the situation in detail, I don’t want to be left out of the loop. Oi, Murasaki, come here for a moment!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…. I knew you would say that. I am sorry but I am a little tight on time. Once Murasaki comes, I will start scheduling」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few days passed by quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day by day Mio-san is returning home later and later. She is even working on Saturday aiming to do a perfect job. I, too, have been keeping in touch with Murasaki and Tsuchiya over the phone and getting ahead with the plan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, next week arrived and it was Monday. The appointment date, 9 p.m. in the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saotome Mio’s elevator opened its door on the 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> floor of the apartment.</span></p>
