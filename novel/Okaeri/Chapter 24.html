<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants to Work</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Keeping a cover containing business documents amidst picture books…… Mio-san, who did you want to show off to?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally uttered a retort at my landlord/employer who is not present here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Work wholeheartedly to earn the trust of both managers and employees 』below the gleaming cover containing the documents, you can see a fancy binding with 『Wolf Rin-chan’s adventures』written on the front cover.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But still, I guess it’s a given to get a clear picture of the contents inside with just this」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The existence called bookshelf is something that slowly becomes disorganized with time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has already been three weeks since this empty bookshelf from my first arrival has been filled with books. As usual I started worrying about the disorganised bookshelf and decided to arrange it in some order. It has been fifteen minutes since then.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This is a picture book. This one is also a picture book. “Illustrated Encyclopedia of Animals” it should be fine to not hide this…&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, why am I arranging the books all by myself deep in the night?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer is quite simple. It’s because Mio-san hasn’t returned home yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That aside, Mio-san is late today. How rare!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She did contact me saying that she was unsure of when she will be able to come home. But I never expected her to not be back even after 10 p.m. It is a bit worrying as she is a person who comes back on time right at 6 p.m. most of the days and even if she is stuck with work, she returns by 7 p.m.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dinner has been left untouched on top of the table. Hamburgers might be too heavy to eat this late.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even yesterday she had to watch that movie recommended by her client. She seems to be busy with a lot of things going on. Something light on the stomach…. Let’s make some kure soup」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kure soup is written as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">呉汁』</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">in kanji.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a local dish made by adding mashed soybeans and green soybeans to miso soup. It is a nutritious meal that has made frequent appearances in the masterpiece gourmet manga 『Cooking Papa』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I heard it was a local cuisine, I thought that I must definitely be from Fukuoka. Only when I searched around did I find out that a similar dish exists in every single place in the country. To ask if a local dish that is local to every place in the country is still local is a hopeless endeavour.<span id='easy-footnote-1-5981' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5981' title=' ED: It’s so local, it’s global '><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Once I put this in place then I can take the beans to…. Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking the last book should also be a picture book or an illustrated encyclopedia of sorts, I took it in my hand, and I realised it had a different feel. As usual they are business documents, but beneath the cover I found plain memo sheets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is this a diary?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the words they seem to be from a long time back, probably from when she was a kid.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the last cardboard we opened contained her diaries and yearbooks. Those didn’t have a deceptive front cover and were kept aside, on a different shelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why does this one alone get a special treatment? No, no, going ahead to read it without permission would be bad. Let’s just return to its place…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Today my abacus died』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to close, this particular sentence flashed before my eyes and weighed on my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember about the abacus.It was back when Mio-san was down with fever. After drinking Tamagozake she started talking about an abacus when I took the natto that she kept stirring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Return my abacus to me』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Was that something from her childhood memories…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that it is wrong to be doing this, I turn over the pages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『My indoor shoes passed away』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『My keychain went somewhere』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">An entry like this is written every two days.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, there was this one entry written on an autumn day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Where is Aa-chan? Mika-chan why did you do this?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aa-chan is surely that……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s the name of Mio-san’s treasured talking plush toy. She said that it resembled Fuu-chan a little.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then Mika-chan here is a human friend….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ding dong”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the intercom sound I almost jumped out. Humans are creatures that act like in a manga when they are jolted out of their reverie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I totally forgot that Mio-san will be returning home. Hurriedly putting away the diary, I move towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a pattern that I am familiar with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am opening it now, okay~」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open the lock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door won’t be opened immediately. Wait there patiently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about 20 seconds have passed, the door is slowly pushed open and Mio-san with a somewhat strong eye makeup peeks through the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ta, Tadaima?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Okaerinasai. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Today seems to have been tough」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, Matsutomo-san is here…. Since there wasn’t any reply I was worried…. Whether you were here…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am sorry for being late. But I was exactly here all the while」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it’s my job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Th, That’s right. It’s because it is your job isn’t it. Yes, yes you must to do your job perfectly」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup, that’s why I will be here tomorrow, the day after and after that too. Until the day that you stop paying me wages!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Waah, what a splendid adult!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is the type of person who quickly becomes anxious thinking that I ran away as I didn’t like the job, since there was no reply for a little while.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wondering if I wasn’t trusted, but I learnt how that’s how she is after working hours so I try to coordinate as best as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san did you have dinner?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, not yet. I am sorry that it has become so late…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Not at all. I thought of having hamburger for dinner, but it has become so late. Should I make something light for you?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a look at the clock it is already 10:15 p.m. We have broken into the period where it is sinful to consume greasy foods.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Light food?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Kure soup can be prepared immediately!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Kure soup」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s the one where you add mashed soybeans to Miso soup」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You add the mashed beans right after tofu and fried tofu…..!?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Moreover today’s Miso soup is the dried tofu variety」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dried tofu, the white layer that you get when making tofu.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes without saying that the main ingredient is soybean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Soybean “with” Soybean “with” Soybean.<span id='easy-footnote-2-5981' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5981' title='TL: The with here was written in English in the raws as well hence the quote'><sup>2</sup></a></span> To think such a combination existed」<span id='easy-footnote-3-5981' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5981' title='TL: To the folks who don’t know. Miso soup is made using soybean, dried tofu is again from soybean, and this kure soup adds mashed soybean on top of it'><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So, which one do you want to have?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Both!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hamburger and Kure soup.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wouldn’t that become protein overload?!! Thank god that the hamburger was not a tofu-burger but made of cow and pig meat. Still… as expected. Well I guess I have to reduce the volume of the serving.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then, I will start making the preparations. Please come back after changing your clothes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Okay—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when I thought that she was going to go with the 『Let me help』pattern.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think today she is barely holding herself together as she is still tired from work and has yet to let loose. Hmm, is it around a middle-schooler’s level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Nah, a 28 year old, who is holding her act together by behaving like a middle schooler. It can’t be」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sending off Mio-san who vanished into the bedroom, I played the straight man <span id='easy-footnote-4-5981' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5981' title='TL: Tsukkomi in the popular tsukkomi-boke duo of japanese comedy'><sup>4</sup></a></span> to my own thoughts and went to the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was Mio-san so busy?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came to know of the reason after a call from Tsuchiya.</span></p>
