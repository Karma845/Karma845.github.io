There is also a popular phrase that goes “don’t underestimate Ibaraki” which is the same that Murasaki has used here. The Showa era is particularly mentioned here, I think it’s because Yankees back then have an image of being much fiercer.

I am going, Mio-san.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eh? Ah, aba, yes?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One, Two—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「「「「It’s the sea~~!!!」」」」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the bright sun of July, the shout of joy from the men and women who are entering their mid twenties pierced through the clear skies of Kujukuri Beach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tracing back to the beginning of the story, we go back to early July.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah!

When you switch off the lights, stars become visible on their own, don’t they.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s been four day since that incident involving Tsuchiya and the rest. It’s Friday today.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san and I are holding a small Tanabata festival by ourselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thin strip of origami paper that we hung by the window on the broadleaf bamboo which we brought from the park is fluttering in the wind. We are eating cold soumen while listening to the paper that has『World Peace』written on it scrape against the bamboo.<span id='easy-footnote-4-6079' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6079' title='TL: Something like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media-01.creema.net/user/1937945/exhibits/9703833/8_3c0f20d077ed519fb9c320f619c927f4_500.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></span></span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">is a Japanese summer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s really strange isn’t it, every year you get tired of it but somehow end up wanting to eat it again later.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Once summer comes, one way or another you end up feeling a sense of obligation, something like『Aah, if I don’t eat soumen….』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It must surely be an expansion pack that was installed in DNA of Japanese people.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily today is this year’s first day for Soumen. We can enjoy eating it with all our heart when the weariness meter is at zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to enjoy the taste of the noodle in itself, the condiments have been kept at a minimum only adding onion, ginger, seaweed and natto.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a little upsetting that Mio-san is making a face that says “Is Matsutomo-san exhausted to the point of doing this…..” while staring at the natto that was spread over the soumen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hey, does it really taste good after adding natto?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, I am telling the truth」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「How delicious is it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Delicious enough to see the Milky Way」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Milky Way」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, right up there in the polluted sky of Tokyo I am able to see a Milky Way made of natto and wheat flour」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to bring herself to completely believe me, Mio-san dubiously follows after me and puts some natto in the soumen soup. Slightly stirring the soup and dipping the soumen in it, a few beads of natto gets stuck to soumen when it is lifted up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「With brown beads stuck on it’s sides it somewhat looks like an abacus」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, yes, it certainly does」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike when a person affected by fever or alcohol wanted to save the company using the calculation ability of natto, this is different. I think for Mio-san natto and abacus are two things that are very close to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaffected by my inner thoughts that are troubled with the memories from back then, memories which refuse to fade away, Mio-san takes the soumen with natto to her mouth and starts eating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly stopped in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…… There is a swan flying」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have recommend this way of eating soumen to lots of people before, but this is the first time someone could see The Swan<span id='easy-footnote-5-6079' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-6079' title='TL:Constellation Cygnus also called The Swan'><sup>5</sup></a></span> flying out in the Milky Way」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s delicious, it’s really delicious Matsutomo-san!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Isn’t it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have never thought of trying it out, such a thing…..!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If you think about it logically, the soup base and the natto are made up from almost the same things in the first place. It would be weird if the taste didn’t suit」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to do this, I specifically bought and used dried bonito flakes and smoked mackerel for the soup base.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natto’s flavour comes from the glutamic acid present in it. When the inosinic acid present in the dried bonito and smoked mackerel combines with it, the flavour becomes many times better because of the synergy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aside from this you can add sesame oil, miso soup, and such to the soup base and enjoy soumen in various different ways」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ohhhhh….!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Furthermore, there is also Soumen Chanpuru with garnish that can be made Okinawa style, Sichuan style or Guandong style. There is a different food item called rice noodle which goes really well with rice」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Whoaaaa…..!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that I underestimated the number of midyear gifts and therefore, the amount of soumen that a talented marketer receives is something that I only got to know later on, well anyways, that’s a story for some other time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. hm?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While eating I realised that I had unread messages in my SNS. It’s about 35 minutes back, looks like a text that was sent when the call wasn’t getting through.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s Tsuchiya, a message saying that the programme for summer holidays has been determined」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsuchiya’s company has entered a sudden busy season since June because of the deal, a problem caused by excessive bragging.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And hence, not all employees can take leave at once. They are supposed to alternate their holidays between July and August.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「When is it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The last week of July, Murasaki also seems to be under the same bracket」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, I see」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And then Mio-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san slightly tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The holidays being decided is just the beginning. The real problem starts from here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tsuchiya wanted to go the sea, the four of us」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sea…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, sea」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sea, huh…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fundamentally, Mio-san is from the indoor faction. If there is something that she has to buy, like before, she wouldn’t mind going out but otherwise she doesn’t like to go out into crowded areas on her days off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, if you need to go out, you wouldn’t just move from the chair thinking it will be a lot of fun. This is the destiny of the indoor faction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It would be fun to go. Yes, yes it will definitely be fun」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Don’t you dislike the sea?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s not exactly like that…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If you prefer a mountain or some other place I can tell them so. Tsuchiya and Murasaki also would definitely want you to have fun」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, I have been asking for many favours from Tsuchiya.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking him to go shopping when she was having a fever, calling him up late at night and making him play UNO until morning and with Aa-chan he managed to get the original voice restored, a commendable achievement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, favours that can’t be half heartedly repaid has piled up quite a bit without being resolved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover Murasaki, another benefactor who helped out with Aa-chan, is also looking forward to it. With this, it’s checkmate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I would like to hear her wish and help her out, if I cater to one side then I come up short on the other side……</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is what I was thinking, but it seems like Mio-san’s worries were not regarding that part.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh, I like the sea. I would love to go to the sea with Tsuchiya-san and Murasaki-san as well you know. It’s just that…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You have something that troubles you?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You know, I just had tofu and salad for my dinner right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a feeling that she had mentioned this when we met for the first time as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So, you see, it’s fine if the thing called carbohydrates is not there. But, isn’t it also wired in Japanese’s DNA that if carbohydrates are present then you have to eat as much as want?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「In other words?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san’s dinner is delicious and I…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have made you talk about something painful for you, sorry」<span id='easy-footnote-6-6079' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-6079' title='TL: Basically he made her talk about her weight and diet and etc. etc. '><sup>6</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s not have soumen after today」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「There is good news. Tomorrow is the day when tofu is on sale」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Don’t leave a single one standing. That’s an order」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Roger」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, around two weeks ago, the swimming trip at the end of July was decided.</span></p>
