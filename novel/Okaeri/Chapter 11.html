<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Want to Make Saotome-san Take a Break</h3>

<p>「No more, let’s return home&#8230;..」</p><p>「Mio-san, this is your home, you know. Hey! Please split apart the natto」</p><p>「That’s a lie, this pwace is office….. 。Abacus, give my abacus back to me」</p><p>「Do leading companies give out abaci…?」</p><p>Why in the world did it end up [becoming] like this.</p><p>In front of Mio-san who is continuously stirring the natto with hollow eyes, I have no choice but to look up to the heavens for guidance.</p><p>It was a night after an afternoon drizzle.</p><p>‍「<em>Tada, ima~…</em>..?」</p><p>「<em>Okaerinasai</em>」</p><p>「<em>T, tadaima!</em>」</p><p>「<em>Hai, Okaerinasai.</em> I am working today as well, you know.」</p><p>「That’s great…. I ran back wondering if you would not be here.」</p><p>Mio-san who was peeping through the door, stepped in with a sigh of relief after seeing me. It has already been three weeks since we started having this exchange.</p><p>I thought she will start to grow tired of this banter, but surprisingly she has taken a liking to it.</p><p>「Yes, yes, since this is my job. Ah! You are sweating a lot. Why don’t you take a shower first?」</p>


<p>「Will do sooo….」</p><p>Mio-san came up the porch, replying sluggishly.</p><p>Remove the shoes too.</p><p>「Erm, Mio-san」</p><p>「<em>Muee?</em>」</p><p>Turning back to look at me, Mio-san lost her balance and slipped over.</p><p>「Careful!」</p><p>Flustered, I rushed in and caught her. Though Mio-san has a small build, she is quite heavy.</p><p>「Strooong. Young man!」</p><p>「This isn’t the time to be saying such things now! What’s the matter?」</p><p>I try to support Mio-san who keeps swaying back and forth. Just when I was thinking if she hit the floor hard, her head tilted forward in a strange manner.</p><p>「<em>Aree, </em>can’t stand up?」</p><p>「Don’t tell me…」</p><p>I put my hands on Mio-san’s forehead.</p><p>Scorching.</p><p>「Isn’t the temperature too high!! Why would you run when you are already like this.」</p><p>Her body temperature has already surpassed 38ºC. But when her body is in such a condition, instead of getting worried, Mio-san is cackling foolishly.</p><p>「Nothing of that sort. I am doing fine, fine I say.」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5708' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5708' title=' &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genkii, Genkii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>Seems like she is trying to do an “All Good” pose. Nevertheless, without any improvement in her condition, she looks like an octopus that is flailing around.</p><p>「Were you the type that gets a ‘high’ when you have a fever, becoming insensitive to the fatigue and pain?」</p><p>It is likely that she got wet in the afternoon drizzle and went straight back to office, sitting under the air conditioner.</p><p>Even though the day we met, she was completely fine after getting drenched by rain. In the end, catching a cold/flu is a matter of chance. When it is your turn, you will end up getting it one way or the other.</p><p>Luckily, she seems fine for now, but once the ‘high’ recedes both the pain and the fatigue will start catching up.</p><p>「About tomorrow’s work…. What the hell am I saying right now? Anyways let’s hit bed after making her change clothes.」</p><p>I rebuke myself for getting influenced by my previous company’s conduct and first held Mio-san up, helping her remove her shoes. Becoming surprised by the <em>peaky </em>design of women’s shoes, I somehow manage to put the grey high heels in the porch and lift Mio-san up.</p><p>「Princess~」</p><p>「That’s right. It&#8217;s the princess carry. You will start fumbling if you keep talking, so shhhh. Shhh」</p><p>「Shhh」</p><p>Her mental state is regressing, going back to that of a child, just like during the incident with the G. At that time at least, it was possible to assert her sanity through her actions and behavior.</p><p>「So today turned out to be this sort of a situation, huh. This is your typical troublesome situation」</p><p>The danger is only until that. It is merely a cold/flu; however, it is still a cold/flu. You can’t be careless when the fever is this high.</p><p>I enter the bedroom and carefully rest her on the bed. The simple wooden bed squeaked a little as it bore her weight.</p><p>「I won’t go so far as to say something like “Since I have seen it once, it’s all the same no matter how many times it happens”, but this is an emergency. I will make sure to listen to your complaints afterwards so, excuse me.」</p><p>I remove her jacket and skirt, then cover her body, which is just housing a blouse and underwear up, with a blanket. Without a doubt, her skirt is damp and letting out a musty smell.</p><p>「As expected, she got caught in the rain」</p><p>「<em>Ne nee, </em>Matsutomo-san? It’s not yet time to get off work, you know.」</p><p>「According to today’s fortune-telling, if Mio-san goes to sleep early today, then something good will happen」<span id='easy-footnote-2-5708' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5708' title='ED: Out of context this could be very bad.'><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>「So-Something goood?」</p><p>「Tomorrow’s dessert will be fruiche!」</p><p>「Fruiiche! Me like!」</p><p>「That’s right, it’s fruiche. So, let’s go to sleep for now.」</p><p>「Let’s sleeep!」</p><p>Of course, it’s just something that I said in the heat of the moment. Since a sick person has very little self-awareness, there is no way other than telling something or the other.</p><p>I mean, I don’t even know her birthday and zodiac sign.</p><p>Let’s just buy a fruiche for now.</p><p>「Should I drop the plan of making it myself? Hmm… should I go with <em>Cotton</em>..?」</p><p>Looking through my phone, I decided to drop the plan of making it. It’s not perfect, but there are more pressing things at hand.</p><p>Droplets of sweat shines brightly on Mio-san’s nape, who is blankly staring at the ceiling.</p><p>「There’s too much sweat. It will become troublesome if it is not wiped off.」</p><p>Even after bringing a wet hand towel from the kitchen, I find myself hesitating.</p><p>「As if this is the point to be saying such things.」</p><p>「<em>Nnn?</em>」</p><p>「<em>Hai </em>Mio-san, raise your hands(<em>banzaii</em>)」</p><p>「<em>Banzaii</em>」</p><p>After unbuttoning and taking off her blouse, below that…. Camisole? Yes if you lift up the camisole, you can see a black laced underwear completely different from the other time.</p><p>「….I see」</p><p>「What do you seee?」</p><p>「Mio-san has worked very hard today as well」</p><p>「Is that soo…?」</p><p>「Yup, That’s right」</p><p>High-heels in place of the usual low-heeled court shoes that she wears. Moreover carefully chosen underwear that even a sloppy person like me was able to take notice of.</p><p>How to put it, I can’t think of Mio-san having a boyfriend, lover or someone like that. Therefore, this can’t be dressing up for a date.</p><p>That being the case.</p><p>「You seem to have had an important work today. Work that was important enough for you to disregard drying your wet clothes.」</p><p>Even the first time we met, she was the person who said that her company would collapse without the materials inside. I tend to forget it occasionally but Mio-san is a person of such character.</p><p>「That being said, if you push yourself to hard then you will become exhausted and catch a cold/flu. It is characteristic of you to miss the final sprint up and have a poor end game.」</p><p>「It is not like that….. I will do it prowperly….」</p><p>「Yes, yes. Now, I will wipe it off one more time, so please raise you hands (<em>banzaii</em>)」</p><p>「<em>Muu</em>」</p><p>I wipe down her body which has become flushed a slight pink due to the fever.</p><p>In the process, I come to realize the fragility and thinness of her delicate body.</p><p>How many women are out there competing with experienced and capable people, fighting against the society’s system where it is very hard to find one’s bearings.</p><p>Saotome-san here is such a person.</p><p>It would be strange if she didn’t catch a cold. At least that’s what I think.</p><p>「Unexpectedly, perverted thoughts don’t creep in when you muse about such things.」</p><p>— It’s a lie.</p><p>「Mio-san’s favorite sweater is the one with the vertical stripes right?」</p><p>「Haha, nothing at all.」</p><p>I will tell it once again, it’s a lie.</p><p>Right now, I am biting my tongue with all my might. I am biting it with my front teeth, and to be precise, I am using the canine teeth and not the incisors.</p><p>It is a bit too hard so I have to do at least that.</p><p>Frankly, it is impossible.</p><p>「Hahaha, calm down, calm down.」</p><p>「<em>Aah, Huu</em>」</p><p>「Was it cold? I can’t really tell you to stop letting out such a voice, but still..」</p><p>「I mean.」</p><p>「Alright, Mio-san it’s that. Let’s do that」</p><p>「Thaat?」</p>

<p>The only thing that can erase the erotic allure that Mio-san holds.</p><p>「Abababababa」</p><p>「Abababababa?」</p><p>「Abababababaa」</p><p>「Abababababaa!」</p><p>An onee-san with flushed cheeks in her black underwear is chirping out ‘Abababababa’.</p><p>「Yeah&#8230; nope, not good. If this keeps up, I might awaken to a weird sexual preference. Let’s hurry and finish it up.」</p><p>Deep breaths. Yes, deep breaths.</p><p>When humans take deep breaths they are able to calm down. Inhale—.</p><p>「It’s not working, somehow Mio-san’s womanly scent keeps interfering. The smell of cardboard has completely disappeared.」</p><p>Dammit. Who’s the guy that cleaned this place up?</p><p>That was me.</p><p>「Our Father who art in Heaven</p><p>Hallowed be thy Name.</p><p>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,</p><p>on Earth as it is in Heaven.」</p><p>I am glad that I went to parochial school during my childhood.</p><p>I am sorry for doubting the existence of God before. I will properly repent, so please save me now.</p><p>Right around the third time reciting the Lord’s Prayer, I finished wiping the sweat off Mio-san’s body completely.</p>
