Whoosh……..Srrrpp</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Black Snakes <span id='easy-footnote-1-6110' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6110' title='TL: A type of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_snake_(firework)#:~:text=%22Black%20snake%22%20is%20a%20term,snake%20and%20the%20sugar%20snake.&amp;amp;text=Once%20lit%2C%20both%20fireworks%20emit,flares%2C%20projectiles%2C%20or%20sound.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;fireworks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span> are nice aren’t they…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「In the first place do they even qualify as fireworks?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tsuchiya senpai, it was formerly known as the “Pharaoh’s serpent” and it is a very cool firework that was invented in Europe.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oh.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the garden facing the sea there is a sign that says 『A promise from the night with fireworks』. In this place that had been setup by the inn we spread out the fireworks that we had brought with us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smoke from the mosquito coil mixes with the scent of fireworks and the lingering smell of barbeque. It’s that sort of a night where summer rides the salty sea breezes to assail your nostrils.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The sky has finally become clear, hasn’t it Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right. The stars are so bright and brilliant.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gulping down a can of juice after the barbeque, Mio-san’s eyes sparkle as she stares at the starry sky. Getting caught up, I also lifted my head to see the Milky Way that we were not able to see during the Tanabata as it was drifting through the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now then Mio-san, before Tsuchiya and Murasaki light up all the fireworks let us also go get our hands on some.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s go!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Which one do you want to light up? We have almost every kind, ranging from handheld firesticks and sparklers to Catherine wheel.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Handheld firesticks.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Your favourite colour?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「All colours.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then here you go, a multi-coloured one.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the bag, I took out the one labelled “Rainbow” and presented it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san, who was sitting on the veranda swinging her legs and waving th festival fan, borrowed from the inn, came hopping. I took out the lighter as well and helped her ignite it</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Whoaa.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s been a while for me as well. I forgot that fireworks were such bright and vivid things.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the twilight that is turning darker, Mio-san&#8217;s pupils are illuminated by the changing red, blue and green of the firestick, appearing brighter than the firework itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, it was also a similar night when we met for the first time. Everything changed from that rainy night when I called out to Mio-san who was standing alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Mio-san had not lost her keys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had been more exhausted and hesitated to ask her about it.<span id='easy-footnote-2-6110' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6110' title=' ED: It’s about the story’s beginning '><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without that, these things might have never happened. Our meeting was a whimsical fateful encounter and that has led to the four of us now being here together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Next, this one looks good!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Okay, okay.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san as well, light some up.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then, I will also choose the same one as Mio-san’s.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lined them up and lit them. White fireworks sprayed out of the stick and landed on the grass tracing a parabola through the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san likes fireworks?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Me? I like them all. Small and big alike.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Me tooooo!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Mio-san waving the firestick in circles, suddenly a thought struck me. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I am not sure as to how long I can continue with this job. The question of whether I will be able to eat and survive with this job until the end is something that nobody knows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san I don’t think that I will ever regret what I am doing now.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What you are talking about?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Enjoying life like this.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oh!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right when she should have followed up with “Me too” the firestick died out, engulfing us in darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to take out the sparklers to replace it, Murasaki and Tsuchiya who were observing the Black Snake called out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-saaan, let’s soon light up the big ones!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We confirmed with the staff!! Though the type that shoots out are prohibited, the type that sprays outward is completely fine.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Co, coming. Let’s go Mio-san.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Un.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once Tsuchiya lit up the fuse, it sizzled through and disappeared into the cylindrical tube. After a moment of silence bright pink fireworks illuminated the sky, making it look as if the number of stars in the sky had increased. Looking at the spectacle, Murasaki and Tsuchiya let out cheers of joy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yay!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, that’s right, picture. Let’s take a picture.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san as well is staring at the fireworks glittering in the sky while gripping the hem of her shirt. I wonder if it’s my imagination that those pupils have become moist.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Beautiful isn’t it, Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It&#8217;s been slightly under two months since we met. To think that so many things would happen is something we would never have imagined. Life is unpredictable.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Look! Murasaki and Tsuchiya as well, fooling around so joyously…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. Mio-san, what do you think about the current German government’s policy towards France?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yup.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied right away. I looked at the veranda that Mio-san was sitting in a while ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember drinking one can of the juice served with the barbeque but didn’t really read the label on it. In the darkness, I grabbed one and managed to make out the words written on it. It was four hiragana letters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ho○yoi.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing that I thought to have been a juice was canned shochu with a moderately sweet pleasant flavour and 3%ABV.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To find someone who gets drunk on just a single can of it is particularly rare but the fact that Mio-san’s alcohol tolerance is very low is something that became evident in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagozake </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">incident. As a matter of fact, when I turned back to look at Mio-san she was waddling towards the sea just like a newborn sea turtle hatchling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san, Matsutomo-san the sea really pretty you know.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hold it right there! It’s too dangerous to go swimming now.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mo~, I’m not going to drown.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is one more group of young people who are shouting out with excitement and lighting up much fancier and flashy fireworks. It is obvious that they come under the rumoured party lovers category.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, a 28-year-old E-cupped drunk young woman with splendid features might end up in a part of the summer beach that has the scent of an amorous adventure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That scenario has to be avoided at all costs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hey, Tsuchiya! Murasaki!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hm, What?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Did something happen to Saotome-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Seems like she got a little drunk. The fireworks are also almost used up so let’s head to the room and…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, for me I have a 『Contingency』 plan!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the trip was confirmed, I decided that there was something that was absolutely indispensable and crucial if the four of us were going to gather round and spend the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Oi, Matsuu, you can’t possibly mean…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s fine with me, I won’t pass on this opportunity for revenge.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You want to? Even though Aa-chan and the kids are not here, I won’t lose.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a slight nod to the three of them who had already guessed it. I reached out into my pocket and took out a palm-sized box hoisting it into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wanna play some UNO?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The yellow logo on the black background stands out under the pink-lit sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The summer night has just begun.</span>
