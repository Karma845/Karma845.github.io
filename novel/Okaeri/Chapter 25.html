<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Saotome-san is Late Today as Well</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「She is late today as well. That makes it one whole week of returning after 9 p.m.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That makes me worry about her health. An ironic smile escapes my mouth while thinking that it isn’t something that I, who used to take the last train everyday should be saying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shifting my glance away from the timepiece showing 9:10 p.m, I commence organising the postal items.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting your mailbox dumped with direct mails without any personal content in it is the reality of modern day Japan. I came to terms with this reality of having to sort them out in such late hours as soon as I started living alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This room is filled with mail that there is no place to rest your legs….<span id='easy-footnote-1-5984' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5984' title='Something like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmanganight.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F07%2Fdaisuke-nishijima-580x226.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmanganight.net%2F%25E8%25A5%25BF%25E5%25B3%25B6%25E5%25A4%25A7%25E4%25BB%258B%25EF%25BC%259A%25E3%2580%258C%25E3%2583%259E%25E3%2583%25B3%25E3%2582%25AC%25E3%2580%258D%25E3%2581%25AE%25E5%25B1%2595%25E7%25A4%25BA%25E3%2581%25AF%25E3%2581%25A9%25E3%2581%2593%25E3%2581%25BE%25E3%2581%25A7%25E5%258F%25AF%25E8%2583%25BD%25E3%2581%258B%2F&amp;amp;tbnid=70R3azyNfSLYgM&amp;amp;vet=12ahUKEwjb0YDPr6frAhUq8zgGHU2cAMYQMygAegQIARAX..i&amp;amp;docid=sgkGJKId-wnsOM&amp;amp;w=580&amp;amp;h=226&amp;amp;q=toddler&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb0YDPr6frAhUq8zgGHU2cAMYQMygAegQIARAX&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not sure if it’s because I was staying late in the Saotome household or something else but I started recalling the first time that I broke in through the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cardboard wall, the swamp of PET bottles with a cardboard line separating the swamp in half. Back then, that spectacle left such a strong impression on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ehhh, fire insurance, a new curry shop, real estate deal, and this is&#8230; health products manufactured using soybeans? Just have them normally, as usual. Hmmm, chiropractic, should I keep this aside…?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember Mio-san saying that she had stiff shoulders. Must definitely be due to working in front of the computer.<span id='easy-footnote-2-5984' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5984' title=' ED: Well, I was thinking about another reason, a pair of reasons to be exact, one that takes away the reason from men '><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This envelope is remote wine ordering service, next up another new curry shop and this……invitation for the alumni meet?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mixed with the advertisement for “Model House”, the hosting of a particular elementary school’s alumni meet was written on a plain envelope.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s two months later. I wonder if Mio-san is the type to attend such things…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finding it difficult to imagine Mio-san being such a person, I slid the envelope over and the name printed on the bottom of the envelope drew my attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『 Organiser: Ishijima Mikako (Maiden name: Watase Mikako)』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watase Mikako.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……. Mika-chan?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be the person mentioned in Mio-san’s diary?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Nah, no way.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am curious to inquire about it. But I drove away those thoughts as it wouldn’t be right to wilfully ask such things and put the letter inside the『To be replied box』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing to organise I almost finished digging through the mountain of letters, but there is no sign of Mio-san coming back home. While wondering what to do next, my phone that I left on the table vibrated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-sa… not her huh.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tring”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Oi, Matsu,.. Are you free now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s the matter, Tsuchiya. Returning home? Too bad for you but Mio-san isn’t here」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Whaaat? Reallly. Where can this prisoner find solace……』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…. Ah, you are still working.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding this unreasonable amount of work pressure in my previous workplace, I have a very clear understanding of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is also usually busy with her work. But it is a “busyness” that is strictly confined to the work timings namely, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is different from the “busyness” which transpires because of your manager’s inability to plan and dumping an overwhelming amount of work on you. And it goes without saying that Tsuchiya’s “busyness” implies the latter.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Mmm, rather I am free. Found a good excuse to get out of the office and take a breather. Sent Murasaki to buy stuff from the convenience store while taking a breather.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Do you have to wait on the client? Some issue came up and you can’t go home before sorting out the details with the client?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried guessing of various common situations that could occur based on my experience. They are all different from the situation that Tsuchiya is telling me now though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Matsu, do you remember what happened last year?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Last year? Which incident are you talking about?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『That incident which occured because the chief said some unnecessary stuff』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Bald cuckoo」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes, it rebounded』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see, so it rebounded」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『So you see, all because of that Bald cuckoo, we were given work that you wouldn’t be able to complete no matter what you do. No one was able to do much. There once was a day that all of us had to stay back in the office』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, that one……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes the “Black Monday”』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a dark past that I had forgotten about.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result of being displeased with the plan that the operations team came up with, he passionately said, “I will show you how it’s done” only to unleash Pandora’s Box on a verbal slip. We were given work that is ten times greater than our processing capacity, and in the end everyone just sat on their chairs with blank faces being unable to get anything done.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a brief summary of that incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember it being named “Black Monday” just before I switched jobs. It’s a mystery as to why Bald cuckoo was able to keep his position as the chief even after such an incident.<span id='easy-footnote-3-5984' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5984' title=' ED: most likely connections…'><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Did the chief do something unnecessary again?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Whom do you think it is?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hmm, so it’s not the section chief. Then is it the department head?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『B: Department head.

Well, I too forgot that though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No wait, really? The top management?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Seems like they got a big unprecedented deal in the company before and promised great things. But now the tensions have risen and it’s become difficult to withdraw.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It was 10 times over capacity with the section chief, what about the president?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『About 50 times over capacity? I am not sure, we underlings don’t understand anymore』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「….. The Super Sai*an amplification factor was also somewhat close to this level.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『It’s like asking Kril*in to defeat Fri*za.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looks like the situation is much worse. If they do a sloppy job, no, in all likelihood the company would most probably not be able to survive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can almost see the future bankruptcy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hey」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Oi, Matsu, don’t say things like an altruist protagonist』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『It’s not at the point where things will get better if you come to help out. This is not a problem we could have finished, with or without you. That much even Bald cuckoo will be able to understand. Don’t come』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, sorry. I made you say such dull things…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『If you are really sorry, then give me a call once Saotome-san reaches home』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Well, maybe」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsuchiya doesn’t really know about night mode Mio-san, but he did see a little of her true state in the Great UNO Meet that night. So I think it should probably be fine to give a call in the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『It’s a promise then.

It’s about time that Murasaki…. Oi, she seems to have bought melon bread and brought it in the bag. But I asked her to buy dinner. Is it normal to buy just melon bread for dinner?』</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s because she likes it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Hmmm, will it be possible for me to eat along with Mio-sann!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cut the call at his shriek and moved to the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I open the lock, the door immediately opens and Mio-san who is tired from all the work throughout the entire week peeks in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tadaima～….</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Okaerinasai. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">You worked really hard this week」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes….. I could hear you speaking to someone, a phone call?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, it was Tsuchiya」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, right. You two are good friends. Doing fine?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, that’s so」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What about Murasaki-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「She didn’t speak on the call but it’s still the same. It seems like both of them have trouble at work.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing about the president, even telling me, a former employee, is a big nono. It isn’t something I should talk about with Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately Mio-san was also not really interested in it and just said “is that so” and removed her pumps after entering inside. Since she is extremely tired I think it was the right choice to make something refreshing for dinner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You will be eating dinner right? Today is dried mackerel, tuna and miso soup made with fried tofu」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, thank you. I will go change my clothes」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ok, take your time」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sending off Mio-san, who went to the bedroom, I headed to the kitchen and chose a mackerel that had few bones and heated the stove.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is strange that Mio-san’s expression stiffened the moment she heard Tsuchiya’s and Murasaki’s names.</span></p>
