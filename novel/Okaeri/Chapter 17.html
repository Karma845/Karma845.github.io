<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hora, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san, hurry up, remove your hands and let me take a look」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But, it is really embarrassing……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, you can’t escape. I will definitely have you show it to me today」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I am being too forceful, but this is a path that the two of us must cross someday. I have to harden my heart and get it done today.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> don’t hide」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…………Okay」<span id='easy-footnote-2-5899' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5899' title='ED: Quite an innuendo here '><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Urged by me, Mio-san, opened up her hands which tightly held it together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Finally done!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Unpacking luggage, complete!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s already been four weeks since I started working for Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unpacking which I steadily kept working on during these four weeks has finally come to an end. The sea of cardboard boxes that covered the floor are now nowhere to be seen. The calm, peaceful afternoon sunlight is brightly shining upon the grains of the wooden flooring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wow! This house is actually really spacious! This reminds me of the house at the time of preliminary inspection before moving in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I don’t think living alone in a 2 LDK and barely having enough living space is normal」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I already cleaned up the boxes containing things like dishware, cutlery, books etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was the boxes containing Mio-san’s personal things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「She doesn’t have time during weekdays, and during holidays she doesn’t have the drive to tidy things up, if I’m not there. Look here, this box looks like it’s been left untouched after you moved in. The tape has become all sticky」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……….I can’t help it. I mean, things like old albums, diaries and stuff like that are embarrassing even if you open it up by yourself……」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s because you kept procrastinating that you are now stuck with having to let them see the daylight in my presence」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">TBU</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」<span id='easy-footnote-3-5899' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5899' title=' ED: It should mean “To Be Updated” as in ‘probably never’ '><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Mio-san said, only the box with the albums and diary was left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her that it was fine to leave it be if she doesn’t want others to open it. Mio-san didn’t want to stow it away like that as it would feel awkward. That’s what she said, but there were no signs of her opening it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inevitably it devolved into a situation where I had to pressure her into it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s because you kept hiding it with your hands until the end, putting up a futile resistance. Even though it would have been fine had you tidied it up some day when I wasn’t present」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I wa, was preparing myself to face it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「As I was saying, leaving it untouched for more than two years is just too much」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">TBU</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I managed to get her to open the box and until now we were in the midst of putting it away on bookshelves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, the unpacking which has been going on for over two years, from the time Mio-san moved in, is now complete.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But, I didn’t think that you would have brought even the graduation anthology along with your yearbook」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Somehow. I mean, it would be a hindrance to leave it at my parent’s home, in Kanagawa」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right, whenever a yearbook is mentioned, you get this urge to see it, don’t you?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……..Don’t see mine, okay?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I won’t do it. Ah, right. Speaking of memories, there was this thing」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What is it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finding something odd with what Mio-san was saying, I realised that it was because of what occurred when she was being nursed by me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Who is ”Aa-chan”」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…. How do you know about that?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even if you ask me how, it was you yourself who told me about it. I happened back when you turned the entire room upside down while saying “Aa-chan is missing” with a deadpan expression」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I guess I might have done something like that」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something that I realised after Mio-san recovered from her fever is that she only has faint and indistinct memories of whatever happens when her fever is high.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Returning home, eating egg porridge and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tamagozake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, my friend Tsuchiya buying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Okusu**metane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> for us, …. and that’s about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has no memories whatsoever of her turning the room upside down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「From what I heard, I would think it is a plush toy or something similar</span><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it is a talking plush toy that I treasured till the autumn of elementary 4th grade」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ahh! So that’s it. The type that shouts “Konnichiwa” when you press its stomach, right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, yes, that’s the one. It looks a bit like Fubuki <span id='easy-footnote-4-5899' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5899' title='TL: Must be the full name of Fuu-chan'><sup>4</sup></a></span>」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, isn’t it that you bought Fuu-chan, the white fox as it resembled Aa-chan?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Did you throw it away?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I think I lost it at some point. I don’t remember clearly as it has been so long」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I guess a lot toys that we played with as a kid end up that way…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That summer day, we weren’t able to return together from the sea, my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiba Red</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> doll from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senkousentai chibashiga saga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> <span id='easy-footnote-5-5899' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5899' title='TL: Power rangers'><sup>5</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess my hero is still protecting the waters of Ishigawa island.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as the atmosphere changed into one of nostalgia, Mio-san suddenly slapped her hands together and stood up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s already late noon now, why don’t we grab something to eat」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the watch I realise that it’s already 2:30 pm. Even though we started working early in the morning, time just passed too quickly as we were concentrating on negotiation and tidying things up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why don’t we cook something?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s already late, let’s also eat out and commemorate this. There are cafes nearby that serve lunch till 3, I will treat you there」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, no it’s fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Come on now, don’t worry, okay?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I will definitely pay 20,000 yen as your holiday work allowance」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fiiine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow in the end it reached a situation where I received a holiday work allowance and got treated to lunch. Having to negotiate it with Mio-san every time we go out, I think it might be better to decide on the company measures soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though it will become something like: 『4</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> clause “Clause governing the rules of dining in a café”』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two hours later, 5 p.m.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned home taking the elevator up the mansion when the sun had already started to set.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">……… dragging along with me night mode Mio-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It was delicious</span><span style="font-weight: 400">∼. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I like prawn fryyyy」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Twat’s wright.
