<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Saotome-san Doesn’t Know the Meaning of Retreat</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking Tennosuke from Murasaki’s lap and placing Akai-san there pronounced the start of the second round.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then….</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six hours went by</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ding-dong”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san! It’s me, Tsuchiya Haruto, I dealt with my work at a breakneck speed and rushed over at your invitation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Perfect timing Tsuchiya, I am really thankful you showed up even though you are tired because of your work」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What! Why is Matsu also here?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Now, now, I am the one that called you amn’t I. Well, stop standing there and come on in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door after answering the intercom and found my former colleague from last week standing over there. Tsuchiya was standing there with tanned skin that gave one the impression of noon. Even though it’s still late into the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I thought Saotome-san asked you to call me as she was feeling shy to do so herself」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Rest easy, it’s true that Saotome-san invited you over. Murasaki is also waiting for you inside」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Finee, if what you are saying is true, then great. By the way Matsu, your face is pale. Did something happen?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s just that the fight prolonged for a while」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Eh? A fight?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You will understand once you see it for yourself」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Wh, what happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walk over to the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Opening the living room door from the corridor, whoosh, a sweeet fragrance flows out. The lights are switched on but for some reason the room feels dark and gloomy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Entering inside you find Mio-san and Murasaki who took the oath of sisterhood, developing strategies for the next battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, that’s not it Fuu-chan. You should save this card so that you can use it if Matsutomo-san plays a three-pronged skip like before. Yuu-chan, you have gradually become great at this. NO, you shouldn’t fall asleep Koro-chan!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Akai-san, Akai-san feels good……feels good to snuggle……snuggle snuggle snuggle snuggle」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like they got a little better. It is evident in their faces too, some colour has returned to their face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, why has Tsuchiya, who just entered, become this pale?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsu, I, have heard a story similar to this before」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What’s the matter」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Amongst people from north India, there is an aborginal religion where they burn sweet smelling incense sticks which makes people hallucinate」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, if it’s that story, then I have also heard about it. The devotees get into a trance, with blank eyes not having any bearing of the situation around them and start blurting everything. Why are talking about this suddenly, is something the matter?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm, it will be great if it’s just my misunderstanding」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That so? Well, whatever, take a seat. I will pour you some milk tea」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This is the fragrance of the milk tea….!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What else did you think it was?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That side, how tha hell did this happen?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, it’s difficult. Where do I even start…. It’s something that transpired seven hours ago, no three, three hours back. I, Mio-san and Murasaki, who came to deliver my belongings only to end up becoming Mio-san’s younger sister, started the Great UNO Meet. But then…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Little sister…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">———</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Three hours before</span><span style="font-weight: 400">———</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In UNO you will be dealt seven cards. The aim of the game is to exhaust your hand before others by using the varied rules.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In such a simple game, it is unexpectedly difficult to team up against others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Reverse」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Reverse」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Reverse」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Reverse」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Skip」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Skip」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh! It’s already…..!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is it only up to here…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s a given isn’t it. It had to come to an end at some point」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『You cannot look at the cards of other players』It’s this inviolable rule that makes teaming up hard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It prohibits not only stealing a glance at your opponent’s war potential but also showing each other’s cards amongst allies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, in order to co-operate amongst two people and defeat one, you are left with roughly two big stratagems.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, Use the card that skips the opponent&#8217;s turn 『Skip』 and the card that switches the direction 『Reverse』 in order to keep the turns amongst yourselves. This effectively blocks your opponent from playing anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second, transmit your will through eye contact and match the cards that you are playing in a way that is mutually beneficial.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, a tepid game where one can play just reverse and skip doesn’t exist. The two who were using the first stratagem until now have completely exhausted their firepower.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki-san, Murasaki-san……!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san, Saotome-san……! Please accept everything…….」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5957' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5957' title='TL: The cards, all the cards'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Since Murasaki is weak at using strategy, you plan on giving your cards to Saotome-san.  Don’t even think about it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two are exchanging glances passionately. The second stratagem, in other words they are attempting thought transmission through eye contact. If they are able to pull it off, then they grasp the overwhelming advantage of playing cards that are mutually beneficial to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, the result was soon out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san, I got it! Yellow 7!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh, Draw……can’t play, even after that…….Pass…..」</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">When you don’t have a playable card, you draw a card from the draw pile. If you are able to play the card that you drew, then you can do so. (Same with both official and house rules)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You people can’t get it across at all….. Yes, yellow skip, UNO <span id='easy-footnote-2-5957' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5957' title=' TL: To those who don’t know, the player has to say UNO before playing his next to last card '><sup>2</sup></a></span>」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sa, Saotome-san!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I, it’s all right. Draw, the draw card is still there….! Please, a good one please!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you add Yuu-chan who joined in after Koro-chan was taken from my hands then right now the number of guardian deities that Mio-san is holding has increased to three.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding three plush toys as well as her card all at ones, it looks like she is already at her limit. Holding onto this much at once, don’t Mio-san’s thin arms ever get tired?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding the plush toys on her right, Mio-san extended her left hand towards the draw pile and drew a card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah!, thi, this is ….!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Don’t tell me it’s going to be a game changer!? Did the guardian deities have such an effect to them?!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Pass」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not a game changer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hmm, then Yellow 5, with that I win the game」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We lost again…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「However many times we play, We are not able to defeat Matsutomo-san at all….!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I never thought that being unable to lose intentionally would be such a big burden」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not that big of a deal to be saying things like this. Both Mio-san and I are full-fledged adults after all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At times you have to concede and lose. We do understand that in order to make a living it is important to discern the necessary things. And we also know how to participate in a give and take exchange.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But UNO is unnecessary to make a living. Therefore, there is no reason to lose intentionally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Urgh. Had winning in UNO been a requirement to be recognised as an adult, then I would have had some experience going easy on people. Why, Why is it not required for UNO to be a part of coming of age ceremonies or marriages!?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「If you ask me UNO should have been a part of business conventions then, I wouldn’t mind losing and we wouldn’t have had to fight this much…..!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We will stop once everyone has won at least once.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While playing UNO, our tacit mutual understanding somehow got caught up in this very popular Japanese trap mentality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the biggest miscalculation was Murasaki’s UNO ineptitude. With the slightest mishap or the trouble at sight it is already game over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a single change in the state of affairs, we lost track of the time and before we realised it, four hours had passed since the commencement of the Great UNO Meet.</span></p>
