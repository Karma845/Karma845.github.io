<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Saotome-san Can’t Escape</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That call came in when I was organising the mail which had taken over my room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Matsumoto, I will give you some pocket money for doing odd jobs. I will even give you 1/30</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><span id='easy-footnote-1-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6027' title=' TL: basically one day salary, considering a month as 30 days'><sup>1</sup></a></span> of your salary that you used to get, so can you help us…..』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hey, you didn’t get it in the end!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsuchiya!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as you would expect, I was aggravated thinking about the name of the former colleague and complained in my head. After all, he was the one who acted all cool and told me “That much even Bald cuckoo will be able to understand”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly burst out with elicited bewilderment at my former boss’s voice, one that I didn’t hear for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Didn’t get it? What are you talking about it?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「No, it&#8217;s something that happened over here. Please don’t mind it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『I,Is that so. When will you be able to come here? If you are fine with it, how about today and right now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am sorry I would like to refuse」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is that birdbrain talking under the assumption that I will agree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Eh? Why?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「How should I put it? Don&#8217;t you think that it is too little? At least offer the standard one day salary of 1/25</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the monthly salary, considering 25 working days a month」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Und, understood. I will pay you that much. So get here as soon as you can. This should be enough right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How the hell is it enough. That Bald cuckoo, I wonder what sort of an abacus he has in his head to calculate things like this. Even if he had one, the natto abacus does a better job.<span id='easy-footnote-2-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6027' title=' ED: Poor Matsutomo, the abaci and the natto are getting into his mind '><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I seriously don’t have any intention to go, but I also feel partly relieved because the section chief called. I should be able to learn some details about the troublesome deal that Tsuchiya was talking about.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Not really, it is quite appealing but should I take it……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『How greedy! To be ungrateful like this after quitting your job all of a sudden. Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shouted at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, how convenient for him. Inside his head I have already become someone who quit the job voluntarily and without any notice. Though he is bald, his brain is twisted and contorted like natto <span id='easy-footnote-3-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-6027' title='TL:pun being a bald head is smooth and I don’t know why the author likes natto so much'><sup>3</sup></a></span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「In the first place, why do you need my help? Tsuchiya is capable enough and by now Murasaki should also be able to take up more work. There should be enough manpower」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Well that is……』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is wavering. I should be able to get it out of him if I give it a little push.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Are you implying that I am the type of person to just frivolously agree to whatever you are saying without understanding the situation that the company is in and what would my own role in it be first?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『No, not at all. Matsumoto<span id='easy-footnote-4-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6027' title='TL: He never fails to get it wrong does he'><sup>4</sup></a></span>, you know about the big deal that our company got when you quit, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The compensation for selling me like a slave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, the president told me about it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Yes, that’s the one. We proceeded with the deal, having the marketing company, which brought it to us, to act as the intermediary. But, the client had a false impression and that gave birth to a lot of chaos. We ended up being burdened with an endless amount of work.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see, that’s a disaster」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though he is saying that they had a false impression, I bet they just believed the president&#8217;s bragging.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The situation is not that different from what Tsuchiya told me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The young marketing Onee-san who went around mediating also doesn’t seem all that reliable…. But if we are able to pass this hurdle, then our division will surely shoot up in value and we can consider that you will have repaid the gratitude that the company has shown you during your employment.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, okay….. the young female marketer?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard something that couldn’t be ignored from the section chief, who I want to ignore. And so I questioned him in reflex.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marketer. A specialist who uses his expertise and knowledge to formulate sales plans grounded in reality and connects buyers and sellers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A young lady marketer who is in charge of the deal that was part of the transaction in my trade.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This must definitely be…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Ah, are you interested in her? She is a bit forceful but a beauty alright. Moreover she is big….』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And that person’s name is?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s almost no possibility of me being wrong. A 99% chance I’m right.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I get it, I still can’t stop hoping that it is not who I think it is. Unfortunately, the section chief still uttered the name that I was very familiar with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Was it Saotome-san, right it is Saotome Mio-san』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome Mio…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『If you come and work you might have the chance to meet her. Hurry up, try to make it here within an hour』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I would like to refuse your offer. As for the reason, it’s because my name is not Matsumoto but Matsutomo. Bye then」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Eh, Wai』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beep Beep Beep<span id='easy-footnote-5-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-6027' title=' ED: Quite a satisfying moment here '><sup>5</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Fuuuhhh………」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hanging up the phone, I took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「This must be that」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expected it ever since speaking with Tsuchiya that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trouble because of the big deal that came in after I quit. It’s simple to deduce that Mio-san will be affected by it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s a crisis where Tsuchiya and Murasaki might face unemployment because of the lie that the company president told at the deal for my extraction」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I put it? Mio-san&#8217;s personality is too difficult. Anyways the situation we are stuck in seems to be very complicated. Of course, there is also the matter of being accountable for the contract and one’s professional duties. And if we are playing the blame game then it is President Kusaki who is 99.9% at fault here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even so, Mio-san is surely feeling guilty about it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Splashed pasta on the person who had lunch with me”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was unable to hold an entertaining conversation when he came shopping with me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san is the type of person who cries while hugging Fuu-chan for such simple things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what Mio-san thinks about Murasaki and Tsuchiya. Maybe acquaintances? Or friends? At the very least she feels goodwill towards them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was that way, no, I am pretty sure it is so. Then right now Mio-san should be feeling an immense pressure that I can’t possibly fathom. Even if all of this gets settled peacefully she probably wouldn’t dare to meet those two ever again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all I went through to set them up. If possible I would like for them to maintain their relationship. How am I going to do that&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is there something that I can do…」</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Night</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who came home exactly at 9 p.m. told me about what happened during the day while gobbling her Sichuan style bean curd.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And you know the department head was elated when I told him that I watched “A ghost’s Bon curry” on a big screen using the projector」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Thank goodness that it was worth the efforts that we put in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And this time he loaned out another movie……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「”Should I eat your pancreas from the inside or from the bottom”?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Probably a splatter film…..<span id='easy-footnote-6-6027' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-6027' title='TL: Was surprised to find that such a subgenre of horror exists'><sup>6</sup></a></span>」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s have this conversation after dinner. We should drop this for now.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ok, we will do that」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san has completely omitted the details regarding my former company. Looks like even she understands client confidentiality and is upholding the principle of not divulging information about her clients.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even regarding this department head who is fond of horror movies, I don’t know his real name nor the company that he works at. That is the norm and hence I have never asked her about such things and that’s how we have traversed so far.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Let’s change the topic then. That’s right, Mio-san what did you do about that?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The information regarding the alumni reunion.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah…. I am thinking of skipping out on it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It will be difficult for something like this to happen again, why don’t you go and meet your friends?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You see I don’t have anyone that I am close with…..」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I see, well then I will mail them back informing your absence」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Thanks!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ummm… well….. uh….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Awkward silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes…?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A delicate atmosphere has descended upon the dining table. In the first place I never was good at hiding things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san too, she is also like that. I can keep work related things secret but this time I also have my personal things mixed in as well. Hiding this is also a part of communication. There is no doubt Mio-san is also bad at hiding things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the situation doesn’t allow me to wait till Mio-san comes out with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I wanted to avert this bleak future we are slowly advancing towards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You seem to be really busy these days.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, I am really sorry making you wait everyday」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Not at all, this is my job. But why did you become busy all of a sudden?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That, I can’t tell you much because of the company norms….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied just the way I feared she would.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Is it because you pulled me out of there?」</span></p>
