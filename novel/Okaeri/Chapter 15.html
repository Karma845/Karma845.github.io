<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Saotome-san has Become Weak Again</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How are you feeling, Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think I am feeling a little better now」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sending Tsuchiya off, I placed the bottle of『Dassai』that was out of my reach in the kitchen and went to Mio-san’s bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was wrapped up in a blanket and letting out a shallow breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Looks like moving your body might have turned out for the better」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Maybe」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Your physical health is important, but I am really glad that you didn’t collapse mentally. I thought you would definitely worry about every little mistake that you made whilst meeting with Tsuchiya which in turn might have exacerbated your illness」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before, when we went shopping together she criticised herself for not being able to hold an interesting conversation and for spilling a drop of napolitana sauce. She considered such things to be grave enough to warrant a Sabbath<span id='easy-footnote-1-5866' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5866' title=' should mean something like a “reflection meeting” here'><sup>1</sup></a></span>. I was convinced that something similar would occur.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tsuchiya-san? That’s because I won’t be meeting him anytime soon. So……」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……. How does it matter?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, after seeing Matsutomo-san today, I will be seeing you again tomorrow right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, naturally」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That’s why, if you come to hate me today, then tomorrow you would still be forced to meet me. I am hungry….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san answered my question with 「Isn’t it a given」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I won’t come to hate you. Even if, in the smallest chance that I do come to hate you then I will not push myself and just quit.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don’t want that…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ehhh–?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Even though I have Fuu-chan and the rest, I still don’t want it to happen. It’s a definite no-no」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then what do you want me to do?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have no clue…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow I think I got the gist of what she is trying to tell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, to sum it up you don’t have to worry and can rest easy as you won’t be meeting with Tsuchiya. Is that it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…… I will make sure to take him out to convey my thanks.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Commendable, commendable」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muu—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remains carefree and won’t get depressed if there is enough time between successive meetings. Even if it is simply postponing the inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「By the way, Mio-san, you were the type that put off doing your holiday homework, right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eek, Aba, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tur, turned it in time?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Good grief, you must at least make it a point to do it systematically this year.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We don’t have homework anymore…… Eh, we don’t, right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case she seems to have improved enough to hold a conversation. If she stays like this then it is possible to make her eat something before giving her the medicine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then, I will go and make food. I am taking away the egg porridge」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she has become a bit better, I don’t want to force it and have her consume solid food. It’s really wasteful, but let’s just look over it this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was clearing the plate with the porridge, Mio-san grabbed the spoon from the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I can still eat」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s fine. If you force yourself to eat, then you may end up vomiting and subsequently delay your recovery」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will be fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She refuses to let go. She is weirdly obstinate in some places.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Cold porridge is not really palatable you know」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That’s okay」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even from the nutritional perspective, starch that has started the process of retrogradation is difficult to digest and might even burden the already weak digestive organs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the case, but I guess you can’t help it if she is determined to eat it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In that case, only a spoonful」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Okay」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splosh, Mio-san put her spoon in the porridge that is starting to resemble a dumpling and retrieved a spoonful. Putting it in her mouth she gulped down the porridge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">….Gochisousama</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">∼</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osomatsusama</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span id='easy-footnote-2-5866' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5866' title='For anyone unfamiliar with this term, it should be a humble way of saying “I’m glad you liked it” or so. Google it for more details'><sup>2</sup></a></span>. It’s good that you don’t want to waste food but you shouldn’t do it at the cost of your health. Then you will be losing both the principal as well as the interest.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I ate it because I couldn’t taste anything」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, that was it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that Mio-san doesn’t realise, I quietly closed the plate which still had eight tenths of the porridge left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If you get better, then I will make it as a late night snack for you. It’s really delicious when made with an earthenware pot. Let’s have it together.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Okay, it’s a promise.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please get well even if it’s only for the sake of eating the late night snack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately the fever has gone down a bit and she is able to eat light food. The ingredients that Tsuchiya bought can be put to use.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s whip something up before the fever recurs. I moved to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator which has already become completely familiar to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s good that she stocked up on eggs」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ingredients required this time are much simpler than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Egg, sake, sugar, honey….., I also have soy milk at hand, huh. Let’s use that too.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time we will be making a dish that stands on par with egg porridge. A typical go to food for those afflicted with fever.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there are even a lot of people who have come across this dish in an anime or manga but were unable to make it themselves. Before learning how to cook, I too was one amongst them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Scramble the eggs and then use a tea filter to strain it. Add sugar and honey to the egg and mix it well.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First job at hand is to process the eggs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that no lumps are formed at this stage is important as it affects the final outcome.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now gently beat the eggs until it becomes a uniform yellow coloured liquid. Set it aside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Take half a cup of 『Dassai』and boil it in the stove to reduce its alcohol content」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a little hot water to the sake and stir it well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Now pour this into the beaten eggs while stirring and blend it thoroughly to a single homogenous mixture.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you pour it in a hurried manner the egg will harden and it will become similar to an egg soup. Pour it slowly in order to get a yellow liquid that gleams like a custard pudding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「At last, add just a little soy milk.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to soften the flavour it’s better to use cow’s milk. In my case it should be fine to use soymilk since Mio-san loves soy beans. It’s also a great choice as it is good for the stomach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「All right, it tastes good. Isn’t it great that it is also high in nutrients」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few decades ago, the dietary supplements and jelly type products that people use nowadays didn’t exist. The famed technique that Japanese people have been using for hundreds of years together is “Liquid Dietary Supplement”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Complete」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><a href="https://www.umami-insider.com/recipe-tamagozake/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamagozake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The viscous yellow liquid rolled around the mug, letting out a sweet aroma</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
