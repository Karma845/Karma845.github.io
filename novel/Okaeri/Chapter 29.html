<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; Welcoming Saotome-san Back</h3>

<p><strong>Saotome POV</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「After a long while I am feeling really tired today…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the elevator opened, seeing the usual corridor to my apartment I couldn’t stop myself from letting out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s finally over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moderating and adjusting the workload, schedule and the number of people involved. I finally managed to bring the situation under control using every single one of my skills and connections to the maximum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have even devised a contingency plan, so the same mistake shouldn’t repeat again. Both the companies should now be able to get a satisfying return from the transaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing that much and coming back home, my legs feel like lead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Once I return, I will report to Matsutomo-san, apologise to Murasaki-san and Tsuchiya-san and then…. I guess it will only be till there」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that it will come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It will really end.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Will they get angry. I wonder if they will get mad at me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Tsuchiya-san and Murasaki-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Matsutomo-san apart, I just got to know the other two but, I can tell that they are very nice people.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I apologise they will definitely forgive me and say it’s alright.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am scared of that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they say that it’s alright, they will definitely have some anger and resentment in their hearts. That negative feeling would gradually accumulate. After that, there will come a day when it falls upon me in its entirety.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean even someone like Mika-chan whom I knew for four years did something like that and separated from me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why, I should break away by myself earlier and end it as soon as possible. That should be my responsibility as well as the correct thing to do. I did what I did and I don’t have any intentions of making excuses or justifying my actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was disturbed would go back to normal. That’s all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah…….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Burdened with such thoughts I reach in front of the No. 603. Just across No. 605, whose owner has been taken into my house is completely still and silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ding-Dong”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I ring the intercom, I could hear the sound of someone opening the lock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Placing my hands on the door knob, I slightly open the door and peek inside. There isn’t much of a meaning behind this. It’s just that the memory of living by myself for so long, involuntarily induces anxiety and leads me to think that there is no one inside. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-san…?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He opened the door, so it’s not possible that he is not here. But, there is no indication of anyone being present.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, there is pure white fox plush that has been made to sit on the wooden flooring of the corridor. Looking small and cute as if greeting people.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why is Fubuki here…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not Fubuki, and not Fuu-chan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「But then, this should be, should be」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flung my shoes away and took the plush toy in my hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a form.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel it’s weight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not an illusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「『Saotome Mio』…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The letters written on its back scattered any notion of the obvious answer of it being a different toy of the same model. Without a mistake these are the letters that I wrote imitating others when I was five years old.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can’t be. But there is no other possibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aa-chan……?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to believe it, I grasped it tightly. I felt something hard inside it’s stomach. Then I remembered, Aa-chan was a talking plush toy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought back and recollected my memory, which I could never forget.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right, the button was certainly around this area…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probing the place with the button, I suddenly remembered something that I read a long time back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every meeting will certainly lead to a parting. And you gradually start to forget about the person you part with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Character.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Faults.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The memories of such things get lost along the passage of time and before long it fades away completely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is however an order in which you lose them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a researcher, people first forget the “voice.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking up till there I managed to find the button and pressed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「『Okaerinasai!』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The faded memory has now regained its colour.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is Aa-chan’s voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our memories together in the 5 years from our meeting when I was 5 years old to our parting when I was 10 years old are innumerous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The memory of the night I spent crying alone after losing him is never ending.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They keep flowing, I am not able to stop it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aaaaaaaaa……..!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want to part a second time. Thinking so I tightly hugged Aa-chan.</span></p>
