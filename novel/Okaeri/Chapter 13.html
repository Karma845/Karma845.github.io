<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; It’s Difficult to Introduce Saotome-san</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~Beep~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hello, Tsuchiya?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Long time no see! My phone was run over by a delivery truck and got drenched on top of it. I thought it was done for, but then a godly repairman managed to resuscitate my phone from the dead and restore the data. In order to commemorate its revival I wanted to call someone, and you were the first person that came to mind. So what were you doing?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Now… ah. I am working right now」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Seriously? Your working conditions haven’t improved even after switching jobs? Did I interrupt your work?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, not at all. On the contrary, you saved me」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Re, Really? Then it should be fine I guess』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both joined the company at the same time. Both of us were from Kyushu, I from Fukuoka prefecture and he from Nagasaki. We hit it off well with each other and used to hang around the neighbourhood all the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s not important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need of the hour is thought, calculation, dialogue, negotiation and etiquette, including soft and hard tactics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all, speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tsuchiya, where are you right now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Returning home from work…… Do you want to go drinking? Work finished at 9pm and I am bustling with energy!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That will be a bit difficult, let’s go some other time. Can you do me a favour and deliver something to my house, no questions asked!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is good reason for this negotiation to be aggressive. If I start entertaining questions then the situation will quickly become tedious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s wrong? It should be alright if I could buy it closeby』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thanks, you saved me!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phew! I have managed to deflect any troublesome questions that might be asked. Looks like I will be able to complete my objective very soon.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am forced to resort to such measures since my situation is a bit special.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally a conversation between former colleagues goes like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「Where do you work now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B 「XXX Company. I work in the sales department, selling office chairs」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「That’s nice! How are the people over there? And the work culture?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B 「It’s great! The clerk, Kaya-san’s child is very cute—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「Ehhh–」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas in my case it will be like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「Where do you work now?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B 「At my neighbour’s place. Everyday I welcome her home by saying 『</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okaeri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">』」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「That’s nice! How are the people over there? And the work culture?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B 「It’s great! Everyday my employer’s mental age keeps changing and it is really fun」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 「Ehhh–」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I assure you it won’t stop at「Ehhh–」.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can feel the barrage of questions and the chaos that will ensue once I start answering them honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was exactly why I didn’t contact him these three weeks after changing jobs. Fortunately, he called me now, reminding me that I could ask for help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will definitely make full use of this opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So, what do you want?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ok, first…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Matsutomo-san, who are you talking to….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mio-san, what’re ya doing?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I switched to dialect reflexively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Did I just hear a woman’s voice now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Sorry, It’s the TV」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Matsutomo-san, Matsutomo-san. Look here. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nee</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『She’s calling out your name though. Don’t tell me, you got a girlfriend? Are you not working right now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, I didn’t lie when I said I was in the middle of work.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Matsutomo-san is ignoring me…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fumu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s obvious that Tsuchiya has started to think about things on the other side. This is bad. If I handle this poorly and let the conversation drag, then it will take that much longer to get the medicine. But recklessly rushing things there is the worst case scenario that I end up offending him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this juncture, I must devote myself entirely to thinking of a stop gap measure. All for the sole purpose of making Mio-san ingest the bitter medicine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I didn’t mean to deceive you. The situation is quite complicated. I will clearly explain it later…. So please!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s okay. I got it』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Really?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did he really deduce the situation from just this. It’s a scenario which might push Sherlock Holmes to throw the towel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『In the middle of work. An </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onee-san’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pampering voice. Stuff that you urgently need but can’t buy it by yourself. From these bits of information I can easily deduce your new job.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment, Tsuchiya declared, probably with a smug face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s either host or nurse, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You&#8230; What’re ya saying?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involuntarily changed my dialect again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Did I get it right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Wrong. How in the world did you narrow it down to these two choices. Hello Work will not even introduce these jobs to you if you are not 13 years old.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Given the circumstances I could only think of this.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「As if… it might be」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Like I said』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But if I had to choose from these two then…. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wait, let’s stop contemplating whether my job is closer to a host or a nurse and save it for later. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a lot to say, but Mio-san comes first. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Anyway let’s put this aside for now. It’s complicated, really hard to explain.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To each his own』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will explain later. Can you please buy a few things for me?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Fine, I will do it. What do you want?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two things are required immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, ingredients to make a dish that is palatable for Mio-san who can’t have egg porridge. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A bottle of sake. Something mild and sweet should do.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Sake! So your new job is a host? Is this for you to drink with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onee-san</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ordered takeout?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That and “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okusuri No**tane”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」[Note: Swallowing Aid Jelly for Children]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Which one?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Peach flavoured」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I am not asking about the flavour』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But I like grapeeee…」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5848' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5848' title='ED: This should be obvious, but it’s Mio-san'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Make it grape flavoured!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ah fine already. I got it. Sake and grape flavoured </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oku**ri Nometane, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right!』</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yosh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Finally done. I was able to procure the supplies in the most efficient manner. All that is left is to wait for Tsuchiya to reach….</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the hell am I going to explain all this!!</span></p>
