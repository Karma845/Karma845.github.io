<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Saotome-san Won&#8217;t Give Up</h3>

<p>「It&#8217;s the truth. But since it&#8217;s already this late, let&#8217;s continue this later.」</p><p>「Eh&#8230;&#8230;」</p><p>Please don&#8217;t look like an abandoned puppy that&#8217;s watching its owner leave by itself. With those upturned eyes coupled with that see-through shirt making me see your cleavage, please don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s bad for my heart. Saotome-san height is 150 CM, and it&#8217;s overly unbalanced with that overpowered weapon that&#8217;s located in front of her. I feel like those weapons are destroying my eyes.</p><p>While my heart is wavering because of such temptation, I look at the clock and see it&#8217;s about three in the morning. Considering I still have work tomorrow, this is kinda bad. Not to mention, at this point, my fatigue and sleepiness are starting to overwhelm me.</p><p id="L9">「Th, then tomorrow. Could you say it to me again tomorrow?」</p><p>Answering &#8220;Yes&#8221; to slowly approaching Saotome-san, but after remembering how my work goes, I shook my head.</p><p>「Ahh~, I don&#8217;t think our time of going home matches. Since I usually get home this late.」</p><p>I was astonished when I first learned that trains in Tokyo still run until midnight.</p><p>This is the first impression that I received when I came to Tokyo from Fukuoka for work. I never thought from the start of the first week of my work that I will have to work until 1 AM. It was during the first month of working when I realized that it will be like this for the rest of the year.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know what time Saotome-san goes home, but I am sure that it won&#8217;t be as late as mine since it&#8217;s physically impossible. It&#8217;s possible if I&#8217;m the one getting told, but being the one who tells will be hard.</p><p>「Is that so&#8230;&#8230;」</p><p>「I may be able to do it when it&#8217;s a day off, though I&#8217;m not sure when that day off will come.」</p><p>I really don&#8217;t know when that day off will come.</p><p>「I understand.」</p><p>「It&#8217;s fine if you understand it. Well then, let&#8217;s seal up the broken window and go to sleep.」</p><p>「If that is the case then I will hire you. Please become my &#8220;Okaeri Manager&#8221;」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5142' title=' can I apply for that? '><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>We&#8217;re not on the same page.<br /> What is she saying? I thought she started to understand but apparently, that is not the case at all.</p><p>「Hello, do you <em>Understand</em><span id='easy-footnote-2-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5142' title=' he said this in English, in this way -&amp;gt; アンダースタン -&amp;gt; understaan'><sup>2</sup></a></span> what you&#8217;re saying?」</p><p>「<em>Understand-desu.</em>」</p>

<p id="L40">「I see you <em>Understand. </em>Though even if you say you want to hire me, it&#8217;s not that simple&#8230;」</p><p>「My monthly salary is 530,000 yen.」</p><p>What Saotome-san said so nonchalantedly, was something about triple my monthly salary. Salary that came from working until the last train.<br /> I forcefully pulled myself together.</p><p>「530,000 Yen?」</p><p>「530,000 Yen desu.」</p><p>「Face value? In hand?」</p><p>「It&#8217;s in hand.」</p><p>This is something I learned when I became a member of the society. There are two types of income: &#8220;Face Value&#8221; and &#8220;In Hand&#8221;. Former is the sum of all including the salary, and it&#8217;s also called gross salary. From that point, employee&#8217;s pension, social insurance, or taxes are drawn, and the latter is to be sent to you monthly. <span id='easy-footnote-3-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5142' title=' basically, the 530,000 yen is the after all the deduction. It&amp;#8217;s quite big. '><sup>3</sup></a></span></p><p>In most cases, salary income for office workers is about 80% of face value.</p><p>That basically means 20% is gone <span id='easy-footnote-4-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5142' title=' Actually not, since they come back to you by any other means. '><sup>4</sup></a></span>.  If you work for five days, you&#8217;re basically working for a day for free.</p><p>I have a lot to say against this system, but that will make the story go askew. The important thing right now is that, when Saotome-san gets her bonus, her total salary might reach 1,000,000 yen.</p><p>「Though I am not saying this proudly, ever since I was born, I did not have any kind of hobbies, no boyfriend, no friends!<span id='easy-footnote-5-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5142' title=' what a sad person, not that I can talk about it&amp;#8230;. '><sup>5</sup></a></span>」</p><p>「That&#8217;s really not something you can talk about proudly.」</p><p>「Even if I go to restaurant and bars, since I am alone it just make me sad. So I usually spend my earnings to eat something healthy. Specifically Tofu.」</p><p>「Well they are really tasty. Tofu.」<span id='easy-footnote-6-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5142' title=' YES! '><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p>「I also like Miso soup.」</p><p>「Tofu and Miso are both cheap right?」</p><p id="L75">「Yes, they turned me healthy and made my savings increase. And what&#8217;s more.」</p><p>「&#8230;&#8230;.What&#8217;s more?」</p><p>I asked her frankly because I realized she is breaking my guard down little by little.</p><p>「I DID NOT HAVE ANYONE TO ENJOY THAT FEELING TOGETHER!」</p>
<p>「Well, things do look different if you have some friends.」</p><p>Apparently, there are some people who hate 4-person board games.</p><p>「And so, I can&#8217;t take this anymore. Not after having my body carved with your &#8216;okaerinasai,&#8217; this is something that won&#8217;t heal over time. And so, yes. 300,000 yen per month. I will pay you that much to hire you as my &#8216;Okaeri Manager.&#8217;」</p><p id="L89">What kind of phrasing is that? Well, I really can&#8217;t talk sense into that since it&#8217;ll be a sexual harassment. <span id='easy-footnote-7-5142' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5142' title=' he&amp;#8217;s talking about body carving and something that won&amp;#8217;t heal overtime. Frankly speaking, virginity. '><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

<p>If I think about it, if my monthly income will be 300,000. This will be more than 70% of my current income. Not to mention all I have to do is to say &#8216;okaeri&#8217; to Saotome-san. There should be nothing better than this.</p><p>In fact, it&#8217;s too good to be true. Or rather it&#8217;s scary.</p><p id="L95">「That said, I still have my current work.」</p><p id="L97">「Sorry for asking, but where do you work currently?」</p><p>「Ah, I&#8217;m sorry for being late, I am something like this&#8230;&#8230;」</p><p>I pass the business card as it is required. Though the phrase that I just said won&#8217;t go away due to my habit that was formed after saying that phrase every time I handed my business card.</p><p id="L103">「I see.」</p><p id="L103">「You see what?」</p><p>「Thank you for working until this late. As for the broken window, I will have it fixed myself so please don&#8217;t worry about it anymore.」</p><p>「Eeh?」</p><p>「Well then, good night.」</p><p>I was pushed out of her apartment and thrown away into the corridor. It was a blunder to get captivated by the smile of Saotome-san while she was closing the door.</p><p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s not to worry about. That thing itself is worrying, but it&#8217;s already this late. I will think about this tomorrow.</p><p>I thrown my fatigued body into the futon that is located inside my empty apartment.</p>
