<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Saotome-san won’t let me leave</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘God will never give you more than you can handle.’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A saying that I heard in parochial school. I wonder who said this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I don’t think it is all fine and dandy if you are able to overcome it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the taste of blood still lingering in my mouth, I complained to the Heaven’s Resident and helped Mio-san into a gingham checkered<span id='easy-footnote-1-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5835' title='ED: Gingham is a medium-weight balanced plain-woven fabric made from dyed cotton or cotton-blend yarn.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> spring pajama. I was filled with nothing but praiseworthiness for having won over the devil in me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mio-san, Are you feeling hungry?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Not much…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her condition still seems as bad as before. Her complexion hasn’t recovered and her poor physical condition is clearly reflected in her lack of appetite.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she isn’t aware of her own condition, skipping supper is out of the question. I probably realised it then.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‍</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, I will go and cook something light.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don’t really want to eat anything.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s good to eat at least a little. Speaking of that, what did you have for lunch?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let’s see—」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is taking a while to think about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can completely relate. After all, you don’t really take note of what you have for lunch. It’s similar to walking into a katsudon<span id='easy-footnote-2-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5835' title='pork cutlet rice, but any kind of fast food would work here'><sup>2</sup></a></span> outlet for dinner and all of a sudden realize that you had katsudon for lunch as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, I remember. It was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">S*YJ*Y </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span id='easy-footnote-3-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5835' title=' SOYJOY &amp;#8211; a brand of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.blanja.com/katalog/p/fnb/soyjoy-banana-30-gr-single-16534143&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;nutritional bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; '><sup>3</sup></a></span>」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Only that?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Bananaaa flavoured —」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I thought, she seems to have been hard-pressed at work.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be better than just skipping lunch altogether, but no matter how much nutritional content it has, it’s definitely not good to eat just that. If you eat only beans then… What were the lyrics?! ‘It builds up a robust body and gives a fierce sex appeal’.<span id='easy-footnote-4-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5835' title=' So, this is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-soybeans-song&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;sauce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; '><sup>4</sup></a></span> That might be so but right now Mio-san just needs a normal appetite and her usual liveliness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There is also the fact that it will be problematic if her sex appeal grew any further」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, next time my tongue might turn into mincemeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was saying how great it will be if Mio-san recovered quickly.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I am not sick though?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oops! I didn’t realise.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, she is feeling fine only because her consciousness is hazy. Having her eat something is the best course of action.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright. Please wait for a bit, I will be back right after cooking some food.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itterasshai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix spring onion with the eggs, rice…… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nn, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I wonder if there is no other choice but to use cooking wine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even amongst the types of food suitable for a person down with fever, this should be the best choice. Luckily, as it is a routinely made and customary dish, all the ingredients required are there in the fridge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yosh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ingredients are steamed rice, egg, the versatile spring onions, dried young sardine<span id='easy-footnote-5-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5835' title='Also named “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;dried Shirasu”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and here is an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://favy-inbound-singapore.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/topic_item/image/71464/retina_Shirasu_pile.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, but be careful'><sup>5</sup></a></span>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">white soup stock <span id='easy-footnote-6-5835' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5835' title='dashi'><sup>6</sup></a></span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dish I am going to make is egg porridge. Being highly nutritious and easily digestible, it is the ideal get-well meal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The focus this time must be on speed rather than taste. Before the situation gets any worse, have her eat and go to sleep. This way she should recover just fine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, the rice should be boiled using large amounts of water and soup stock, the egg whisked properly in a circular motion and poured into the rice while the rice is still hot and finally season it by sprinkling the sardines and the spring onion. It becomes much more delicious if it’s cooked using an earthen pot, so much so that you won’t hesitate to have it even if you are up and running.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that will easily take around 30 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cook it now in the shortest time possible, the only way is to use that and not the rice cooker or the earthen pot. Yes, the microwave oven.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san has a model that can be used at 200, 500 and 700 watts. With this, it should only take 10 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hmm, this should do for a heat resistant vessel. Put in the rice, pour water and soup stock, close the lid and set it at 700 watts…. As the rice is still warm, about a minute is all it should take.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting the vessel revolve around, I scramble the eggs, add the sardines in between and keep them aside. Whisking with the chopsticks using a vertical slicing motion makes it easier for the white to blend in with the yolk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the boiled rice out and stir gently. Doing this enhances the taste. It still can’t compare to the real thing, but it is sufficient in this case.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the whisked egg mixture, stir it, cover it and then steam it once more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「At last, sprinkle the spring onion. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yosh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparation complete. Time taken: approximately 5 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now then, let’s quickly have her eat this and go to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mio-san, time to eat!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no response to the continuous knocks on the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still no reaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the door, my eyes lay witness to the chaotic scene inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This is…She managed to open every single drawer in this short time…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, Matsutomo-san, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okaeri</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">∼</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the drawers and cupboards are open. Mio-san is flopped right in the middle of the room surrounded by clothes, underwear and even sanitary products. And some other things, possibly private and personal things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mi..Mio-san, this, what were you doing?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is not here.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is apparent that she is searching for something, but what is so important that she turned the entire room upside down for it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Can you please tell me what you were searching for? I will help you find it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Aa-chan!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Aa-chan?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aa-chan… what is that?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A dear companion…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, is it one of the plush toys that you recently bought?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo with vastly different backgrounds, one being a premium product from a specialist store and the other a normal game center gift. Shouldn’t they be fighting for attention from their senpai Fuu-chan?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No. That was Koro-chan and Yuu-chan」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koro-chan should be the dog and Yuu-chan the cat. The atmosphere has somehow become odd.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that is the case, then who is Aa-chan?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then, what kind of a child is Aa-chan?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A pure white fox.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Isn’t that Fuu-chan. He is in the living room right now, should I go and get him?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s not Fuu-chan but Aa-chan. Aa-chan…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, look! Your fever has gotten high.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped her from rolling around listlessly and took her to the bed. Although she is not in pain, it is likely that she became delirious because of the fever. It would be for the best if she ate the porridge and went to sleep. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please have supper first, I will find Aa-chan for you.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wonder where he went….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will report his whereabouts as soon as I find him. Are you able to eat this by yourself?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think I can」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s fine even if it is just a little. Please have something」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spoonful, two and that’s all. She clearly doesn’t have an appetite. I would really like to have her eat more, but forcing food is not good and might have other repercussions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she had a little, I put the plate down and handed over the cold medicine to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Here you go, take the medicine.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nn….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put the medicine powder in her right hand after breaking open the golden sachet. Mio-san had preemptively bought this medicine for a just-in-case scenario.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…..Keuk, keuk」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Are you alright!?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She coughed violently as she choked on the medicine. I can help her out by stroking her back but that might lead to troublesome circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiping off the yellow powder that flew to my face, I just realised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mio-san, can it be that you can’t swallow the medicine??」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「….I don’t know」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingesting the medicine powder is by no means a simple task. I remember reading that it requires more care and skill than what everyone thinks is necessary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicine, in addition to the efficacy of the chemicals present in it, also has a bitter taste to it that promulgates the secretion of gastric acid, thus preparing the body. Nevertheless, to humans, bitterness directly relates to poison, therefore when a person tries to swallow the bitter and dry powder, he has to go against his instinctual response.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let’s try one more time」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to have her take another packet but the result was the same.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uek, Uergh」</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s a given that you will not be to swallow the bitter medicine when you can’t even eat normal food.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No worries, nowadays there are handy things available just for this」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen advertisements for the jelly-type oblates used to take medicine. It should be available in any pharmacy or convenience store nearby.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will just go out shopping and then be back. Please tell me if you want something, I will buy it for you.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san’s complexion is getting worse and worse. Making sure that I took my smartphone, I stood up to leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…umm」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ee, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the matter」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like it’s difficult for her to speak. But when I brought my ears close to hear her properly, she caught hold of my sleeve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Don’t go….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Even if you tell me that」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be because of the fever. Depending on how it goes, it might be necessary for her to go to the hospital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been quite some time since I tried to leave. I should probably be shaking her off and then leaving, but her slender hands are too firm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Stay here…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that she is helpless. But I can’t do something like just watch while her condition gets worse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impasse. What to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haa, Haa….</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Are you feeling sick?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Just a little bit. However, I am alright.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regular symptoms have started to appear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her breath became more and more strenuous as she held on to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What to do…..!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how hard I try, it is unlikely that I will be able to leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have even tried praying to God. In fact, I wouldn’t need any help if only my prayers would work.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「….?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My phone vibrated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tch, what is it now? A complaint for when I went to the game centre without him?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s most likely completely coincidental but I still prayed my gratitude to God.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Incoming call: Tsuchiya Haruto」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The culprit who introduced me to the game centre from before and now stays just two stations away. My former colleague’s name kept blinking on the screen.</p>
