<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Saotome-san Wants a Younger Sister</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sorry to keep you waiting」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came out to the corridor after 4 minutes and 30 seconds, there…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「………」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「………」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It feels like neither of them has moved an inch」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was greeted by a spectacle that seemed to be frozen in time from when I rushed inside my house. The only things that had moved were the clouds in the evening sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「A territory war between a shoe-billed stork and a sloth is it……?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsukaresama desu senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, isn’t it too awkward to just stare for over 5 minutes at a person you met for the first time? At least have some small chat」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Going forward I will make sure to do so. I was caught up in my observation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This kid, isn’t she doing the same thing as at work?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「With that, Mio-san is……..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, Matsutomo-san, just a bit, wait a little」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san who was a stork all this while, finally transformed back into a human, grabbed my hands and dragged me to the secluded place in the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That child, Murasaki-san? Who is she?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「She was my junior in the company I worked at before. I wonder why she suddenly turned up holding a bag…… We haven’t kept contact after I resigned」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So it was like that….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am sorry, she is not a bad person at heart, she just lacks a bit of common sense. Can you please forgive her on my behalf for her rudeness 「Matsutomo-san」」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just realised. Mio-san wasn’t looking at me all this time. Her eyes are rooted at Murasaki and haven’t moved at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have been observing that child from a while back and&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I thought you were just staring back in silence, but it looks like you were also observing her in kind」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And I understood something」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Hoh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this, things that can be understood only through female camaraderie?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it something like figuring out the character from one’s makeup or identifying whether one loves someone else through her hairstyle?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That child is cute」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aah, that’s right. I think she is cute, yes.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taken aback by her surprise attack that came out of nowhere, I ended up repeating her words. What the hell is this person saying?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I have never talked about it, but I always wanted to have a younger brother or sister」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s quite the big revelation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「My craving for a younger brother abated a bit after meeting Matsutomo-san, but…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Craving for a younger brother」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems I was not only sating her appetite for food, but also for this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Just like I thought, I really want a younger sister tooo&#8230;」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「And so?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That child is fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「What are you talking about Mio-san?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I want to make that child my younger sister」<span id='easy-footnote-1-5911' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5911' title='ED: Mio-san, the collector of younger siblings.'><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Please send that request to your parents or Santa Claus」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I’m already 28-years old, she will be more of a daughter&#8230;」<span id='easy-footnote-2-5911' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5911' title='ED: Second part could also be “I’m no longer a daughter” ~ I think'><sup>2</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san, I think you are missing the point here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forgot, but women at this age <span id='easy-footnote-3-5911' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5911' title='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Christmas%20Cake&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A christmas cake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span> tend to be sensitive to this kind of topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Aaa—….. Even if you say things like wanting to make her your younger sister all of a sudden. Moreover if it really comes to be then you would have to meet her quite often you know?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it is someone that she will be frequently meeting, she is scared that she will make some mistake and be hated for it. That’s why she consulted me beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her being this type of a person, I never expected her to want to acknowledge someone as her younger sister. That’s why I am completely surprised too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I like children. If it’s going to be such a little child then it should be fine 」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mio-san, I am reminding you just in case, but Murasaki is 22 years old. She is an adult.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「? I knew that too?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It should be fine if you know it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like Mio-san will be alright if she perceives someone as a kid, even if she has to meet that person frequently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, Murasaki’s height doesn’t exceed 150cm. When someone in the company brought along his daughter, who was in 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade, she was desperate not to have their heights compared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way even though she is one year junior to me in the office, her birthday hasn’t come yet so there is a 2 year age difference still.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Anyways, looks like she has come to see you for something? Go talk to her now, go on now, go on.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time she pushed my back, returning me to where I was standing before. For the second time I am stuck between Mio-san and Murasaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Are you guys done talking?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, Aah. Sorry to keep you waiting. So what’s the matter? I was surprised since you came over here so suddenly」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I came here to deliver your things by the order of that Zurekakkou <span id='easy-footnote-4-5911' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5911' title='TL: the previous nickname was Zurakakkou becoming &amp;#8220;wiggy cuckoo” as Zura meant wig, but Zure here means gap/dislodged/slipped. so it’s a sort of a pun, wasn’t able to think of a good equivalent in english'><sup>4</sup></a></span> section chief.」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using his title along with this nickname. This feeling&#8230; now it really feels like I’m meeting with Murasaki again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah is that so. I wasn’t able to collect them, as it was all too sudden…. Zurekakkou?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We now call him Zurekakkou section chief」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Tsuchiya called him a wig-head though」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It has been revised」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bald cuckoo ––&gt; Wiggy cuckoo, has it started slipping now? That’s probably it&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s becoming rather bad. Even if you are bringing in my things, isn’t it just a mug?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That and your spare tie that was in the locker」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looks like the paper bag she is holding has all my things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Receiving the paper bag that was thrust upon me with both hands, I was able to peek at the mug which I bought in the 100-yen shop and my 798 yen necktie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, thanks. You helped me out」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「So senpai, this person is?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ah, this is my neighbour…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I am Saotome. I am always under the care of Matsutomo-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of an elder sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s different from her usual tone and also different from her work mode. Mio-san is adopting the tone of an elder sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Nice to meet you. I am Murasaki」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Umm, your given name is?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Uh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki flinched at such a normal question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Did I do something?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Murasaki, it’s fine with this person」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…….Ok」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It’s Murasaki Kiran」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murasaki’s full name is Murasaki Kiran. Kiran in hiragana.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">During my employment there, it became a huge topic as the generation of flashy names had reached our company as well. She herself doesn’t like it much and so she doesn’t want to use her given name.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「N, No, it’s not the Kiran from the onomatopoeia for “bright and shiny”. There’s a plant called kiransou <span id='easy-footnote-5-5911' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5911' title='TL: This &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajuga_decumbens&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a></span> and it has bluish violet flowers which bloom during spring. My parents liked it and they grew it, that’s why this name….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Cuteee」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…..Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Isn’t your name really cute and fashionable?! Kiran-chan!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Everyone says so but, stuck with this name was troublesome and I don’t have any pleasant memories of it」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「You weren’t able to experience the excitement that comes up when you learn the kanji that makes up your name in the japanese class, right? I completely understand!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ehhh…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「My name is also just “Mio” in katakana, so I understand」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「…!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few seconds of speechlessness, Murasaki slowly turned around to face me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Matsutomo-senpai」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Saotome-san is a good person」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That’s right」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I now understand why senpai said that it was fine」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Even I didn’t think that it would be a one-hit K.O to this extent. You haven’t changed at all, Murasaki」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she is cold and harsh, if she clicks off then it’s a one hit K.O. That’s the type of person she is.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Then, Kiran-cha…..Murasaki-san what are your plans after this?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I don’t have anything in particular…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Why don’t you come in for a bit?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To think that Mio-san will invite someone to her house by her own will….</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ma, Matsutomo-senpai」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「I plan to drop by for a while too」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Th, then I will have to trouble you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragging me into this, Murasaki keeps looking at me intermittently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mio-san probably just wants to say 「It’s your elder sister! Elder sister!」.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Murasaki probably wants to say 「She just invited me, what do I do?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「……. Well, above everything else it’s important to get along」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Mio-san and Murasaki didn’t have any friends to have a girls&#8217; talk with. And it’s mutually beneficial for them to have a person with whom they didn’t need to be on guard with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「It was just cleaned up this morning. Now, now, come on in」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Um… I don’t really know about things like tea….」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「That aside, Murasaki, do you play UNO?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「We will be playing UNO from now」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「UNO? That nation masterpiece of a card game?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Yes, that UNO」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a tough ordeal. At least for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, this led to the start of the 『UNO』death march that swallowed up the weekend. The beginning of the 『the Great UNO Meet』later was something that no one anticipated.</span></p>
