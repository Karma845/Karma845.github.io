<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Saotome-san Won’t Sleep</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">———2 hours ago, Time: 10:30pm———</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you for today Matsutomo-senpai, Saotome-san…. next time, we will win next time for sure!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After playing for more than 10 times, the result was Mio-san and me helplessly plopping our heads down on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unending eternal UNO prison already went on for five and a half more hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Murasaki! You, you must abbsso….lutely not gamble, ever! Got it!? When it comes to things like tactics and psychological warfare, you are bad enough for it to result in a disastrous situation」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Understood senpai! I will keep it in mind」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s good if you understand! But the problem now is the UNO match. Actually, I don’t feel like wrapping it up like this」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「W, we can’t give up yet! Look here, everyone else is also of the same opinion. If you give up then…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mio-san proclaimed this and hoisted the guardian deity<span id='easy-footnote-1-5964' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5964' title='Plush toy'><sup>1</sup></a></span>, right at that instant Yuu-chan wilted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Haa?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ugu?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of us were blank as to what happened. Amidst the silence, white and yellow coloured urethane foam started falling onto the tatami in the living room. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Abababababa」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mi, Mio-san don’t move! If the cotton scatters everywhere then we will not be able to gather it and put it back!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Saotome-san you didn’t augment it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh, augment?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san who is taking care not to step on the urethane foam is doing a weird pose. Her upper body is holding the plush toy out just like in the movie lion king and she is standing on one leg like a flamingo. Staying frozen like a statue, she managed to stretch her neck out towards Murasaki at the unfamiliar vocabulary she used.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Murasaki, what is “augment”?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting the urethane that was on the floor and placing it on a vinyl nearby, I too looked at Murasaki for an answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Shitora….. No, even though this cat is a prize article, it is made using premium quality cloth. Just that, the thread used to sew it is doesn’t go with the cloth, so it easily crumbles at the weaker sections if it is not augmented」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murasaki was observing Yuu-chan with a face that said, “Since he looked well-kept I thought the surgery would have already been completed”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Before we retrieved him, he was inside the game cabinet for a long time and was crumpled quite a bit. I guess it’s no wonder the condition deteriorated this fast」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Wh, What do we do? What should we do to get him back to normal?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Anyhow, if you have to stitch it up by choosing the places to reinforce then it isn’t something that I can do. Please get it done at a service shop」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Can you let me try it out?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done with her observation, Murasaki asked for permission right away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Will you be able to do it? Murasaki-san!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, I was also the one who reinforced my Shitora. Looking at it, the broken place seems to be quite clear-cut, so I will definitely try to do something」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While saying so, she took out a sewing kit from her bag. It doesn’t look like a professional one. Rather it looks like an ordinary needle and thread used to sew buttons back again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Will you be fine with just those?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s fine, not a problem. I will be dismantling it now, so can you go and buy some thread in the meanwhile?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took note of the necessary specifications such as the type, thickness and colour of the thread. They should be available in the neighbourhood supermarket.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh and also get a punch needle, safety pin and fabric glue if they are available」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What do I do if there are multiple varieties」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Get the cheapest one. Ah, get a good one just for the fabric glue」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling me these things, Murasaki started dismantling the plush toy. Taking out the remaining cotton, removing the parka that it was wearing she turned it inside out and started removing all the unwanted seams using a thread snip.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Woo—w!&#8230;..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time I returned, the three dimensional Yuu-chan had already been reduced to a flat two dimensional object.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is obvious, but dismantling it into its components like this really drives home the fact that a plush toy is made up of cloth and cotton.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Here you go, the thread. This is fine right?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, thanks! This should do the trick」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And Mio-san, we have already collected all the urethane, so it’s fine for you to move now」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A, ah really..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then, I will start my work」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murasaki skilfully passes the thread through the needle’s eye. What happened after was much faster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Woow…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Mio-san, it is dangerous to get too close while she is working with needles」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no faltering movements.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murasaki will probably brush it off by saying, “It’s because I am doing it for the second time”, but even an amateur can see that this level of skill and speed can’t be explained by that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were watching cloth and cloth combining to return to its original form, the flat two-dimensional object gradually became three-dimensional again. With the stitching almost over, turning it inside out, one can see an augmented plush toy that can’t be told apart from its original pristine condition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The urethane should be fine, but I will add a little to it in order to correct it’s appearance」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stuffed the scrap cloths and added a little urethane inside its limbs, puffing it up and finally closed its mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this took merely an hour. “Cloth” became “Yuu-chan” and thus he was revived.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have also strengthened the clothes he is wearing by using fabric glue on the broken parts. If you leave it for about an hour then you can hug it all you want」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Murasaki, you even had such a special skill」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, well, things happened and…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at a level where she wouldn’t have trouble making a living out of it. Mio-san too is listlessly staring at Yuu-chan, who was revived stronger and better by Murasaki’s hands and now is seated above a chair, waiting for his glue to dry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Murasaki-san」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is it?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Amazing」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh, Th, Thank you」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Amazing!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thanks a lot!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Amazing!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thanks a lot!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Amazing, Amazing!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san who is holding Murasaki’s hands and praising her has run out words to use.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same with the fried pork incident too; it’s probably because she is predisposed in such a manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Amazing! Really amazing, thank you so much!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ma, Matsutomo senpai!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What happened?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I haven’t been praised to this extent since successfully finding a job!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Isn’t that great!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like Murasaki is suffering from that “my pace”<span id='easy-footnote-2-5964' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5964' title='I do things at my own pace, when and how I please without a care for the circumstances or consideration of others'><sup>2</sup></a></span> like visage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wait, don’t all “my pace” people do whatever they want regardless of whom they are with?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting to know Mio-san, I realised that there are people who want to adjust to circumstances, try really hard to do it and finally end up looking like a “my pace” person.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Now, now, I think this is a good time to stop. It’s already past 10 p.m. shall we eat something? Do you have any request?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I was able to make Murasaki see a good side of me and also calling it a day at this point is sheer wisdom. With that in mind, I proposed a meal that combines both dinner and a late night snack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Curry—!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Udon or the sort…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then, we will go for Curry-udon」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn&#8217;t enough time to make curry now, but the readymade curry that you get in sealed pouches is delicious enough. There shouldn’t be any problem in making Curry-udon using dashi to spread it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「After eating it…..」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let’s go for the continuation of UNO!!!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That’s right」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…….Eh?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dissolve this meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting caught up in that atmosphere, my expectation was that she would get crushed under the democratic rule of majority.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If it’s Murasaki-san then you will definitely be able to win soon, you are that amazing!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think I got the knack of it. Next time around, I have a feeling that I will do well」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will do well next time around. It’s just my imagination that I heard this every single round.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, because Japan is a democratic country and because I am Mio-san&#8217;s employee…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That’s the spirit, Let’s keep going at it….. is what I want to say, but change is a necessity here」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she is brimming with spirit, the possibility that Murasaki wins the game is unimaginably miniscule.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new variable is required, a new rule or possibly…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Should we increase the number of people? But…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「To find someone who will turn up at this time when called upon doesn’t seem likely」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Exactly… that’s the thing…..Ah」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of the same tanned face, all three of us looked at each other at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…..And that’s how we called upon you using LINE」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think there was about an hour’s time between your meal and my arrival. What happened in meanwhile?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「With the quick shogi rule of limiting the time to 2 minutes a turn, we had about thirty skirmishes. But Murasaki still lost in every single one of them」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought she would at least win a round by accident at this fast pace, but on the contrary she got even worse and the scheme backfired.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it bad to such an extent?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tsuchiya, you really saved me by showing up. Now, let’s start the next sequel」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Till Murasaki wins?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Till Murasaki wins」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I still have some work left to do, so…」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Tsuchiya-san won’t play together with us……?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uh」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio-san uses puppy eyes, it’s a HIT.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It struck right at his vitals. It’s a critical hit! <span id='easy-footnote-3-5964' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5964' title='It’s super effective!'><sup>3</sup></a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……I will show you the spirit of Kyushu men!!!!」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, Atta boy! Tsuchiya」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you very much, Tsuchiya-senpai. I will certainly answer your expectations before morning」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Before morning…..?」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the preparations complete for the induction of the fourth member, The Great UNO Meet moves on to the next arc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let’s begin」</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murasaki clinched her first victory by drawing four『Draw four』at the first hand happened some eleven hours after this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday morning 11:43 AM.</span></p>
