<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Getting stronger quickly at the Dragon Village! ③</h3>

<p>&#8220;Your existance&#8230;. The world destiny already shifted to the direction of destruction, you noticed that right?&#8221; (DK for Dragon King)</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; (Lt for Lute)</p>
<p>I never heard that before.<br />
Even my voice tone sounds so stiff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;. you didn&#8217;t know that.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>Dragon King said that while shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard me?&#8230;. what do you mean?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;. the princess you should protect- is a special existance in this world. I mean, in this world&#8217;s era&#8230;. she is one of the &#8216;Hero&#8217; from 4 in total. They have responsibility to save the world from the hand of salvation and the great calamity&#8230;.the most important existance in this world.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>I understand about that thing.<br />
Cordelia is the Hero of the north, the other hero from the east, west and south&#8230; All of them recieves an oracle then unite and help each other.<br />
Everyone know about that story, if not maybe he is living alone in the mountain.<br />
&#8230;..more or less, that&#8217;s the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Ah, thats right&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;The one who strike the darkness with a sword of hope and clean up the disaster&#8230;.. that is the &#8216;Hero'&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>I respond with frustation mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aa, that&#8217;s right&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;The hero who is saving the weak and purifying (Kill?) demons&#8230;. with such an absolute strength, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>My bad mood turn into a clear anger.<br />
Its not only frustating me, he just said such an obvious things.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what do you mean after said that?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;The weak&#8230; the villager is&#8230;. even hero saved by the weak villager&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>Dragon shook his head with a gloomy face.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, he said this.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think about a villager defending a hero ? Is that a good thing?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not only able to read memory but also the world progress&#8230; I can read it a bit.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to say?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, because you annihilate the army of goblins, the history from future is going crazy.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Future history&#8230; crazy&#8230;?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>Ah, and the dragon nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, at that moment&#8230;. actually she was planning to brave herself to protect you&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;I know even I can&#8217;t say it&#8230; the result is&#8230;. you know how it should be. She know how it is in midsummer, she got a wound and couldn&#8217;t wear a short sleeve shirt.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it&#8230; she should be like that, it&#8217;s a challange for her to protect you&#8230; in order to become stronger&#8230;. without relying on you to know her quality as a Hero&#8230;. in a sense as training, she should heve push herself to the limit&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well&#8230; that is&#8230;. what does it matter?&#8221; (Lt) [TN: is he that dense?]
<p>By the way, when we were in the prevoius life&#8230;. she suddenly went to mountain and participate as a knight.<br />
Usualy insect have an insensible personality</p>
<p>By the way, when we were in the previous life &#8230; &#8230; when she suddenly came to the mountain and began to actively participate in the Knights Order.<br />
Although those insects (knights order?) were originally have insensible personality, eventhough they disliked the oracle of the &#8216;Hero&#8217; from the bottom of their hearts &#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;- There is nothing that matters, it&#8217;s because she gets stronger.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that &#8230; &#8230; why?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the same as the feeling that you are having now?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;The same with me &#8230; same ?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;The feeling of want to become stronger in order to protect your important things, isn&#8217;t it the feeling to get stronger than anything?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;……eh?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere 15-year-old girl called as a dragon killer &#8230; Do you think she is possible to gain that title in this world time?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that is &#8230; &#8230;.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally, the attack of that Goblin &#8230; was an awakening event to decide the preparedness for her to live as a Hero, but you solved it by yourself. The side who should saved poeple is getting saved instead It&#8217;s a tough topic to say. &#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but &#8230; &#8230;.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is the destiny that was prescribed in this world &#8230; Well, now it is uncertain as we go to another branch &#8230;&#8221; (DK) [TN : he mean another route, like visual novel maybe]
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;- Dragon Killer &#8230; &#8230; To prove that someone is trully a Hero, Driving into full-scale training at full power,<br />
It&#8217;s a title you obtained by betting your own life.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; &#8230;.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not a thing that can be cleared up only with talent, its not simple as you think&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; &#8230;.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t read everything. Even if it is a serious disaster, I do not know what will happen concretely. But &#8230; the world has largely been ruined. That&#8217;s all I can say. &#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>The Dragon King ridiculous smile on me who kept silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after all, you are just a child &#8230; &#8230; I was a bit disappointed &#8230; Well, that is no problem. When the fate is twisting the band of the Heroes or the world&#8217;s fate &#8230;&#8230; That kind of stuff&#8221; (DK) [TN: Not sure in this line]
<p>For the time being, I keep silent.<br />
And stare at each other silently with Dragon King &#8211; 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is already useless as a Hero &#8230;. Is it something like that?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;According to your memory &#8230; When you are 15 years old, she will be a dragon killer, Right ?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&#8230;.. when she suffering against the Evil Dragon?&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>I will never forget.<br />
Shee was accompanied with the knights order to subjugated some monster, then they met a unusual monsters, and suffered as a witness from the annihilation of the knights order &#8211; even the survivor are in the horrible condition.</p>
<p>And aside from the survivor, their head has been separated from their neck to their torso and some of them are from mutilated to burned into ash.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, at that point(Prevous life time?)&#8230;&#8230;but this time&#8230;.. she can&#8217;t win over that Dragon, 100% dead&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>I keep silent for a while, then I laugh a little towards him.<br />
&#8220;Why are you laughing?&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong if I become strong? I wonder if I could slaugh that evil dragons &#8230; no, it&#8217;s better&#8230;&#8230;. if I&#8217;m the one who did it.&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;That is &#8230; &#8230;.&#8221; (DK)</p>
<p>&#8220;My childhood friend is a Hero &#8230; at the age of 15 she got the Dragon Killer&#8217;s title, but all of it has beed reversed&#8230;..&#8221; (Lt)</p>
<p>&#8220;hmmm?&#8221; (DK) (RAW : Fumu?)</p>
<p>&#8220;- I&#8217;m at least 14 years old and I guess it&#8217;s okay if I can get rid of the evil dragon?&#8221; (Lt) [TN : Gooo my boy!]
<p>Listening to that word, Dragon King gets a shaky expression.</p>
<p>And after a while, Dragon King smiled so gladly.</p>
