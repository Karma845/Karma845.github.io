<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Six Principality</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
were attacked by a Great Bush Wolf and a Bush Wolf, but we successfully
defeated them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
the help of Erio and the other adventurers of his race, we were able to collect
those monster's magic stones we defeated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
give an offer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
almost dark, so we're going to camp here.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
not safe to move around after dark, so as a thank you for saving us from Bush
snake, Great Bush Wolf, and Bush Wolf, we'd like to invite you to stay the
night with us, though we can only offer you camp food and a poor tent.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Bush
snakes aside, the rest we did on our own accord."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
we owe you a thank you for this morning, anyway......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
brother glances sideways at his sister, whose eyes are sparkling.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
sister would love to talk to you about magic......, so please take my
offer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hahaha......
then I'll take your offer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
older brother is weak against the younger sister's wishes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
someone who also has a younger sister, I understand it very well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So I
accepted his offer without hesitation.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
helped them set up their tents and use fallen rocks to make a simple cooking
stove, and introduced ourselves to each other.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
leader of the group is Erio the red-haired, and his sister, Miya the magician.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
are accompanied by their childhood friends. Gimra the frivolous boy and Wardy
the tallest of their group.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
was a rather unique party: one sorcerer and three knights with swords and
shields.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I asked why all the boys were knights with shields and swords.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Because
it's cool to be a knight!" they replied.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
laughed at their answer and said, "Oh, ohoho, I see."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
think they need to think more about their party's member roles and
composition......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
taboo to meddle in other people's parties, so I didn't make any comment.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
put some water, dried meat, dried vegetables, and salt in a pot to simmer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
cooking the simple camp food, I talked with Miya about magic as she requested.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
I couldn't just tell her my true identity as the ruler of the abyss, so I told
her about my fake back-story.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Both
of your parents were magicians? That's why you have such a great talent, isn't
it?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Miya-chan
is also great, still young but already a great magician."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
can't be compared to Dark-san. I can't even use tactical class magic, let alone
use magic without chanting."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There
are basically three types of magic in this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Battle
class, tactical class, and strategic class.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Basically,
the range and power increased from the battle class to the strategy class.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Attack,
defense, recovery, and support are all divided into these classes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
the level rises, those who have the background can learn magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
you are a skilled magician, you will be able to use magic without chanting, but
it takes a lot of effort to reach that level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
addition, there are differences between combat class, tactical class, and
strategic class: low, medium, and high.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
"SR, Firewall" that I used is classified as low tactical level magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'll
also give the definitions for each.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"># </span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Battle
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
spell performed by a single magician.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Fire
arrows, ice arrows, and other attacks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Depending
on the person, the type and number of attributes they can learn may be
different.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Generally,
it is thought that those who focused on one attribute will be more successful
as a specialized type.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"># </span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Tactical class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Basically, it refers to magic that affects
a wide area.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The ability to use this tactical class is
considered to be the obstacle to becoming a "first-class" magician.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Most human can't get past this obstacle.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The dragon race, the elf race, and the
demon race are able to cross this obstacle.</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"># Strategic
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Meteorites
falling from the sky, tsunamis, earthquakes causing cracks in the ground, etc. This
is magic that have greater affects than the tactical class.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is why it is called strategic class.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is possible for multiple people to chant and combine their magic power to
release it, but because it is an advanced technology and extremely costly, it
is a magic that is rarely practiced in other nations besides the human and
beast races.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(In
addition, my magic teacher, Ellie, the Forbidden Witch, can use the Extreme
Class, which is even higher than the Strategic Class. This is an unknown class,
so she's told me not to talk about it on the surface world.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
the highest level, you can revive the dead (with many conditions), summon
angels the messenger of the God, and even connect space to other dimension.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Even
Ellie, the "Forbidden Witch" who has mastered magic, can only use it
once a day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is why it is an extreme level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
the way, I raised my level to 9999 by using this extreme level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(Raising
my level was so difficult......) she can't help but take a distant look.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Erio
patting Miya's head to comfort her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't know much about magic, but Miya is talented enough to got a
recommendation to attend magic school in the principality, so don't be
discouraged."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Oh,
big brother, don't pat my head, you'll ruin my hair."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
shyly wriggled away from her brother's skinship.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
principality is a state funded and managed the six species with the dragonmen
race in charge at the top.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Its
official name is Six Principality. Principality for short.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is one of the most prosperous countries in this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">And
the dragonmen race calls their country the "Dragon Newt Empire".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
Principality is treated as their colony, so they call themselves the Dragon
Newt Empire.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Every
few years, representatives of the human, beastmen, dragonmen, elves, dwarves,
and demons gather in the Principality for a meeting and to make decisions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
magic school in the Principality is one of the best.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
seems to be a really talented magician to get a recommendation to attend that school.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FwYpR1H/000021.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"But
my parents died of an epidemic and we couldn't pay the tuition fees, so she had
to quit from the magic school... I started work as adventurers together with my
sister and my childhood friends. My goal is to earn money as an adventurer to
send Miya to a magician school in the Principality. "</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
will be 13 this year.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Erio
and the others are fifteen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is believed that the earlier you start studying, the better you will be at
magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A few
years delay is a loss, but it's not a loss that can't be made up for.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hey,
hey, leader. That' what we dream about, right?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">".............</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gimra
smiled and meddle with him, and Wardy nodded silently.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
responded to all three of them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
just happy to be together like this with you all. Onii-chan and the others
please don't over exert yourself."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
know. I won't do anything reckless."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Once
again, the brother is patting his sister's head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
time, Miya was not reluctant to accept her brother's hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">To
change the gloomy atmosphere, Erio switch the topic.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
the way, Dark-san and the others, why did you become adventurers?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Well,
my lord parents took very good care of me and Nemumu. However, a fire killed
them both, and my Lord suffered severe burns on his face....... We became
adventurers to find potions and medicines to heal the burns, and to help my
Lord gain more experience."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
told them the story that we had arranged in advance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
"SSR, Mask of the Clown" has an illusion and recognition blocking
effect.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
the power of the illusion, it can make I look as if my face has been badly
burned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
was also the reason why I wore the mask and disguised my appearance.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
Erio's question, the frivolous Gimra raised his hand and ask a question.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hey,
hey!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Can
I ask you a question too? Are Gold-san and Nemumu-san lovers?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Like
a young girl Miya's eyes light up at this love story question, and Wardy quietly
pays attention.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
the way, I told them that I'm twelve years old, Nemumu is eighteen, and Gold is
in his late twenties.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
makes a bitter and disgusted face at his question, as if she has chewed up
10,000 worms.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
have no interest in such a vulgar man in his shiny gold armor. He looks stupid and
has bad taste. Absolutely impossible."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Wahahaha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'm
sorry, but I'm also not interested in tiny breasts!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
prefer older, mature women who look good in gold!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Who's
has tiny breasts?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I told you I'm normal!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu's
face turns red; she feels annoyed and punches Gold who sitting next to her in
the shoulder.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Putting
her reaction aside, she couldn't help but complain at Gold's reply.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Heee,
Gold like that kind of women. I didn't know that."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Well,
it's not like I was trying to hide it, but I don't need to tell anyone."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Then,
Nemumu-san, how about me?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
thank you. I have a noble mission to protect Dark-sama."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya's
eyes light up even more at this response, and she looks at me and Nemumu, who are
sitting next to each other.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
a love story with an age gap. It's so beautiful."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
don't have that kind of relationship, but.......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Before
I can deny it, Gold smiles broadly and waves his hands in front of his face.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Wahaha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No,
no. My Lord is too good for tiny breasts like Nemumu!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
told you! Normal! I'm normal! You shiny bastard!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu,
really angry at his comment. She stands up and pulls out a knife and uses the
handle to hit Gold's head with it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
it had no effect. I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I mean.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
Erio the leader of the group was rather flustered by this situation and
apologizes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
sorry. One of our party members said something rude!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
no, don't worry about it. Rather, I'm sorry for the commotion."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
we apologize to each other, the camp pot started to boil. </span></p></div>
