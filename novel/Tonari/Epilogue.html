<h2>Epilogue.</h2>

<p>"I said, Hokuto-san."</p><p>Because of the call, I turned my face towards her. Against my wish, who was praying that nothing would happen, she smiled clearly wanting to do something. In short, it was a grin. Like a little devil, everyone who saw it would feel nervous. But for me right now, that expression would only let me express bad hopes. I sensed firsthand that, depending on the answer, I might have more subtle feelings than seeing the confessional scene. Even though I was also thinking of leaving like this, no response after being summoned would make me feel guilty, so I asked again.</p><p>"...What is it?"</p><p>I prayed again that this was just a delusion of being persecuted, and at the same time watched her lightly lift her lips.</p><p>Her lips, which were slightly moist from drinking strawberry milk, slowly parted meaningfully.</p><p>"You may not know it, but I've always liked you."</p><p>A very clear voice entered my body and flowed around my body. Since she was very good at imitating sounds, she didn't joke much, but more like reproducing them.</p><p>"If you can, please go out with me"</p><p>What comes to my mind about this sentence. Since it's my own business, I know that, but I don't want to repeat it. The key point was how far she had read it. Seeing the corners of her mouth slightly arching, I understood that I was thinking about things that were very unfavorable to me.</p><p>"Hey. After hearing this sentence, Hokuto-san originally thought so. Not bad."</p><p>"What's not bad?"</p><p>Since I couldn't understand her intention to say this sentence, it became more and more clear. The feeling similar to her fear that I felt after a long time made my thinking slow down.</p><p>"By the way, that confession, what do you think I answered?"</p><p>"...How do I know this kind of thing?"</p><p>"Sorry. I have someone I like."</p><p>I just take this refusal to confess, a common expression with indifference.</p><p>"Do you care who it is?"</p><p>"I don't care. It doesn't matter who it is."</p><p>"Obviously you care a lot."</p><p>You could tell from her that she was in high spirits without adding any honorifics.</p><p>"Don't even try to be brave huh. As long as they say their favorite person, no matter who, who will care about that since"</p><p>"Although I am very concerned, but do not want to know."</p><p>"......Is that true,"</p><p>Since this is a commonly used sentence for refusal, so the possibility that she doesn't have someone she likes is sufficient. But she is also a high school student. It's no surprise even as a lover to stick with someone I'm not. And, even though we spend less time together, we should be able to continue hanging out as friends. If you are a friend, you must support your friend's love. This should be. It must be so.</p><p>"By the way, the person you like must be very happy."</p><p>"Why do you think like that?"</p><p>"Although it may be a little heavy, it must be a testament to your unanimity&#8230;.isn't it?"</p><p>"I'm glad you can say that, it's just."</p><p>"Just?"</p><p>"...There is no! Let's go buy oranges. Hokuto-san please invite me."</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Back, screaming not to fall. The moment she said the impossible, I immediately grabbed her wrist, which had lost its center of gravity and slowly disappeared from my sight.</p><p>"Listen, didn't I tell you?"</p><p>It might have fallen which made her very embarrassed, and her cheeks were stained cherry red.</p>
