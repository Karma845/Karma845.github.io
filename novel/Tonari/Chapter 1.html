<h2>Chapter 1 Do you like this kind of thing?</h2>

<p>Ever since I became a high school student on library duty day, I felt like my job as a library committee was diminishing. For elementary and junior high school students, although there is a process of returning books to the shelves, since becoming a high school student, it has not been considered a job. Working at the counter, making the monthly newspaper, and carrying out other projects are now the main activities.</p><p>I don't like the job of returning the book. If you want to say it, I'm really bad at finding where to put the book. So far, I think it makes more sense to memorize element tags than to memorize label tags. So when you get sentimental like this, it's the wrong sutra. People don't come here often for twenty minutes after school. As long as you sit quietly at the counter, listen to the BGM playing, and read a book yourself, it will soon be over. Even though people came occasionally, it was just a simple task of reading the barcode and clicking the mouse a few times. Just laugh at the ease of this job.</p><p>I should have spent this precious time smoothly, but why did it become like this.</p><p>"You've been on the library committee since I was in elementary school. You must really like books."</p><p>She stood across from the counter and faced me directly. She&nbsp;once said she could read my mind. Every day since then bothered me a lot. And even this dissatisfaction, she can naturally hear.</p><p>It can be said that it is not sustainable.</p><p>"I do like books, but the reason I became the librarian is because I like the library room."</p><p>If I want to add one more point, a lot of people hate being on a library committee because they have to come all the way to the library every day, so there aren't too many alternatives. I don't want to be naive to fight in the committee election.</p><p>"I won't mention extra things for now. Books occupy most of the library space. Not only do you treat books as a collection of literary works, but you also like them as subjects, don't you?"</p><p>"That's an interesting way of thinking."</p><p>"Your line of thought is even more interesting."</p><p>Her face and voice were devoid of the slightest emotion from start to finish, making me feel like I was not being praised. Since she would read the person's mind after entering a radius of about two meters, she also said that she hoped I wouldn't think bad things about it, but even so, she would still follow me for some reason. Needless to say, this is naturally a problem on my part.</p><p>"Do you like me?"</p><p>"Because as long as I'm by your side, I can't listen to the thoughts of anyone other than you."</p><p>"That's ridiculous. I don't think I have the ability to resemble the protagonist of a light novel."</p><p>"I don't know anything about light novels, so I won't touch on that topic. If you really think I'm a problem, shouldn't you kick me out?"</p><p>What was she planning for me to do to get her to say something like "run away for a life of shelter"? Not just "run", but "run for my beloved life". Even silly things have a limit.</p><p>"I'm a man"</p><p>"Your real thoughts?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Actually, you don't want to get into trouble. So you don't want to make enemies especially after doing something to me. I think this is a good mindset."</p><p>This is the worst. Not only had all my thoughts been read out, but she had even said them out loud. I didn't say anything to refute at all, so I just sighed.</p><p>"I'm sure you of all people should know that it's best not to make enemies, right?"</p><p>"Who are you possibly talking about?"</p><p>"That is you"</p><p>"Forgive me "</p><p>I don't know what she likes, but she still laughs happily. Obviously, she always has no expression on her face, but she often laughs in front of me. This even contributed to my misunderstanding that she might like me. It is not good.</p><p>Even if laughed at. appropriate. Regardless of the words or abilities, although they are not that unpleasant, but even so, I don't want to accept them, but I don't really hate them. Is it because she's beautiful?</p><p>"Thank you very much"</p><p>It would be better not to ask.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"The desire to keep beautiful things as they are is an unchanging and eternal desire."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>"Yes, I see."</p><p>With how pretty her face is, I'm sure she has received a lot of hate from girls, and I'm sure there are many men who make her the target of their desires and lusts.</p><p>"If you only count those who act directly, the number of women is around 50 or 60, and the number of men is about six."</p><p>"Hold on. Isn't the ratio of women to men here obviously weird."</p><p>"Because when I was in the second grade of junior high school, I was the enemy of all the girls in the class"</p><p>"Is it some kind of battle royal?"</p><p>If this is the case, I'm sure she's worried she won't be able to leave the table lightly. I can't help but think that this is a tragic thing called "It's good to be indifferent".</p><p>"I really like your face Hakuto-san"</p><p>"You don't have to pity me"</p><p>"Why are you being so cold to me? I didn't mean it. However, after bringing up this topic, it's very rare for me to get a reaction as weak as yours."</p><p>"I'm just not interested."</p><p>However, it might be something akin to a girl in the middle of class setting her eyes on a boy, but this boy confessed to someone else, so she hated her&nbsp;for that. Girls at that age like anything and everything to do with love, and they want to date other guys without thinking too much about it.</p><p>"Even though you say that I'm not interested, the accusations are accurate. You're absolutely right. That period of time was like hell."</p><p>"So, what do you want to say in the end?"</p><p>"Fine, well. Because this is what I can say. This is a funny story I can tell you."</p><p>Funny story, yes.</p><p>"Can I keep talking?"</p><p>"... please speak"</p><p>"Because I already knew that the girl liked him, so I turned down her&nbsp;request for a date. But even so, I still can't believe I found trash in my bag."</p>

<p>"I guess the fact that he likes you doesn't suit her."</p><p>"I only have the advantage of appearances. And that girl should have many other advantages."</p><p>Even though the content was decisive, she closed her&nbsp;eyes in great sadness.</p><p>"I'm so sad."</p><p>"Why. Wasn't she the one who bullied you?"</p><p>"Because she helped me in the past."</p><p>I still don't know, don't understand her&nbsp;mind. However, even if I don't understand, I still have words to say.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Don't call it a funny story."</p><p>The expression disappeared from her&nbsp;face.</p><p>"Does that make you uncomfortable?"</p><p>"You yourself told the story in such a sad and painful tone, so how could you call it a funny story"</p><p>"...I will remember it in the future"</p><p>I can't read her&nbsp;feelings, nor can I read anything on her&nbsp;face. But I always think about it by accident, her face is so pretty. In this way, I am unable to understand the thoughts of those who have jealousy or admiration for them. Although there is a personal difference between preference and scope, people always like beautiful things. If something goes wrong, it will naturally confuse feelings.</p><p>"If you say that humans like beautiful things, then me being right next to you would be a wonderful thing, wouldn't it?"</p><p>"Impossible. I said, didn't I? I don't want to make everyone an enemy."</p><p>My friendships are already very narrow, and I'm even more unlikely to make enemies.</p><p>"It will be fine. Please look over there."</p><p>Her gaze shifted to my back. Looking back, I saw the teacher from the Secretary looking here anxiously. The heavy dictionary was held in her&nbsp;hand like a shield. Even if it was, I could sense that she was frightened.</p><p>"I don't even need to read the teacher's mind. 'Kisaragi Nao is a person who knows what other people think.' This has spread throughout the school. Therefore, what is conveyed here is neither jealousy nor admiration, but fear. Probably not. anyone will show hostility towards Hokuto-san"</p><p>"...ha ha"</p><p>"I go first. Please follow me faster. Then, excuse me."</p><p>Even so, this still didn't change the fact that this was a troublesome matter, and she refused to realize it. After lowering her&nbsp;head slightly, she quickly left the room.</p><p>"Usami-kun. You can go today."</p><p>Whispered the teacher and trembled. Kisaragi-san once said that there was no need to read her&nbsp;mind. In fact it is, now even I can tell what the teacher is basically trying to say. That's "scared". Sentences like that alone were unacceptable, if everyone's minds could be read, then she would be bathed in words that were hard to hear. That's not her intention, but she couldn't resist it.</p><p>"I understand. In that case, excuse me."</p><p>After placing several heavy backpacks on my back, I walked out of the library.</p><p>She was standing at the door. She sighed a little.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to come with me obediently"</p><p>"It has nothing to do with you, I just think it's time to go back"</p><p>"Is that so. I remember the way back is to go from the main entrance right? Up halfway, we can go together?"</p><p>"Even if I refuse, you will follow me with the excuse that you won't hear anything by my side."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Why are you so happy?"</p><p>"There is no!"</p><p>A loud voice, echoed in the noisy corridor.</p><p>She stood in front of me as if she had suddenly jumped out on the first day we met.</p><p>[I've always felt that the expression 'white as snow' refers to the dead. But, as it turned out, the slightly exposed white skin of a well-fitting uniform could even make one realize that a living human could wear it. instead, it's like every corner shines, which shows its refreshing and smooth texture. Judging by her length, in animation, as a heroine, she is perfect for some "wow" things. What comes out of her beautiful cherry -colored lips is&nbsp; a monotone and non-emotional sound. She also said that she could read my mind. Such a thing is impossible. Here it is. It was called 'Even though she has the potential to be a heroine, she became a heroine candidate because of all the effort she has put in.' There was no way to feel that way. Even though I don't know the direction of the last wind in the world, at least, he's not mine. If possible, go to someone else instead of me.]</p><p>This is unbelievable. You have to ask me something unbelievable, that is, she not only read my mind, but also told me this disgusting feeling firsthand. This is really embarrassing. It's so embarrassing that I even want my existence to disappear on the spot.</p><p>"How about, do you trust me a little bit?"</p><p>Contrary to what I thought, she seemed to think everything was fine. She was still looking at me without changing her&nbsp;facial expression.</p><p>"Forgive me."</p><p>"When you apologized to me, it was actually quite embarrassing."</p><p>"Although you may be right, there's nothing I can do about it."</p><p>"By the way, what does that &#8220;fwoosh-ing&#8221; mean?"</p><p>"I am so sorry. Please don't mind that, really."</p><p>Not only did I stare at other people, but I also used the word disgusting to describe them, which would be disgusting no matter who it was. I originally thought that the idea wouldn't be read out, but in fact, it could be said that it wasn't good at all to describe it in more exaggerated words than usual.</p><p>"...For you to retreat to this level, as a person who reads your mind, I feel very ashamed."</p><p>"You just agreed to my provocation. I really feel sorry."</p><p>"Compared to this, don't you feel scared?"</p><p>"After hearing from other people, I finally feel that my disgusting thoughts are scarier than anything in this world."</p><p>"I do not mean it. I can actually read people's minds."</p><p>I just realized this now. What she said was reality without a trace of lies. But if I'm not afraid of danger, I'm not so afraid. On the contrary, I sympathize with her.</p><p>"Isn't that very difficult?"</p><p>She didn't say anything. She probably didn't expect to receive such a reply. Since she asked if I was scared in the first place, that is to say, she was told that this incident was scary. Why would someone who is afraid to read other people's ideas tell the truth?</p><p>"Because it sounds like people are talking in their brains, so to think it's just rude is an understatement."</p><p>"Now you can read my mind, right?"</p><p>"Yes. From what you thought of running away from me, I'm very sorry. But I plan to stay beside you for a while."</p><p>"...Hah?"</p><p>Not good. I do not know why.</p><p>"Even if I say I hope you can find someone else?"</p><p>"Even though you said that. No one can replace Hakuto-san. Within two meters of your radius, that's where I'll be from now on."</p><p>She selfishly declared her&nbsp;will. Even though I thought she would say this was a joke shortly after, she asked me "how". I didn't think so much.</p><p>What I care about is the distance.</p><p>"I don't know if I should say it's wide or narrow, it's really an inexplicable distance..."</p><p>Compared to this, I always feel that I haven't heard the word "radius" for a long time.</p><p>Although this did not interfere with her&nbsp;personal space, she firmly stood in a realm that would immediately disturb people if she took a step from there.</p><p>"By the way, why is it me?"</p><p>"Because you know that my abilities are not fake."</p><p>"Isn't that what you told me!?"</p><p>"The result is the same. In that case, please let me know."</p><p>"Even if you continue your own topic, I will. Very problematic."</p><p>Contrary to what I said, she slightly raised the corner of her&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>"You want to come back soon&#8230; and play a game of galge?"</p><p>"Hah?"</p><p>Because it was something I didn't expect, so I couldn't hold back a strange cry from my mouth.</p><p>"Would you prefer a girl who was both obedient and cheerful to yourself as your sister? That makes sense. I really can't be a heroine. But I'm sorry. Still, can you stay with me for a bit?"</p><p>She stretched out her&nbsp;hand following the polite words. In her eyes that had been chattering in an even tone, "If you refuse, do you know what will happen?" Pressure seeps out. And even the so-called time period she said was unbelievable.</p><p>"By all means, please."</p><p>"Yes. Same here, I will be in your care."</p><p>But I had no choice but to lend a hand.</p><p>"As a thank you, do you want me to call you "Onii-chan"? "</p><p>"I refuse."</p><p>"Oh, too bad"</p><p>Her soft tone is very similar to the character in my favorite game, but because her face and voice are inconsistent, my brain is in a state of chaos.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Cursed notebook</h3><p>"I have a cursed notebook."</p><p>"...hah?"</p><p>I couldn't answer for a moment. Even if someone told me they had a cursed notebook, what else could I say but say, "I see." I didn't think she would lie, but I slightly felt that I shouldn't say such nonchalant words. But since the deal was done, I couldn't hide my confusion.</p><p>"That's really disrespectful."</p><p>Even though she was so cute with her disgruntled face and puffy cheeks, it shouldn't be the time to be thinking that now.</p><p>"Because your existence is a fantasy, you know?"</p><p>"Neither I nor this notebook are fantasy. Please have a look. These are actual notes."</p><p>She put it on the table while saying it. It was a notebook with a plain cover. Since I used it myself, I can only find it very ordinary.</p><p>"&#8230;May I touch it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>I took the notebook in my hand and confirmed it. No matter it is on the front cover or back cover, no name and textbook name is used on it. This can be seen from the little black stains that come out of the white paper used in this notebook. At first glance, it really doesn't make people think that this is a cursed note.</p><p>"Where's the curse record?"</p><p>"Please open and see."</p><p>As she said, I opened the notebook. I fell silent. In it, I don't know how many B pencils wrote someone's name. I couldn't help but make a strange sound, and even throw the note away. And she carefully picked up the object that fell on the ground.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>My hands are shaking. I feel more scared than before.</p><p>"I told you, didn't I? This is a cursed notebook."</p><p>"Uh, I know this."</p><p>"Please be careful. Since this is a lost item, you will have to give it to someone temporarily."</p><p>"Well, aren't you a brave one!??"</p><p>If she finds out someone has read the contents, I don't know what will happen to those people.</p><p>"By the way, do you know whose notebook this is?"</p><p>"Yes. There are people in the class who only think about the person written in this notebook. That person must be the owner, right?"</p><p>"Since you already know who it is, don't you just leave it on the table?"</p><p>"Without writing the notebook's name back there herself, I think she will be able to judge me according to her&nbsp;own inner thoughts to send back. After all, it must be known that indirect will be safer."</p><p>so.</p><p>"Perhaps, it should be like this."</p><p>And from her words, it could be seen that the person who made this thing must be a girl. But I don't want to know at all.</p><p>"Compared to these things, why do you want to show me. To scare me?"</p><p>"No, I didn't expect Hakuto-san to be so scared. Sorry."</p><p>She really didn't seem to be expecting that, she bent her&nbsp;head over to me.</p><p>"&#8230;You don't need to apologize to me. If possible, I would like you to tell the story before and after."</p><p>When I said this, she lifted her&nbsp;face.</p><p>"Things I wanted to say before and after the fall anyway, they're just things I've heard even to that point and will definitely be different from reality, even then you should listen to them?"</p><p>After all, things were terrible until the last sequence. Knowing it wasn't actually terrible. Now that I know some, it's hard to stop there.</p><p>"Then my first question is, why do you want to show this to me?"</p><p>"I shared it because I was afraid of being cursed alone!"</p><p>This excuse is terrible.</p><p>"What should I do if I get cursed too?"</p><p>"Although I don't know the principle of the curse, as long as two people see it, the two of us will definitely only be half cursed."</p><p>"I&#8230; it definitely doesn't work like that&#8230;!"</p><p>I didn't care what to do after being cursed, she looked like she was thinking about something. She glanced at me. She must have been denying the "I'm not pretending" in her&nbsp;heart. Even being stared at by her&nbsp;wasn't scary. She sighed, then she spoke.</p><p>"I don't think that a curse can be placed on you, even if it is cursed, it should only be the person who writes the note on the right. I believe you will be fine. So do you have any other questions?"</p><p>Whether it's fine or not, there's no way to fight the curse. I have no choice but to think about my next action.</p><p>"By the way, do you know who the record belongs to through the mind of the owner who reads this letter? Then why did you pick it up again?"</p><p>"If a note falls in the corridor, anyone will pick it up."</p><p>"Then those people will open it?"</p><p>"Aren't there some people who write their names on the cover paper."</p><p>Although I can't think of such a person, judging from her&nbsp;very firmly, it must be there. Ever since this notebook appeared on stage, I've always heard something that makes people nervous.</p><p>"Then the next step is the topic. Why were these notes made?"</p><p>"Out of jealousy"</p><p>"Jealous"</p><p>"This is the result of not facing hostility towards rivals, but facing records."</p><p>"Why go for a notebook, of all things?"</p><p>"Please think it's better not to face jealous people. This kind of person should be classified as a yandere? Or Menhera?"</p><p>"A person like this? That's outside my area of &#8203;&#8203;expertise."</p><p>"Is that so. Since I don't know, it's still a mystery."</p><p>On the other hand, I still want it to remain a mystery.</p><p>"But, it turned out to be jealous, huh..."</p><p>Even though it was scary, but because the reason was so simple, it was also a relief. After all, I have reached such a point, I think it will be a more complicated reason.</p><p>"After all, it's not a TV series. There won't be such a complicated reason. No, even if it's a TV series, as long as you know the whole picture, sometimes it's very simple."</p><p>Just as I saw her smile, the classroom door opened. Looking over there, you could see the female classmates who were gasping for air were looking here with desperate eyes. She&nbsp;ran over here and took the notebook from the table.</p><p>"&#8230;You saw it?"</p><p>That cold, low voice sent chills down my spine. I wonder how to answer it. But this point in time seems to be the evidence we've seen, even if we answer honestly...</p><p>"We saw it. Sorry."</p><p>Beside me thinking about this reason, Kisaragi-san confessed the truth and lowered her&nbsp;head.</p><p>"Forgive me&#8230;"</p><p>I lowered my head like her.</p><p>"Oh, I see. Then don't tell anyone about it."</p><p>After she said this softly, she immediately left the classroom. I raised my face to match Kisaragi's gaze. I can only sigh.</p><p>"...I can't possibly tell anyone, can I?"</p><p>But her&nbsp;appearance was strange, and she looked up at the sky with an inexplicable melancholy gaze. Now, when did she have such a side to her?</p><p>"It really is an amazing feeling. I can't even see that someone is approaching here."</p><p>"Ah, yes. That's good."</p><p>"Well, that's really great!"</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Orange day</h3><p>A high school girl in front of me was peeling oranges in class. The peeling method is very clean. Maybe she was used to eating it regularly.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to praise my peeling method. Does Hokuto-san want to eat it?"</p><p>She pointed at the table with her&nbsp;gaze. On the table, there were three oranges she had left behind.</p><p>"Uh, not anymore"</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>She stuffed the white orange into her&nbsp;mouth disinterestedly. It must be delicious, she had a small smile on the corner of her mouth.</p><p>"Is it visible?"</p><p>"Yes, it shows."</p>

<p>"Oranges are delicious."</p><p>Even as she said that, she did it one after another, and the orange disappeared into her&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>"Put canned oranges in a container and bring them here, moreover. It's the first time I've seen someone carry an orange with its peel in a container."</p><p>"Is that so. I don't know when I saw someone picking up oranges for lunch."</p><p>"Why is that...... "</p><p>"Maybe that guy's house only has oranges."</p><p>"It really was a very difficult life,"</p><p>"Yeah that's true. Though, I'm not sure if that's really the case."</p><p>She said after that, she held the last orange in her&nbsp;mouth and smiled again.</p><p>"By the way"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>When she reached for the second orange, I changed the subject. The topic has become something I care about her.</p><p>"Does reading other people's minds feel like hearing them in your ears? Or as if it just popped into your head?"</p><p>She looked thoughtful and answered while peeling off her&nbsp;skin. After peeling the skin off, she eats one or two. After holding the third petal in her&nbsp;hand, she spoke again.</p><p>"I'd say it's closer to the brain."</p><p>"Closer?"</p><p>"Yes. Since I thought 'that's how it is', it's hard to describe the feeling. But that's as close to a description I can give you."</p><p>"Like I asked you to explain how to breathe."</p><p>"Breathe?"</p><p>"I mean, it's so obvious it's hard to explain directly."</p><p>"Ah, ah, it has to be. I, it will really be equivalent to breathing. But unlike breathing, even if it is explained to others, other people can't understand."</p><p>That makes sense. Even though I asked out of curiosity, it wasn't a topic that would continue to interest me, so we fell silent. Because of this silence, I remembered about the abilities of the two.</p><p>"I thought of this as I listened."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Doesn't this mean you can cheat on exams all the time?"</p><p>She narrowed her&nbsp;eyes as if to say, "You noticed?" a dark expression crept across her&nbsp;face.</p><p>"Fufu, you noticed that~?"</p><p>Her tone of voice was also like that of a prankster. Because of her rare expression, I couldn't help but be touched. There should be a note at the end of the sentence. After all, she was honestly saying underhanded tricks that would never be exposed, so it looked more like this.</p><p>"But then again, I've never done anything to tackle an exam without studying at all. If I don't understand and just read other people's minds, there's no way of knowing which one is the right answer."</p><p>"Shouldn't you be better at memorizing things?"</p><p>"Right. Because the person sitting in front of me is really good at memorizing things, so it helps me a lot."</p><p>She smiled more deeply than when she ate an orange. Is this really good.</p><p>She said again.</p><p>"Ah, I'm also very good at playing games. Because I haven't been invited recently, so I haven't played. Do you want to play in pairs?"</p><p>I saw Kisaragi-san take out a poker card from her&nbsp;school bag and laugh out loud.</p><p>"The conditions are too unbalanced."</p><p>It's impossible to win. In the battle against people, reading minds and the like is a more practical means than knowing the opponent's hand. Because no matter how you do it, there's no way people don't care about the position of the trump card.</p><p>Thinking about it this way, there were also some places where she could use her&nbsp;abilities effectively. As a result, I'm a little jealous. If used properly, it will definitely help life a lot.</p><p>"No matter what, please don't think about obtaining this ability."</p><p>She giggled. Although it sounded very happy, it also sounded a little helpless. I didn't notice until then. To her, this was not what she wanted.</p><p>"So."</p><p>I am ashamed of my careless thinking.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">On orange jelly day.</h3><p>I gave her&nbsp;a bag of orange jelly. As a result, a line of sight that said "what happened" asked me.</p><p>"If you don't need it, you can throw it away."</p><p>But as soon as she saw the contents inside, she shook her&nbsp;head. Sinces she was showing a happy expression, she had to be willing to accept it.</p><p>"Thank you very much. I basically like citrus-scented things, so I really enjoyed it."</p><p>"Really. That's good."</p><p>She quickly opened the lid, took out the orange jelly, and stuffed it into her&nbsp;mouth. She was eating orange jelly very deliciously. It's really thanks to department stores that put orange jelly in a prominent place.</p><p>"So, how about we go to a cafe selling orange cakes later?"</p><p>I said half jokingly, then she opened her&nbsp;eyes wide in surprise. The hand that was eating the jelly also stopped. Is that very surprising.</p><p>"Is it really okay for you to say that? I will be very calm and look forward to shopping with you."</p><p>"Wait, isn't that bad for you?"</p><p>"I can't hear the voices of the people on the street. It really is. What a beautiful thing,"</p><p>She continued to speak with a serious expression on her&nbsp;face.</p><p>"Ah, I'm going out, so I want to watch a movie by the way. What's being shown in public right now... Is there a movie that Hokuto-san wants to see?"</p><p>She seems to be really looking forward to it. Although I don't know if there's an orange cake in the shop, I said something right, but after seeing such an expression, I wanted to try investigating it.</p><p>"Go to a cafe and watch a movie."</p><p>"Yes. Go after the next exam. Ah, don't worry about the money."</p><p>"I'm not so poor that I have to ask a girl to treat me to a drink."</p><p>"Oh, I see. I am happy."</p><p>"So, may I ask a question first?"</p><p>"Yes, what is it?"</p><p>"Do you believe I can block your ability?"</p><p>"Oh, didn't I say that at first?"</p><p>I felt like she had said it.</p><p>"I ignored it then."</p><p>I also took it before.</p><p>"That's right. This is also a good opportunity. Let me explain."</p><p>She seemed to be in a good mood. She&nbsp;put the jelly container in the corner of the table, took out loose paper and a pen, and began to write What happened. She&nbsp;seemed to explain it to me after she finished it.</p><p>"Now"</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"Although my general ability is said to be reading, but in the end, I know what people are thinking subconsciously. How to say it. It's like being in a family restaurant, although I don't listen, but as long as someone is talking next to me, even if I don't want to, I'll go into my ears, won't I? Like that. And those are all very personal topics. After all, it expresses things of thought at a stage before speaking."</p><p>"If a galge game girl is used as a comparison, it's like being able to see all the possible options, including the very obvious and correct."</p><p>"That's right. This is a good analogy. I gave you Hanamaru for that."</p><p>[note: Hanamaru is a flower seal (equivalent to a gold star given to children for good work in school)]</p><p>I got Hanamaru again after a long time. Since when did I not get Hanamaru? Was it when I was an elementary school student?</p><p>"So it feels like it goes straight into your head. I told you before, right? Do you remember?"</p><p>"Oh, I remember this"</p><p>"Then, after entering your two meter radius, I could hear nothing but your voice. That's a fact."</p><p>"I know it's here."</p><p>Is there anything else besides that?</p><p>"This two meters is Hokuto-san's distance"</p><p>"My distance?"</p><p>"The distance of 'can hear mind' varies from person to person"</p><p>"...This is my first time hearing this."</p><p>This seems very important. content.</p><p>"If there are people who can hear their thoughts at a distance of 50 meters or 100 meters, there will naturally be people like Hokuto-san who can be heard from almost zero distance."</p><p>"Oh, so that's how it works."</p><p>"Yes, although I don't know the exact criteria."</p><p>This did happen. Since no one other than her&nbsp;could understand this, it couldn't be confirmed. I think everyone should be two meters. It seems that reality is noisier than I thought.</p><p>"It would be better if my range of effect was wider."</p><p>"I'm used to it, so there's no problem. And two meters is good enough."</p><p>"...For example?"</p><p>"Sorry, it's a secret."</p><p>I saw her&nbsp;put a finger to her&nbsp;lips, I realized she wasn't going to keep talking, so I gave up and kept asking.</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"That's it, the explanation is done."</p><p>"Ah, so that's all?"</p><p>Even though it started off fiercely, the explanation was very brief. In the end, blank paper and pens were not used.</p><p>"By the way, I want to talk about shopping."</p><p>"You really want to go."</p><p>Ah, looks like she wants to use it here. And she has written a lot. She&nbsp;seemed to be writing as we spoke. Was she looking forward to it a little too much?</p><p>"Wherever you want to go, that's fine. We can combine our ideas into one schedule."</p><p>"This is really wise! Then, once the exam is over, we'll decide on the details."</p><p>Seeing her&nbsp;show a deeper face than the last joke, After a happier smile, I can't help but look forward to it.</p><p>"I'm looking forward to it"</p><p>"Well, me too"</p><p>-</p><p>After returning home, I confirmed that no one was home. After that, I used the phone software to play the radio while playing music with the music player. Finally, I turned on the TV again and kept it like this for five minutes. Even though I wanted to add more sound, I found it very noisy from the first time I heard it. In less than five minutes, the brain begins to creak and scream. Twenty-four hours a day, she listens to voices far beyond this, beyond her&nbsp;own control. If it was me, I definitely wouldn't be able to stand it at all. Even though she had a calm face, she should have pretended to be. Or maybe I don't know when it started, and I feel paralyzed. No matter which one it is, I don't have to understand it.</p><p>I didn't mean to understand. But that's what I said, but because I already know a lot, I care a lot, so I can't back down. but. As long as it doesn't go in a bad direction.</p><p>Naturally, that's good.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Perfect day for reading.</h3><p>Today is work day at the library. Teacher Librarian isn't here because he's gone to a staff meeting. Although for this reason I have to work longer than usual, but as usual, there are no visitors from the library. So today is a good day to learn.</p><p>"What book do you recommend?"</p><p>This should be reading day.</p><p>Due to the sudden voice, I took my eyes off the line of text I was reading. As expected, she was standing in front of me. She turned her&nbsp;hopeful gaze towards me, but because of what she said, even though I was reluctant, I still got up from my seat. Although the saying goes that beautiful women get bored in three days, but I am still very attracted to her beauty.</p><p>Anyway, I think it's a good thing to be interested in books. In this day and age when readers are considered a minority, having the intention to just read is extraordinary.</p><p>"Thank you very much"</p><p>"So, how often does Kisaragi-san study?"</p><p>"Basically, I didn't read it. It's just looking at textbooks."</p><p>Almost zero, then.</p><p>"What kind of stories do you like?"</p><p>"I don't really like anything."</p><p>"In that case, do you have anything that you are not good at?"</p><p>"I don't have anything like that either. Even if I had to say it, I'm not good at classical literature in general."</p><p>"I didn't think I would just recommend classical literature all of a sudden."</p><p>Even though people who like it will really like it, since I don't really like it, I'll only read it when I'm studying.</p><p>"Is the book interesting?"</p><p>Suddenly, her&nbsp;gaze fell on the book I was holding. For her&nbsp;to see this simple cover clearly, I placed it in front of me.</p><p>"Even though I only watched half of it, it was really interesting."</p><p>"Oh, what's the story?"</p><p>"It's about a murderous woman who runs into an ordinary man's house. The killer's appearance is very attractive."</p><p>I said as I opened the book and opened the illustration with an assassin appearing on the scene.</p><p>"Wearing a coat on the outside, wearing a winter tracksuit underneath, and wearing a face mask with a doll's head. Seems like a suspicious person."</p><p>"After all, it is a killer, and it is more than suspicious."</p><p>Because she laughed a little, so she must have understood something.</p><p>The book itself is relatively thin, and the content is not esoteric, so it should be easy to read. I remember that there must be another copy that is exactly the same. I found it off the shelf and gave it to her.</p>

<p>"How?"</p><p>She turned the pages of the book, and nodded after confirming its contents.</p><p>"Well, I'll just take this one."</p><p>With this sentence, I immediately felt relieved. If you want to keep talking about the contents of this book, it really is endless and endless. For otaku, this character is not good.</p><p>"I care about that. Please tell me next time."</p><p>"You would definitely hate it, so I turned it down."</p><p>"I won't hate it."</p><p>"Who knows?"</p><p>"Because I think Hokuto-san's thoughts that I've heard so far are very interesting, so it should be fine."</p><p>Even though she immediately stood up. Thumb said there was no problem, but it would definitely be a problem for me, so I decided to ignore it.</p><p>"&#8230;Ah, do you have a student card?"</p><p>"I have it, what should I do?"</p><p>When I returned to the counter, I took the student card from her.</p><p>"I need to use it when I borrow books. Lend me a little."</p><p>Even though the small image pasted on the student card appeared in my eyes, right now, my consciousness shouldn't have shifted to that. After reading the barcode on the student ID, the borrowed and returned book data appears on the computer. After reading the barcode on the book and confirming the loan, the job is done.</p><p>"This barcode turned out to be useful."</p><p>While she was looking at the returned student card with great interest, she said in a low voice, leaving me speechless. real or fake.</p><p>"When I first entered school, someone should have explained it when I visited the library for the first time."</p><p>"There is no such thing in my memory."</p><p>"&#8230;How many students like that are there?"</p><p>"There should be a lot, right?"</p><p>Just as I was about to be surrounded by indescribable sadness, an idea flashed through my mind that could take advantage of this tragic scene.</p><p>"If you knew how to use barcodes in the library, wouldn't everyone come to the library?"</p><p>"I thought it would end with "Oh, that's great"."</p><p>She would never transmit it normally, the emotion in the voice, but the emotion and tone was very high. It hit the mark, and I laughed helplessly. The faint sadness that would surround me now surrounds me. And she just returned to class with a satisfied face.</p><p>As usual, nothing came from the library.</p><p>It really is a perfect reading day.</p><p>*</p><p>After leaving the task on the table, I cleared the things off the table of useless things. This is to put down the book that was recommended to me by Hokuto-san who might also be reading right now. I slowly took the book out of my school bag, as if I was tending ceramics, and placed it carefully.</p><p>Save it, I take deep breaths to calm the rapid pulse of the arteries.</p><p>"So..."</p><p>The title is called 'One Sun Ahead is Darkness' I think it's a title taken from the saying that "the future is unpredictable". From the simple cover, the illustration of the killer, and the explanation, I couldn't imagine what this story would be like.</p><p>Why did Hokuto-san take this book and read it again, and what will he think after reading it? And what will I think when I finish reading. Not the contents of the book, but this kind of thing slowly appeared in my mind. Can I imagine the same scene with her. Can you get the impression that you can talk to her? Not only the people around me, but I, who read very little, probably couldn't imagine anything. And I'm afraid of this, so I know that I haven't opened the book yet.</p><p>"...Haa"</p><p>She said. "Just want to read it, it can be said to be very rare." And she smiled a little at me, who was determined to read the book.</p><p>I couldn't accept that I couldn't respond to her&nbsp;expectations, and I was also very scared.</p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p>I always felt that even if I thought or thought nothing of it, she wouldn't show a bothersome expression. In that case, I want her&nbsp;to have a good impression of me. I have thought more than once, this should not be done. I held both ends of the book I wanted to read, and it was impossible to turn the pages of the book from there.</p><p>In this way, tomorrow will be the day of book return. If you don't read it now, it will cause problems for the next person to read it. I want to avoid this at all costs.</p><p>"...Okay!"</p><p>And I decided to open the book. Turned the page with the title written on it, and after scrolling through the table of contents, she turned her&nbsp;attention to the text.</p><p>The main text mainly consists of dialogue between an older sister who calls herself a murderer, the owner of the room she enters, and a young man dressed as an illustration. As Hokuto-san said, it's very easy to read, and the dialogue between two people who have no contact in daily life can't help but sink into it.</p><p>But as I read, I couldn't help but think, could it be that Hokuto-san's friend likes an older woman like this. However, what the woman in the illustration emphasizes is that her appearance is very young, she tends to like younger but mature girls.</p><p>No, again, he would most likely only show love to women in this second dimension. Although I can't understand the feeling, I know that some people have this hobby. I can't guarantee that Hokuto-san isn't like that.</p><p>If so, then I.</p><p>As a student at the same level, didn't I get into her&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>As soon as I started thinking, my brain started spinning, and the contents of the book didn't enter my mind at all. In my grief, I decided to wait until my brain calmed down before borrowing and rereading it.</p>
