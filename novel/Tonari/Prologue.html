<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>"Good morning!"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Good morning from the new semester starts in the morning, your thoughts are pretty good."</p><p>&#8220;Because of the new semester ah! Anyway, if we go up to second grade we can also be in the same class okay!&#8221;</p><p>"Well spoken. The class schedule seems to have been posted, let's go and see it together."</p><p>(Why do I have to be in the same class as you for two years straight? I really can't accept it! Ah, if there is a god, I wish it was please put me and this person in a different class!)</p><p>(Wow, it's Kisaragi-san. Eeh, did she hear the things I'm thinking right now. Although not believing that things like supernormal phenomena would be any better, But after all, it was spread over the school, it should be true... )</p><p>From the class distribution table taped to the front of the shoe cabinet, I could see my name. There was basically no one else with the Kisaragi surname this school year, so it was easy to find. After confirming that I was in the same class as several people last year, I went to the designated class.</p><p>"Oh, good. We seem to be in the same class in second grade. I am very happy."</p><p>"Hah? Who cares about such things.&#8221;</p><p>(Good. Spring break is hard to see, if you don't know what to do if you are in a different class with this guy, it seems that this is an unfounded concern. He will take care of me this year as well)</p><p>(Kisaragi-san is really pretty today...Although there are a lot of rumors about her, and she gives people an atmosphere that is hard to approach, but that's not another good point about her)</p><p>(This class is full of people I don't know... I've formed a small team between acquaintances, and it seems difficult to meet new friends. Take a break. Time seems to be able to go to another class)</p><p>(Finally me and my longtime ex-boyfriend are in the same class! I'm so excited, so I have to work hard this year!)</p><p>After opening the classroom door, accompanied by the sound of the door opening, all the students inside turned their heads to my side. But everyone turned their gaze back as if they didn't see anything.</p><p>(Also in the same class as Kisaragi-san, huh)</p><p>(Meaning, for a year, will she always hear what we think? Wow, I have a bad feeling)</p><p>(Even though she's still incredibly beautiful, she looks like the embodiment of the adage that &#8220;beautiful roses eventually have thorns.&#8221;)</p><p>No, not everyone. Another male classmate turned his attention to my side. But his thoughts didn't reach me, and I didn't know what he was thinking. But then again, even if I say something, it's the same as usual, so I don't care about her, but make sure my own seat is written on the blackboard. My seat seemed to be across from the male classmate earlier. After looking there again, the male student turned his gaze back. This can be taken for granted. To get past it, I stepped away.</p><p>As a result, the brain suddenly becomes silent. The messy thoughts that had been ringing so far suddenly stopped, and my brain became extremely clear. It was as if no thoughts had come. However, I heard someone sigh immediately. It was sent by the male student next to me who just turned his back on me later.</p><p>(I didn't know there was such a pretty girl in my class. Even though she's not my type, she must be very popular)</p><p>Only one person echoed in my mind. And that person seems completely ignorant of my business, showing such feelings.</p><p>And the feeling that I haven't experienced in this long returned to its original state when I arrived at my seat.</p><p>I can't think of it as an illusion of mine, and the feeling isn't an exaggeration even if it's described as changing the world. What happens after silence to that level. No, I also found out the reason without knowing it. It must be because of the male classmate who had read in front of me. My sixth sense tells me it must be so. Although I wanted to confirm it right away, walking back and forth seemed suspicious, so I hastily sat down. The length of the sigh from the overflow was enough to see how shaken I was.</p><p>The heartbeat accelerated due to the shock like the "heart of love" I heard from the rumors, and I couldn't help but think, "I hope this feeling won't be passed on to anyone!". "</p><p>Since then, I found out that the name of the male classmate who didn't know about me was 'Usami Hokuto', I knew that he liked to read, and I knew that When I'm by his side, he will treat everything but himself. The flow of thought Knowing that a male high school student is a very valuable existence, driven by curiosity, I decided to approach him.</p><p>"Usami Hokuto"</p><p>After school. I talked to him in class, who was silently reading a book. He slowly lifted his face from the book called "Light Novel". It was one of the volumes in a series of books he had recently read. The content of the story is a story in which a heroine with superpowers and a protagonist who can neutralize them continue to take risks while deepening their bond. When I found out this was content through his thoughts, I felt that it was the same as us, and I couldn't help but scream. I can read other people's minds, and Hakuto-san, the one who can negate my ability to read other people's minds besides his own. Although I'm a little embarrassed, I can't help but look forward to whether we will build a beautiful relationship like the two people in light novels.</p><p>"...Hah?"</p><p>"I can tell what you're thinking."</p><p>He didn't say a word, as if asking, "What is this guy talking about?" Even so, when I turned my gaze to him without backing down, he realized that I didn't mean to leave, so he spoke.</p><p>"...Then, can you guess what I'm thinking right now?"</p><p>"Of course. It could be as long as possible."</p><p>"I know. Then..."</p><p>And the collective thinking has a very interesting feel... While it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what's interesting, in short, it's very interesting to me.</p><p>Even though it took a while, I was determined to become the heroine of the life story named with him as the protagonist. Even though he may be very unsure, he seems to be very gentle, and he won't reject it firmly. I believe everything will be fine.</p>
