<h2>Chapter 5 Can you hear my voice?</h2>

<h3>Friends day</h3><p>In the classroom after school that day, and it was just she and me left. Although I expected someone to bother her this time, it didn't. This must be because he wants her to read other people's minds, but he doesn't want her to know his own.</p><p>"Hokuto-san."</p><p>As usual, she stood up to sit closer to me. And I also stand.</p><p>"Do not move."</p><p>She opened her eyes for a moment.</p><p>"...Is this some kind of coercion?"</p><p>Did she think this was a joke, or maybe she wanted to think so. A small laugh escaped her mouth. And I shook my head.</p><p>"This is my request. There's something I want to ask you, but I don't want to talk when you read my mind."</p><p>And this is of course just a request, so I can't force it. When I begged her to agree, I looked into her eyes intently. After a moment of silence, she nodded. Then, she kept a little distance from me.</p><p>"So, what do you want to ask?"</p><p>"I just asked you directly. Do you want to let go of the request now?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>She was expressionless and tilted her head.</p><p>"I just felt that Kisaragi-san was just being used just now. Incidents related to love are very dangerous. Nobody knows what will happen."</p><p>There is even a saying that people who interfere with other people's relationships should be divided by five horses. It would be best to close it as soon as possible while everything can be restored.</p><p>"Of course, I was the one who caused this situation. I apologize to you. Sorry."</p><p>I lowered my head until she said, "please raise your head". And I raised my head as she said, then I continued.</p><p>"If something happens, let me be your supporter. So"</p><p>"I understand"</p><p>"If you can understand, I will very... oh, you understand?"</p><p>"Yes, I understand."</p><p>Due to the unexpected response, I couldn't help but ask back. I thought she would be entangled for a while, so when I got a response so quickly, I felt a little frustrated.</p><p>"Because I thought it was for Hokuto-san, so I accepted this order."</p><p>"Hah"</p><p>Is it because I received the order in advance?</p><p>"But if the most important Hokuto-san says that he doesn't want to do this, that's another matter. I immediately apologize carefully to the few people who got the contact address and conveyed the meaning of refusal."</p><p>She says this and takes out the cell phone. Then she started tapping the touch screen rapidly. I stared blankly at this scene, which was exactly like a high school student. In the end, perhaps after contact, she put her cell phone back in her school bag. After I confirmed that she put the phone back down, she spoke slowly.</p><p>"You really are honest"</p><p>"Because after reading other people's minds, there will be more things I don't understand, so this isn't what I want to do."</p><p>I remember her saying this when she was assigned earlier. But she doesn't care about this, but does it. And that reason is me?</p><p>"It's not a problem for me because it's really my fault."</p><p>After I understood everything, seeing her appearance made me feel even more guilty. Obviously, for this reason, she would definitely lose her reputation.</p><p>"It's fine. Only I received, so I'm in charge. But it's very difficult. Summoned for who did what?"</p><p>She laughed in confusion, suddenly as if thinking of something. Sparkling eyes.</p><p>"By the way"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Can I almost sit next to you?"</p><p>Just giving her permission made my heart beat slowly.</p><p>"...Please, sit."</p><p>Why would she just sit next to me her eyes would sparkle. Of course. Because as long as you're with me, other people's thoughts won't enter her brain.</p><p>But what about now?</p><p>"Because we are friends"</p><p>"Because we're friends?"</p><p>"Yeah... Ah, I have something to say. The little shop has orange snacks. It's delicious!"</p><p>"That was really great."</p><p>It's really, really big.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Support day</h3><p>"Why are you in front of my eyes every time, every time, when I realize it!? You stand out so much!!"</p><p>Accompanied by a roar of anger, it was heard. Just when I thought something was wrong, Hiten appeared in front of me who was about to return.</p><p>"Nao got the girls entangled. Only you can help her"</p><p>He whispered to me, then I was dragged away by him and taken to the classroom where it happened. On the opposite side of the door, Kisaragi-san fell to the ground. It was pushed by the girl with her back to this side. She said too much to Kisaragi-san, and even made her shoulders shake. And the surroundings sent me here and let me block my view. This guy is really overdoing it, really. They paid no attention to me on the cause of the incident.</p><p>As usual Kisaragi-san, her face was expressionless.</p><p>No. She showed an expression of sorrow for the person in front of her. I've seen that before. That's the look in Kisaragi-san's eyes when she mentions the past in the library and remembers the person who hurt her. Back then, it was because of jealousy that she had that experience, and this incident, perhaps because her actions were like falling in love with Cupid this time. Thinking will not want to understand, this will only let go of the opportunity to move forward, letting thinking start to escape from reality.</p><p>"You speak!"</p><p>I said to the girl who was about to grab Kisaragi-san's collar while saying this.</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>She turned and looked at me. I think I've seen it from somewhere. But I don't remember who it was. And while she was in a daze, I barged into the middle of Kisaragi-san and her.</p><p>"I don't understand the reason, but I'm here to apologize. But after all, it's not a matter of using force, is it?"</p><p>"You guys who aren't even boyfriends, I don't care!"</p><p>Why is she mentioning girlfriend now?</p><p>"My friend is being molested by you. My classmate of the same level is being molested by you. I just stopped her."</p><p>Even though this was true, it was a sentence that made people itch all over after saying it. As for the word for a classmate of the same level, the girl strained her face.</p><p>"You are not lovers!? So what! Why are you protecting that woman!!"</p><p>These words were spoken word by word, and finally turned into a choke. Kneeling on the ground, she threw away the friends gathered around her because they were worried about her.</p><p>"Isn't that reason enough as a friend?"</p><p>"Isn't that a common problem! You may not remember from your tone of voice, but my name is Sato Yuna!"</p><p>No wonder I felt as if I had seen it from somewhere. I came here, it should be counterproductive. But now it's too late. She continued to speak with tears on her face.</p><p>"Even if you have a good impression of you, you don't accept my thoughts! But you're stuck with a woman who isn't even a lover! What's with me!? You can explain!!!"</p><p>Is she right? Are you serious? The feeling she had was truly pitiful.</p><p>"I hate people who are rude to people. And now, I'm more sure why it can't be your cause."</p><p>Then, the class fell silent. Even the sound of her sobs stopped. She must never have expected that I would answer so clearly.</p><p>"&#8230;Can you stand?"</p><p>While I couldn't stand the silence, I extended my hand to Kisaragi-san. I saw her stand up and reach out to Sato Yuna, but she threw it away. She stood alone.</p><p>"Who can call the teacher?"</p><p>Many people were relieved by what Kisaragi-san said. Even Hiten showed a confused expression. real or fake. She should have called the teacher before me, right?</p><p>"If you don't ask the teacher to come over, forget it. Yuna-san, let's clear the table. Since we are playing a game, the table is very neatly laid out for nothing."</p><p>At Kisaragi-san's resolute figure, Sato Yuna cried again. This time she was taken care of by her friends. Therefore, I cannot ignore it. I also started helping Kisaragi-san and moved the table back to its original position.</p><p><br /></p><p>"We still have a bit further than that."</p><p>"If you feel responsible for this incident, beside me. As a friend to protect me."</p><p>"Ah ha ha"</p><p>"If you hate it, forget it."</p><p>Her self-deprecating smile made me so heartbroken. She said that because she knew I wouldn't refuse. She is a very bad woman. And I have to be a really bad person with her like that. The so-called gathering of things is really good. The bell sounded to announce the end of the fourth class.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The day the note was thrown</h3><p>Now it's lunch break. After confirming that the teacher in charge of this class was out, I released my strength and leaned back on the chair. Although there will be a feeling of sleepiness after lunch, it is not comparable to the hunger that hit before lunch.</p><p>bang</p><p>There was the sound of something being thrown. The classroom was completely different from now, and filled with tension. The hand I reached out to take out the bento was immediately withdrawn.</p><p>"Do you know this?"</p><p>After looking in the direction of the voice, I saw a man I had never seen before standing in front of Kisaragi-san's chair. Judging by the color of the indoor shoes, he should be senpai. The surroundings were divided into people who were watching while terrified, people who seemed to be saying that they didn't want to get into trouble, and people who pretended not to see it. I remember the conversation I told her the other day. To protect her, I slowly stood up from where I was.</p><p>"If you can read other people's minds, you should be able to know what I want to say."</p><p>Kisaragi-san didn't answer. She looked straight into the man's face. Sadness reappeared in her expression. Depending on the angle, it can also be considered a pity. I don't know how the man understands, he continued in an uneasy tone.</p><p>"I heard you're holding this notebook. If this thing is yours, let's have a little talk."</p><p>What do you want to say. Use that attitude to persecute her, even if it's coercion. But Kisaragi-san's expression remained unchanged, and she still didn't speak.</p><p>"Even if you make a mistake, you should know who wrote this, right? Tell me now."</p><p>"I won't say it"</p><p>But this is the last word hateful. Her statement confirmed that she knew who it was. This angered the other party even more.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Since I agree, I won't say it."</p><p>She's very honest in strange places. It was originally the fault of the person who made the notebooks and brought them to school and didn't manage them properly. But this is the situation after all. Her opponent was a powerful ancestor. What should I do if I moved like this before. I don't have the confidence to beat him.</p><p>"Don't you think the nature of this notebook is different when you look at it?"</p><p>The eyes around me seemed to be urging me out.</p><p>"I think so, but people think they themselves are different, it's hard to say, then everyone's nature is different. If you take that pain, then let me get rid of it?"</p><p>I don't care if my situation improves for some reason, but Kisaragi-san tilts her head.</p><p>"I didn't mean to say this!!!"</p><p>He impatiently pounded Kisaragi-san's desk. Even though Kisaragi-san's shoulders were shaking, for this reason, Kisaragi-san was even more expressionless. Because of that, he was even more unwilling to throw the table aside. Judging that the situation wouldn't get any better if I continued to watch it, I broke through them.</p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p>To protect her, I spread my arms and stand between them.</p><p>"Ah? The pest that always stands by Nao's side."</p><p>I, originally known like this.</p><p>"Why? Why can you use that power to help with love matters, but not help me in this matter? How exactly do you tell the difference?"</p><p>I didn't speak, but gave him the right to speak, and I know the general idea because of this. He wanted Kisaragi-san to continue doing her cupid-like work. Because the school year is different, the speed of information transmission will slow down, so it's impossible.</p><p>So, how to fight.</p><p>"I know who the notebook belongs to. Even though I also kept it covered, I will say it according to the situation."</p><p>"That"</p><p>"Once you know who the notebook belongs to, what do you want to do?"</p><p>I cut him off and looked him in the eye. His clear eyes reflected my muddy eyes. Somehow, someone commented that these eyes are not angry.</p><p>"Do you want to examine her, rebuke her, or insult her. Or do you have to accept the kindness written on it?"</p><p>"Good, kindness?"</p><p>"Yes. incident"</p><p>"Then you should tell me more!"</p><p>"I refuse your request. Let's make a deal."</p><p>I grabbed my thighs with my hands, holding back my fear, and looked senpai's eyes straight. Whenever his eyes wobble, I just look straight. His gaze caught her more easily than usual. His face turned even worse, his lips moved slightly, trying to say something. But he didn't say a word.</p><p>"...Damn"</p><p>Finally, he ran out of the classroom. The closed door was again forced open due to the reaction force. In this day and age when there is still some heat left, even if left alone, it should be fine.</p><p>"Hokuto-kun"</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"That girl doesn't have a good impression of him"</p><p>"Hah?"</p><p>Even though I thought the name written in the notebook was just senpai, it seems I was wrong. In other words, does the girl have a good impression of others?</p><p>"They are a triangular relationship?"</p><p>"Relationship quadrilateral."</p><p>"...Hah?"</p><p>This is really troublesome. What kind of arrow could make them form a relationship like this? I don't want to know, and I don't know maybe it's better for myself.</p><p>"But anyway, I thank you very much. In exchange, would you like to eat an orange?"</p><p>This time, I took the oranges carefully. The orange I got from her for the first time was very sour.</p><p>"Very sour"</p><p>"When you are tired, it's better to eat something sour."</p><p>"Is that so..."</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Preparation day</h3><p>"[Kisaragi Nao who can see what other people are thinking.&nbsp; And usami hokuto with a body murky like a dead man by her side. It would be best not to have any relationship with any of them.] There seems to be a rumor like this."</p><p>I sighed and shrugged.</p><p>"This is truly a wise judgment."</p><p>The commotion in the school building was nothing more than a trivial matter in this school building. So far, preparations for the cultural festival have also been running smoothly. Even those of us on the stairs could hear the awesome lines from every classroom.</p><p>"But, please go shopping for people who don't want to get involved in your own judgment. Don't you think that's weird?"</p><p>As we walked into the corridor in front of the class of first year students, we saw mountains of corrugated boxes piled up. Since I will see it when I enter school and leave school, I naturally know it, and the surrounding noise also highlights the atmosphere of the cultural festival.</p><p>"As long as you buy what they want, what's more, it keeps us away from the classroom. In this way, we can perform efficiently at the "Cultural Festival where everyone in the class can work together"."</p><p>She stopped. She walked a few steps forward, stopped and turned her head, looking at me with a careless expression.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"I really didn't expect to get such a distorted response."</p><p>"By the way, we're both judged not to be using our budgets at will."</p><p>I can only snort. Anyway, that's true. Even if this was just a wish or a delusion, it could be said to be a fact.</p><p>"Look at this piece of paper."</p><p>I handed her the paper given by the girl who was the center of the class. But after she refused to take the paper, she continued to move forward. And I chased her. She seemed to have judged that there was no need to see it a second time, or else she could see it later. Maybe it's a clever way, but I've seen it a few times inexplicably.</p><p>"The official product names and model numbers are even carefully written. Now that you understand this level, can you just use online shopping?"</p><p>"After all, there is no guarantee that the shop will have it."</p><p>"She said if not, let's call her. What are we going to do?"</p><p>"The one who took this paper is Hokuto-san."</p><p>"I knew you would say that."</p><p>I took my shoes out of the shoe cabinet and walked outside. Then go to the bike parking lot, look for Hiten's bikes. Kisaragi-san seems to have borrowed it from a girl in the same class. It took some time to find her among the many and almost identical bikes from a distance. Having found a bicycle with the same key, we rushed to the building materials supermarket.</p><p>The wind that I felt back after so long after riding the bike was really refreshing. The two of us pedaled our bikes without saying a word, and finally reached our destination.</p><p>"At this time and in uniform entering the shop, you feel so nervous?"</p><p>"Is your heart pounding? I suggest you to go to the Cardiology department"</p><p>(Note : Cardiology is a branch of medicine that specifically studies disorders of the heart and blood vessels.)</p><p>"Are you recommending this method really enough for reality,"</p><p>Even though I brought up this topic, but I don't find it interesting to answer seriously.</p><p>"In short, let's go to the shop first, and look for it properly."</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>The items were also classified into large items at similar shops nearby, and a wide variety of products were placed in the spacious shop. Seeing Kisaragi-san's fast pace, I thought that might be so, as a result, she actually started looking for things that interest her with pleasure.</p><p>"May I sit in this chair for a moment?"</p><p>"Fine. Wait until I come."</p><p>After looking at her, there was a chair that had an indescribable shape. The uncomfortable chair came into my eyes.</p><p>"&#8230;I care a little too."</p><p>"That's right!? That way, it won't work if you don't sit down for a while!"</p><p>"Sit down while you don't say it. Let me sit down for a moment."</p><p>While we were repeating this interaction, I walked around the shop. I don't know if it's because of time or week, the number of customers is very small, so we shouldn't cause trouble to the shop. I want to think so.</p><p>Since there were three things we couldn't find, we asked the clerk and got the answer that nothing was bought. And since the clerk recommended a similar product to us, we considered it and called. After making a few calls, the other party told me we didn't want to buy anything and just came back. After conveying the meaning of understanding, I hung up the phone. I settled the bill and got the invoice. We put our things in our respective baskets, rode our bikes, and walked down the path we had previously passed.</p><p>Do you want to buy the rest online? It should be like this. This will make it easier. Even though I thought about buying it at another shop, thinking about this or many other things, I gave up. The wind was colder than before. Sunsets are even more dazzling.</p><p>"Please don't pretend to be cool,"</p><p>"Okay once in a while it's fine too."</p><p>"I prefer Hokuto-san's natural state,"</p><p>"Isn't it the atmosphere to say such a thing now?"</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Day of making small things</h3><p>Due to the upcoming cultural festival, so the time for comprehensive study is also used to prepare for the cultural festival. Broadly speaking, this is also a type of comprehensive learning. But it might be too naive to think that it was just a purchase. Although there is still a period of time, within a certain period of time, even after school must be prepared. It seems very happy to most people, but not so to a bad person like me.</p><p>The classroom was divided equally into two parts, one for people who wanted to go up on stage to practice, the other for making props. In charge of self-made clothes, there are three elites who are good at sewing and quite arrogant. The rest, myself included, would make books, small houses, hunting weapons, and dwarf axes mounted on stilts out of corrugated boxes. Several sheets of corrugated cardboard were put together and pasted with white paper, so that art students could draw a sketch of a house. As for me, I want to paint secretly on it.</p><p>"A weapon? A gun to do it? A model gun, isn't it? It's sold at a 100 yen shop."</p><p>"In this case, it doesn't exist in the world. Even if it isn't perfect, I think it should be able to look a lot like a rifle from the stands."</p><p>"As expected of the arts department, really hard work!"</p><p>"Hmm, it's worth it anyways"</p><p>"Mirror, mirror. Who is the most beautiful woman in the world?"</p><p>"This is Snow White"</p><p>"...Is that true? If you erase the most beautiful princess in the world "now", I will become the most beautiful woman."</p><p>"Ah, is it going to feel like this kind of slow feeling? I imagine that it was written by a very passionate queen."</p><p>"Yes, is that so? That's it... Is that! Just remove the prettiest princess in the world "now", and I'll be the most beautiful woman!"</p><p>"Oh... right, that's how it feels."</p><p>"Well, does anyone know where the tape was put?"</p><p>"I just saw the tape."</p><p>"S, Snow White is dead!?"</p><p>"Ah, still breathing!"</p><p>"Hurry up and help him!"</p><p>"Breathe Manually!!"</p><p>"Artificial breathing!!"</p><p>I really wished the bell would ring sooner.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Poster day</h3><p>It was on the stairs that would reach the library, and a question flew from the side.</p><p>"How will the Library Committee participate in the cultural festival?"</p><p>"Hey, didn't I tell you?"</p><p>Since she followed so naturally, I must have thought he knew it.</p><p>"Maybe it's also because I haven't asked, I don't know."</p><p>"Everything is like this, you still have to follow me."</p><p>"Well, almost."</p><p>Just as I was about to open the door, the door opened from the other side, and the guests who came first came out of there. I was slightly distracted from my sight by the back figure I had seen. But I didn't think back in a few seconds, so I must have read it wrong.</p><p>When she opened the library door and looked back, she didn't seem to be in a good mood, and then she looked away. She shouldn't want to stay in class either. Since I'm in the same mood, I'm not qualified to treat her as a fool.</p><p>"Then, what are we going to do?"</p><p>I took out the thick paper and stationery under the table.</p><p>"Every other class, I put up a poster with an introduction to my favorite book at school. Now, I just want to make that poster."</p><p>Between us sitting across from each other, I used thick paper for the poster. Stationery on the table. Her gaze then turned to the various paper cutters on the stationery.</p><p>"May I use it?"</p><p>"Please."</p><p>She must have tried it a few times, and I handed her the folded origami. The pattern I gave Kisaragi-san is a star. It's because I saw her eyes shining and I thought I should give this to her. She's holding the crinkled corner of the origami, and there's a snap. Then, in his palm, a yellow star fell.</p><p>"Have a good time"</p><p>"That's good,"</p><p>"Use this to decorate it?"</p><p>"Do not use"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Although this is recommended, but not mandatory"</p><p>Cheerful expression of the turn, she looked at me with a look of surprise expression. Her expression is like saying that you don't need it, as if it's awesome to the extreme.</p><p>"Why not use it?"</p><p>"Do you think I can use it well?"</p><p>"I don't think there are many things that can be decorated so easily like this."</p><p>"That's why you have no taste in decoration."</p><p>"Then, what if Hokuto-san wants to decorate?"</p><p>"I don't know how to decorate"</p><p>"Hah?"</p><p>And she made a very surprised sound. She looked quite surprised.</p><p>"Simply post an introduction and then write a title or something."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"Really"</p><p>"Then I'll do it"</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"Don't you want to do it?"</p><p>She was already holding a pair of scissors in her hand. She looked full of energy.</p><p>"In this case..."</p><p>If this is the case, of course it helps me a lot, so just go for it. As I was about to say this, I suddenly remembered the tragic "door" painting she had painted herself. But even if you say no this time, can you stop it. There is no doubt that she will definitely export and shoot again. This scene is easy to imagine.</p><p>And even if I did, I could only make posters that were dry, tasteless, and inconspicuous. Even if it would take some risks, I felt it would be best to ask her. If it's not good, stop her then.</p><p>"Then I'll leave it to you."</p><p>"I see. Is there anything I need to pay attention to?"</p><p>"As long as it doesn't cover up the introduction of the article too much, you can do whatever you like after that."</p><p>"So,"</p><p>She said, started using paper cutters and scissors to cut paper and decorate posters. Since I'm embarrassed to read here, I've been watching her homework project.</p><p>"I'd be embarrassed if you saw me like this."</p><p>"Even my hands are embarrassed?"</p><p>"Isn't there a saying that hands show a person's personality?"</p><p>"If you say that, everything will show that person's personality."</p><p>"That's right. So I was very embarrassed."</p><p>"Since you also read me, I might know that, including stopping you when it's bad, I should also look at the poster. So that's okay. I don't really care about your hands."</p><p>"...Even so, I have some dissatisfaction"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>What do you want me to do.</p><p>"Talk about it. Let it briefly describe what you see my hand impression of it."</p><p>"I think it's very beautiful. Or, most of your skin is very beautiful."</p><p>".....yes."</p><p>"Yes ah"</p><p>Immediately after, she fell silent. I don't know what's going on.</p><p>As a result, I did not stop his work. The end result is an introductory poster that is anything but pretty but very beautiful.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>And she looked at me with confidence too.</p><p>"Thank you. I can't do this."</p><p>"Very good."</p><p>"Yes. It is just."</p><p>Even though I'd say it if it took me a long time, I gave up. It's because she did what I was supposed to do. Irresponsibility also has its limits.</p><p>"I don't want to go back to class."</p><p>"Yeah, that's what I said."</p><p>The preparation period is coming to an end. The rehearsal has also been carried out once, and has entered the final adjustment stage. At first, it was because we had to make a lot of small props that we escaped here, but right now people like us who weren't on stage had nothing to do. Fortunately, we escaped like this on the grounds that the library committee's preparations had not yet been completed.</p><p>"If you don't want to come back, don't come back."</p><p>Her hand held mine on the table. The grip is very soft and gentle. Presumably the devil made such a sound to seduce humans.</p><p>"Do you want to make a fuss?"</p><p>"No, that's enough. Come back soon."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Back to class"</p><p>She smiled a little. As if to say, I knew you would.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">First Day of Cultural Festival</h3><p>The first day of the Cultural Festival was mainly for first year students, various committees and individuals. Because in the afternoon, the gymnasium stage was used for the previous day's practice, so second graders could basically only hang out in the morning. However, it's not mandatory to watch, so you can work on topics in class, or you can read in the corner of the library. There must be some classes who consider this moment as their last hope and are practicing drama.</p><p>A few days ago, I started picking out some books to read today, so I didn't plan on dropping out of my class, but I was taken out by Kisaragi-san like last time.</p><p>Being too inconsistent with my own ideas, I started to worry about myself.</p><p>"This decoration is so cute."</p><p>She strolled around the displays happily, and expressed her agreement about each display. Because sometimes, it seems like the closest people related to the show will open their eyes and show happy expressions after seeing it, so it's just some positive thoughts.</p><p>"Right, what I did was funny"</p><p>"What does Hokuto-san want to see at the cultural festival?"</p><p>"I do not want anything"</p><p>"Hokuto-san isn't interested at all from the bottom of his heart."</p><p>She will feel a little bad. Her eyes turned to me.</p><p>"If you have to say it like this, the production process is more important, right? I'm not a producer, and I won't have the slightest emotion."</p><p>"Wouldn't the thoughts that have worked hard also be revealed?"</p><p>"...Not limited to humans, can you understand thoughts nested in inorganic matter?"</p><p>"That's not the case. Just take a look and you'll find out"</p><p>"I don't know what to do?"</p><p>"Try it. Maybe it's better to make a masterpiece full of thoughts?"</p><p>"There he is. I'm grateful, I'll refer him."</p><p>"Seeing what you look like, I should forget my words in three seconds."</p><p>"No. I'll think of what to do in 30 seconds, and if I can't think of anything, I'll forget about it."</p><p>Kisaragi-san sighed with surprise on her face.</p><p>"Let's go to the next place."</p><p>"Yes, yes."</p><p>"You only have to say it once."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>I was taken away by her displeased and visited the next one. 5th grade from first grade. In most classrooms, it sits like a planetarium. Before we saw the most important star, we were overwhelmed by its aura.</p><p>"This is absolutely amazing."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>It's really amazing. Due to its unusual appearance, one couldn't help but look forward to the stars in it.</p><p>Due to the size of the planetarium, the number of people that can enter is limited, and because there is also time for commenting, it is worth waiting in line for a while. There were so many people in the team that it had folded in two rows from the corridor in front of the Class 5 classroom. Unlike what I expected, I thought it was a drawback to see several people at a time.</p><p>"Speaking of, I saw the planetarium in the place where I lived with when I was in first grade. Although the feeling was very ordinary, I clearly remember that it was very beautiful."</p><p>"...If you say that, it seems that it did."</p><p>But I don't remember clearly.</p><p>"Are you sleeping?"</p><p>"No, I'm just not interested in activities."</p><p>"Really. Nothing to do with this kind of thing. Not good for you."</p><p>"I know"</p><p>"So why did you do that?"</p><p>"That is what is called a second year illness."</p><p>"If a high school student is called a second-order disease, then in other words, you will be like "my eyes hurt&#8230;", &#8230;!?"</p><p>"Forget the actual demonstration. It makes people feel uncomfortable."</p><p>The words of the student in charge of the reception echoed down the corridor. So that we can be entertained.</p><p>"Wow"</p><p>"Extraordinary..."</p><p>The moment we went inside, we were impressed by the "reality". They were able to use materials such as corrugated paper on hand and a bit of a budget to make something nearly as planetarium to my impression, and such high quality, I couldn't help but feel. It coincided with the student's explanation, forming a beautiful space in the classroom.</p><p>"It's very romantic,"</p><p>She whispered to me remembering the incident. Obviously her voice was very small, but I could clearly understand that she was very excited.</p><p>"Ah, the atmosphere is good. If possible, I really want to march again."</p><p>"Do you want to do it?"</p><p>"This thing should be prohibited by Class 5. When you came in, didn't you see the Precautions."</p><p>I couldn't help but be surprised by the voice that suddenly interrupted between us. Because it was so sudden, I don't even know where the voice came from. And beside me, at a loss for what to do, he said.</p><p>"Right. We didn't see it. Thank you so much for letting us know."</p><p>"...Thank you"</p><p>He's very reliable at this point.</p><p>"...While watching other displays, read the precautions carefully."</p><p>That person must have never expected that he would receive such a response from the warned party. The owner of the voice said this last while trembling. I always felt that this voice had been heard from somewhere, but the voices of boys of the same generation were basically similar. So it was hard to identify whose voice it was right away, so I judged this might be my illusion.</p><p>On the other hand, he winked at me as if he was saying "Look". But I didn't look carefully, but he had to wink at me.</p><p>I have a slight longing for his dignified figure. Since he would be very proud of what he said to him in private, so I won't say it, but it's really unusual to be able to admit his mistakes obediently. Crooked people like me think so even more.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Second Day of Cultural Festival</h3><p>Cultural festivals, various performances will be held in the gymnasium throughout the day. In addition to the second year students and group activities, and private announcements, there was also a guessing game held by the student union, so it was more enthusiastic than the first day.</p><p>And now. On stage, Hiten showed outstanding acting skills. He joined the drama department for some time in high school, but his strength has not diminished even today. Because Hiten is so good, a little bit of directness of others is very eye-catching. Although from his point of view, he might as well want to get rid of some power, but in reality he didn't get rid of it at all. It was because the story revolved around him, the balance was out of balance. Compared to other programs, the content is more hardcore, presumably their class will win first place because of the third-rate votes.</p><p>"Okay, everyone, come and form a circle."</p><p>And the next to appear is our class. After the main character in the class said this at the side door of the stage, there was a noisy environment. I felt like thinking "Now? There are not a few people, but the amazing thing is that everyone naturally forms a circle. And I have no choice but to take advantage of this situation, and at the same time, I'm worried whether Kisaragi-san left behind, and looked at her uncomfortably. An unremarkable female classmate in class, although showing some hesitation, still held her hand. And that slight hesitation made my heart ache.</p><p>"Come on!"</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>I stated very slowly. After shouting, everyone let go of their hands and waited for their own appearance. And when I saw Snow White trembling in the middle of the smaller ring, I couldn't help but worry about whether something would happen. She was sweating coldly, and the white paint on her cheeks seemed to fall.</p><p>At that moment Hiten finished playing and got off the stage, then the host faintly stated that the next show would be Snow White from our class. The students walking on the stage cheered with cheerful expressions. Soon after, the students who couldn't go up to the stage also said words of support. In the end, I lost the pressure among the public, and I couldn't help but utter a word of cheer.</p><p><br /></p><p>The best class that was shown at the closing ceremony, as the public thought it was the Hiten class. Then there were happy and sad voices from everywhere. Whether you can be selected is a big deal for all those who truly welcome cultural festivals.</p><p>"Congratulations on winning the best award"</p><p>The representative in Hiten's class wiped the corner of his eye and received a certificate of praise. Including the congratulatory meaning, I clapped louder than usual.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Sports Festival Day &#8211; Headband</h3><p>Like many people who live in the shadows I don't like sports either. Although this has to do with me not being good at sports, the main reason is that I have to form a team with people who don't communicate much. To cooperate with people who are good at sports, I naturally hate it, but even working with people who are also not good at sports will only be very painful. No, for whatever reason, I hate sports. Because of that, I definitely won't like sports festivals. I tried my best to reduce the amount of competition I played on the pitch, and I chose to be a manager who didn't have a few things to do that day. This is the time for very smart people to show their talents. People who are not smart and don't like it should be aware of this and spend this time unobtrusively. Because I'm so good at distinguishing right from wrong that people can't help but feel miserable, so there's no problem.</p><p>By the way, Hiten had a good impression of the sports festival, and even he himself joined the support group, while Kisaragi-san was unexpectedly good at sports, so nothing happened. In addition to envy, also make people jealous. Why only me? Although this feeling of inferiority may arise, the problem must be that the object of comparison is only the two of them. If you look around, you can see at a glance that there are a lot of dispirited people with headbands around. From the point of view of the entire school, my existence was normal.</p><p>But I'm a little surprised by the fact that Kisaragi-san is good at sports. Under that appearance, what she was good at was not studying, but sports. Who could have predicted this. The most beautiful girl character setting should be the other way around...or they're all very good at it. Although I think the setting I control is a bit excessive, in reality there are people who are beautiful, smart, and good at sports. After all, there is a saying that reality is more magical than fiction. In fact, there are some people with extraordinary abilities who would be refuted by exaggerating sentences at the stage of plotting.</p><p>"Hokuto-san"</p><p>Just as my thoughts jumped from her to the inexplicable, I was called by name, thinking that she might object to my thoughts, I looked back. After that, I stopped thinking for a moment because of her appearance in my eyes. Although the brain immediately began to function again, it still did not understand what was in the eyes.</p><p>"...What's that?"</p><p>Finally, I confirmed it verbally.</p><p>"This is a cat ear headband. Since people in my class wanted to do this, I also took advantage of the trend to do it."</p><p>"Really&#8230;"</p><p>That's how it is. She now looks like cat ears. Since it was originally a headband, it didn't look like cat ears, but even so, in front of me it was still like Kisaragi-san with cat ears, so I couldn't hide my confusion.</p><p>"Is that funny?"</p><p>"That's right. I think it's pretty good."</p><p>"Don't be shy, please tell me honestly."</p><p>"I think you should be embarrassed at this point. Aren't you the one who openly pointed it out? Cat ears?"</p><p>"Because there are a lot of people too, so I'm not too embarrassed."</p><p>"That's a bit of a shame."</p><p>"That's right I was a little embarrassed."</p><p>"Then it would be a great help to me if you could let her go."</p><p>So said Kisaragi-san. At the same time, the boy who appeared suddenly made me feel like I had seen him before. I referred to the ocean in my memory and realized that he was the chairman of the disciplinary committee. Thinking that he would be warned for this reason, I watched him with trembling in my heart.</p><p>"Because I think it's interesting, so I want to give it a try."</p><p>"It bothered us a lot. Wear a good head covering."</p><p>"That's right. Sorry."</p><p>She says what she might think like this in her heart. At the same time, she honestly removed the headband from gher head and rolled it back on her forehead as before.</p><p>"I remember warning me when I was at the planetarium,"</p><p>Kisaragi-san said to the chairman confirming that he would be leaving after rolling up her headband.</p>

<p>"Oh"</p><p>This sentence really surprised me. After thinking this, I replayed the voice in my memory in my brain, but since I didn't hear it when I woke up, it was hard to understand that it was the same person. But the person in question also stood still in shock, so it must be like that.</p><p>"You can observe your surroundings carefully, that's good. But being too nervous is not a good thing,"</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>"You have to learn how to stop."</p><p>The chairman who shrank after inadvertently replied thank you for your concern, and left immediately.</p><p>If it was someone of his looks and seriousness, he should have gotten used to a woman's smile, but his snuggled gaze was clearly shy.</p><p>"Those who appear on two or three legs, please gather at the entrance gate."</p><p>And I didn't even have time to think about why this happened, and the broadcast of the meeting of the players from the next competition sounded. And some of my appearances have also arrived. I started cursing that my luck was so bad that I got a combo competition. I waved at her saying please cheer.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Sports Festival Day - Bento</h3><p>I threw away the "KEEP OUT" paper that kept people from moving forward as usual, and continued up the stairs. I watched her from my footsteps, and let out a sigh that could even reach the stairs on the next floor.</p><p>"Did you forget the bento again?"</p><p>I raised the bento in front of her who said so.</p><p>"I didn't forget today."</p><p>I just don't want to live in a noisy classroom filled with the heat of a sports festival.</p><p>"It's okay for now."</p><p>"Since there was something about the high school students last time, I was a little scared."</p><p>"Can you forget about that matter?"</p><p>"That's what I said, a little tired."</p><p>That would be great. I kept my distance and sat down to prevent her from reading my mind. Today, she was holding a lunch box in her hand.</p><p>"Is that the bento you made?"</p><p>There seemed to be sausages and the like apart from fried eggs. Maybe because someone ate it, it looks delicious.</p><p>"Having said that, basically all food is frozen."</p><p>"Just being able to put it in a bento box makes me so emotional."</p><p>I opened my bento box and it was full. It's not mine, it's my mom's.</p><p>"I've done it a few times, but I don't know why the things I put in can't keep me full during the day."</p><p>"It takes getting used to. Just do it every day."</p><p>"That's right. I'll get started."</p><p>Kisaragi-san and I were addicted to food, and there was silence for a while. Lifting my face after eating, I happened to meet Kisaragi-san's eyes. Since the chopsticks were in the box,s he seemed to have just finished eating. After I covered my hand, she also closed her hand in panic.</p><p>"I'm full"</p><p>I didn't think we would finish eating at the same time. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. After placing the bento box in the backpack, I then took out the tea.</p><p>"Is Hiten-san participating in the support team?"</p><p>"Yes. He did a very good job. In the dance that starts in the afternoon, he looks like he's showing off a flying kick or a locomotive kick or something."</p><p>"Wow, I was looking forward to it!"</p><p>From her extremely exaggerated response, I could sense her expectations of Hiten. She also seems to be attracted by Hiten's friendliness. As a friend, it doesn't feel good.</p><p>"By the way, why has the relationship between Hokuto-san and Hiten-san become more intimate?"</p><p>She ate the oranges after lunch with a smile on the corner of her mouth. Just when I saw the spot where the orange was peeled, she handed me a piece. What does this piece mean?</p><p>"I do not want"</p><p>The orange was sucked into her mouth.</p><p>"We've only known each other for a long time."</p><p>"Even if we know it for a long time, as long as the class changes, some relationships will naturally become estranged."</p><p>There should be such a relationship. On the other hand, when I first became a sophomore, I thought it would be like this. Since she is different from me, even if her class changes, there will be many friends around her. Even if I wasn't around, there wouldn't be a problem. But this hope suddenly left me. I'm so happy that I can have daily conversations with her now.</p><p>"Because it took a long time to get to know each other so you can understand what to say to each other. So even though the classes are different, you still want to talk together."</p><p>Even though this is all learned and sold from her, because thinking everything is basically the same, so there is nothing wrong.</p><p>"This is a good thing."</p><p>"Eh, not all of this. Because we're going to have a conversation without a subject under the premise that we both know it, so when other people join the conversation occasionally, we'll look weird."</p><p>She couldn't help but let out a voice of approval. Have we ever had a conversation like that in front of her. Because we are not self-conscious, nature can be said to be very bad.</p><p>"Ah"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"We have to gather in five minutes."</p><p>"Lie!?"</p><p>I gripped my backpack tightly and quickly descended the stairs.</p><p>"What's the competition in the first quarter this afternoon!?"</p><p>"Typhoon Eyes!"</p><p>"I hate!"</p><p>"Since this is a competition where all players are required to play, there is no right to refuse!"</p><p>"I know!"</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Karaoke Day</h3><p>Looking back. This is not where Kisaragi-san and I should go. The single room we were taken to was very cramped. All my thoughts should be heard by her all the time.</p><p>This is also as usual.</p><p>I watched water droplets fall from the surface of the green tea cup in front of me to escape reality. What kind of expression was I showing in front of her. The last time I saw her, it should have been a minute ago. No, maybe not necessarily tens of seconds ago.</p><p>"&#8230;What do you mean by looking back?"</p><p>It is an irreparable fact that I have been summoned here. I accepted it with difficulty and raised my face. Questions were asked about the words spoken after today's meeting.</p><p>"It means literally. Because it's rare to be so happy in school activities, so I wanted to talk about memories."</p><p>"Then you go to the class celebration party."</p><p>"I don't want to go. How can I go there?"</p><p>She smiled. Tell me this. Since I'm not coming, I also agree with this, but I don't accept this excuse.</p><p>"Then what? You called me, who doesn't want to talk much?"</p><p>"I'll settle the bill here."</p><p>"I don't want you to do this."</p><p>I look so poor.</p><p>"I want to talk about memories with Hokuto-san."</p><p>"&#8230;I don't remember anything worth talking about."</p><p>"That's right. Then let's take some time to reflect. I'll sing a song first."</p><p>"Is this the mood now?"</p><p>"Should Hokuto-san sing first?"</p><p>She handed me the song ordering machine, and I shook my head at her sudden movement. She nodded as if she said so, and started picking up the song she wanted to sing. Apart from mentioning the situation, I started to care about what song he wanted to sing, so I looked at the picture. Displayed on the screen is the title of the song that carries the popular concept of female love. I can only sigh.</p><p>"I thought you could sing the school song"</p><p>"Because there's no school song in it, so I can't sing it."</p><p>"That is, if it's in it, will you sing it?"</p><p>"Who knows? At the time, I didn't know."</p><p>"I do not know anything."</p><p>Finally, she began to sing along with the accompaniment that began to play.</p><p>She sings badly. Since the beat is consistent to some extent, she may not know the song, but the tone is muddled. The displayed score is less than half of the national average.</p><p>"&#8230;I'm not well."</p><p>What was unexpected was that she was actually worried about the state of his microphone. While it can't be said to be true, it's not a song to be listened to over and over again.</p><p>"I feel almost reminded, let's revisit it."</p><p>By the time I noticed, I had already said this sentence. She looks at me with a big smile and puts the microphone on the table. I don't know if she planned that way.</p><p>"In the first place, on the first day of the cultural festival, the Class 5 planetarium was very beautiful. It's so good it didn't even occur to a junior to make it."</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"For me. I really like Class 2. The sample show of traditional Japanese food. Even though doing so might not be that great, but it's a very cultured festival theme."</p><p>"Indeed so."</p><p>"On the second day of the cultural festival, I must say Hiten-san's acting was really good."</p><p>Maybe because my reaction was so weak, she quickly changed the date. Hiten's acting ability is extraordinary.</p><p>"The next day I just remembered this."</p><p>"Yes. Then do you remember the details of Konaka-san who is usually friendly and takes motherhood seriously."</p><p>"Who is Konaka-san?"</p><p>"Then you don't remember being in the interlude Is that thing about Sora-san showing jokes proudly during break that the audience is so embarrassed about?"</p><p>"Why do you always remember such subtle things?"</p><p>It's a shame that you can keep saying names and things.</p><p>"Because I hear their names from time to time."</p><p>"Ah, ah, there he is."</p><p>"That,"</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"&#8230;&#8230;let's talk about the first day."</p><p>"Please speak."</p><p>She gave me the same side of understanding each other, she started to look back enthusiastically. Though I will repeat it, but I don't remember half of the contents. However, it is very good to share happy things with others. Her expression was very touching.</p><p>"...At this point, the review is complete"</p><p>Finally she stated like this. Her cheeks were flushed, and I could see at a glance that she was very excited.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work."</p><p>After I signaled her to drink, she drank it all at once. Maybe her condition got better, and she reached her hand out to the machine again. Really, do whatever you like.</p><p>"Does Hokuto-san have nothing to look back on?"</p><p>"I think Snow White's better off letting you come to the show."</p><p>Her thoughts paused for a moment, and then the opening of a new song began. She seemed to be sighing on purpose, blasting the microphone throughout the room.</p><p>"What are you talking about now? Except for me, they won't know if you don't say anything."</p><p>She didn't look at me.</p><p>"Even if I'm too far away, I can't hear it."</p><p>I looked sideways at her who was starting to sing popular love songs again, thinking that it was rare, so I started looking for a song I wanted to sing.</p><p>But there isn't one.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Umbrella day</h3><p>"Hokuto-san"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Is my voice conveyed to you?"</p><p>"Yes, it was conveyed to me well"</p><p>"Even though it was conveyed, you didn't seem to be listening, so I had to say it a few more times. Please bring the umbrella yourself."</p><p>"I've bowed."</p><p>"That's because you didn't lean on your shoulder to get wet. It's fine if I get drenched under the railing, but the classmate of the umbrella owner Hokuto-san getting drenched is no good. If you want to continue this state of affairs, I'll run home."</p><p>"If you do that, you'll catch a cold."</p><p>"If it continues like this, Hokuto-san will be cold"</p><p>"If you catch a cold, I'll be in trouble."</p><p>"If Hokuto-san gets cold, I'll be in trouble too. So even if I ask you, please block the rain."</p><p>"I got in the way."</p><p>"Can't you see your left side? ?"</p><p>"Seen"</p><p>"You saw it wet?"</p><p>"That's your illusion."</p><p>"You really are stubborn. I've been reading your mind all along. Do you really hate sharing your umbrella with me?"</p><p>"If it bothers you, I won't let you come."</p><p>"...If that's the case, just move closer, okay?"</p><p>"Oh, Hokuto and Nao. Are you going home now?"</p><p>"This, isn't that Hiten? What's wrong. It's really weird to meet on the way home."</p><p>"Because it's raining today, I don't ride a bicycle, but go to school on foot."</p><p>"Ah, that's what happened. After all, riding a bicycle in the rain is very difficult."</p><p>"That's all. By the way, Nao, did you forget to bring your umbrella?"</p><p>"Yes. Since I saw the morning weather, I never thought it would rain."</p><p>"After all, a sunny day. This is the way. Would you like to borrow my folding umbrella?"</p><p>"... I ask."</p><p>"Then give this to you. I can return it at any time. If you can't make it to my class, let Hiten drive it to me."</p><p>"Thank you. Because Hokuto-san can't hold his umbrella well for himself, so I'm really embarrassed."</p><p>"Hokuto is that kind of person."</p><p>"That's what she said."</p><p>"You are so annoying."</p><p>Slowly she lifted the umbrella and went under my umbrella. I have a sense of openness. The umbrella is great for one person. I lifted my feet which had become naturally fast and away from her. They started the conversation behind my back just like that. I couldn't hear clearly because of the sound of the rain. Sometimes I can hear the words "北" and "斗", but these should only be part of a list of various words. It must be so, without doubt.</p><p>"If it's really that annoying, I won't let you in..."</p><p>I thought it was funny what I accidentally said. Even though I knew I wouldn't pass it on, I said it anyway. Really, what did I realize?</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Confession Day</h3><p>I witnessed the scene where someone confessed to Kisaragi Nao. The other party turned out to be the chairman of the disciplinary committee. Even though the cultural festival is a cooperative activity between people, I never thought of linking these two people together. I quickly moved my body and left from there.</p><p>To some extent, in front of a vending machine in the distance, I sat on a chair and took a deep breath while asking myself why I felt so guilty. No, it's strange to say whether this is guilty or not. Overall, it's true that I'm in a bad mood. The scene flashed through my head many times. Even though I didn't see the expression on the person's expression that I liked you, I could tell from his voice that he looked very nervous. On the other hand, Kisaragi-san didn't show any expression. Either it was because she wasn't interested or she was just surprised. Because there's only a moment, so I can't judge.</p><p>What kind of answer did she give? I am in front of her, no matter what I do, I will still think about her. If possible, I would like to avoid this. However, she would definitely appear this time...</p><p>"The answer is correct. You really know that."</p><p>Even though I had expected it, I couldn't help but shake my shoulders since she actually appeared here. I turned and saw her buying juice in front of the vending machine.</p><p>"Sometimes, I think Hokuto-san might be better at reading ideas."</p><p>The packaging that appears is strawberry milk. I feel a little emotional about her coming into contact with fruits other than oranges.</p><p>No, the place to be concerned is not here.</p><p>"Compared to this, what's wrong with you? Why are you in this place"</p><p>It seems that due to distance and other reasons, she didn't read what I was thinking beforehand.</p><p>"Of course I bought juice."</p><p>"I refuse his confession."</p><p>She reads what I think.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Are you asking about the reason for reading? Or the reason for the refusal?"</p><p>"...Reason to read"</p><p>"Even if you don't want to think about it, you will still think about it subconsciously. It can be said that it is unavoidable."</p><p>She sat a bit away from me. After inserting the straw, she drank the strawberry milk. Her expression was more cheerful than before.</p><p>"Even though the place is in the shadows, many people pass by."</p><p>"...Is that so?"</p><p>I leaned back in the chair and took a deep breath. Although the heart is noisy, the indescribably bad mood has disappeared.</p><p>"Being seen by someone other than Hokuto-san is the problem. Since he's a good person, I might become a target for attacks if I get rid of him."</p><p>"No one else."</p><p>"Why do you think so?"</p><p>"Even if there is, I will think of a way."</p><p>"You are really reliable."</p><p>After about three seconds, I realized what I was missing after seeing her face. She smiled a little, very happy. I've never seen her expression so relaxed.</p><p>"Sure enough, it still doesn't work. I withdraw my statement."</p><p>"You already said it, please take responsibility."</p><p>I looked at her who chuckled and said it really loud, and prayed that nothing would happen.</p><p>*</p><p>In the backyard</p><p>"You may not know it, but I've always liked you. If you can, please go out with me."</p><p>(It doesn't matter who she can read. I confess because I like Kisaragi Nao)</p><p>When I heard his confession, the first thing I remembered was Hokuto-san's face. It wasn't his smiling face, but it wasn't his deadly serious expression, but his extremely unhappy appearance. It was as if Hokuto-san in my heart was extremely jealous of my confession, and I couldn't help but laugh. I immediately denied that Hokuto-san was unable to show such an expression. Because he definitely won't be interested in who I confess to. Although I would like him to have some interest, he is not such a vulgar person.</p><p>"Sorry. I have someone I like."</p><p>I said so, rejecting the senior's confession.</p><p>"Really. However, I originally thought that it might not work, but after being rejected, I still feel a little sad."</p><p>Although I wanted to apologize again, but after thinking that I shouldn't reply like this, I shut my mouth.</p><p>"The person you like is the one who is always by your side?"</p><p>Senior asked me with a wry smile, and I put my finger on my lips and smiled and replied that this is a secret. Senior just said something like this, and didn't stop me from leaving.</p><p>After that, in front of the vending machine I was aiming for, I couldn't help but tremble at Hokuto-san's reaction that I met. Instead of buying oranges, I bought strawberry milk.</p><p>I saw that he, who seemed to have seen the confession scene, showed a clear mess beyond my expectations.</p><p>Is this the chance that Hokuto-san will give me a good impression? Though I thought so, but I thought friendship might be the same, so I started to think about it. I've heard that people feel sad when their friends suddenly start prioritizing their lover. If I really went into this situation, I would be very sad.

When it comes to friends, there is also a code of ethics, because it is better to talk about the same gender. And if I could, I also think that someone with a lot of knowledge about love would be better off, but to me without friends, everyone is a luxury.</p>
