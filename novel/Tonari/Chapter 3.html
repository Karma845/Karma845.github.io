<h2>Chapter 3 Not bored with it?</h2>

<h3>Confession day</h3><p>After school was over, I went to the page the letter pointed to. I stopped when I saw the figure of a girl passing by in my memory.</p><p>"Is your name Sato Yuna?"</p><p>She nodded slightly. Her big watery eyes are impressive and very cute. She&nbsp;pressed her lips tightly together and fixed her intense gaze on me.</p><p>"Sorry, I called you here all of a sudden. I started liking you a long time ago. Please go out with me,"</p><p>She said in a clear tone. But I also thought it would be like this. When I was in school, I had an inkling after seeing the letter in the shoebox.</p><p>At 4.30 pm after school, please come to the courtyard. "Sato Yuna"</p><p>In a world where SNS was starting to rise, she would actually confess face to face. She&nbsp;was really brave.</p><p>"Sorry"</p><p>But accepting her as a love partner is another matter. Not my favorite to be the only person judging the material at this stage. Of course, as long as there is an exchange, it is possible to review the consistency of personality and taste preferences, but I didn't expect this.</p><p>For a moment, she revealed her dissatisfaction to her expression.</p><p>"So why? You're not dating Kisaragi-san, are you?"</p><p>Why? that's my sentence. Even if Kisaragi's name was mentioned here, I wouldn't have a good impression of you. On the other hand, there will be unpleasant discomfort.</p><p>"We really aren't dating"</p><p>"Then what is your relationship?"</p><p>When asked, I couldn't answer for a while.</p><p>"That has nothing to do with you."</p><p>I followed her hysterical tone and uttered these lines along the way. But Sato-san was only for a moment, she bit her lip, and tears appeared in the corners of her eyes. Seeing her expression that lost strength, I realized that I had said the wrong thing and began to regret it. But I, who refused her confession, had no right to comfort her. I looked around, and in the shadows of things, I saw people who looked like her friends. Thinking that it shouldn't have anything to do with friends, I immediately left the courtyard.</p><p>*</p><p>"You seem to have been recognized by Sato Yuna."</p><p>After returning to class, only Kisaragi-san was in class as a matter of course. I leaned my back against the door in a different direction from the one I opened. She seemed to have heard the words "page" and "Sato Yuna" many times today. Today, it is impossible to think of a duel.</p><p>"What happened to that?"</p><p>"Did you dump her too much? Guilt flows from you."</p><p>Guilt seems to be something that can come out. In other words, it can bring out a general sense of guilt. This is of course the same. Not only did I fail to receive her help, but instead I acted like I was going berserk. With a human heart, I would only feel guilty.</p><p>"Are you saying "That has nothing to do with you"?"</p><p>She sighed softly as if she was saying that she couldn't do anything about you.</p><p>"You really are an arrogant man."</p><p>"I feel guilty if you have to show it again."</p><p>"No, I'm the worst."</p><p>Her foot slipped on the floor, and she walked in front of me.</p><p>"I obviously don't like it, but in order to pursue my own interests, I stay beside you with a calm face."</p><p>"You obviously don't plan to leave, it's a shame you dare to say it."</p><p>With the corners of his mouth curved. She&nbsp;jumped in front of me again after a long time.</p><p>"Should we relate like this?"</p><p>Approached to zero distance, she whispered in my ear like a devil. Although there would be very few people in the school building after school, it was also very possible for others to see. No, what she said was more of a problem than that. I don't have to answer casually. I saw a smile on her face.</p><p>"This way, even though our relationship is distorted, it can be said to be justified. If it becomes a proper relationship, she might as well give up completely."</p><p>She continued without caring. In the end, once satisfied, she would just leave. The heart sound is very loud. Her expression fascinated me, and I couldn't help but think that nodding might be fine. What I think?</p><p>"You're the worse one"</p><p>At least I have to refuse. It has to be this way.</p><p>"No kidding. This is something you're thinking about, right? I just repeated it."</p><p>My brain went blank because of her words.</p><p>"Why"</p><p>I tried my best to finally make a shaking sound. So far, I did think of this kind of thing. But after going up to the second floor where the class was located, I tried my best not to think like that. It should be, but why.</p><p>"......Where did the two meter restriction go?"</p><p>"Oh, it's still applicable now. I can always tell what your mindset is so I subconsciously understand."</p><p>This is called wanting to stab people who would say stabbed people funny line.</p><p>Understand her thoughts.</p><p>Is it a disease or mental disorder? I couldn't possibly know. I'm not curious about that, just shaking with fear at the sight.</p><p>"Please don't be afraid of me. Didn't we talk about you not liking it?"</p><p>"That's how it is."</p><p>"Then I turn to the topic of not liking me too. Hokuto-san has the right to choose. You can do anything. People's relationships are different."</p><p>At this time, the problem was solved perfectly. I couldn't help but spout a dry smile.</p><p>"Obviously talk a lot, are you still planning to do this?"</p><p>"Who knows, what do you mean?"</p><p>Kisaragi-san likes to pretend not to know. Although not impossible, but in this situation, it can't be said to be pretending to be confused. But seeing her like that, I feel relieved for some reason.</p><p>*</p><h3>On bread day</h3><p>"I'm a hopeless fool, a hopeless fool."</p><p>I sighed at my stupidity, as I climbed the stairs. Near the top floor, I saw her figure. When she noticed the sound of shoes in the room, she turned to me, our eyes overlapping.</p><p>"... Hello."</p><p>"You are fine, you are fine with anything. What's wrong with you, you will come here. What about the person you usually spend your lunch break with?"</p><p>I never worry about me averting her eyes, and sitting on the same stairs as her, which is the same distance away as when she was talking in class.</p><p>"He's busy with the manuscript."</p><p>"Manuscript?"</p><p>"Dojinshi script. Tomorrow seems to be the deadline for scripts."</p><p>"I don't know very well, but is it something that even a lunch break should use?"</p><p>"Don't worry about it, it's his own fault"</p><p>"Yes. Is that so. Then, why did Hokuto-san come here?"</p><p>"Share lunch with me."</p><p>I sat on the stairs and lowered my head. In the current situation, I don't care if the floor is covered in dust.</p><p>"I know it's hard. But I noticed that when there were no lunch boxes, when I rushed to the school cafeteria, they were already sold out."</p><p>I had no idea that the cafeteria had such a cruel war.</p><p>"I know it's difficult, but I'm asking you anyway. I only have some rice. Give me some."</p><p>Even as a male high school student, I didn't think I could endure an afternoon like this.</p><p>"Does Hokuto-san not have any other friends?"</p><p>"You just mentioned this now."</p><p>Although I am not avoided by others, but friends who are close enough to be able to ask for a little lunch, there is nothing but Hiten.</p><p>"This time I can't even ask for Hiten, so I'm here to beg you. Kisaragi-san"</p><p>"Whether it's your way of dealing with it or an inexplicable appearance, please stop it."</p><p>No matter how you look at it, this is a sincere wish. Maybe she wanted to say that I was just pretending to be docile at the moment, but I asked her to realize that I wasn't in a mental state where I could stand and plead with others.</p><p>She said with a sigh.</p><p>"There's really no way. I took three loaves of bread today. I'll give you two."</p><p>"Oh, you want to give me two?"</p><p>"By the way, aren't you a male high school student, right?"</p><p>She curled her lips and smiled widely. In this way, it seems that the harassed joke has also increased by one. But there is no way in this situation. I lifted my face and straightened my posture.</p><p>"When I come back, you should buy me some orange jelly."</p><p>"So. I'll buy you ten."</p><p>Upon hearing the number, her cheeks loosened. She&nbsp;slapped her face, denying the fact that her cheeks were loose, and grabbed her school bag. Then, she took out the pineapple bun and chocolate bun and...?</p><p>"This is Panini"</p><p>"Oh, what is this? Casting a spell under abnormal circumstances?"</p><p>"This is the name of the bread. Since I don't know where it came from, so if you care, please go online and investigate afterwards. It's simply stuffed with ham, cheese and tomatoes in it."</p><p>Is it similar to a sandwich? Although this is very interesting to me, I'm also very bothered if I want to ask if I want to eat it. I have a feeling of rejection of this fashionable name.</p><p>"So which one do you want?"</p><p>&#8220;I think Kisaragi-san should choose first this time."</p><p>"I like them all. Hokuto-san, please choose what you can eat."</p><p>"&#8230;Then I'll choose it. Pineapple Bread and Chocolate Bread"</p><p>"Is it okay not to choose Panini?"</p><p>"I don't know the true form of Panini. If I can't eat it, I'll be in a lot of trouble."</p><p>"I know. Then please eat."</p><p>"Thank You"</p><p>I respectfully accepted the pineapple bread and brown bread from her. Maybe because the food gives you a sense of peace, and tastes many times better than usual.</p><p>"Then, Itadakimasu."</p><p>"...Itadakimasu,"</p><p>She continued softly.</p><p>Delicious. thof course.</p><p>"Do you always eat here?"</p><p>"Yes. Don't you see the words "KEEP OUT" there?"</p><p>"I see it"</p><p>As she said, when the stairs were halfway up, a tape reading "KEEP OUT" was put up to prevent people from passing. Even though I took it off at the same time with a surprised expression, it seems that's what she did.</p><p>"It's a bit bad to say that, but you idiot."</p><p>"Don't you think it's pretty&#8230;?"</p><p>Her face was full of anxiety, and she looked at me.</p><p>"..."</p><p>How should I put it, no matter the location or what, everything is the same. It makes people nervous and hard to ignore.</p><p>"If you think you are handsome, then you have no right to reject me."</p><p>"What are you thinking right now?"</p><p>"You know!? Keep complaining, I think there will be trouble no matter how you put it.!"</p><p>"But, after all, it's a high school kid. There's nothing you can do about desire."</p><p>Ah, this is called incorrect thinking. I calmed down for some reason while eating brown bread.</p><p>"Eh, how should I put it, I mean there is a problem with the location?"</p><p>But to find a way to clear up the misunderstanding, I tried a few words and put together a sentence.</p><p>"I know. Hokuto-san's preference is "submissive little sister"."</p><p>She smiled slightly, completely hateful.</p><p>But it was all bad for me to forget the bento.</p><p>"From tomorrow onwards, get out of bed as soon as you wake up. Hokuto-san is very determined,"</p><p>She concluded happily.</p><p>Soulless.</p><p>I went to my friend's house, I was supposed to help him draw manga as a gift for sending me information. But after the past, what was really asked was the task of working on a mobile game. Unclear meaning.</p><p>"This will be resolved soon, but you can take it slow before then."</p><p>"You can do it slowly, right?"</p><p>"Yes. In short, just adjust the order of the destinations from the start."</p><p>"&#8230;So."</p><p>Since this is also the work I've been doing, there's no problem, but it always makes people want to protest. The main reason was that the energy expended in this adjustment was not used for doujin-related work. But this is in return, so I can only promise obediently.</p><p>"I don't want to let it go, whether it's a rare event card in a social game or a new issue."</p><p>With this statement, he handed the smartphone over to me. Displayed on the screen are several combinations that are like chunks of krypton gold. This was all because he was lucky enough to be able to mold it, which was really expensive.</p><p>"This time I had to draw more than usual, so I thought it would be easier to click on the phone than to draw a line in a comic."</p><p>After I saw his who was already facing the screen before saying that, he didn't. Sighs overflowed. I sat on the sofa for the guest and started tapping his smartphone one by one. Because this combination is already the rarest collection of cards in the game, the performance of each character is very high. It seems easy to do the task.</p><p>"I know you are so shocked that you have nothing to say! But I still beg you!"</p><p>"Ah, uh, I wasn't planning on doing this."</p><p>Because as usual, I forgot to say something. So I came up with the word panic.</p><p>"Just do this job?"</p><p>"OK! I'll be silent for a while, even if you talk to yourself in despair after that, don't care!"</p><p>"I know"</p><p>After saying that, he put on his headphones and turned his attention to the original manuscript. Obviously you can do it quickly like this from the start. Even if I start to panic after thinking about it like this, he won't hear what I'm thinking.</p><p>This is a very serious situation.</p><p>I clicked the phone silently, thinking about it alone. While it's not that I feel speechless for him, it's not for this reason that I'm not. This is because I have brought the feeling of a dialogue with Kisaragi-san into a dialogue with someone else. And still unconscious.</p><p>By the way, I remember that my father recently started to worry about making friends. Although the content of the worry was very ambiguous, I was taken away, but if I had to say this to my family, I would naturally understand it. It's natural for dad to feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Kisaragi-san became the benchmark for my dialogue.</p><p>I started to swallow meaninglessly. How much did I tell Kisaragi-san?</p><p>Looking back, three months have passed since we started communicating. A quarter of a year has passed. After a lapse of time, summer will soon come. The time for the change of seasons had ended a few days ago. I felt the passage of time again and laughed dryly.</p><p>And the reactions around him started from &#8220;Why are those two people together?&#8221; turning to &#8220;two people will always be together&#8221;. Sometimes, when one went to the library after school, one would notice me from time to time, this must be because of this. The more I thought about it, the few points I could think of started to come to my mind. Even though this isn't an obstacle in my current life, I really want to do something before it's too late.</p><p>For this, the solution I'm thinking of is to leave Kisaragi-san.</p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p>"Oh, what's wrong?"</p><p>He didn't know when, before my eyes, his expression was tinged with a hint of anxiety.</p><p>"I forgot to bring tea and snacks, sorry. I put them in front of you, and you can eat them if you want. And also..."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>Is there something wrong with my homework?</p><p>"Well, if you have a problem, can you tell me&#8230;?"</p><p>Even though I started to feel uncomfortable and asked him, what he said from his mouth worried me. Maybe I put on a really ugly face.</p><p>"Of course after this is over!"</p><p>He didn't wait for my answer before returning to the world of manuscripts. ...Ah, this is not good. Let me say more. Accompanied by a declaration like some sort of slogan, I couldn't help but smile.</p><p>I turned my head slightly, and saw a line of text indicating that there were still thirty minutes before completion. I cut my brain to do the task again. I can't let my friends rank down.</p><p>*</p><h3>Days where it rains</h3><p>Accompanied with satisfaction, I was pleasantly surprised after reading the new works released by my favorite authors and brought my consciousness back to reality. It's pouring rain outside. It seems to have been downloaded while I was obsessed with the books in the library. Even though there's still a period of time before school finishes, can I stop before that?</p><p>"Do you hate rainy days?"</p><p>Kisaragi-san, who was in front of me, threw that question. She&nbsp;seemed to be reading a book too, and a book with a very famous title was placed on the table. She&nbsp;seems to like horror books.</p><p>"Do you think this can be stopped?"</p><p>"Please don't answer a question with a question."</p><p>"Even if you say that"</p><p>Even if you talk about topics you love or hate the weather, wouldn't that be a waste? I basically think so.</p><p>"You see it very well."</p><p>"Not like that. I'm just lazy. Then again, do you think it will stop?"</p><p>"Who knows. I haven't read the weather forecast."</p><p>Oh, so am I.</p><p>"...No matter what, I can't go home with a book today."</p><p>"After all, Hokuto-san's backpack will be soaking wet."</p><p>"That is. Even though I've brought a towel, the textbook isn't available yet. I can't let the book be in any danger."</p><p>I shouldn't have chosen it from a design point of view. I once got my book wet. I can't make a second mistake no matter what. Let's spend time with entertainment other than books in the library today. In that case, maybe I can sleep earlier.</p><p>"that"</p><p>She whispered to me faintly.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Did you bring an umbrella?"</p><p>"I brought it"</p><p>"Did you bring two umbrellas?"</p><p>Her voice was so small that the sound of rain seemed to cover it. Even though it was hard to hear clearly, she said it.</p><p>"Yeah, is it okay for folding umbrellas?"</p><p>"Very helpful. How can I thank you?"</p><p>"No need"</p><p>Unlike the previous buns, the umbrella will not disappear after use.</p><p>"But using rudeness to spoil it is another matter."</p><p>"I wouldn't do that."</p><p>"Yeah. So it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter."</p><p>And if you have a loan, you have to pay it back, which doesn't bother me. This is not something worth asking for in return.</p><p>"That's not good."</p><p>"In that case, I have a recommended book you'd like to read."</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>I stood up and took the book off the shelf.</p><p>"This"</p><p>So that he could see the cover clearly, I put the book in my hand and placed it on the table.</p><p>"The genre is inferential. Since it is a book series, it is now in the seventh volume. Although you may feel uncomfortable due to the thickness of "Can you read it?", please don't worry. The protagonist is unique. The words spoken by the characters in a strong voice and personality, as long as you read it at the beginning, you will finish reading one in a while, and even want to read the second one soon."</p><p>But there are personal differences at this point. She&nbsp;might not be like this either.</p><p>"...But even if my explanation is a bit exaggerated, this book is very interesting. I want you to read one volume first."</p><p>Although I still have something to say, too much excitement will turn into noise. I thought the details could be explained another time, so I handed the book over to her first.</p><p>"Extraordinary"</p><p>There seemed to be admiration in her eyes. But instead of turning her gaze to the book, she turned to me.</p><p>"What's so great?"</p><p>"Hokuto-san's eyes are full of life."</p><p>"What are you saying like I usually have the eye of a dead fish."</p><p>"Don't you always have the eye of a dead fish?"</p><p>"...Is that true?"</p><p>"Really"</p><p>"That's how..."</p><p>Although I don't want to believe it at all, but if she says it by my side almost every day, it must be true. Although I judged her unsentimental expression on her face, I was actually blindfolded myself.</p><p>I can't criticize her position at all.</p><p>*</p><h3>Day of sketching</h3><p>"Uh"</p><p>"Oh, how are you"</p><p>"Hello, what are you doing?"</p><p>What is her tone today.</p><p>"Who do you care about?"</p><p>"I don't care about who?"</p><p>"haah"</p><p>At a disturbing sketch conference. I looked for a place where there were as few people as possible, and finally I looked around and went into the depths of the gymnasium. But I saw the face I always see there, and I suddenly became depressed. However, I gave up looking for a place to continue wasting time. It's not something that can be pulled quickly. So I can't sit five meters away from her. As long as she's at this distance, she can't read my mind.</p><p>"&#8230;Why am I still approaching you even now knowing that you will read my mind?"</p><p>I fixed the paper on the drawing board. Even if you look around, you won't see a good view because of the location.</p><p>"Isn't it because Hokuto-san is so gentle?"</p><p>"Do I look like a gentle person?"</p><p>There is a limit to what I can express with my own abilities. So I gave up and started painting the scenery my eyes could see.</p><p>"Looks like oh"</p><p>The gym's doors were half closed. It looked more rusty than usual, and had cobwebs on it. I referred to this and let the pencils start running across the drawing paper. As a result, some distorted and skewed lines appear on it, and I don't know what to draw. It's for this reason that I hate painting. Only then did I regret entering this school from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>"&#8230;You haven't been with your friends yet."</p><p>Perhaps because there was no answer, she changed the subject.</p><p>"Hiten is very good at painting. Now, he's where he wants to paint."</p><p>"He likes to paint. I can't imagine at all."</p><p>"Aren't you good at drawing?"</p><p>"Ah I. I'm not good at it, so I don't like it."</p><p>"I also."</p><p>"Of course I do, but your painting is very good."</p><p>"Hah!?"</p><p>I looked up from the paper and saw her face close up ahead from my eyes. I can't help but back off.</p><p>"Are you really that surprised?"</p><p>She picked up the paper and pen that fell to the ground due to the reaction force, and puffed out her cheeks in disapproval.</p><p>"Eh, because, shouldn't you also draw?"</p><p>"After all, no matter how hard I try, it looks like a child's painting. So I gave up early."</p><p>I took a paper and a pencil.</p><p>"Would you like to see?"</p><p>I was starting to worry that she would be so low, so I nodded.</p><p>"By the way, where did you paint?"</p><p>"It's a door painting."</p><p>What she showed me was like a child's painting. Even if it is a door, one does not know where it was painted.</p><p>"&#8230;Would it be better if I colored it?"</p><p>"I don't think so, but I'd better draw it first."</p><p>She returned to her position and pressed the paint onto the palette. She&nbsp;started painting, although I was very concerned about the coloring method he used, I who had been drawing the lines until now, started drawing again. Take a pen.</p><p>Although it is very rough, after seeing the painting, I feel that mine is very good.</p><p>*</p><h3>The day the orange disappeared</h3><p>"We've both been in the library until now, haven't we."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>We returned books as usual and borrowed new books. Including going back and forth, we left class for about fifteen minutes. In the classroom, no one was there before or after returning. After all, after school, people were scattered all over the school.</p><p>"I put the oranges on the table before I left. Even though I was going to eat them at that time, after finding out that Hokuto-san went to the library, I put them on the table and followed you out. Since it's impossible. I took them to the library where the food is forbidden, so I put the oranges on the table. There are three oranges."</p><p>Although I don't know the amount, I seem to see oranges on the table.</p><p>"But now, there are no oranges on the table."</p><p>She sighed in exaggeration, and then took a shot.</p><p>"This is a very serious event,"</p><p>She said with an expression like the end of the world.</p><p>"haah"</p><p>People who put oranges on the table and people who eat oranges without permission.</p><p>"No matter which side, I don't want to get involved, can I go back?"</p><p>"No. It's not the fact that oranges are eaten. What matters. What matters is that "all" oranges are eaten."</p><p>"The meaning is unknown."</p><p>I don't want to understand either.</p><p>"The orange is the orange at the bottom of the box."</p><p>"Oranges at the bottom of the box?"</p><p>"It's a fully ripe orange."</p><p>I've heard of it. If you're buying oranges by the box, it's best to start with the oranges at the bottom of the box. And she seemed to confirm my thoughts, and she smiled for a moment.</p><p>"If the three oranges are eaten, the oranges will disappear. It was clearly eaten by someone."</p><p>"&#8230;Uh, right."</p><p>Although I have a lot to say, I want to talk to her now. Talking is really troublesome.</p><p>"If someone knew an orange was ripe, they would definitely eat it."</p><p>"You're absolutely sure."</p><p>"I definitely know. This means that this is someone who is the same as me, or even more similar to me. The crime was committed by the orange man. We might get along well."</p><p>How does it feel to hang out with criminals? Even if you really get along, she's the one who ate your oranges without permission.</p><p>"Sorry if you're in a rush, but can you find it yourself?"</p><p>"Not. Let's find the classrooms one by one first. Come with me."</p><p>My sleeves were caught and I was forcibly dragged away. Arrive outside class. We passed two classrooms where there was no one, and found a student in the third classroom. She&nbsp;saw us appearing suddenly and tilted her head in disbelief.</p><p>"This person is the culprit."</p><p>"It's very fast."</p><p>Where is the evidence to conclude that she was a perpetrator?</p><p>"Her hands are yellow which is the hallmark of eating oranges."</p><p>"Oops, caught"</p>

<p>And it opens very quickly.</p><p>"I think it was revealed after reading minds. This is very common."</p><p>Whether it was her or me, we both tightened our bodies. This was very similar to some of the things he had experienced. Could it be that Kisaragi-san was tempted for some reason?</p><p>"Oranges are delicious!"</p><p>Because of the next sentence, Kisaragi-san smiled triumphantly. Was this to ignore the words just now?</p><p>"So glad you know the delicacy of oranges!"</p><p>She said with a more excited face than usual. It's very strange, and I might be able to understand their next dialogue. It makes no sense to stay here. I used it to let go of my hand and returned to class. Even if she wasn't familiar with people-related matters, she could still have good dialogue with people who ate her own stuff without permission and seemed to be testing others. It's weird.</p><p>When I was about to go home after preparing to go home, she returned to the classroom with a gloomy look.</p><p>"What's wrong with orange conversation"</p><p>"I saw a difference in direction with him, so I went solo."</p><p>"You are a member of the band."</p><p>"She&nbsp;seems to be shedding orange tissue. I can't imagine it."</p><p>"Orange tissue...?"</p><p>"It's white silk on oranges."</p><p>"Oh, isn't it?"</p><p>It's really hard to get along with the things you love.</p><p>*</p><h3>Day to go to the beach</h3><p>The students in uniform disappeared one by one from the swaying tram and advanced. The last few tracks stared at us, mixed with surprise. She&nbsp;didn't care about the gaze, but looked out the window, looking at the passing scenery.</p><p>"Let's go to the beach"</p><p>She stated that she had just met in the morning, with a big smile on her face.</p><p>"...Beach?"</p><p>"Yes. Let's go to the beach."</p><p>She didn't see on her face that she had thought about the trouble going to the beach during her time at school. We are bound to be scolded by others, worried by others, and in the worst case, we may write reflective articles. I refused for a while, saying that I didn't want to get involved. But her sad expression at that time made me hesitate again, and I finally agreed. If it was me in the past, I wouldn't be able to keep up with the perfect attendance award. But this does not mean that I have become slim. Since I knew her from her usual words and actions, I was worried that she would go to the beach alone. Even though she looked very beautiful and intellectual, but the reality was completely different, and it couldn't be like this. I have no other feelings than that.</p><p>"...I say"</p><p>But even so, I still had a question I cared about, so I asked.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Are you planning a crime?"</p><p>"It's a secret"</p><p>"Since you said that, it was probably just a random thought."</p><p>Through the window, I met her eyes. Kisaragi-san mysteriously put her finger on her lips.</p><p>"...It's a secret"</p><p>I couldn't help but feel that stubborn woman was really cute, so I laughed. She frowned sadly, but she looked even prettier. Just as I was about to reach out and touch her head, there was a radio announcement that I would be arriving near the beach. And I immediately withdrew my hand, but when I did this, I was shaken by Kisaragi-san who didn't really hate it. She&nbsp;didn't care about me having her pulse beating in the palm of her hand, but when the tram arrived, she got off the tram with the aim of going to the seaside. I chased after her shakily.</p><p>*</p><p>Sea. This is the sea called mother and so on. Maybe it's salt water. No matter how thirsty you are, you will become even thirstier after drinking it.</p><p>"Your explanation is still too much."</p><p>"&#8230;The sea breeze gently curls Kisaragi-san's beautiful long hair."</p><p>"Is it necessary to dictate it?"</p><p>I ignored her disgusting look and continued.</p><p>"Not only is her hair beautiful. This girl is truly a beautiful girl. It is like a painting, but there is another main reason. It symbolizes the brightness of a high school student. A gray uniform, cloudless blue sky. And a brilliant summer sun and brilliantly projected in the center. In addition, there is a sea that reflects the sun and sparkles. Finally, there is a white sandy beach. This is an image I can't stand. Under the painting, even within reach, I can't stand the scene being photographed but actually, I don't paint, but I also take only equipped with a camera-enabled smartphone. This is really very sorry."</p><p>"Please don't do that, it's annoying."</p><p>"I am really, really sorry."</p><p>An apology without an apology left my mouth.</p><p>"Then, what do you want to do when you come to the beach this time. Did you kill yourself together?"</p><p>"We're not that romantic, are we?"</p><p>"Is co-suicide romantic?"</p><p>"Yeah, it's romantic"</p><p>She's annoying. Although it was a bit bad after asking, it didn't matter what she was thinking at the moment. The terrible thing about suicide had nothing to do with us, so I threw it away immediately.</p><p>"In any case, this is indeed a bit self-defeating. After all, I skipped class and came to the beach."</p><p>She nodded as if to say that it was, and looked around.</p><p>"I can see horizontal lines. Nothing. Maybe we came here at the right time."</p><p>"Do you want to swim?"</p><p>"I don't have a swimsuit."</p><p>"You can swim like this."</p><p>"What are you going to do on your return?"</p><p>"Wait until it's dry. Besides, it's weather like this. It'll be over soon."</p><p>She seemed to really accept these words. She&nbsp;took off her shoes and walked slowly towards the sea. Just as the water reached her knees, she suddenly turned around and poured water on my side.</p><p>"...You are the same"</p><p>But I also took advantage of the momentum and raised the splash with my feet to fight back. After going back and forth for a while, she burst out laughing. And I laughed with her.</p><p><br /></p><p>"<b>It's like dating</b>."</p><p><br /></p><p>"From an unsuspecting person, we have to look like a bad match."</p><p>"Here again, not seeing the person, not to mention, we are not a couple,"</p><p>Even though I understand, But I still hurt my heart because of her straightforward words.</p><p>"I know this kind of thing."</p><p>Feeling the wet uniform heavier, my calm brain started to ache.</p><p>"No, I want to go back"</p><p>"Could you be able to take the tram alone to get back?"</p><p>"Don't treat me like a fool."</p><p>"After all, it's time, so I was wondering if it would be difficult for you to sit like that."</p><p>Oh, I can't take it anymore.</p><p>"&#8230;If we don't go up during the day, we can only sit on it when our clothes are dry."</p><p>"Could you stay with me a little longer, right? That's good."</p><p>She looks happy entrusting her body to the current and floating on the water.</p><p>Seeing her look like this, my heart was pounding for some reason, like I was missing something.</p><p>*</p><h3>On the day of the class competition</h3><p>"Are you here"</p><p>Because a familiar voice suddenly came, I couldn't help but shake my shoulders.</p><p>I ignored the smile on the face of the person looking at me before my eyes, and glanced at the owner of the voice.</p><p>"It's finished?"</p><p>"Because I can't stand it anymore, so I'm lazy. How about you?"</p><p>The owner of the voice walked slowly towards me and sat beside me.</p><p>"We lost"</p><p>"Then what did you do?"</p><p>"Play Othello"</p><p>"Eh, you can tell by looking at it."</p><p>"I also happened to win. Then Nao-san joined in. Let's play a simplified version of the game of life or poker. What kind of game will Nao-san play?"</p><p>Her eyes lit up at the word poker. Able to read my mind, but because of me, she can't read Hiten's mind. This is a tremendous loss.</p><p>"It's too despicable to win and qualify, let's do it again."</p><p>"Idiot. No matter how you do it, the result won't change."</p><p>"Maybe a little bad for me, but do you know what happened today?"</p><p>""Class competition""</p><p>Hiten's and I's voices overlapped. As a result, she showed an expression as if she was saying that you know how to do it. We naturally know that we do.</p><p>"At a time like that, why are you also playing board games in class."</p><p>"After all, I am a withdrawn person. And if you look around, there are people who look like me."</p><p>There are people who do their homework and those who play portable game consoles openly.</p><p>"That meeting is of course only for people who are good at sports. While people like us who are shameless can only spend time like this."</p><p>"You can exercise, and you're not a person to be ashamed of."</p><p>In fact, Across all competitions, there are many persuaders.</p><p>"Oh, I have a working body, and I'm not stubborn enough to be driven by it."</p><p>"Fuck. Your stamina is endless, right?"</p><p>"It's just for talk time."</p><p>Even though he and I said several times to let go, he still chose board games. I think he's handsome. But since he would be very proud after saying it, so I won't say anything.</p><p>"So, what does Nao-san want to play?"</p><p>Hiten asked after he won the Othello game. But when she was asked, her eyes still sparkled. I can understand what I just said, but what now?</p><p>"Ah, and my classmate seems a bit too outspoken, may I call you Nao?"</p><p>"Okay, okay. Uh, what should I call you?"</p><p>"My name is Hatano Hiten. Just call me Hiten."</p><p>"Hiten-san"</p><p>"Uh huh"</p><p>Her eyes were more shining and moving. It seems this is not my illusion.</p><p>"Are you that excited?"</p><p>Even though both of them turned their heads towards me, I set my sights on Kisaragi-san. A smile appeared on the corner of Kisaragi-san's mouth, and Hiten&nbsp;looked intently at Kisaragi-san's expression. She&nbsp;seemed to be saying, is she that excited?</p><p>"I can't help but feel so touched by this name like a friend."</p><p>"It does look like this."</p><p>"Wait a moment. How does Hokuto usually call her?&#8221;</p><p>"I call her Kisaragi-san"</p><p>"&#8230;what about Nao?"</p><p>"I call him Hokuto-san."</p><p>"You guys, you guys really don't seem to have lost touch. Moreover, Nao is using honorifics all the time."</p><p>His expression looked amazing. Thinking of it this way, Hiten&nbsp;seemed to have called Kisaragi-san by name from the start. For someone to be in a relationship with such a positive person like him, it must be very embarrassing.</p><p>"Because you guys have been together for a long time, so I think you guys are really close."</p><p>"Don't the address and tone reflect the character of the character. It's not a good thing to care too much about it."</p><p>"If you say that, I won't have anything to say."</p><p>I took out the game of life and played cards from my school bag. But Kisaragi-san picked up the poker and started shuffling the cards. Don't decide without permission. I stubbornly arrange the pieces of the game of life.</p><p>"Wait a minute!? This is reality now, so the characters are fine."</p><p>Hiten said this as if he was complaining about himself, but I couldn't empathize with what he was saying. Maybe he felt that we didn't say a word, so he proposed a compromise plan.</p><p>"If you care too much about this, how about using your name?"</p><p>"Do you want me to call it that?"</p><p>"I do not want"</p><p>"Look"</p><p>"What do you think. Then, remove the honor?"</p><p>"I'll take it out when the time comes."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>With a worried look, he picked up the cards that were dealt in the past as if it was a matter of course.</p><p>"&#8230;After all, everyone is different!"</p><p>Kisaragi-san smiled as if boasting victory. And I also agree.</p><p>"You should at least deal with the cards once you've decided what to do."</p><p>"Is it okay to play with rich people?"</p><p>"I do not care."</p><p>Resistance seems meaningless. I took the game of life without saying a word.</p><p>*</p><h3>Yakiniku day</h3><p>"Good morning"</p><p>I opened my eyes, checked the time on my phone, and saw that such a text message was sent. Looks like it just shipped. I don't remember sending greeting messages to each other like this. I slowly awakened my mind and eyes, and found that the messenger was Kisaragi. Is there something she doesn't understand about future topics, exams, etc? However, she would confirm it at school every time. And I just followed it yesterday and confirmed the reservation for next week. In that case, does she have anything to look for me. And what is she looking for for me, what is it?</p><p>"Good morning. What is it?"</p><p>I sent a simple text message. To get out of bed, I put my phone on the side. But at this moment, I noticed that another notification popped up.</p><p>"Today is Kisaragi Nao's birthday! Congratulations!!"</p><p>"What!?"</p><p>I suddenly woke up. A strange sweat dripped from me, and I understood that it wasn't because of the hot summer. What am I looking for?</p><p>&#65039;*</p><p>Barbecue sounds came from all directions. The air was filled with the smell of barbecue. At the same time, it is filled with sauce and tastes like butter. Although the taste is good everywhere, but now it's more than that. I stared at the barbecue net and asked myself, is this really that good. However, judging by her expression, it didn't seem very good.</p><p>"Hokuto-san"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>And this is revealed in that voice. I couldn't hide my indecision at all.</p><p>"Well, what's wrong?"</p><p>"Is this a birthday present?"</p><p>"Why grilled meat?"</p><p>"Sushi is better?"</p><p>"No, I didn't mean this"</p><p>"This is not "good morning". If you want to celebrate, honestly say that today is your birthday."</p><p>"Although I really wanted to celebrate, I didn't expect you to go this far."</p><p>"Then why did you come here?"</p><p>"Either it was the person who called me here or brought me here. It's Hokuto-san."</p><p>If she doesn't have time, I still wonder what to do, but luckily, she has some free time. However, it might be bad luck for her.</p><p>"I was just thinking, buying bread from the school cafeteria, or orange jelly, candy, etc... just to celebrate on the surface."</p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't know what a normal birthday present is."</p><p>Cute little things, snacks and the like pop up in my mind. But to say whether it is suitable for a birthday gift, no matter which one, it is very unsuitable.</p><p>"So I brought you here. Where my only friend and I will be on our anniversary."</p><p>"I like oranges, right?"</p><p>"I actually don't want to explain that I didn't expect that as long as I gave you an orange, you would accept it obediently."</p><p>"How cruel&#8230;"</p><p>"Yeah, we'll go where you want to go, then. If you don't want this, just say what you want. "</p><p>"I like meat"</p><p>"Is that all right?"</p><p>"I'm very happy, so it's fine, but it's better to think about it when you're officially hanging out with someone. Is it really that disappointing?"</p><p>"I know. It's almost over? I'm going to barbecue. You came to eat. That's all."</p><p>Thinking it was said, I might die from shame, so I declared like this. Although she lowered her head for a while, showing a complicated expression, in the end, she changed back to her usual appearance.</p><p>"So."</p><p>Seeing her lift up after a while, I smiled as much as I could.</p><p>"Happy Birthday"</p><p>"Thank you very much"</p><p>I subconsciously looked away from her who was embarrassed. no. Sure enough, no matter what it is, it is very shy. Next time I will act after careful consideration.</p><p>"Next time?"</p><p>"...Next time"</p><p>"If there is another time, it will be fine."</p><p>Even though she was saying it word by word, her eyes lit up when she looked at the menu, so it was hard to say. are you serious. And she looked really happy, and in terms of the outcome, it should be okay.</p><p>*</p><p>(Kisaragi POV)</p><p>In the room</p><p>"Happy Birthday! Are you celebrating with Hokuto?"</p><p>After the two announcements sounded, a congratulatory text message from Hiten&nbsp;came along with a cute illustration. Did he draw this illustration? This illustration has the text HAPPY BIRTHDAY written on it, and has the same painting style as Hiten's avatar.</p><p>"Thank you very much. Hokuto-san invited me to eat yakiniku"</p><p>"...Is that true?"</p><p>When I was about to send the words "correct", a second message came.</p><p>"Although that person is a bit like that, but it's not a bad person"</p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal">I deleted the text that had been typed and wrote a new sentence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I know, it doesn't matter. Also, can you tell me about Hiten-san and Hokuto-san's birthdays?"</p><p class="MsoNormal">"It's fine. Hokuto is January 9th, and I'm February 14th. So my birthday present is mixed with Valentine's Day chocolates."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Then sent a sad expression, mixed with a sigh, people can't help but sigh. On such an extraordinary day, one couldn't help but envy him for being born into this world, but because of this, he would run into trouble.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I see. I'll give you something then"</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Thank you. I'll also prepare some gifts for Nao? I'll leave them to you when I see you at school."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Thank you very much, I'm looking forward to it."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Right! When Hokuto's birthday draws near, let's find him something he wants, shall we?"</p><p class="MsoNormal">Although this very charming invitation made my heart flutter, but there was still a long time before his birthday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"No need. Before that time, I will find a way to establish a relationship with Hokuto-san to know what he wants."</p><p class="MsoNormal">The information that had returned at the speed of light so far had been separated by a beat. Just as I was starting to regret that I had to accept it obediently this time, the message came back.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"That's what I like about you. I will support you"</p><p class="MsoNormal">And this kind answer, which was higher than I expected, made me feel good.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Okay, thank you very much"</p><p class="MsoNormal">As soon as I sent the message, I immediately put the phone down. Taking a pen that could write bright colors, I opened the calendar. When I turned back to last December and was about to look at the walls, I noticed that the so-called January and February refer to the following year, and there is no way to mark them on the calendar that is currently in use.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why was my birthday celebrated at that time? Even if I'm very angry, it doesn't help. After a pause, I thought about what to do and looked at the calendar. But even staring at it still doesn't work. So I had no choice but to return the pen and turn on the phone again. Then, I added his second birthday to the calendar function built into the phone. In order not to make me forget, I used the memo function to write it down. Since earlier, I've been thinking about it, I won't forget it, but this is just in case. My memory might be lost suddenly because of something.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I swore to myself that after I bought next year's calendar, I would have to write it down on paper.</p>
