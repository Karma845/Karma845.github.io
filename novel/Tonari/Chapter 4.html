<h2>Chapter 4 Do you want me to go with you during summer vacation?</h2>

<h3>Day of receiving requests</h3><p>"There is a junior who believes in your abilities, please read the mind of the person he likes."</p><p>"...What for?"</p><p>"The goal is to ascertain whether the person has a good impression. That's all. I want to avoid confession failures as much as possible."</p><p>Confessed before summer vacation. Make it run smoothly and spend a nice summer with your sweetheart! Everyone knows such a plot. There was no doubt that he wanted to use this summer as a starting point, start his normal life after enrolling, and deepen his relationship with school activities such as accommodation and class competitions. The reason why it will be communicated through me must be because it's hard to get close to the school's number one beauty and a freak like Kisaragi-san.</p><p>"Haa"</p><p>And she showed a surprised expression. Even though I feel quite stupid, after all, I have agreed with the person who said this to me to pass it on to Kisaragi-san herself. The agreement must be followed.</p><p>"If you decide to help that person, let's think about what to do. It's fine not to help people. I will refuse now."</p><p>"Let me ask a question for a moment. Is it a junior that Hokuto is familiar with?"</p><p>"How is that possible"</p><p>I have few acquaintances among classmates, and it is even more unlikely that I have acquaintances among juniors.</p><p>"How can you say such a tragic thing so calmly."</p><p>"That's a fact."</p><p>I'm just stating facts, I don't let people say it's pathetic.</p><p>"For me personally, it's very cruel to decide whether to confess based on other people's good intentions. So"</p><p>"Hokuto-san is playing a love game, right?"</p><p>She interrupted me and asked an inexplicable question. Rather, I was in contrast to her who showed a slightly cheerful expression somehow, showing a bitter expression.</p><p>"Almost."</p><p>"If you don't gather a lot of people's opinions, will you still confess?"</p><p>Ah, she's talking about this.</p><p>"No"</p><p>"There's no opinion bar in reality. Without choices, it's naturally impossible to know what to choose to make that person happy. He's upset about it."</p><p>I can understand what she's saying. But I don't think so.</p><p>"Do you think this is okay?"</p><p>This is the reality. There are no opinion bars, and there is no fixed and correct route. Isn't this common knowledge?</p><p>"I just want to say that the bitterness of love can only be understood by those who have fallen in love. A shameless person like us, no matter what, has no right to comment on him who decided to confess."</p><p>I didn't expect her to come to this point. I didn't want to continue to argue, but looked away from her.</p><p>"...I can't accept it."</p><p>"It's just a student's love. It's best to watch them gently."</p><p>"Where's the view?"</p><p>Compared to drowning in someone else's love, she in this tone prefers to tease me. This may be her real heart. In short, she was very interested in this request.</p><p>"See what you look like, are you willing to accept this request?"</p><p>"Yes, I will accept"</p><p>"You're serious?"</p><p>"I'm seriously."</p><p>I glanced at her and nodded when I looked at her with a satisfied expression. She looked very excited. And this is right for the person assigned. I judged that I shouldn't continue to be stubborn, so I turned to her obediently. And she seemed to say that this was true, and the corners of her mouth loosened a little.</p><p>"Then, let's decide to digest from this request."</p><p>"Oh, I see."</p><p>The name "Digest Mode" fits her style very well.</p><p>"Is there a method name from him?"</p><p>"No, he didn't say anything."</p><p>"What does that have to do with people having a good opinion of him?"</p><p>"He said they still have a good relationship now. Friends"</p><p>"Yeah. So let's do this. Let me read their minds while they're having a conversation."</p><p>"It's very simple and straightforward."</p><p>"Do you think so too?"</p><p>Do you think so too?</p><p>"How could it be!"</p><p>She sighed deeply and unabashedly for me who couldn't help but repeat it in my brain subconsciously, and was still complaining to myself. You don't understand anything. Even though her gaze said this, how could I not understand.</p><p>"What's wrong, isn't it simple and clear?"</p><p>"This kind of thing is quite troublesome"</p><p>"Why. Ah, is it a matter of distance?"</p><p>"Although there is this reason. Because it's a bit hard to explain, so about me My ability has something I haven't explained to you yet."</p><p>She crossed her arms and seemed to be thinking about how to explain it. Is there any new information?</p><p>"Is it difficult to explain?"</p><p>"What do you doubt?"</p><p>"No, nothing."</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he spoke heavily.</p><p>"For example&#8230; well, I haven't heard the name of the client."</p><p>"Oh, sorry. Its name is Aizawa Kota. By the way, the person he likes is Todokoro Mizuki. They are all first year students."</p><p>"I know. Then let's move on."</p><p>"Please tell"</p><p>"For example, if Todokoro-san hides her affection in front of Aizawa-san, we just need to read her mind and sort it out. Almost the same, then tell Todokoro-san, right?"</p><p>I can't help but laugh at the metaphor.</p><p>"Almost. Almost the same."</p><p>"Yes, almost the same. But if it's hidden or not, we have to guide it. "Do you have someone you like?", "What do you think of me?", ...Almost like this."</p><p>"Then just read as usual, okay?"</p><p>"But this is different from the thinking you have, dialogue and debriefing. Sometimes I don't think about the reply."</p><p>"Ha..."</p><p>What is it? She just stared at me silently. I feel the oppression that sometimes prompts you to think about it.</p><p>Will not think of a reply back.</p><p>"...If you say something right away, or if you don't take random feigns seriously, you might not be able to connect your thoughts and words."</p><p>"That's it. "Really, when are you going to watch TV?", "Hurry up and do your homework!", "I knew it!", In this kind of dialogue, it's easy to understand"</p><p>Why would she imitate someone who doesn't complain about other people. I can't even laugh.</p><p>"So you can understand, right? Let's continue."</p><p>"Okay"</p><p>"It doesn't matter whether to accept it or not when I read her mind, so his request will fail. For me it's just a little bit of stuff, but it's not for him."</p><p>She and my eyes met.</p><p>"If he was angry then, could you help me?"</p><p>"Am I going too?"</p><p>"Wasn't Hokuto-san the one who accepted the request? Isn't that of course?"</p><p>I was so affirmed by her.</p><p>But this is fine.</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>Since the problem is solved, I can only do this. I picked up the phone and opened the screen of the shipping address he gave me just now.</p><p>"When and where do you want to hear it?"</p><p>"If they're free, they'll be in the library tomorrow after school."</p><p>She made up her mind and blinked. In his pupils opening again, I see confidence.</p><p>"Let's end it early."</p><p>-</p><p>Continued</p><p>In the library after school the day I received the request. Seeing me and Kisaragi-san enter, the junior in charge smiled wryly. We only came here to borrow and return books, so I still hope he doesn't care.</p><p>"Sorry. I'll leave it to you."</p><p>"Me too, please."</p><p>"Okay~"</p><p>The book return procedure is very fast.</p><p>"Thank you"</p><p>"No, thank you"</p><p>Looked around the library, and there was no one here today. Then, as long as someone comes in, we should be able to find out who the client is. Therefore, we cannot avoid sudden visits. So when we let a client in, we beckon us. Rather, it is the only way to do this. Since Kisaragi-san couldn't use her abilities while beside me, I waited for Aizawa Yasuta near the entrance. And Kisaragi-san should be near the bookshelf in the depths. I turned my gaze over there, and saw her serious expression and the scattered left side of her body. This is scary, stop it.</p><p>As we did this, the sound of the door opening was heard.</p><p>Turning his head to look, what caught his attention was a man with a refreshing appearance, he was Aizawa Kota. In that case, the person smiling next to him should be Todokoro Mizuki. She's at Kisaragi-san's level, which is perfect for the word cute. I immediately signaled to Kisaragi-san with my eyesight. When he realized this, he put down his scattered hands. Aizawa and the others engaged in a conversation that we basically couldn't hear, and chose the book. From them, there was an atmosphere they used to feel even though they weren't comfortable with the library. Maybe it's just that I don't know, they might as well be the people who use the library. This is really rare.</p><p>So. If Kisaragi-san had not read it as described the day before, he would have told me, and then read the book in a way that Aizawa could understand at a glance. I turned my gaze to him every now and then, but because of the obstruction, I couldn't see him. Does this indicate that there is no problem.</p><p>"Hokuto-san"</p><p>"Oh"</p><p>I don't know when, she arrived in front of me. She&nbsp;turns blue and grabs the corner of my clothes.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>I also came here to borrow a book, so I left without explaining clearly, which made me feel a little regretful.</p><p>"Please"</p><p>But since I was asked, I couldn't refuse. I let her pull and leave the library. There is no wish of my own in this. Reluctantly I moved my hand to the bottom of my clothes and ran after her.</p><p>After returning to class, she sat down in her chair and sighed.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>I put the pencil case on the table back into my backpack and prepared to head home. And it looks like she's been doing it for a long time.</p><p>"She&nbsp;likes it without a doubt."</p><p>"Isn't that happy for everyone?"</p><p>"But the longing is deep and heavy. It's not something to be heard casually..."</p><p>She kept shaking and hugged her own shoulders. She&nbsp;seemed to have heard something terrible. She&nbsp;was very frightened, dealing with all kinds of ideas almost every day.</p><p>"Isn't it possible that you met someone who felt that way?"</p><p>"Right. Why is that&#8230;"</p><p>"After all, even you feel heavy."</p><p>I can only say that.</p><p>"So..."</p><p>She immediately put on a serious expression, and placed the hand that was holding her shoulder on her thigh. Where did the vibration go?</p><p>"However, I will edit similar content later and post it. Thank you for helping me. In that case, I apologize."</p><p>"You're being completely honest. Can you buy me some jelly on the way back?"</p><p>"Ahhh, buy, buy, buy"</p><p>Just as we were about to head back and walk towards the door, there was a patter running down the corridor. But the purpose of the voice turned out to be this class. The door suddenly opened, and Aizawa-kun, panting heavily, emerged from there.</p><p>"So how!?"</p><p>He seemed to have come here just to hear the results. He was really scorching hot.</p><p>"Ah, that was the result, right?"</p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p>Kisaragi-san jumped up and took a step forward.</p><p>"Your confession will definitely work."</p><p>"Is that true!?"</p><p>"Yes that's correct."</p><p>In the blink of an eye, his expression became even more cheerful. Finally he showed a full smile and extended his hand to Kisaragi-san. And after hesitating for a moment, Kisaragi-san also reached out and shook her hand.</p><p>"Thank you very much! How should I respond..."</p><p>"Nothing. Even if you know that she has a good impression of you, you can't go on without putting it into words. And when you walk by each other, if you guys don't understand each other, it will be hard to keep it up for a long time. It all depends on how you do it."</p><p>He smiled literally, took his school bag in his hands, and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>"I wish you happiness"</p><p>I gently nodded at him who was standing blankly, and followed Kisaragi-san out of the classroom. When I left, I saw his face was still full of smiles.</p><p>What is called not knowing is happiness, and it does exist in the world.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Ice cream day</h3><p>"What about negotiating approaches?"</p><p>"No problem. How about Hokuto-san?"</p><p>"I have no problem."</p><p>The goal for first grade hasn't changed, and I'm still working hard towards it.</p><p>"Oh, let's talk"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I was told that I could be a fortune teller in the worst case."</p><p>"Ah&#8230;"</p><p>I can understand what this means. The so-called being able to understand what the other party was thinking was a useful ability to make people believe in prophecies. But suggesting this to students is still very strange to me.</p><p>"The headmaster seems to approve of your rumours."</p><p>"It seems so. The principal also said that the existence of such extraordinary things is more interesting."</p><p>"Don't think it's funny..."</p><p>"This is much better than being scared for no reason. Oh"</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>It doesn't matter what other people say. Strange that I care so much about this.</p><p>I reset my mood and turned my gaze to the ice cream box. Considering my current mood, I started to think about which one tastes better. Thinking of the heat outside, I wanted a refreshing taste. Today is soda sherbet. After all, it is in a cup, if it melts, put it in the refrigerator and freeze.</p><p>And Kisaragi-san next to me, on the other hand, looked really annoyed.</p><p>"If there was a orange flavor I would definitely be able to decide right away, but it really stresses me out without it."</p><p>"Since there is no orange taste, how about this flavor?"</p><p>"I'm very depressed."</p><p>She answered the same lines as an NPC. She&nbsp;seems to really like oranges. This actually surprised me a little.</p><p>"Then go buy some orange jelly, how about eating it after you get back?"</p><p>"I thought about it too, but I still want to eat it, I want to eat it now. You see, eating popsicles on the way home from school, Isn't that quite hopeful?"</p><p>I imagined the situation for a moment, but had no longing for it.</p><p>"Eh, I don't understand."</p><p>"No matter what, I don't dare to do it myself."</p><p>She didn't listen to what other people had to say, and ended up buying a vanilla flavored popsicle. After leaving the shop, she immediately opened the bag and threw it in the trash outside. She ate the popsicle and showed a satisfied expression. Bathed in the sun, the popsicles immediately began to melt. But she made a very good sound and took a bite and ate it. On the remaining wooden sticks, there are some words that will be missing, "No Win". The sticks were also thrown in the trash, and we returned home again.</p><p>"What do you think after doing what you have been waiting for?"</p><p>"I feel what is called youth. Next time Hokuto-san will be together too"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"No reason"</p><p>"Stop that reply"</p><p>I think back to the initial encounter goosebumps appear on the body.</p><p>At that time, it was a very warm and comfortable climate. Having said that, it hadn't actually been a few months.</p><p>And what about now. Under the sunlight coming from above, the heat reflected by the concrete beneath my feet became aggressive again. In addition, the cries of crickets came from all directions, making the heat even higher. I really wanted to go home and roll under the air conditioner.</p><p>"Summer vacation is coming soon"</p><p>She muttered to herself in a low voice.</p><p>"Even though it's a holiday, there really isn't much time to rest."</p><p>Summer classes line up in the first half and second half of the holiday. In fact, there is no difference from class. If you do not participate, it will affect the next course.</p><p>"That's what it says, but isn't summer vacation still full of hope?"</p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't have pure feelings in my heart."</p><p>"You are still the same as before, and you can see it. Then, what about Hokuto-san. How about spending the summer vacation?"</p><p>"Carry out a task"</p><p>"I mean other than that."</p><p>"Digesting accumulated games and books"</p><p>After that, I should have played with Hiten. There is no difference between this holiday and usual.</p><p>"It has nothing to do with summer."</p><p>"Leave me alone."</p><p>"It's rare after all, let's go to the festival together."</p><p>"If you invite me, I have no reason not to go."</p><p>"Really? Can you? "</p><p>She said it clearly, but she was shaking. Did she think I would refuse.</p><p>"I have no reason to refuse."</p><p>Her expression immediately became cheerful. I also thought about it, is it okay for me to go to the festival with her. But seeing her happy, seemed too unattractive to deny it.</p><p>"Then let's go together. How many days in advance is it better to call?"</p><p>"The day before or the day is fine."</p><p>Basically no reservation, even if the reservation is filled, it must be only a few days.</p><p>"If there is a first appointment, I will not go."</p><p>"Of course"</p><p>Just when we were like this, I walked to my house.</p><p>"I see, see you tomorrow,"</p><p>She waved.</p><p>"Ah, see you tomorrow"</p><p>I didn't wave my hand, but looked back at her. I didn't enter the house until I couldn't see her reflection. This summer vacation, at least looks like summer vacation.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Summer class day</h3><p>It's summer vacation. Because of that, I still live in the days of going to school every day to attend an additional class which is basically mandatory and is called Summer Class. Because there is also a problem, so I have to go to school. I can't help but think about what summer vacation is all about. What exactly is summer vacation? Even if I think about it, I can't get the answer, I only know that going to class when I can't gather my energy because of the heat, can only be said to be very bad.</p><p>After the lecture, it was to discuss what to do at the cultural festival held in the fall.</p><p>In principle, second-year students use the gymnasium stage to announce stage plays or dances. Although it seems that several classes broke away from last year, this class will follow suit.</p><p>"If a stage play is going to be held, do you have anything you want to do?"</p><p>"Yes! Romeo and Juliet!&#8221;</p><p>"If you want to talk about drama, definitely this."</p><p>"There is a class in that show to play."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"Truly. Although it hasn't been decided yet, it seems to be basically determined."</p><p>"So can anyone think of a program other than Romeo Juliet?"</p><p>People who have authority in the class began to actively give their opinion. Make decision. After all, after entering the second semester, I will definitely share the responsibilities. After that, the responsibility will definitely be my turn.</p><p>While thinking, I want to return immediately, while waiting vacantly for time to pass.</p><p>~</p><p>Three days later. Our class appearance was finally decided to be "Snow Princess". At this time, the so-called majority decision can be described as very convenient.</p><p>After this incident, the class asked everyone to read Snow Princess's book at least once during summer vacation.</p><p>"I don't have picture books at home, so I have to go to the library."</p><p>"Waiting for your visit."</p><p>Sentences are spoken immediately. This is because I only think of this sentence while speaking.</p><p>"Just borrow it as a textbook, right?"</p><p>"Just that. Just put the books they borrowed on the bookshelf in class."</p><p>"Yes, yes."</p><p>Because there is teacher guidance in primary and secondary schools, this system is often used.</p><p>"I haven't heard of it in a long time. Is there such a system in high school?"</p><p>"I do not know"</p><p>"Hah?"</p><p>While it's a bit bad to say that, high schools don't use this system, and I haven't seen anyone use this system yet. .</p><p>"Next time, I'll ask the homeroom teacher."</p><p>"If it can be borrowed, I have to talk to the people in class."</p><p>Just that. If no one knows, of course no one will read it. In order for them to read it, I need to show them to some extent and inform them of the book's whereabouts.</p><p>"Then don't do it."</p><p>"Even if most people don't know the contents, the person in charge of the script will definitely do something about it."</p><p>"That"</p><p>By the way, Snow Princess. The first impression is to look in the mirror and ask who is the daughter of the most beautiful person in the world, and a poisoned apple.</p><p>"This is the story that the prince of the corpse lovers will appear."</p><p>"Let's stop that perception of yours."</p><p>According to the way of expression, this may not be wrong, but it is not a feature worth choosing.</p><p>"Is the lover's body in love with the adult prince of Snow Princess's resurrection to do?"</p><p>"After all, it's called Snow Princess. She has to face it not as white as death, like that?"</p><p>"Like me?"</p><p>At her next to me took a step forward and walked in front of me. Long black hair and pupils, white skin. Researching again, she fits the term Snow Princess very well.</p><p>"possible"</p><p>In my brain, she is wearing a dress like a princess, with birds and squirrels standing on her shoulders and wrists. Finally, the animals fell to the ground.</p><p>"It feels like you will kill any forest beast that comes into contact with you."</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and laughed. Both affirmative and negative, she came back to my side.</p><p>"I'm looking forward to the cultural festival."</p><p>"Eh, let's stop so as not to overdo it."</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Match day</h3><p>I saw Kisaragi-san jump into the water in a daze.</p><p>"Not good for jumping,"</p><p>Said a young man like a bystander loudly. But she who had entered the water must not have heard it either. Diving should be prohibited, and she has not done any preparatory exercises. Next time she shows up, I need to remind her.</p><p>"Aren't you going to swim?"</p><p>The man who was watching me said to me. From the outside, he should be a student. A nameplate reading "Morioka" hung under his neck. His blonde hair and smiling face that wasn't worried at all was dazzling. I, who was shrinking in front of him, greeted him and said that I could sit in the chair next to him. And he happily agreed.</p><p>"Thank you very much."</p><p>"It's late after all, and no one will be sitting here."</p><p>She swam leisurely in the almost covered pool. She&nbsp;seems to be very good at swimming. She&nbsp;hit back in the 25 meter freestyle lane.</p><p>Isn't that very happy?</p><p>"What's your relationship with her?"</p><p>"We're friends."</p><p>To this expected question, I answered with the words I had always thought of.</p><p>"Didn't you go swimming?"</p><p>And this sentence, I also expected it.</p><p>"About this, I suddenly asked her to pull over without knowing anything, so I didn't bring a swimsuit."</p><p>If she obediently told me that I was going to the pool, I definitely wouldn't have left the house. When she said that she wanted to go to the convenience store and forcibly took me outside, she said that she wanted to swim where there were no people, and then she took me to the residents' swimming pool, which would be open until late at night. Even though I really wanted to go back right away, after she asked for a very expensive ice cream, coming back without saying a word would make me very guilty.</p><p>"You can buy all the swimming props here."</p><p>"Haa..."</p><p>This is a dialogue line that I didn't expect. I didn't want to swim to that point, but he said to me happily. This makes it difficult for me to answer negative words.</p><p>"If you buy it, you can go swimming."</p><p>"Uh, this"</p><p>I bought a swimsuit from someone I just met. This is a situation that people don't really want to be in. Moreover, according to the type of swimsuit and the small amount of accessories, he will definitely let me buy something that is never cheap.</p><p>"Eh, this is a bit embarrassing, I'm sorry."</p><p>"But she can't be happy alone. If she was a hermit type of swimmer, you could come and train with her, but you don't have that kind of atmosphere."</p><p>Morioka turned his attention to the swimming pool. After I followed him and averted my gaze, I saw Kisaragi-san looking at this side with an extraordinary face for quite some time.</p><p>"Well, do you want to swim alone? Or do you want to swim with that child?"</p><p>She showed a pair of eyes that shone like water. She&nbsp;would show this expression, which surprised me.</p><p>"As far as possible, I want to swim with her."</p><p>"I understand"</p><p>What do you understand.</p><p>"Even if you say so"</p><p>However, aren't there many things to consider. For example, gender, age, etc, various things. Maybe he noticed my unresponsive mind, and he smiled a little.</p><p>"Aren't you 'friends'? It's okay. I'm watching too."</p><p>The things I wanted to express came out like a mountain, and my brain went blank. I was grabbed by Morioka's hand, and when I regained consciousness, I changed into a swimsuit. No, I was alone when I changed clothes. After seeing the brightly colored seawater pants, I still feel like I don't want to wear them, I still have the consciousness to have some doubts about it. Obviously it would be fine without this, and I can't help but think so. Seeing me in a swimsuit, Morioka said something afterward. Isn't that appropriate? Such exact words.</p><p>"Thank you very much?"</p><p>Ah, but if the word "fit" means the size is perfect, then that's okay. The size is just right.</p><p>Uh, but so what.</p><p>"Yeah. But the shock after taking it off wasn't enough. Maybe it's better to have more muscle. See, isn't there such a thing as falling into cuteness? I was thinking, you can use this too. Is this the goal??"</p><p>"I'll handle it properly."</p><p>Before my response, Morioka said to Kisaragi-san.</p><p>"You haven't done any preparatory exercises yet?"</p><p>"Oh, I forgot. It doesn't matter."</p><p>She came to the pool, of course in a bathing suit. But at a glance, it looks like wearing ordinary clothes. It wasn't until I got close that I finally knew that it was a cloth similar to a swimsuit. But it's not good to look directly to make people misunderstand, so I immediately avert my eyes. We must be a moderate friendship.</p><p>"You don't fit in at all."</p><p>"I know"</p><p>Suitable for this, maybe only people who can sing about life. The Morioka in front of me matched this perfectly. After being reminded by him, after finishing the preparatory exercises, we slowly entered the water. Since the water is warm, it is easy to enter.</p><p>"Do you know how to swim?"</p><p>"I do not know"</p><p>"Do you?"</p><p>"Because I haven't been swimming in a long time."</p><p>Our high school does not have a swimming pool. The last time I swam was when I was in middle school. Back then I should have been able to swim, but what about now.</p><p>"At least, when I was a high school student, 25 meters was easy to do."</p><p>"Instead of talking about the past, let's go for a swim."</p><p>"No need to tell."</p><p>I tried to push my feet to the side. from the pool at the corner of the swim path. Hands outstretched. Then, I switched to freestyle, swam forward, and finally reached the end of the other side smoothly. My body seems to remember how to swim. On the side of the swimming path, Kisaragi-san gently clapped.</p><p>"Good~ awesome"</p><p>"You think I'm stupid"</p><p>"I just didn't expect you to actually be able to swim, so I was just surprised. How. Do you want to compete faster than everyone else??"</p><p>"If I wanted to,"</p><p>"Sir!"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"We want to compare them, so can you be a signal to start?"</p><p>"Oh yes! It looks very interesting!"</p><p>Isn't that the happiest he is? Morioka got up from his chair laughing, and stood by the pool. Kisaragi-san and I are standing on different paths on the same side.</p><p>"Are you ready?"</p><p>"Ready!"</p><p>Kisaragi-san smiled as if boasting victory before the game started. She&nbsp;must have great confidence in swimming. Now that I've accepted the game, I naturally don't want to lose. There must be a chance to win.</p><p><br /></p><p>. . . . . .</p><p><br /></p><p>"It's closing soon, please change clothes quickly!"</p><p>Morioka's voice and clapping brought me back to reality.</p><p>In the end, I couldn't beat her even once. I didn't think she was that good at swimming. To beat it, it might be better to work some muscles.</p><p>After changing clothes and wiping my wet hair with a towel, I walked out. Kisaragi-san seems the same, but because of her hairstyle, she looks younger than usual.</p><p>"Do you like this type?"</p><p>"If you don't like your little sister, you like someone who looks young."</p><p>In the little sister attribute, there are also characters with different appearances. I don't chase the young.</p><p>"This is really hard."</p><p>"It doesn't matter what type I like."</p><p>Although it's not impossible, it's not a conversation that can be said immediately after exiting the residents' swimming pool.</p><p>"By the way, when I talk about the type I like, by the way, how about my swimsuit?"</p><p>"It's not like a swimsuit, it's more like a dress."</p><p>"For Hokuto-san, bikini should be better, right?"</p><p>Since this question was very natural to ask, I naturally expressed my most straightforward thoughts. After that, she immediately said something very bold with a serious expression on her face, and I subconsciously said to wait for me to stop her.</p><p>"What does it mean?"</p><p>"After all, Hokuto-san is a high school boy."</p><p>I couldn't hold back a groan.</p><p>"You really are inexplicably stubborn."</p><p>"Then what is it?"</p><p>"Everyone has something that fits? Kisaragi-san is more suited to the things you just wore than that pretty thing."</p><p>"How about that?"</p><p>"In short, what ah?"</p><p>"Cute?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how."</p><p>"Why ah!"</p><p>"Because I thought it would be sexual harassment."</p><p>"...... maybe so,"</p><p>I looked away from her who looked at me with disdain. By my side, she looked away and stepped forward.</p><p>"The main thing is! Hurry back. Parents will be worried.&#8221;</p><p>Even though it was explained earlier, even so, it is necessary to return soon.</p><p>"Summer days are very long, so there's no problem. Festivals can be held until ten o'clock. That's normal."</p><p>"Your idea is not good."</p><p>Isn't it hard to send you home? Just as I was very dissatisfied, there was a surprised voice next to me. She&nbsp;looked at me unexpectedly.</p><p>"Will you send me back?"</p><p>"Uh, of course."</p><p>"You are so gentle."</p><p>"If something happens to you on the way back, I don't want to be the first to be suspected."</p><p>"It's fine to say it directly."</p><p>"What did you say. "</p><p>She shrugged as if to say there was nothing you could do, and sighed. I really can't do anything about you, really. Couldn't even take a breath.</p><p>As we walked, we looked up at the sky which was darker than before. The faintly visible stars were shining and moving.</p><p>"Let's come here again if we have the chance. If this continues, I'll turn to winning and running."</p><p>She spun around, laughed like a little devil, and seemed to be planning to keep running if he won. Can I beat her again this summer.</p><p>I started to think about this kind of thing before denying it next time, and I realized that I had some regrets about losing this.</p><p>After returning, let's examine the methods for training muscles.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Fireworks day</h3><p>Strontium is red, sodium is yellow, and barium is green. There are a few more. Using the color reaction of the flames, the flames can be colored, and various beautiful flowers bloom in the sky.</p><p>This is the fireworks.</p><p>This is called the fireworks festival.</p><p><br /></p><p>As I said earlier, I was invited by her earlier, and since there was no other appointment, I agreed. When do you hear fireworks in an air-conditioned room? After all, this will undoubtedly go to the festival again after a long time. The sun had set, and in the park before summer, I was wrapped in insect repellent, waiting for her.</p><p>The people aiming for the fireworks had passed before my eyes countless times. The scheduled meeting time is seven o'clock. No matter how many times I looked at the phone, the scheduled time had passed. No response to messages sent recently. Is there something wrong? On the day of this summer festival. Even though it wasn't very dark, it was also at night. I'm starting to care if she's involved in some weird incident, and she's agitated. Either send another text message or call to ask. As I continued to think while looking at the contact address, the phone showing her name called. The clicking finger trembled involuntarily.</p><p>"Hello. This is Usami"</p><p>"Hokuto-san, right? I'm Kisaragi"</p><p>"What's wrong? Nothing happened, right?"</p><p>"Sorry. I got the timing wrong. So it's a bit late."</p><p>After she finished saying this, she one-sidedly hung up. The end of the call text is listed on the screen. Even though this was a very short conversation, the voice that came had a sense of disharmony. In particular, my own voice mixed with hers and reached me.</p><p>This shouldn't be possible. After turning around suspiciously, under the toy, I saw a familiar face.</p><p>"Kisaragi-san?"</p><p>"Ah"</p><p>"Do you?"</p><p>Even though she immediately looked back and wanted to leave, I immediately chased after her. After I stood in front of her and blocked her, she immediately stopped and groaned.</p><p>"Hey, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>She didn't raise her head or answer.</p><p>"If you feel unwell, don't force it. If you come back, I will take you away."</p><p>"That's not the case."</p><p>Her tone was very clear. So I don't think she's lying.</p><p>"There's nothing uncomfortable about your body, right?"</p><p>"Well, no"</p><p>Then, I can feel relieved for now.</p><p>"Then what's the matter with you?"</p><p>"I don't think the yukata fits very well."</p><p>"Eh...."</p><p>As she said, she came here wearing a very beautiful yukata. On the water-colored cloth, there is a pattern of a red goldfish swimming. The hair is tied up, and the flower decoration is shaking. To match this, she wore clogs, so even if she wanted to leave, she couldn't walk fast.</p><p>"In short, stand up if you can stand. The yukata will get dirty."</p><p>After I stretched out my hand, she lifted her head and looked straight at my hand. After urging her to quicken my gaze, I dragged her up. What she was holding should be a wallet. This could be said to be a costume prepared for the summer festival.</p><p>"This outfit makes you suddenly embarrassed?"</p><p>She nodded gently at my question.</p><p>"...Yes."</p><p>She must have thought it was a summer festival after all, so she came here wearing a yukata. Maybe it was because there were fewer people wearing yukata than she thought, and she was embarrassed. Because of that, she called me and said that she would be late, and that she had to come back to change. It must be so.</p><p>I followed her gaze. There was a slight redness on her face. I caught her gaze. And she might have given up her heart, so she nodded gently.</p><p>"No need to feel ashamed."</p><p>This isn't a person who isn't wearing a yukata, much less.</p><p>"Does this suit me?"</p><p>"...Shouldn't those words come out of my mouth?"</p><p>Shouldn't it have come from someone more intimate. For example, a lover or something. Instead, I had to look away this time, and then he looked at me intently.</p><p>"I have a close relationship with Hokuto-san, do I?"</p><p>"&#8230;Ah, that's right"</p><p>The hem of my sweater was tightly gripped by her. She didn't seem to let me run.</p><p>"It's beautiful, isn't it normal?"</p><p>I said it without bringing up any mood. And he laughed happily. Why is he smiling happily?</p><p>*</p><p>I don't want to think about it at all.</p><p>When he finished, Hiten just finished his Coke. We went to the drinks bar again and made a second Coke. He put the cup on the table very rudely.</p><p>"Then, how?"</p><p>"Then I met Kazuka Yano, who was holding a lot of water in her hands, and she returned some to Kisaragi-san."</p><p>"I don't want to hear you say this."</p><p>But I guessed it will occur. But I just left this impression, there's nothing more to say.</p><p>"What about the fireworks?"</p><p>"Very beautiful. But I don't think it's something worth seeing in such a hot time."</p><p>Hiten took a deep breath. He couldn't seem to say a word. I can't help but sigh that he can take a deep breath.</p><p>"While I was being chased by manuscripts and topics, did you really enjoy your youth?"</p><p>"Youth time?"</p><p>I can understand the word youth and the word time. But when these two words are combined to describe myself, I have no idea what they mean at all.</p><p>"Are you not aware?"</p><p>"No"</p><p>"I knew it would turn out like this. At school, weren't you always with Nao? You still don't seem to think it's unnatural for you to be together?"</p><p>He will speak like a curse. I don't deny the fact of being together, and I also know that it's unnatural to some extent. As for why I didn't go beside her. I don't want to know or think about this kind of thing.</p><p>"That"</p><p>"Okay, I know! This anger has nowhere to go!"</p><p>"What makes you angry..."</p><p>"This is a place like this for you! After all, it's you who pays this bill!"</p><p>"Uh, why?"</p><p>He didn't listen to me, and after saying that, he opened the menu again.</p><p>"Excuse me!"</p><p>He purposely called the clerk in a loud voice and ordered two French fries and a strawberry parfait. And I took advantage of the trend and ordered a cheesecake. Finally, while eating the Buffy cake he brought, he slowly calmed down. His expression became very gentle.</p><p>"Summer vacation is coming to an end"</p><p>He said effortlessly, erasing the regretful expression just now, and rearranging the subject. Due to this sudden change, my reaction was a bit slow.</p><p>"&#8230;That's what I said."</p><p>"Have you won it once?"</p><p>He was referring to the swimming competition I mentioned earlier.</p><p>"Even though there were three chances to fight again, I didn't win the match."</p><p>Even after that, I practiced alone for a few days. But even if I chase her to an extreme position, she will still win in the end.</p><p>"Nao is very strong."</p><p>"Yes. If possible, I want to beat her once this year.&#8221;</p><p>I checked and the residents pool seems to be able to swim in winter. Although it is difficult to win it in the summer, if this year, there must be some changes for the better.</p><p>"...To be honest, I'm surprised you have this kind of fighting spirit."</p><p>"Makes sense."</p><p>It really makes me feel young.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Last day of summer vacation</h3><p>"Stupid"</p><p>"Um"</p><p>"stupid fool"</p><p>"Don't say it over and over like this idiot!"</p><p>"Then I ask you, how many days are left in summer vacation?"</p><p>"Only today remains"</p><p>"What about your remaining duties?"</p><p>"Japanese and Maths, and..."</p><p>"Ah, that's enough. Needless to say, it's better to say that you don't need to continue. I'm just reiterating. You idiot."</p><p>After receiving his complaint that he couldn't finish his project, I came to many people near the school. The study room in the multi-purpose hall. And with a tearful expression on his face, he desperately copied the answer to the subject. I should have told him to let him finish, but now he has no time to spare. The task he couldn't complete was more than five times what I expected.</p><p>"Why did you leave so many left."</p><p>"I'll ask, why did Hokuto finish? Not just summer class, you and I went swimming, went to summer festivals, and went to the park to blow bubbles with me."</p><p>"Because I do my homework at home"</p><p>"Me, I do homework too!?"</p><p>"This time because the result wasn't like that. Don't look at me, look at your problem quickly."</p><p>"My hands are starting to hurt."</p><p>"Of course it's because you started torturing it crazily. If you don't do it bit by bit, it will become like this."</p><p>I always see some students who can't finish his project. The scene of being scolded by the teacher, but now he did not expect that he would become one of those students.</p><p>"Could it be that you often do this during long vacations?"</p><p>"No, only this time it was really bad."</p><p>"...You said it was special, you didn't deny that it was done reluctantly."</p><p>"...Hey"</p><p>"You really."</p><p>Even if he put on a cute look here and gently tilted his head, the topic would not be finished.</p><p>"Every time I feel a crisis that I don't act quickly, it's not good?"</p><p>"If you don't act on a sense of crisis, it's meaningless."</p><p>"But&#8230;"</p><p>He had moved his hand. His speed suddenly started to slow down. He clearly knew it wouldn't work if he didn't do it quickly, and when I wanted to interrupt and ask why he'd stopped, he said.</p><p>"From the start, I felt Hokuto was three times tighter than usual."</p><p>"After all, this is because you haven't fulfilled your duty as a student. Of course, you will be strict. What's more, after the holidays, there will be unexpected results. Are there tests within the scope of a given topic? Do you know?"</p><p>"Oh, you're worried about me?"</p><p>"Since you can understand that this is worrying about you, it means that you have some chances. Then hurry up. When I finish, let me feel at ease."</p><p>"But I'm sorry, I guess no matter how hard I try, I'll make it in the middle of the night."</p><p>"Am I going to greet the morning without worrying?"</p><p>"No, it's okay"</p><p>"It doesn't matter"</p><p>"I'll finish it tomorrow morning..."</p><p>"It's like a magic moment for the subject"</p><p>"Please don't say it's so easy!"</p><p>The school, the uniform, and the entrance to the school that had not been close to the school that day. But that long lost feeling was very weak, this must be because there were many days to go to school during summer vacation. But in any case, this can be considered finished.</p><p>*</p><p>Now is the start of the second semester.</p><p>Without hiding my melancholic mood, I walked towards my classroom and opened the door.</p><p>"Help! Kisaragi-san!"</p><p>"Hah?"</p><p>It's definitely not my name, but I'm still reacting. The one that caught my attention the most was Kisaragi-san. Several female classmates surrounded her, and my eyes met theirs by accident. I quickly looked away and saw my position. Question marks are all over my brain. Why are there people around Kisaragi-san? Could it be that for some reason, she was asked to do such a troublesome job? No, I think Kisaragi-san should be the one to firmly reject trouble. Moreover, from the voice of a female classmate asking her, I could hear a feeling of extreme despair. The voice seemed to say that you can only ask Kisaragi-san, accept it.</p><p>"Yes. If there is no inconvenience, can you tell me the contact address. Ahhh. Of course, I will delete this request once it's done, rest assured."</p><p>"Thank you very much!"</p><p>And Kisaragi actually accepted the request again, being asked to exchange contact addresses with her. The female classmate's voice was filled with countless thanks.</p><p>"Me too! Please!"</p><p>Starting from this, there were many voices among the students. Although most of the voices were female classmates, there seemed to be male classmates among them.</p><p>"That's right. How about accepting only three people at a time? If you are really impatient, then please give me a contact address first. If I have time, I will use it to contact."</p><p>She was proficient and started exchanging contact addresses. After that, the students returned to their classrooms and seats. When the principal came, only Kisaragi-san was standing alone.</p><p>What exactly is going on.</p><p>My thoughts cannot be conveyed from here. And I can't read his mind.</p><p><br /></p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>Without talking about the current situation, Hiten who rushed over asked anxiously.</p><p>"Can you tell me why this situation happened?"</p><p>"A certain junior speaks a lot in the department. And the word slowly spreads after the summer vacation."</p><p>I listened carefully, the people in his class seem to have gone to look for Kisaragi-san too. Even though this rumor started in Kisaragi-san, it caused a commotion during this school year where the central figure was.</p><p>"Is this the result?"</p><p>"It seems so"</p><p>Hiten glanced at me and shrugged. My expression and voice must be really scary. I have no appetite, and nothing less than lunch.</p><p>I understand why. It's because of Kisaragi-san.</p><p>"That person&#8230;&#8230;"</p><p>But I don't understand if it's because of Kisaragi-san that her feelings are so shaken. Even so, now that I can't see it, I think about it.</p><p>"What, exclusivity?"</p><p>"No. Not that. Absolutely not."</p><p>I'm not Kisaragi-san's lover. Strange to even call her a friend. Exclusivity is even dumber.</p><p>"Lack of confidence"</p><p>I wish he said that. Since this morning, the class is looking at me very gently. We are not in that kind of relationship.</p><p>"How can I say that you can believe that it was made..."</p><p>"Sorry. I know. Don't look at me with those eyes."</p><p>"What kind of eyes?"</p><p>"Such eyes."</p><p>Hiten gently handed me the mirror and told me about those eyes.</p><p>"Wow..."</p><p>Muddy eyes that seemed to come out of mud and water reflected in the mirror. But I don't know why this happened, and I don't plan on changing. I proudly put the lid on the lunch box.</p><p>"If you don't eat the bento, would you like to eat the jelly you bought for me?"</p><p>Even though it's just a bite-sized jelly, the word "jelly" crossed my mind the scene of Kisaragi-san eating jelly. I realized that it was getting late, and shook my head. I probably worried about her like this. After he put the jelly in his school bag, he said that I was full.</p><p>Then he put his hand on the table and said.</p><p>"She really can read people's minds."</p><p>Whether it's positive or negative, I can't say</p><p>"If it continues to spread like this, compared to the gossip scene, won't the number of people who are afraid of her just by watching Nao increase? Isn't there such a thing as private privacy?"</p><p>"...Personal privacy?"</p><p>She wasn't after anything like that. To her, if possible, she did not want to hear these things, nor did she want to know. Otherwise, she wouldn't stick to me like that. And even when that incident happened in elementary school, those who looked up to her disappeared, leaving her alone.</p><p>Obviously this is the case, but why did she do it.</p><p>"Why do you think Kisaragi-san would do such a thing?"</p><p>"Who knows? I don't even know things you don't even know when you're so close to her. I even tend not to know."</p><p>"Then I will change the question. Why do other people so easily start to get close to the person they have been avoiding?"</p><p>"Isn't it because you knew it would be good for your own sake?"</p><p>Not because of me. I couldn't help but cover my face.</p><p>"The reason why you became unhappy is probably because of that,"</p><p>He said. In this case, even if it is said to be a monopoly, I can't deny it.</p><p>*</p><p>(Kisaragi POV)</p><p>At lunch on the stairs, all I remember is an unprecedented and enjoyable summer vacation. In fact, there are basically no rest days, most of the time is spent at school, but what comes to mind is that every day is spent with Hokuto-san.</p><p>When he went to the pool, he actually put on his bathing suit and swam with me. Maybe he just didn't want to lose to me, but swimming with him who kept training and slowly surpassed me made me really happy. Since he hasn't beaten me yet, I was overjoyed when he said that he would compete again as long as he had the chance. The so-called next time is really a lot of fun.</p><p>During the fireworks display, he also complimented my yukata for being so beautiful. Even though his tone was very cold, but that must be his shy manner. He held my hand tightly in the crowd so I wouldn't be scattered by the crowd. From someone else's point of view, we might be like a couple in a relationship. Even if it's not, it makes me a little sad, but since he compliments me and holding my hand makes me so happy, I don't care.</p><p>After that, we also played a bubble game in the garden, and I asked him to help me look at the assignment. Even though he was very strict at that time, he was worried about me, so I should feel happy. What's more, all the tasks are done, so everyone is happy.</p><p>And waiting for me to go up to school in a sleep deprived state, it's a few female classmates. They said they wanted me to use my ability to read people's minds. When I understood that this was spread by the juniors I met before the start of summer vacation, it didn't take much time.</p><p>All the reasons came from Hokuto-san. Although I thought so at the time, I actually wanted to listen to the ambiguous requests of the younger generation who had never seen anyone before. Good people must have limits. This content happened to pique my interest. But if this doesn't happen, he will be blamed for not letting me accept this request. I think he who is smart must not have thought of this, it should be because he can't refuse other people's requests. Obviously he's not here, but I can still sigh.</p><p>It's precisely because the person I like is like that, that I inadvertently want to do it too. If someone is looking for my abilities, I'll want to respond to them.</p><p>I kept thinking, it's okay. The sense of superiority that comes from being relied on by others is immense, and I wish I could become gentler like Hokuto-san, and my heart couldn't help but beat faster.</p><p>When I say I like oranges, some girls tell me they have them. I ate the orange snack I bought from a small shop to calm my mood. Nothing, I should be able to do something.</p>
