<h2>Chapter 2 - This kind of thing is called a date, right?</h2>

<p>Not arrogant.</p><p>"Why did you have such a good relationship with Kisaragi Nao, the number one beautiful and strange girl in school, when I had a hard time because of the script?"</p><p>"I do not know"</p><p>Appeared in our class again after a long time. As Hatano Hiten&nbsp;said that, he borrowed a chair from the chair in front of me and opened the lunch box.</p><p>Beautiful girl and number one freak in school.</p><p>There is no doubt about this. Except for such extreme words, no other vocabulary could describe him. Although I have my doubts about the saying that the relationship has become very good, from other people's point of view, we seem to have a very good relationship. But this is only a gap in understanding. However, it doesn't matter what other people think.</p><p>I also opened the lunch box and entered the lunch break.</p><p>"Then, when you'd rather die, do you have to finish writing the script that presses step by step towards you?"</p><p>Because of my words, Mikinori's chopsticks stopped. He clearly had a very bad face.</p><p>"Ah&#8230; uh, um. I'm done writing for now."</p><p>I didn't even bother to sigh in response to this vague answer.</p><p>"What's wrong. Did you miss the new edition again?"</p><p>"I really didn't expect you to say the word 'again'. I didn't miss the new edition. But it was just a casual upgrade."</p><p>"You're at least chasing the normal deadline."</p><p>"Because!"</p><p>"Not because, are you an elementary school kid?"</p><p>Judging from people unfamiliar with my comrades, her laughter was no more than fifty paces away. This is not something worth showing off. I caught the burdock root with my chopsticks and sighed.</p><p>"It's because you did it, that the part-time wages you've been earning will evaporate quickly, right?"</p><p>"Hokuto. You say that because you don't know how delicious the roast meat at the end of the show is."</p><p>"I don't know, and I don't want to know. If it wasn't for the increase, you could at least eat one more time, right? No matter how you think about it, it's definitely better to catch up to the deadline. After all, it has to be printed. It's just the right to use a pre-ordered discount."</p><p>"...Um"</p><p>"Also, grilled meat tastes great anytime."</p><p>He put his chopsticks on the corner of the bento box with a sad expression because of what I said.</p><p>"This is a lot that I know. Even though I know that, but because I am so happy, so I can't stop."</p><p>"Ah. Since you enjoyed it, I won't say much more."</p><p>"I knew Hokuto would say that."</p><p>After expressing his agreement, he picked up his chopsticks and started eating again. This is a regular dialogue all the time. Although I think it's time to stop, but because the habit continues to this day. But this time he did not continue to eat. Instead, he made an appearance of thinking about something.</p><p>"Is it your arrogance that fascinates Nao-san?"</p><p>Because of what he said, my chopsticks almost fell to the ground. But at that time, I avoided this situation.</p><p>It's dangerous and scary.</p><p>"...Why do you think so, did you hear about it from the rumours?"</p><p>"Rumors say that Nao-san's classmate can read people's minds, right? If this is true, even if you say this, say that, but she can still understand the fact that you are already shy. Maybe she thinks you are a very cute person? "</p><p>"Hah ...?"</p><p>A strong pain flashed through my brain. My appetite is also slowly fading away. Like him just now, I put the chopsticks in the corner of the bento box. What's with people so cute?</p><p>"Meaning unknown"</p><p>"If I could read your mind like that. What are you thinking now?"</p><p>I don't know if he should understand my feelings, he said casually. Uh, even though I haven't thought about it this way, what happened to the super cute guy!</p><p>"Don't talk about such unreasonable things. I will distribute all your inventory to the school."</p><p>"I know. I didn't guess, sorry."</p><p>After he apologized honestly, he was born without any malice. embarrassed when angry.</p><p>"I'm angry here, but it's more like being hit by you."</p><p>"I like Hokuto's self-reflection."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"Well, I guess this is a good thing."</p><p>"I respect your lifestyle of 'You have to have fun in life!'. You have to cheer for that."</p><p>"Well, thanks for your support. I will do the best."</p><p>Since this was too young a response, I couldn't help but laugh. And he was the same, we both laughed softly in the corner of the classroom.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Day on duty</h3><p>After the class meeting was over and the school was over, the students almost became free bodies. If I said that, some objections about the topic, exams, and group activities might be thrown at me, but it's a kind of freedom to think about how to use the time including this. Make the most of your time and be your strongest self!</p><p>"What's with you, thinking of something unknown. Did something happen?"</p><p>"Nothing happens"</p><p>Nothing happens. It just happened that this thought would surely make people worry. Maybe because I have accumulated a lot of fatigue, my thinking has become a little strange.</p><p>I want to go home soon.</p><p>I'm sure a lot of people think like that. In my class, more than half of the people choose the freedom to leave the class. In front of my eyes, only Kisaragi-san is eating oranges here.</p><p>"Obviously you can go back and eat it."</p><p>"This is what you eat at school."</p><p>Even as she said that, the orange was sucked into her&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>"...Hah?"</p><p>Not true. This is not the time to talk about these kinds of things.</p><p>Notes. If I don't write this down well and then give it to the class teacher, I can't go home. Even though I had finished the course content and class meetings, I couldn't write the final summary column. If there are activities, of course I want to write as much as I want, but today is just an ordinary one day course. People in charge of schedules like me would basically summarize the group activities they were in. But I don't know what to end up with in the homecoming department.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Although this is outrageous. Even though this wasn't my intention. Even from my usual attitude, I'm not like this.</p><p>"That, Kisaragi-san."</p><p>Because I don't know what to write, so I want her to help me.</p><p>"Hokuto-san don't you have someone you like?"</p><p>"How can I mention this?"</p><p>Why are you asking this question now? I can't figure it out at all. The other party showed an expression of {Why don't you understand it}. Instead, the other party said why they didn't understand.</p><p>"Even if you can't write about group activities, don't you also have a great interest in reading?"</p><p>"So."</p><p>I really didn't think about this. The book I just finished last night swirled around in my brain. If so, it could also be related to social issues that have recently become a news topic, and that's good enough to be a topic. Once you decide to write it down, all you have to do is write it down. Succeed. I can go home.</p><p>"Thank you, Kisaragi-san."</p><p>"It does not matter. When you finish writing that, please let me know if you have someone you like.&#8221;</p><p>She seems to want me to tell her&nbsp;who I like. Even though I thought she was joking, she seemed serious. ...Could she want to talk about love. If this is the case, the person talking about it is completely wrong.</p><p>"Why are you asking this?"</p><p>Anyway, that's her. Obviously, as long as she reads my mind, she can tell right away if I have someone I like.</p><p>"You really like me?"</p><p>When I said this as a joke, she sighed deeply as if she had nothing to say. In my point of view, she showed an expression saying {you don't understand}.</p><p>"This ability can only let me know what you are currently thinking, so it is not so versatile. Since I am still clueless in communication so far, so I just wanted to ask."</p><p>" ... Is that true?"</p><p>She usually didn't know where that boring tone had gone. I couldn't help but lift my face off the wooden block because of her&nbsp;fast and chatty tone. She wore a different serious expression than usual and looked at me. It could probably be said that she was clumsy.</p><p>"What happened to you today?"</p><p>"...I'm sorry. To me, this is a very serious question, so I'm a little angry with Hokuto-san's classmate who joked and brought you up. Even though I'm obsessed with you and have caused trouble for you. Sorry for showing this expression in this situation, but I didn't mean to stop."</p><p>Since the question was serious, it wouldn't be right for me to take it as a joke. I still apologize honestly.</p><p>"Sorry"</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"Well, can you tell me as many reasons as possible that caused you to ask this question?"</p><p>"I know. For the future, let me explain this. The cause of this problem was when I met you. Time. For this reason, I know that I can be quiet in a crowd. Being in a quiet environment makes me feel very comfortable. If possible , I don't even plan to let you go."</p><p>She&nbsp;compared my usual feelings to several times richer, and she told me pathetic words that would cause misunderstandings if I wasn't careful.</p><p>I could barely breathe for a moment.</p><p>"However, even if this were to happen, I know that I can't do this. If Hokuto-san has someone I like, I don't have to be by your side."</p><p>"Are you planning to leave?"</p><p>After a while, from her&nbsp;there was a sigh that was completely different from just now.</p><p>"You are really good at saying that."</p><p>After she said that, I remembered what I said. I actually said something very powerful. Which role of Kisaragi-san in this love game? I felt my cheeks getting hot from embarrassment. Are these words asleep in some of my words and sentences?</p><p>"&#8230;But, I didn't do anything wrong, did I?"</p><p>"Right. But first, I can say, I didn't take the initiative to leave."</p><p>In the long line of everyday life, this dialogue has been like a love game. I didn't know that I would hear these words in reality.</p><p>"This world is not a game that has been fixed in the future in a good or bad sense. So let me explain first. If you have someone you like, it's very inconvenient to have me, Please talk at an earlier stage. Because if you want to go back to your original life, it would be best to leave as early as possible."</p><p>She&nbsp;said that, she stopped. In the game, this is definitely the dialogue spoken at the climax and the most exciting scene. Favorite slot is MAX. Before graduation, before leaving. This is the most loving ending.</p><p>"What should I say?"</p><p>I hesitated to say it, but the idea was legible.</p><p>"It feels really heavy."</p><p>"That's right. My own existence is already very troublesome."</p><p>I don't know when she started, she returned to her original sensuality expressionless and emotionless. Obviously she didn't need to talk to this level.</p><p>"At least this journal was finally written thanks to you. I'll hand it over."</p><p>"I see you bow your head from time to time. Are you writing under this situation?"</p><p>"After all, this topic is very heavy. It makes people feel like they'll be overwhelmed by not doing anything. I'm going home."</p><p>I got up from my seat and against the hand that was holding the log, I grabbed the backpack with my other hand.</p><p>"Even though the words are very heavy, you are still willing to let me come back with you"</p><p>I sniffed in response to the voice coming from behind.</p><p>"After all, I'm a gentleman."</p><p>Even though the laughter was small, it still reached my ears.</p><p>I confirmed that there was indeed a breath following behind me, and I walked out of the classroom.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Exam day is over.</h3><p>The exam is over. The ending of this situation refers to the fact that none of the exam papers submitted failed, which meant that I was able to return to a stable life without the hassle of taking exams and changing topics.</p><p>Because I studied hard before the exam, I was very confident in my grades. In fact, there are indeed some subjects that are close to full marks. But before the exam papers were issued, I really didn't know what would happen. Maybe the answer is wrong in the answer column, or maybe you forgot the name. But it's really written when I'm sure the answer is correct. Sometimes, it is very difficult to detect your own faults. It's really great to end safely without anything happening.</p><p>At the end of the exam. After a long time, in order to study in peace, I thought about whether to go to the library.</p><p>"I've investigated it."</p><p>Since she appeared from behind with a line of sight, I was startled and my shoulders shook.</p><p>"What investigation?"</p><p>"Dating plans"</p><p>...Is she referring to the incident when the two of us agreed to go shopping together?</p><p>Judging by her&nbsp;expression, she should be referring to it. I totally forgot about it. Although it was wrong to ask when I would return, she also had to think about her&nbsp;choice of words and sentences. It's natural for me to think like this.</p><p>Even if I didn't want to, I could feel several people in the class turning their gazes to my side. This is also natural, not only does the time we spend together suddenly increase, but we also make conversations to make dating plans. It can also be said that it is a must to pay attention to.</p><p>I'm really not happy.</p><p>I've heard rumors that we might be dating. And in this way, things will definitely be on top again, and some will be published. What has been determined at this stage is that my evaluation has become &#8220;a man who can make plans for a date with Kisaragi-san. It can also be said that it is unavoidable to be noticed.</p><p>"Please take this"</p><p>And he, who was supposed to read all my thoughts, didn't feel uneasy, but instead handed me a piece of printed paper. If I leave here now, the misunderstanding will definitely not be solved, so I accept it obediently. Three plans are written on printed paper. Each schedule coincides with the release time of the highly rated film that is currently being released. Although this is a schedule, it is not as precise as a school trip. Above is mainly the time table of public transport which can be found out by going to local inquiry and time zone when not many people flow in various places. Summary The table is very clean and very comfortable.</p><p>"This is just an idea, just to give you a rough idea, Hokuto-san can also decide on some movies to watch. If it's a movie that's not on this list, I'll plan it again."</p><p>Since she said that she was going to the cinema together, I just took the initiative to confirm the films that were currently playing. Personally, I don't really want to see these films. If some time passes, the latest film from my favorite series will be screened to the public.</p><p>"Then let's wait until the work is shown to the public and talk about it?"</p><p>"Not"</p><p>Let's go early. I can't keep thinking about you until then.</p><p>"Which one would Kisaragi recommend?"</p><p>She opened her&nbsp;eyes wide in surprise. I just realized that after someone listened, I was too embarrassed to say it. At this moment, her&nbsp;ability was very comfortable.</p><p>"I recommend this."</p><p>Her slender index finger pointed at a foreign film being promoted everywhere with beautiful mecha moves as a selling point.</p><p>"The preview video looks really interesting."</p><p>"I haven't investigated this in detail. How does it feel?"</p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p>She took her&nbsp;phone out of her&nbsp;pocket, clicked a few times and then turned the screen towards me.</p><p>"This."</p><p>The content is videos that are limited to publishing on the web. The density of motion in the video is very high. It was no wonder she expected this to work.</p><p>"It looks really interesting, so let's do this. When can we go?"</p><p>"The most free time I've had recently was this Saturday."</p><p>On that day, I didn't have any reservation.</p><p>"Then let's meet at the current station on Saturday."</p><p>"I know. Please call me if you can't go."</p><p>"Oh, you too."</p><p>After remembering the approximate event and location, I put the printer's paper back to her.</p><p>"I score a lot when I score."</p><p>Since there was no point in holding it in my hands, I placed the printed paper she returned in a thin transparent file.</p><p>After looking around, there was no one in the class at all times. Since it is still early, it should worry us.</p><p>"Why do you say the word date?"</p><p>I sighed as I recalled the scene around me.</p><p>In the conversation not too long ago, my understanding of her&nbsp;became a little heavy, and I didn't expect her&nbsp;to do this. This may have been some kind of containment.</p><p>"Holder?"</p><p>"Even if someone likes you, once I tell you that, won't others think that I'm dating you?"</p><p>"I, I haven't thought about it like this"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Judging by the way she spoke, she didn't seem to have this plan.</p><p>"I heard young people recently call it a date even if they go out to play with their friends. Is not it?"</p><p>She&nbsp;said with a very serious expression. I don't even need to sigh, I can only grieve blindly.</p><p>"A relationship that isn't too intimate is pointless."</p><p>This seemed an unexpected answer, and she was taken aback. This is really a very valuable difference in facial expressions. Although the difference in her facial expressions is hard to understand, lately I'm starting to be able to tell the difference. However, I want to divide the resources into more useful things.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Dating day.</h3><p>Although I immediately decided to go see a movie with her, but when I got home to calm myself down, I regretted it. I haven't shopped with the girls. So besides my mother, she will be the first woman to go out with me. Uh, it's fine.</p><p>Kisaragi Nao is beautiful.</p><p>Even though she was exiled at school because of her&nbsp;abilities, passersby on the street would not know about it. Eyes gathered up and down all over her&nbsp;body, and she might even be touched. Can I handle those things. Uh, don't care about that. What should I do with hair and clothes. If you ask Hiten, I'll definitely only recommend a few COSPLAY costumes, and for others, because of the particulars, it's hard for me to ask. Let's open the web browser first.</p><p>...I don't know the words to search just yet!</p><p>"Is it okay tomorrow?"</p><p>"Does not matter"</p><p>"I see. I'm looking forward to it."</p><p>I read the information I exchanged on SNS last night again. I looked at my clothes and made a final confirmation. In order to show as much sense of cleanliness as possible, I tried hard, As for whether I can go out or not, I still don't know. With confirmation, I asked the only woman in the family, my mother, to take a look, but only one sentence wasn't funny at all. What does it take to find interest in human clothing?</p><p>I glanced at the time, and the agreed time was about to arrive. Just in case, I came here ten minutes earlier than the agreed time. I had to say, "No, I just came here." Or "I didn't wait long".</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>"&#8230;I've been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p>"Well, I know."</p><p>She appeared in front of me in a very cute outfit. I don't know what kind of clothes she is, but the clothes she wears make one feel light. She wears very bright colors in the areas where her eyes don't hurt. Because of the usual atmosphere, it was easy to think of a cooler tone, so I was quite surprised. But she also fits perfectly into this color scheme. After all, this is it, no matter what she wears, she definitely fits perfectly. This excessive cuteness even scared me to walk with her.</p><p>"You haven't grown at all since "Wow"."</p><p>I thought so too.</p><p>"Just don't talk about old stuff anymore."</p><p>"It's okay for me. Don't bother too much when you compliment the person you like."</p><p>"A lot of people know that."</p><p>I didn't expect her&nbsp;to say something like that out of the blue. Even though I've been waiting here for a long time, I want to come back soon.</p><p>"Look, the tram we are going to take has arrived, let's go."</p><p>The cold white hand suddenly grabbed my hand and dragged me. This series of movements was so natural, even though I wanted to let go, I didn't let go until I got on the tram. She&nbsp;should have read my mind, but looked off into the distance as if she heard nothing. Since there were no vacant seats, we stayed in an empty spot near the door.</p><p>"That"</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Hand"</p><p>Because of my words, she finally realized that we were holding hands. Immediately after, my hand was immediately released.</p><p>"Yes, I'm sorry. I accidentally stretched out my hand."</p><p>When I let go of her&nbsp;hand, she felt a little cold. Since it happened suddenly, I was a little surprised. Even now, my heart is beating fast.</p><p>"If, if this level gets your heart moving, your body will be overwhelmed when you're on a real date."</p><p>What was she talking about just now?</p><p>"You, you actually dare to say that with a red face"</p><p>"It's blushing."</p><p>"You're not so red now, are you?"</p><p>"Anyone would blush. If they knew they had subconsciously grabbed someone's hand."</p><p>"Okay, okay."</p><p>The person holding her&nbsp;hand will blush, right? Even though I thought so in my heart, I didn't say it. Because she must have heard it too.</p><p>"Let's stop, it doesn't make sense."</p><p>For those who don't know, we will only sound like a couple fighting. Despite some things until now, we can't continue to argue in public.</p><p>"Don't you think so?"</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;That's what was said. Let's just pretend there's no such thing."</p><p>This probably shouldn't be said, but after all, she one-sidedly read my mind. After that, I delivered the topic I prepared last night.</p><p>"Did you watch the latest trailer for the movie you're going to see today?"</p><p>"I saw it. It gives people the feeling that they are not afraid of spoilers at all."</p><p>"Do you think it was done for advertising?"</p><p>"I didn't think so, so I found it a little scary. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't know how it was&#8230;.Should we move on to another movie?"</p><p>"No, I was just planning to keep you company. Whatever you like."</p><p>"Then, let's have a look at the schedule. Ah, does Hokuto-san like eating popcorn?"</p><p>"Then it depends on taste."</p><p>"Me, milk pie."</p><p>"I also."</p><p>"Good. By the way, would you like a bucket of popcorn?"</p><p>"Bucket? For what?"</p><p>"After all, it's called a bucket, so it's naturally used as a container for things."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>To me, this is something that has nothing to do with me, but some people seem to like it.</p><p>"It would be nice if it was a better bucket."</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>We just rocked for a few minutes and arrived at our destination station. Since the movie will start playing in a matter of minutes, so we walked towards the cinema. Maybe because of the weekend, there were a lot of people coming and going. All kinds of people passed by on either side of us. Among them, a group of sexy girls came from in front of us. Because their bright colors are so dazzling, they stand out even in a crowd.</p><p>When they came right in front of us, one of them suddenly made a sound.</p><p>"Kisaragi-san! Ouch, what's wrong, is this your boyfriend?&#8221;</p><p>That's not a boyfriend. I should have said that. But before I could say it, I was held back by Kisaragi-san. I felt her&nbsp;hand begging for help, so I swallowed the sentence. In my highly adaptable brain, another sentence appeared.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm her&nbsp;girlfriend. Are you looking for my Nao?&#8221;</p><p>The so-called reservation is something that can't go smoothly. After all, one cannot predict this kind of accident.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Continuing the date day</h3><p>"What happened."</p><p>To calm down from what happened just now, we walked to a nearby family restaurant.</p><p>Kisaragi-san rolled the cod roe paste with a fork and ate it. But I, who didn't have the morning appetite like her, put the clear soup from the soup bar in front of my eyes.</p><p>"Isn't she a good person?"</p><p>Because she suddenly held my hand as if relying on me, so I naturally thought it was the girl she had a party with in the past.</p><p>"Forgive me"</p><p>But in fact the girl said with a gentle smile, "Congratulations! Yes," it is very nice that the other person is such a gentle person. Kisaragi-san is also a very kind person, but is easily misunderstood. So I really wanted to take a closer look. Ah, I'm ashamed to stop you. Goodbye then! After that, she immediately left, she was just a simple good person.</p><p>"I forgot about her."</p><p>"You are too much."</p><p>"...No. To be honest, I wanted to forget about it."</p><p>"That is, you haven't completely forgotten about it?"</p><p>She lowered her&nbsp;head and made a circle turning the fork.</p><p>"Is he your friend?"</p><p>"Yes. She was my partner in the first grade of junior high school."</p><p>&nbsp;In high school.</p><p>"How did you two meet?"</p><p>"Because I'm in the same class, I get called out a lot. Because I accidentally spoke, I often talked together, but because I was in a different class in the second year, it ended there."</p><p>"Did it really end there?"</p><p>The fork stopped. How do you know, she asked with a tense expression.</p><p>"The so-called second year of junior high school is when you are treated as an enemy by all the girls in class."</p><p>"You remember it clearly."</p><p>I don't really want to remember it, but no. which is easy to forget. I didn't expect it to be connected like this.</p><p>"She&nbsp;must have called you, right?"</p><p>This time, the fork slipped out of her&nbsp;hand. She raised her&nbsp;face as if she had given up, and began to say weakly.</p><p>"I spoke to her&nbsp;once. She asked me, 'Is there anything I can do?'. When I said nothing and threw her&nbsp;hand away."</p><p>"Do you think it will cause trouble for her?"</p><p>She&nbsp;didn't nod at me, but that should be the correct answer. After all, people who felt like a good person all over called her&nbsp;"a very nice person". He's looking at me now, but she must be a good person in front of that person.</p><p>"I really didn't expect that we would meet again on this road, and would be blessed by her&nbsp;once we meet again."</p><p>I remember what the man said again.</p><p>"She&nbsp;says it's easy to misunderstand, and that's the truth. Now she also misunderstood the relationship between Kisaragi-san and me."</p><p>This time I'm also an accomplice. Since there was no time to explain that she was lying, there was no other way, her&nbsp;words of blessing could be described as nonsense. People can't help but feel guilty.</p><p>"I haven't changed."</p><p>She smiled with some hint of self-deprecation. I don't know her&nbsp;past. Just because I don't know, I don't know if the change is good or bad.</p><p>"But I think it's a good thing for her&nbsp;to meet you like that. No matter what it is, she looks relieved when she sees you with someone."</p><p>Besides, I don't know her&nbsp;name. Even so, I think so.</p><p>"Otherwise, the one who was dumped once wouldn't laugh like that."</p><p>Although Kisaragi-san lowered her head for a while, in the end, a smile appeared at the corner of her mouth. There was a slight blush on her white cheeks.</p><p>"That's also true."</p><p>In Kisaragi-san's own heart, it seemed that she had digested that person's business. She&nbsp;picked up another fork and quickly rolled up the noodles. Uh, too many rolls.</p><p>"Then, what are we going to do from now on?"</p><p>She put the rolled pasta back onto the plate as I expected, then rolled it up again and put it in her&nbsp;mouth. One bribe, two bribes. When I noticed that she couldn't speak, I ran to the soup bar down the street and poured pure soup into a cup. Finally, after she finished everything, she closed her&nbsp;hand and said that I was full.</p><p>"Go to the movies of course,"</p><p>She said so majestic after eating.</p><p>"You really are obsessed."</p><p>Now that I've decided to accompany her, of course I don't have a position where I can say anything, but her&nbsp;obsessive appearance scares me a little.</p><p>"I've never seen a movie without a live or weird spoiler."</p><p>"No matter how you struggle, you will eventually hear my feelings, right."</p><p>"Then please listen to the voices of feelings everywhere. Sometimes it's a fact of life that contains spoilers. of believers who often go to see it. Sometimes it's the screams of a disgusted person. Sometimes lose interest in this article and start creating very inexplicable delusions. People. The more popular they are, the more people there will be. Hokuto-san's feelings are really cute."</p><p>What she said contained eternal hatred, and I once again felt that her&nbsp;abilities were absolutely correct. It is very tiring physically and mentally.</p><p>"But, is it okay if you don't see her at home?"</p><p>"Even though you say that, I don't have a monitor in my house."</p><p>Ahhhhhhhhhhh, so that's how it is.</p><p>"Do you want to eat cake in the end?"<br /></p><p>"Of course we go now. We haven't done anything. You must stay with me."</p><p>On her&nbsp;face with a slight smile, there was an expression of hope. .</p><p>"Then let's go."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>After we walked out of the family restaurant where the number of people started to increase, we moved towards the cinema again.</p>

<p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">On the worst day.</h3><p>"Let's take an example."</p><p>"Ha"</p><p>She said with her&nbsp;legs crossed and her&nbsp;fingers crossed, with a slightly melancholic expression on her&nbsp;face. Due to such a posture, the color of the sunset from the window shone on her beautiful black hair. This scene is absolutely beautiful.</p><p>I couldn't help but think that if she didn't say a word, she would be perfect.</p><p>Even though I understand the reason, it seems that it still angers her. Her&nbsp;brows started to tremble slightly.</p><p>"Sorry, it's fine, keep talking."</p><p>"Even though that's not what I meant, let me continue."</p><p>She&nbsp;coughed openly.</p><p>"If everyone except Hokuto-san had the same ability as me, what would you do?"</p><p>She must not have realized that she was talking about such a sensible topic, she said with a serious expression on her&nbsp;face. I had been fascinated by it for a long time, and reacted a little too late.</p><p>"That's really bad."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"If you use the status quo as a metaphor, it means you."</p><p>She immediately changed her&nbsp;expression, spread her&nbsp;arms and leaned her&nbsp;body against the chair.</p><p>After she sighed, she shook her&nbsp;head.</p><p>"Why do you overreact to hypothetical things?"</p><p>"What do you expect from me?"</p><p>"For example, slandering or hating these people is very scary."</p><p>"Do you think slandering secretly is scary, or do you hate me??"</p><p>"No, not at all"</p><p>"Is it okay?"</p><p>"...Was my position really that bad?"</p><p>I couldn't see her lowering her head the expression on her face.</p><p>"After all, being feared in such a small school world, it would be very difficult to live."</p><p>"But that's how it is,"</p><p>She&nbsp;continued, sitting up straight again. Her expression is more refreshing than I've ever seen.</p><p>"I can tell what people are thinking. But those are trifles. After all, there will be people who look like them, right? In the world, there would be people who could hear anything. Because of that, I don't know, I feel that my situation is the worst."</p><p>That's right. In the world, there are also a small number of people with abilities that common sense cannot imagine. In history, there were people who had heard the revelations of the gods. Even if there were few people who could read other people's minds like her&nbsp;, it wouldn't be surprising.</p><p>"Have you ever seen anyone else like me?"</p><p>After she asked, her&nbsp;eyes widened as if she thought of something. Then, I thought for a moment and said.</p><p>"The strategy targets are peers who can hear other people's voices, or seniors who can talk to animals, or juniors who can talk to ghosts, etc... What do you think about this kind of simulation game?"</p><p>"Not. I don't want it. It's very difficult to play. Even if there was, I wouldn't buy it."</p><p>"I know. As long as I'm there, I don't need anything else, right?"</p><p>Why this happened.</p><p>"Can you stop making jokes like this?"</p><p>"Is this a joke?"</p><p>"Eh...isn't it?"</p><p>"Who knows?"</p><p>I don't know where the deep atmosphere has gone all this time. She&nbsp;bullied me with a slight smile, and she was indeed at the furthest distance from the worst.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">There's nothing to be afraid of.</h3><p>"By the way, why have you become a feared object?"</p><p>"I also do not know."</p><p>I followed her&nbsp;eyes away and found her&nbsp;looking around. The atmosphere of returning to the quiet classroom became heavy, so I realized that this was for some reason. Even if she continued to ask, she would not speak. So I stopped asking questions and brought up another topic.</p><p>"Where's lunch?"</p><p>"On the front steps of the roof"</p><p>"Ah ah, yes there is ah. There is a feeling of a little chill."</p><p>"Oh, it's not cold. If you insist, the summer will be hot too."</p><p>"Then you have to be careful not to get heatstroke. Since there won't be many people passing by, no one will notice even if you fall."</p><p>"It doesn't matter, I have confidence that I won't lose for the heat."</p><p>"Stop that, not in this crow's mouth."</p><p>"This is not a crow's mouth. I survived last year. I will also find my way this year."</p><p>"You are so absent-minded, you will lead to an irreversible situation right?"</p><p>"Since you are so worried about me, come and help me when I'm sad."</p><p>"It was so far away that I couldn't even notice it."</p><p>"Please think of a way to work hard on this."</p><p>"How is that possible. Wouldn't it be better for you to eat in class in the summer? Even though the air conditioner isn't enough, it's at least effective."</p><p>"When eating, I also want to be in quiet calm."</p><p>"&#8230;Is that so. But I'm not forcing you either."</p><p>"Well, that's fine."</p><p>As we talked, I remembered that she would pretend that things weren't a big deal. If this is the case, I can't ignore it. Looks like I need to find another aspect.</p><p>I won't let her&nbsp;tell me not to look.</p><p>"By the way, why do you think Kisaragi-san is considered such a scary thing?"</p><p>"You really suddenly, what's wrong?"</p><p>He rolls cod spaghetti in her&nbsp;bento while leaning his ear towards me.</p><p>"I've heard rumors that she can tell what people are thinking. I just don't understand why it made her&nbsp;the object of fear."</p><p>If it's an object of interest and suspicion, let it go and become the object of fear I really can't take it.</p><p>This is the compassion that arises. Even though I know, after displaying such a conspicuous attitude, I can't help but want to at least understand the cause of this matter.</p><p>"After asking her&nbsp;personally, even though I know part of the reason, she still asks me to change the topic."</p><p>"That's it is. That's why you came to ask me. Is that true?"</p><p>I reflected in his eyes. His expression was very serious. Perhaps for this reason, Hiten&nbsp;also showed a serious expression.</p><p>"Sorry"</p><p>"Eh, it's fine. Hokuto rarely counts on me."</p><p>I bowed my head at the goodwill shown by my dearest friend. While talking to himself softly, Hiten&nbsp;twisted his fingertips and started to think.</p><p>Finally, the fingertips stopped.</p><p>"Isn't that because no one wants their own mind to be read?"</p><p>I'm used to mind reading, but my reaction to this rhetorical question is a bit slow. Perhaps it was interpreted negatively, and he continued to set an example.</p><p>"What was Hokuto thinking while talking to me?"</p>

<p>"Thinking about the topic"</p><p>"&#8230;So, what do you think when the person you like is in front of you?"</p><p>"I don't have anyone I like."</p><p>"Right now, even the second dimension is fine."</p><p>So, I recalled the characters in the romance simulation game I played last night. It has a very cute little sister character in it, which is a really good story.</p><p>"Isn't this about the person I like?"</p><p>"In particular?"</p><p>&#8230;After saying that, after thinking about it, something I didn't want people to hear would indeed appear in my heart.</p><p>"Although I don't know what you're thinking, even if it were me, it must be something you don't want people to know? That so-called being able to hear is equivalent to holding someone else's weakness in your hands."</p><p>This is also true. That being the case, he always thought of "Wacha" as a stalk. Since it's embarrassing and also very shy, I really hope he can stop.</p><p>But if this is the case, what will happen to them.</p><p>"I heard someone confessed to Kisaragi-san, how are they?"</p><p>"Although I don't believe the rumors, don't I have that kind of sexual addiction? For example, I want people to know everything about me."</p><p>"...Although it's hard for me to accept, but that means people's preferences are different."</p><p>"Well, uh, that's all."</p><p>Even if it was called the sister attribute, it would change according to the other attributes that came with it. The interpretation of the film and the characters will also vary from person to person, and it is impossible to fully reconcile with others.</p><p>"So"</p><p>He got up from the chair and grabbed his school bag.</p><p>"Even if I continue to speak here, this question will not be answered, so leave it to me later. I will investigate it in detail when I return."</p><p>"Help,"</p><p>I also got up from my chair and lowered my head.</p><p>"Next time you draw manga lines, you have to help me!"</p><p>I can't help but lift my head at Hiten's wonderful words while patting my shoulder. In front of me was the face of an ordinary young man who was unexpectedly drawing a doujin. And I can only nod.</p><p>"Yes, as I wish."</p><p>This is an equivalent exchange I didn't expect. The thing itself is good, but when I think of the assigned manga drawing job, my head hurts.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">A testimony worth 140&#165; (yen)</h3><p>"We have one in our class who knows about Nao-san. I remember her name is Kazuka Yano. I told her to discuss this in the empty classroom next to the chemistry room at five o'clock after school today, I want you to go,"</p><p>He said as soon as he came. I looked at the clock, and it was 4:55.</p><p>"You are male"</p><p>"......Eh"&nbsp;</p><p>I gave up expressing my dissatisfaction and complaints about this malicious information transmission, and I walked briskly from the classroom to the designated place. Although I am very grateful to him for my investigation, but when something happens suddenly, I have no preparation in my heart. I hesitated and stopped in front of the door, but I opened the door as soon as I saw a figure in the window. A woman who seemed to be Yano noticed the sound of the door and looked at me.</p><p>"Are you Kazuka Yano?"</p><p>She nodded, and her short hair also shook.</p><p>"May I call you Usami-kun?"</p><p>After being urged to sit down, she pulled up the chair next to me and sat down obediently.</p><p>"Just being with her is weird enough. I'm really surprised you still want to know about her&nbsp;past. Do you like her&nbsp;that much?"</p><p>I immediately denied what I expected to be said like this. After that, she just said, "Oh, that's all." Even though I wanted to ask her myself, she didn't seem too interested. Maybe it's because my reaction isn't that appealing.</p><p>"The topic will be a bit long, so don't take it too seriously while listening."</p><p>She took a deep breath like a sigh, and started to say.</p><p>"I remember when I was in fifth grade. At that time, there were people who often took other people's things and damaged other people's things. Although everyone knows this is definitely strange, because there is no supporting evidence as such. So it can't be caught anymore. And that day, because someone's manual work disappeared for some reason, it became a problem, so for a long time, everyone seemed to want to discuss it together. the same as not going to class until you report the name of the criminal. Now that I think about it, it was just a waste of time, but at the time it was executed very seriously. In the end, everyone in the class had an interview with the teacher, but even so, I didn't understand anything. It was in fourth grade, going to lunch. She&nbsp;suddenly jumped out and stood in front of the villain."</p><p>I remember Kisaragi-san explaining to me at the beginning that he could hear other people's thoughts when she came out, seemed to appear suddenly. Is this a habit?</p><p>"Then you keep saying"</p><p>"This kind of conversation will end soon. The man's manual work is that after she came here early, she dug a hole in the third grade field and buried it. After all, no one could see."</p><p>Her tone of voice was like telling a horror story, which was scary. She's&nbsp;really good at telling stories, and a corner of my heart expresses that feeling.</p><p>"At that time, that person looked very angry."</p><p>"Why does this person know what I'm thinking? I didn't say anything. Uh, did I say it? Why, why, stop, so scary"</p><p>"...In the end, it's the same as what she said. It really is a very strange sight."</p><p>Of course. In this situation, someone who could tell what people were thinking would definitely feel uncomfortable. The tone of the narrative is very consistent with its content.</p><p>After she took a breath, she continued.</p><p>That brave classmate stood up hesitantly. As she said, after digging around the third-grade field, she actually found it. That guy's manual work made the discovery a mess. Since then, she's been the one being bullied. karma."</p><p>"What about Kisaragi-san."</p><p>"After that, although she was admired by her&nbsp;surroundings for a short time, there was no one that I would never interact with in depth. For this reason, this matter was distorted and turned into what it is now."</p><p>"Just that. I think no one wants to have a good relationship with such a person.&#8221;</p><p>"You said that. Is it really alright?</p><p>"Eh, should that be?"</p><p>"I really think it's amazing. Why don't you throw it away?"</p><p>After being asked a question I didn't want to answer, I couldn't breathe for a moment. Maybe she noticed my appearance too, and she smiled a little. She&nbsp;can't read my mind.</p><p>"You don't know how to tell me, do you?"</p><p>Yano sighed, stretched out her hand and stood up. And I immediately stood up.</p><p>"Overall, I could say that it was the end and she looked pathetic in high school, but she and I didn't go to the same school, so I don't know how specific it is."</p><p>I don't know rumors spreading widely, or to say this world is unexpectedly small. Farewell earlier, it felt like the world revolved around her.</p><p>"Thank You."</p><p>I bowed my head to her who had taken the time to say such a precious thing to me, and thanked her.</p><p>"No, it's just a small matter. Although I don't know how much I can help you with, it would be nice if it could serve as your reference."</p><p>She smiled sheepishly and asked me to buy a can of drink at the vending machine. Therefore, I have the testimony that even though it's not expensive, it doesn't mean it's cheap.</p><p>*</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Counterfeit day</h3><p>After a while, I stayed in the after-school class again. In front of me, Kisaragi-san stuffed three gummies into her&nbsp;mouth in one breath. She looked at me, as if waiting for me to speak. Day after day, even now, she should be able to hear my thoughts. Even so, she wasn't bored, as if she was urging me to speak at this point.</p><p>She&nbsp;nodded deeply. It seems urging me to be right. Because I've been pushed, no way, I said heavily.</p><p>"I asked about what happened when you were in the fifth grade of elementary school."</p><p>"So. I really miss that time."</p><p>Maybe literally, she seemed to miss her a lot. She passed me with a slightly peaceful gaze and looked at the window.</p><p>"Even if it was the first time in my life when my abilities came into play, it wouldn't be too much."</p><p>Finally, she stopped and took the gum's hand. Her mouth didn't move, and she didn't seem to continue eating. Eyes looking into the distance turned to me. I responded to her&nbsp;gaze and continued.</p><p>"In this week, I think a lot."</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"From the conclusion, it is impossible to change the status quo."</p><p>Whether you believe the rumors or not, it has spread all over the place. For this reason, she was indeed avoided by people. Even if I ask others not to avoid it, the only thing that will change is looking at me.</p><p>"What's more, it would be too arrogant to change the status quo that you don't want to change at all."</p><p>"Yeah. That's really arrogant."</p><p>"By the way, I just learned your past by force."</p><p>"It seems so."</p><p>And about this, I will apologize. Even though I can't say it, I still hear it. There's nothing wrong with saying I'm sorry. After all, I've long been used to the scorching sight, so I don't feel any pain now.</p><p>"About this, I have a question to ask"</p><p>"What kind of question is that?"</p><p>"Why did you come out then?"</p><p>She seemed to be saying that I knew you would ask me. I waited a long time, and her&nbsp;eyes started to shine. The offensive gazes so far have been like lies.</p><p>"Guess what I like."</p><p>As if boasting, she handed me a bag of gummy candy. Her fingertips pointed to the fruit on the wrapper.</p><p>"...An orange?"</p><p>"That's it, that's an orange. There was an orange in the food that day. For this reason, I had a problem not going to lunch, so I used it. Everyone was there. It was acceptable under such circumstances. I was surprised."</p><p>She said to me with a pleasant and carefree feeling. Her eyes shone and she laughed. 'Um'. I already knew that she really liked oranges.</p><p>"You are such a person."</p><p>But most of the things that people hide in their hearts are trivial things that don't need to be covered up. When I was alone and thinking, she stared blankly at the second bag of gum she pulled out of her&nbsp;school bag.</p><p>"You go back and eat again."</p><p>"Really, just say so if you want to eat."</p><p>"I don't eat."</p><p>Don't you make me feel embarrassed in an inexplicable place? I was very hesitant to react.</p><p>*</p><p>After entering the room within the room, I resisted the urge to jump onto the bed while wearing the uniform, and change into the indoor clothes. Right after changing clothes, the urge to jump on the bed disappeared. So I had no choice but to sit on the chair in front of the table, release my strength, and let my back rest. The back of the chair I bought before elementary school started to bend, and there was a scraping sound against the plastic. I judged it would be dangerous if I continued to bend over, so I straightened my back. But his back soon bent slightly again.</p><p>"Ah......"</p><p>I sighed subconsciously, it must be impossible. After all, it was to tell Hokuto-san about my past. He probably wouldn't find out easily with just herself, so it should be a friend he had a good relationship with who had a strong intelligence network. Why was his&nbsp;only friend so strong? I couldn't help but begin to feel that, in a sense, he was like a god's favor.</p><p>No, even without the help of others, he would definitely try his best to find out about my past. In the exchange so far, I also subconsciously discovered that he would think about it after knowing it, and then come to the same conclusion. The fact that he wasn't afraid of me or too close to me had bothered me and made me very calm at the same time. No, not only that. From him, who had been able to use my ability to carry on a conversation recently, there was even a respectful thought. Compared to this, the outspoken Hokuto-san wouldn't walk around with anyone but her classmate Hiten-san. I know that he was originally a gentle person. If it's him, even if someone other than me has the ability, I think he can touch it with a calm expression.</p><p>"...?"</p><p>Just when I thought about it, for some reason, I felt irritated. I hate it. Even though it's true, I don't understand why I hate it. Being able to reach anyone without change, I think it's great. I should be happy with his abilities, but I can't be happy. Even if I ask myself why this happened, I can't answer it outright.</p><p>And a heart that knows the answer is more restless.</p>
