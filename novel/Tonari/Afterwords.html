<h2>Afterwords.</h2>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Shirosaki.</p><div><p></p><p>Whether it's a reader who is meeting for the first time or a reader who has been with us during WEB activities, this time I will be able to be "full of you in my heart". Thank you very much in your hands!</p><p>Since I am the type of person who starts reading from postscript, I am concerned about the same type of person, and I will try my best to write postscript without spoilers.</p><p>Thinking of the setting written in KAKUYOMU's outline: "A male high school student was told by a female high school student who could read other people's minds," As long as I'm next to you, I won't hear what other people have to say. thought. "I'm trapped." After that, I found it very interesting, so I wrote this novel.</p><p>So far I've been content with the stage of constantly considering the setting and writing the prologue, and then I'll keep thinking about other settings, then keep writing the prologue, and so on. And this story of Kisaragi and Hokuto was written after countless fortunes, and it was a group of articles with as many as 100,000 words. One of the luckiest were the replies from readers. Besides, I have won a ''special prize'' in the fourth KAKUYOMU contest I applied for, and being able to publish a book like this is also a blessing to many readers. For those who have always dreamed of becoming a novelist and writing articles in this way, there is no other happiness.</p><p>To be honest, since many things have no sense of reality, I wonder if this is a dream. However, I didn't think there would be any well-designed jokes in the world, so I thought about whether this was reality on the other side.</p><p>I can barely maintain a normal state. I'm very normal.</p><p>Although most of the articles published on WEB are from Hokuto's point of view, due to the actualization and suggestions of the editor in charge, articles with Kisaragi's point of view have been added. Since I've always seen stories from Hokuto's point of view, seeing things from Kisaragi's point of view made me think. But even so, it was precisely because of reading the story again from his point of view that I was able to have a deeper understanding of the two of them, which was really satisfying. If you can convey the attachment and beauty in Kisaragi's heart, it will be good luck.</p><p>Lastly, not only from Kisaragi's point of view, but also to M-san, the editor in charge who can guide me who can't tell the difference between left and right, Miwabe-sensei who draws exquisite illustrations, everyone related to this book, and who can make this book. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the readers who hold it. Thank you very much everyone!</p><p>So, see you later!</p>
