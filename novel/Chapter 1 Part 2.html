<b>Part 2</span></b>

</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Until now, Asahi felt it was like a dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't think so. Even if Asahi had no experience of love and was called out from the windowsill many times by senpai, that was what he wanted to think.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Senpai might like me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, somewhere in my heart&#8230; an area controlled by common sense has rejected this idea. This is natural&#8212;you do like senpai, but why should senpai like you? She's more beautiful than anyone you've ever met, she's a megami-senpai that everyone loves. How could I be liked by her&nbsp;for no reason&#8212;how could there be such a good thing in this world?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But senpai did say it. Speak clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Because I like Asahi-kun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;I like Asahi-kun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--Like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--Like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--Like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just thinking about it calmly, everything appeared on his face. Time off. in the classroom. In his seat. A passing female classmate cared&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Amaharashi-kun, are you feeling unwell? Your expression is very strange.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Refreshing scent like drifting orange. ...She is Tsubasa. Noumachi Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She greatly admired his senpai. She's a local idol and has been advertising for local companies for a long time&#8212;and she's also the queen of the Asahi class. Every time that tiny and cute face bent down, Asahi would feel nervous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi is not ashamed. Actually, he was a little bad at dealing with Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Amaharashi-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're too slow to react. I obviously called you. I'm not talking about rain and sunny weather. Things like that are fine. I just wanted to ask you something. If you're there nothing wrong, just answer me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before Asahi could answer, Tsubasa made her classmate's chair creak and sat in front of Asahi. Asahi's position was at the front. He is not good at dealing with Tsubasa's toughness and pressure -even if he has a lot of contact with Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa asked in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This morning, I saw you and Senpai getting off the same bus.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi surprised her&nbsp;by saying this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Ah, I mean Himi-senpai. Himi Kanako. Megami-senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi knew who she was talking about. For the first and second year students at this school, the word "senpai" has become a noun. Asahi asked her&nbsp;to come back to get some time to cool off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... What did she want to ask next?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;What's wrong with Himi-senpai?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Didn't I tell you, you were on the same bus, right? Are your house and your senpai's house close?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Asahi's first time being asked by someone. Location relationship between home and senpai's house. Asahi tried not to let his inner tension show on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Due to this reason, Asahi failed to say a few words to his senpai. But according to Asahi's observations, Asahi felt that if this incident were to be hit by an external storm surge, the unstable world that Asahi and senpai had finally formed would collapse in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi had been doing some things he couldn't do since he was born - that's called pretending to be confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Like Noumachi-san said, I sometimes take the same bus as Senpai.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Don't you know where Senpai's house is?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;I'm not following. I've never asked her&nbsp;before."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi thought that the conversation would end there, but it didn't.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa slapped her tongue hard and said something very unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You have to follow her, it's useless."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't understand what she was saying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If Amaharashi-kun is like a mollusk and sneaks behind senpai, of course he will have to die ten thousand times. But this kind of trivial thing is fine.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What does Noumachi-san want me to do??? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I'm not used to the same class students calling my name, you can call me Tsubaki? Overall, I was able to get some new information from you&#8230;&#8230;. Very close, so there's a high chance that you'll see Senpai wearing casual clothes taking out the trash, or something I've never seen before. I plan to hire you to take pictures.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You actually wanted to hire me to do this kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I want to be closer to senpai. But, don't look at senpai, she can be said to be a onze wall outside of public places. I want an abandoned child who can go straight to work.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You are so outspoken.... Aren't you pretty good in front of Senpai?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa's face showed a hint of surprise. As if to say: You know more than I thought. Asahi realized that she was talking too much. Better not to say something that shouldn't be said- Asahi covered his mouth, and Tsubasa put on an expression she thought was good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know you can't sneak photos, so I'll just say something. If senpai drops something while you're on the same bus, and senpai doesn't notice, you can bring it to me. Okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Tsubasa said this, she left without looking back. I shouldn't have said a few extra words at this point - but Asahi still spoke:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Why should I send the things that senpai dropped to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa stopped. After a while, she turned her&nbsp;head and said,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said. Amaharashi-kun, don't you know how much I respect and love my senpai? Are you saying that because you don't know? You're right when you know this. Did I say something inexplicable like that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Is that inexplicable? Huh? Am I weird?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You really are weird. Listen, senpai&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa looked back into Asahi's eyes, and inclined her&nbsp;face come closer. So the smell of hair drifts here. Even though her face was slightly plump, Tsubasa's eyes pierced Asahi. She began to speak non-stop:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Senpai is a goddess who appeared in this world! Every cell in her is made up of beauty and love. Senpai was a miracle&#8212;even if she respected her as a Virgin, it wasn't an exaggeration. Do you smell senpai? If you had kissed her, I would really have given you a beating. You haven't smelled it yet, have you? There was a scent within her&#8212;even one couldn't help but feel like they were in the land of pure bliss. It smells like the scent of white roses, becomes as noble as white sandalwood, becomes as rich as Casablanca, becomes as refreshing as fruit, and becomes as delicious as vanilla so it's hard to control yourself. Whenever I talked to my senpai, I would whisper it in secret &#8212; the feeling of happiness even made me faint on the spot! Do you think humans can emit that scent? Don't you think so? She's like a fairy, right? Senpai's voice is also very good. I think if a schoolboy becomes an announcer for a TV show, even if it's a ridiculous job, she can win an Emmy Award. Her gestures were the same&#8212;although she usually spoke very quietly, when she was surprised and excited, she would make a high nasal sound like a child. It was really a wife and so cute! I ask you, would most people be so cute? Isn't she a god? I saw the opportunity to touch senpai's cheeks and arms, her skin was smooth and soft, I always thought she had a special ability. She is a fairy! I really wanted to become a creature that could endure rubbing my face against Senpai's skin and hair, but this was really hard in reality, so I gave up&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[TLN: wow Tsubasa is a yandere, Casablanca : the biggest city in Morocco]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She spoke very quietly, but it contained endless enthusiasm for otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi listened to her&nbsp;and hid this sentence in his heart&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(This guy is too mean!)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa's appearance, confident appearance and popularity have earned her&nbsp;a lot of popularity. People say that if senpai is not in school, she will be the prettiest girl in this school. She has many fans. ...But what should I say? Why doesn't everyone realize how bad Tsubasa is? This is not normal at all. Even those sparkling eyes that only appeared in dreams now looked terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Tsubasa finished talking to herself, she sighed as she was overwhelmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, she put on another stern look, changed her&nbsp;attitude, and became rude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you understand? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... Just that? Asahi doesn't understand anything! The context is completely irrelevant. But Asahi clearly understood one thing, namely, Tsubasa liked Senpai more than Asahi thought. But otherwise, it could be said that Asahi only understood this. Even so, Tsubasa still asked:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You, got it, got it, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Noumachi-san, no, no, Tsubasa. Are you talking about taking Senpai's things with someone else?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi Doubt, I don't know why Tsubasa froze on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa thought it was amazing, she frowned. Asahi tilted her&nbsp;head, as if to say: 'What's wrong?' However, this matter ended here. Because the teacher in the next class said, "Everyone sit down", and walked to class. Tsubasa's head returned to her&nbsp;seat without looking back. 'Ah, hateful'&#8212;&#8212;Asahi cursed. And the chair&#8212;it's still there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi returned the chair to its original seat. At this time, the class bell rang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi and Tsubasa brainstormed, they made a new decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Don't let other people know the world on the windowsill with me and my senpai. Especially Tsubasa. What kind of extreme reaction would she make&#8212;just thinking about it, he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since there was a book she wanted to read, Asahi went to the library after school and walked out of school after leaving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After walking to the bus stop closest to home and getting on the bus, Asahi thought about his senpai. Today, she only met senpai once at school&#8212;she and she accidentally rubbed shoulders in the cafeteria, and that senpai was walking with her friends at the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After senpai senpai passed her, he looked back at her, nothing more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai wouldn't destroy her image as everyone's goddess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Now when I look back, when Asahi met Senpai for the first time, Senpai didn't pretend to be "Everyone's Goddess". If Asahi had met the "Everyone's Goddess" Senpai first, would it be different now?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Or, even if there were other ways to meet, would there still be a "seed" that would link them to the same future?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi and senpai met on the usual windowsill. They met at night&#8212;that day, the Asahi family moved into the former house where he now lives. At that time, Asahi was waiting for school to start, which was the second half of March during Spring Break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Due to the delay in delivery, the new curtains have not yet been delivered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, the window of Asahi's room was completely open. In addition, the glass used in the bedroom windows has not been atomized. No obstruction is required in civil law.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Until senpai opened the curtain, opened the large window in her room, and appeared in front of Asahi - Asahi didn't know that there was a goddess living in the room across from her window. After all, Asahi's mother had just moved in, and Asahi's mother didn't greet her neighbors nearby.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, their eyes met each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was very surprised, and his senpai was just as surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Later, according to senpai's own statement, she wanted to blow the night breeze because she lingered in the bathroom. That senpai naturally knew that there was no one next to her, and the people who lived before had no need to let her&nbsp;care about her&nbsp;eyesight. Hence, she was only wearing pajamas at the time&#8212;with a face towel rolled up around her&nbsp;head and a lollipop in her&nbsp;mouth. She didn't expect anyone to be there, so she didn't take any precautions&#8212;only buttoned two or three buttons on her&nbsp;pajamas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi now clearly remembered how senpai had faltered back then. Since Asahi didn't really see her senpai's expression right now, the impression was even deeper. Senpai's eyes were all embarrassed, shaking back and forth, causing panic in an instant. It was the same with Asahi, and Asahi panicked. With cold sweat and hasty hands and feet&#8212;he couldn't look directly at someone I hadn't seen so far, so unprepared. He wanted to cover the windows with corrugated boxes stacked near the windows.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But her anxiety turned her upside down, and the corrugated box flipped over towards Asahi and scattered on the floor. Asahi tried again to cover the window with the corrugated cardboard box, but he caught a glimpse of Senpai through the window-which made his heart start to beat. In front of Asahi's gaze, Senpai wanted to tightly hug the towel that had fallen from above her head. So-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">only a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Asahi saw it from the front, it was obvious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Senpai is slightly shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even now, Asahi didn't understand what senpai was thinking. Senpai's face was still shaken, she wasn't completely calm. He shouldn't know what to do. Nonetheless, that senpai burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there was a hint of worry mixed in the laughter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead of saying that the smile was as gentle and kind as "Everyone's Goddess", it was better to say that it was the smile that pierced Asahi's heart deeply. Senpai not only failed to pull the curtain, she even went to the balcony. She leaned against the armrest and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if the sound was cut by the glass and couldn't be transmitted, from the movement of senpai's mouth, Asahi could tell what senpai was saying-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(can, handle, window, door, open, open?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While Asahi was losing consciousness, the bus passed a familiar intersection. The nearest bus stop from home will be arriving soon. However, no one pushed the button to get out of the car. Asahi hastily suppressed it. Luckily, I caught up&#8212;the bus didn't brake sharply, but came to a slow stop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The temperature started to rise recently, although not to the point of unbearable, humid air blows and makes people feel uncomfortable. Asahi got off the bus and walked from the street where the bus was running to the side of the road. Walking through the street with local bank branches and large supermarkets, and walking towards the transformation of the old river into a green street in the park-Asahi saw a figure squatting next to the green street.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi started to think.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, on the first night, what was Senpai thinking about doing such an act? Once you figure it out, can you find the answer to the question yourself? Or does it have nothing to do with the problem this time around?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And again, can you find the answer to that question?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;The reason why senpai likes herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai who was crouching on the ground and playing with the little dog who was walking standing up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai waved to the puppy and its owner, and waited for Asahi to come to her&nbsp;side. Perhaps she noticed that Asahi was here first. The senpai spoke first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The puppy seems to be a hybrid of a Pomeranian and a mini dachshund. When walking on the street, I run into her&nbsp;often, how about Asahi?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I... don't run much..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi often saw Senpai jogging.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's very comfortable to go for a walk when the weather is nice? You don't have to run. Seeing the cute butterflies and puppies can also soothe your mood.... Asahi-kun, you came back a bit late today. Could it be for a walk? Library?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh? Ah, um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun likes to read books, it's really amazing. Some time ago, Shimao-kun also said that he likes reading books. Although I haven't stopped reading, but basically I only saw some comics and movies. And so on. Because of that, I originally thought we could take the same bus. Nice to meet you. Since I didn't see you, I was just wondering if I could wait here for a bit, I can't help but see you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Waiting for me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Waiting here specifically? If you have something to say, just wait until nightfall as usual and throw a pebble at the window! Perhaps a question mark was written on her&nbsp;face, and that senpai pursed her&nbsp;lips and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually, you can wait until evening. But it would be better not to say that this matter is on the balcony today.... Didn't we pass the cafeteria at noon today? I've been a little worried since then. Asahi-kun, come here a little bit." ."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While that senpai was saying so, she walked from the path towards the slope. After arranging the river land into a path, and planting flowers and plants around it, this green path is considered a garden. The middle part, the part where the water flows from, is used as a temporary drainage channel. After a heavy rain, water will accumulate inside, and on a clear day, there will be soil inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai brought Asahi to the land where the river was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi followed senpai and tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, when we pass, is there anything you care about?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Asahi-kun knows why I speak quietly when I talk to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In short, she asked why I pretended not to know each other in front of people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi thought for a moment, then replied in a mocking tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Since you seem to have a good relationship with me, senpai will feel embarrassed?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if it's a joke, please don't say bad things about the person I like."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When senpai said this, her tone of voice turned out to be beyond Asahi's expectation. Asahi was silent. The senpai stopped somewhere in the green line that looked very inconspicuous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were obviously a lot of people walking on the promenade and nearby pedestrian paths, but the dense trees, short hedges, and scattered rocks made the place suddenly empty. It's very quiet inside, and you can't see what's inside from the outside. The senpai looked back - instead of showing anger on her&nbsp;face, she smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Asahi realized that he had been led into a trap by his senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Se, senpai?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I don't want others to know about my relationship with Asahi-kun, not for being too rude. &#8230;&#8230;Asahi-kun, listen to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order to keep the pedestrians away from the trees, the hedges heard, the Senpai lowered her&nbsp;voice&#8212;and this voice made Asahi's heart tense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's what I think&#8212;wouldn't this be more interesting?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai slowly walked back and walked to Asahi's side. Even though her heart was pounding Asahi still reflexively took a step or two back. However, before retreating far, he hit a boulder on her&nbsp;back. When he realized it, he had been pushed into a desperate situation. Asahi couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...More interesting?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. Think about it. It's on the other side&#8212;it's only two or three meters away from us, and there's a lot of people passing by. Just like the Pomeranian and Dachshund just now. Like their owners of mixed puppies, there might be some people walking their puppies. -walk. Or maybe there are elementary school students and people out to buy something... But"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai placed her hand on the rock behind Asahi. The senpai was hiding her face from the front&#8212;I could even see the length of her eyelashes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Tsubasa said, the smell of senpai was in my nose. But this smell wasn't the "mythical goddess-like scent" that Tsubasa had said. But it's not far. The senpai smiled slightly, and her body trembled&#8212;he continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--No one knows."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She stroked Asahi's hair lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whether it's now, Asahi-kun and I are talking here, or looking at each other at such a close distance.... Or touching your hair-no one will know. This will only be felt and stored by you. In your memories "When you and I were formed-don't you think it was amazing? Even if I do this with you, the passersby won't notice."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai stroked Asahi's hair, slowly bowing. Asahi thought he would be hugged tightly by his senpai, and immediately shrunk his body in cold sweat. However, senpai senpai didn't do this, but did something else-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She buried her&nbsp;nose in Asahi's hair and kissed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... She smelled Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Se...senpai!? What are you doing, hey, ah--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shhh-it will be heard by others"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai said this, and stopped Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't move&#8212;while Senpai kept kissing his hair with her&nbsp;nose. ...Sounds of sparrows came from a nearby tree. In the sky before Tasogare, the clouds rolled in and the overcast was cool, the children's cheerful laughter alternated. The senpai took a deep breath before finally blowing her&nbsp;nose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. That's right. Hehe"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai tilted her head and looked at Asahi's face. The hand that was stroking the hair still wouldn't leave, at this moment - Asahi noticed goosebumps on her senpai's exposed wrist. Senpai really enjoyed Asahi's blushing face. Her words like this, at such close range, were smelled by others&#8212;no one could keep their cool.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi finally let out a few sounds--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Se, Senpai&#8230; uh, um, when we passed in the cafeteria, did you see the smell of sweat on my body&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh? No, It's a scent, I don't care about the smell, but notice that you change the bath soap."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... bath soap?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, when the cafeteria passed by, I found your body and scent a little different from before. Even though it's your taste, it always tastes a little different than before. So I was wondering if you changed to another body wash. Therefore, I would like to confirm - now it's as I guessed. By the way. Did you change the shower gel?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey ... well, my mother bought bath soap, it should be like this ..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai smiled happily, as if she was saying: 'That's how it is.'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looks like my guess was right. It's true. My nose is pretty good. I can remember the new Asahi-kun's scent now. If you stand the upper hand, even if you are fifty meters away from you, I can smell it from afar."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't understand if that senpai was really saying this or joking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How about we go home together?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai turned around and stepped away. The steps are very light. Asahi followed her, climbed the slope, and returned to the trail. Asahi's heart was still torn apart&#8230; senpai's goal was definitely this. This throbbing didn't irritate Asahi, but instead made him want to smile&#8212;it made Asahi not want to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi clenched his fists tightly and thought: 'I can't be led by my senpai&#8212;&#8212;.'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"-- Asahi-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Walking on the small path, senpai turned her head and looked at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her body trembled slightly, and there was a hint of temptation in her&nbsp;eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you that excited?... Huh? Don't show that expression. Asahi is really kind and strong. If you show me that kind of expression... I don't want to see you at night again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...This person, why--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time, she would just reveal Asahi's eyes like that? At this moment, what was she thinking? If Asahi finds the answer to that question, will this be a hint of a reciprocal relationship with his senpai? Asahi's fists clenched harder. He didn't want to lose just because he liked his senpai. Asahi didn't want to be like this alone&#8212;he wanted to make that feeling crash into his heart. This idea was the driving force behind Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's question reminded Asahi of something that would soon be forgotten. Facing "Everyone's Goddess"-Senpai, who was full of thoughts about Asahi, the first thing Asahi would do to make a bullet pierce Senpai's heart was--.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On Friday and Sunday nights, Senpai threw stones at the window and called Asahi out. Not on Saturday. On Sunday, Asahi asked subtly, but senpai was only vaguely. It's just that senpai thought: Calling Asahi day and night will drive Asahi away - Asahi can't think like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai sometimes didn't call him out of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It also shows facts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That is, the dominance is with senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This does not refer to the dominance of this relationship. In terms of falling in love, there was no point in being taken over by Senpai now. Asahi wanted to master half of it, even if it made her&nbsp;very unbearable, Asahi never gave up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This dominance refers to the dominance to start chatting on the windowsill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On Saturday night, Asahi looked at the balcony of her senpai's house through the window, thinking in her heart&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not hard to throw a stone at someone's window from the balcony without breaking the glass. Even if there was a balcony blocking it, throwing stones from Asahi's bedroom window into Senpai's room was difficult to get there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is very easy for small stones to touch the window pane. But if you use too much force to break or break the glass, then you really can't talk about it. Asahi was worried about this, so he never asked that senpai to come out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Usually senpai started chatting with Asahi. Only at night when senpai wanted to chat, at the time when senpai wanted to chat, senpai would hold the prepared pebble in her&nbsp;hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...On Monday morning, Asahi thought about the evening's business and walked out of the house. He had been in trouble for a long time over the weekend. Therefore, when he walked to the bus stop and ran into senpai on the street, he was taken aback&#8212;though normally he would.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His senpai was wearing a uniform, pushing an old car, and talking and laughing with a strange old woman (a stranger to Asahi, but that senpai knew). Senpai showed a smile, and the old woman smiled as if she had seen her grandson again after a long time. At this moment, senpai noticed Asahi. Senpai bowed to the old woman, and then walked to Asahi's side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun. Good morning. You woke up earlier today than usual."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Good morning. I usually wake up at this hour."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? I thought you lost badly at the wording game last night. Because of me, I didn't want to do it, so I sulked and went to bed early."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The night before, Asahi had completely lost to him in a word game. Modern Japanese was originally Asahi's area of &#8203;&#8203;expertise. She shouldn't have lost, but her senpai would always say something annoying from time to time-like [Ah... I really want to see Asahi-kun's sleeping face], [Don't... don't look at me like this, my breasts are actually quite big] or so on, and in the end Asahi lost to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Asahi was shaken and couldn't say a word, that senpai would get excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This residual feeling seemed to last until this morning, and the senpai looked at Asahi and smiled in satisfaction. &#8230;When they walked side by side, the senpai immediately tilted her&nbsp;head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, what's wrong? Do you care about Grandma Futatsuka?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Grandma Futatsuka?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That old woman earlier. Of course, she's not my grandmother. My grandmother is watching TV at home now, and my grandmother runs a hotel on an island in the countryside. Because Grandma Futatsuka lives nearby, so I sometimes stand and talk to her for a while. Her grandson seems to be working in Kobe. "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Senpai, do you know everyone around here?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hahaha. How is that possible. There are a lot of apartment buildings around here. I really like other people talking to me, so I'll have a chat with them. Did anyone talk to Asahi-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;One often talks to senpai, because senpai has an approachable atmosphere for everyone.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Senpai is also very cute&#8212;Asahi hid this sentence in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Playing with Asahi-kun...that's right, I really enjoyed talking to Asahi-kun. But it doesn't matter, Asahi-kun's strength..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as he was about to walk down the main street, the senpai stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi walked a few steps forward, senpai? &#8212;&#8212;Then turned around. The senpai raised her lips and smiled twice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi. I'm looking forward to tonight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took his phone out of his pocket and glanced at the clock. During peak hours of work and school, buses are often late, enough time for them to catch the bus. Asahi touched the phone and started thinking: He knows senpai's phone number, and also knows senpai's email address and SNS number.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In mid-April, they exchanged contact addresses on the balcony. Her full name was registered on her cell phone--Himi Kanako. It wasn't difficult to communicate with each other on cell phones at night, but senpai never used her cell phone once, and she always used pebbles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, Asahi knew why&#8212;Asahi herself didn't want to use an ordinary cell phone, she wanted to meet senpai senpai at the same time in that quiet and special world. It's like on an ordinary window sill...like in a hole beside a green street with few pedestrians.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hence, Asahi made up his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Evening. Asahi caught his breath and waited quietly. Without knowing when it started, it became difficult for him to calm down. Asahi thinks every day: Can I see senpai? At the same time he would fall asleep with these thoughts every day. For Asahi, it was necessary to remedy this unfavorable environment. ...With a click&#8212;the window rang like 9 o'clock. Asahi walked to the window and opened the curtains in one breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only then did Asahi begin to understand how terrifying Senpai was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--...What..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The so-called dumbfounded--should refer to the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, after morning, Asahi never saw senpai again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nothing to mention happened at school. Except that Tsubasa asked once "Did you take the same bus as senpai this morning?", other than that, the usual school life was no different. Senpai couldn't hear what was happening to Asahi. The only thing that could affect senpai's mood was the conversation in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, senpai still pierced Asahi's heart through the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if the window is opened to confirm, there is no denying that this is a fact.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai made cat paws and shouted splendidly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Meow~"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai wear cat ears on her head.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZJhcZtP/10.jpg" alt="10" border="0"></a>

<p>&#8230;Last week, Asahi received a punishment game where he was photographed wearing a cat ear headband. However, unlike Asahi back then, Senpai was still wearing cat-like clothes. It's supposed to be for makeup&#8212;she's wearing a gothic mini dress with a cat tail. Hands that look like cat claws are gloves that look like cat claws.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why Asahi couldn't say a word was because one was afraid, and the other reason was ---</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai who was dressed as a cat stared at Asahi, her face red, like a cat with upturned fur. same, shaking the body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, the senpai closed her&nbsp;eyes as if feeling a lingering excitement. After a few seconds, she opened her&nbsp;eyes and said calmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun. Have you showered today? What are we going to talk about? Is there anything you want to talk about Asahi-kun? I'll listen as much as you talk&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--Not "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi finally returned to himself with his own strength. Courage and consciousness shattered with just one blow&#8212;he tried desperately to collect the remaining shards while feeling dissatisfied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, you really scare me, why are you dressed like a cat&#8230;!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey? Didn't Asahi-kun wear cat ears the other day? See, you brought it yourself. What else can I say&#8212;my hobby is wearing cat ears."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Please don't confuse the facts! It was a punishment game my senpai asked me to play, and it has nothing to do with the present...!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai tilted her head. &#8212;&#8212;That look is very cute&#8212;&#8212; and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I just thought Asahi-kun would be happy&#8230; What do you think?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There's no doubt&#8212;Senpai's appearance is very cute. But this was only one of the reasons Asahi froze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why is that senpai pretending to be a cat? This cuteness can undoubtedly make Asahi's brain fall apart! So Asahi couldn't immediately respond. To her senpai, what she wanted seemed to be exactly what Asahi wanted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's shoulders shook slightly again. With a slight smile on the corners of her mouth, looking at Asahi, her upper body was lying on the armrest like a stretched cat. The senpai asked again,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you think?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um...you can tell by my reaction?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want to hear Asahi-kun say it from his mouth. Does this cat costume suit me...... Or the answer to the question that arose in the punishment game the other day. Asahi-kun, could it be&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai looked at Asahi and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Have you figured it out yet? Was it last night or this morning?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...This question made Asahi completely understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why is that senpai dressed like a cat?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Senpai. Did you feel anything this morning?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um... if I really want to say it, it's only vague. It doesn't feel so clear. I just thought that the look in Asahi-kun's eyes was looking at me... Asahi-kun's clear eyes were full of confidence. There was a feeling of confidence So I thought: 'Did Asahi-kun find the answer'. So I've been looking forward to it, until now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cat dress is Senpai's weapon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It could be said to be intimidation, or it could be said to be a series. No matter how you describe it, it was meant to make the attacking Asahi immediately stop and make a defense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, quite effective. Asahi's enthusiasm was enveloped by another heat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'll be watching Senpai's frantic appearance, this spine, shocked and clearly seeing Senpai's cute appearance, crumbled to pieces. ...However, after realizing this, Asahi's spine recovered. The fire is burning again. He muttered in his heart: Senpai, this weapon will let you dig your own grave. This was the proof&#8212;precisely because the senpai was aware of Asahi's enthusiasm that she thought of this as a weapon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In short, senpai was quite defensive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai felt that Asahi's enthusiasm and preparation content would likely allow them to change attack and defense tonight. So she made some preparations to defeat Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This had nothing to do with Asahi's self-evaluation. No matter how much Asahi thought he wasn't worthy of his senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter what Asahi thought -</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">no matter how unbelievably that senpai liked Asahi -</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">even if she knew how dangerous it was, senpai still liked Asahi, there was no doubt about that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Show confidence!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you want to sit on par with senpai, don't hold back!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Show courage!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi let out all his resolve and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The cat dress fits Senpai very well, it's almost like it's made to be measured. But sadly, I didn't think of an answer to that question, I didn't think of that at all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Just that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;However, please don't be disappointed too early. Even though it wasn't an answer to the question&#8212;but just as senpai said, I had been thinking a lot from last night until this morning. Precisely because senpai has a problem that I have. I can make decisions."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's tone was not disappointed, her eyes were full of hope. She looked at Asahi and waited for Asahi to say something more interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi said slowly and firmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8212;Before that, I want to know everything about Senpai&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The wind suddenly stopped. Tonight, quiet serenity. This silence and serenity gave people an illusion&#8212;that is, there were only two people left in this world, Asahi and Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai is called a Goddess by everyone. Even though Senpai will show me another aspect, I still don't know enough. I want to get to know Senpai to know more. Otherwise, I definitely can't figure out the problem. The answer is to do what I want to do. even more of a dream within a dream. So, if you could--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...If you can?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't use pebbles to call me like you're doing now. ...Though I still don't know what to do on a rainy day, I don't know when to meet up &#8212; from today onwards, should we open the windows at a fixed time? days. As long as nothing is done."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took a deep breath and continued to add.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If senpai feels embarrassed, annoying, or disinterested&#8230;or if she's afraid she can't tease me by doing that&#8230;Of course she can refuse--&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">" --... Asahi-kun. Did you know? ?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai stood up from the armrest. This was the first time Asahi saw Senpai's serious gaze, she seemed to be enjoying what Asahi was saying. Senpai should be surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can see Asahi-kun's room from mine? But this will only keep Asahi-kun from escaping? If Asahi-kun won't come out, even if I throw pebbles, Asahi-kun can pretend to listen. No, pretend -pretending not to. In the room. Compared to me&#8212;can Asahi-kun's rationality and shyness endure?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Can't help myself here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi tried his best and boldly said-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I also want senpai to know everything about me!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps this courage was showing on her face-Asahi wanted to pretend to be calm. Senpai's expression slightly changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...I really want to hear what you have to say."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai muttered and smiled. Her eyes were full of smiles, and her&nbsp;body was shaking slightly. Her cherry blossom lips exhaled a warm breath. Senpai's long hair fluttered in the wind&#8212;the beauty of her posture made Asahi tremble. The air seemed to be turning pink&#8212;thankfully it was by the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If this happened in Asahi's room or in Senpai's room, Asahi couldn't help but touch Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;My behavior will make Asahi-kun appear several times&#8230; an expression like just now, what kind of attractive expression would Asahi-kun appear&#8230; Hehe, if Asahi-kun wants to do this, I will naturally accompany you&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No regret?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You are the one. How do you manage the time? From now on, let's set a special rule?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;The time is between 9 in the evening and 9 fifteen at night. ...At this time, two people should be in their own rooms. Showers, etc should be completed at another time. ...In general, we should meet at all costs. The senpai said: "If you don't have time to get dressed after taking a shower, put on your underwear and open the window first." If you encounter heavy rain, strong winds, or bad weather, you should make a judgment based on the situation. However, this is not mandatory. However, everyone has their own life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as the special rules were set, that senpai was very interested and very happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This failed to make senpai lose her composure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, after all, I can't go back. Asahi has opened the door to a new world. It opened up a new world that was completely different from the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Meow&#8221; - a real cat, meowing somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai stopped her movements and looked at Asahi. &#8220;Meow&#8221; &#8212;&#8212;The cat meowed like a child again. From the charming look just now, senpai smiled like a little devil, and slowly raised her hand with the cat paw mitt to the side of her face&#8212;even more proficient than the first time&#8212;with a real cat for the third time. Talk and pose excitedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Meow&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;Stand. Asahi said desperately to himself holding it in. Tonight, I finally didn't feel defeat from senpai, and endured it until now. Have to endure it. Sweat broke-but don't show it on your face! Can I hold it---</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai posed as a cat, and she sighed, and her&nbsp;body shook twice. Her cheeks were red and her eyes were blurry. &#8230; Asahi couldn't seem to hold on anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Obviously, ever since he was born, he had never been interested in animal ears. From another point of view, Asahi did open the door to a new world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the third grade of elementary school, Asahi saw his cousin, Aki, cry for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki is four years older and is a junior high school student. At the previous house, when Asahi was playing video games in his room, Aki came straight to his house after school-Aki asked for a spare key from Asahi's parents. After entering Asahi's room, Aki asked&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where is your parents?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...They haven't come home from work yet"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Without Asahi's permission, Aki sat in her room without permission. Asahi didn't think about it, after all, she often did this. While they were playing games together, Asahi's mother came home. Counting Aki's share, Asahi's father also returned home while Asahi's mother was cooking dinner. Asahi's father was a very good cook, and the food of the day was made by the couple.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After having dinner with them, Aki sat there in a daze. Asahi's father glanced at his watch and asked&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Should you come back today? Or stay here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Keep staying."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki only answered this sentence - when Aki lived at her house, she would always sleep in Asahi's room. Therefore, after finishing all the preparations, Asahi and Aki returned to their bedroom together. Aki doesn't like bathing&#8212;so that day. So the two of them continued to play games in the room. In the middle of the game, the role played by Aki suddenly stopped moving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi only noticed that Aki was crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not like I cried for a while&#8212;even though Aki held it in and didn't make a sound, there was still a whimper accompanied by a little pear rain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi called out to her&#8212;the next second, Aki burst into tears. Aki hugged Asahi tightly, sobbing and crying, at the same time crying: I don't want this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Why would my father and mother do that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;It would be great if Asahi's parents were mine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;I really envy Asahi. very jealous. very jealous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--I hate it. I definitely don't want to marry like them. Wasn't right before you married, you liked each other?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about a week before Aki's parents officially decided to divorce. Asahi hasn't asked her until now, what happened to Aki's house the day before or the morning she went to Asahi's house?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki cried for a long time, even when she slept on the bed, she would remember the incident before crying again. She got into Asahi's bed without permission and hugged Asahi tightly. Aki cried and said--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi... If you meet someone you know, someone you know, and get married, will you spend your life in peace? Or will you become helpless like my parents. What about a couple who can't be saved like my parents? Asahi, what do you think? If I can be you, if I grow up to be a handsome man, I might think this is good too--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a long time, Asahi recalled what happened that day again. In this memory, it was rare for Aki who was a nobody to be so weak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was when Asahi was about to go to school in the morning when he received a text message.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, Asahi! Can you make a cup of coffee for mom too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's mother said to Asahi while putting on makeup while eating toast at the dinner table. Asahi replied to her&nbsp;wait a minute, let me see the text message first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who sent it to you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looks like Aki Nee-san.... By the way, I haven't contacted her recently."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sender of the text messages received on the phone is Amaharashi Aki. Asahi's address book basically wrote his full name. When Aki was in the first grade of middle school, she changed her&nbsp;mother's last name to "Amaharashi". The text message is very long-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Hi! Since Asahi moved in, we never saw each other again. Are you okay?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Can I go over to your place to play tonight? It seems that you have moved into a new house, you and your mother will also talk about it. My father, mother, and my mother's remarried partner seemed to be discussing something at my house. I think it's about me and money. I don't wanna listen, and I don't wanna stay home, I wanna see you? Or, let me stay for one night? I'll be there as soon as I get home from work, and I'll be there before eight. I will stay for one night. Please say hello to your mother.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;Today? Aki Nee-san wants to stay for one night?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Last night, Asahi and senpai had just agreed that they would open the window at 9pm to chat! At first, she still greeted and asked for instructions, but gradually it became a sure thing - these few words suited Aki's style very well. Asahi holds the smartphone in one hand and freezes on the spot-on</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">this time, Aki sent another text message-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I forgot to ask!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did Asahi have a girl in high school? I'm just going to say it face to face - do you have a boyfriend? Have you kissed? If you haven't kissed yet, I'll give you some advice. If you have a boyfriend, let Aki Nee-san come and judge you what kind of person you are, don't worry!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi had an unknown premonition.</span></p><p></p>
