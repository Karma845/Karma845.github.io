<h3>Side &#8211; Elly, The Forbidden Witch</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
we are here and ...... the Elf Queen Country is there, then a little further
back would be more suitable for our mission."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly,
the "Forbidden Witch," checked her current location against the map
in her hand and started walking through the dense virgin forest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
wears a magician's hat with a large brim, and her beautiful blond hair is tied
in two. Her height is around 160cm, and she always wears a hat and heels, which
make her look taller.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
breasts are firm, her waist is curvy, and her hips are well rounded.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
face is also gorgeous that can make many beautiful women fumes in jealousy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
it's more appropriate to call her a magical girl with a triangle hat than a
witch.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Now,
she is going on her own to inspect the site to perfectly carry out the plan to
take revenge on Sasha, the elf, as requested by her Master, Raito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
location is in the depths of the virgin forest, some distance from the Elf
Queen Country's capital.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
she goes north, she'll see the mountain range that borders the Dwarf Kingdom.
If she goes south, she'll see the ocean.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
forest is dense and dark, and the grass and tree roots grew and twisted
underfoot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
the most experienced adventurer or hunter would have to be careful not to lose
their footing.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
we are considering not only this mission but also the future,...... a little
further to the north would be better."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Despite
this, Elly walks as if she were on a well-maintained path, unhindered by grass,
roots, hollows, or moss.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
gothic dress swayed as she walked, and several magic books slowly floating
around her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
none of them are caught in the trees or in her way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is because Elly has used the "Action Inhibiting Magic" on herself.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
she was not disturbed by the trees and was able to walk smoothly in that
forest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
walked for a while with the map in her hand and then stopped at a certain
point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
looked at the spot and the map alternately and shouted happily.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is the place!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">This is the right place to realize God
Raito's wishes!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
she mentioned Raito's name, Elly's eyes started to melt with fascination.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ahh,
God Raito, ....... If I carry out this plan perfectly, I'm sure that God Raito
will love me more than that arrogant maid."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
"maid" she refers is Mei, a SUR, level 9999, the seeker maid of the
same rank as Elly herself. Her hair is black and ponytailed, and she always
wears a maid's uniform. </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">It
is a fact known to almost everyone in Naraku that Elly considers Mei as her
rival.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Geeez...
Why? I really don't like the way she acts as if she's God Raito's number one! I
really don't like her! …… But it's a fact that if <span>Mei wasn't
summoned and saved God Raito, God Raito must have died</span>.......”</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
even though she sees her as a rival, she never forgets her gratitude, not even
for a moment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
at the same time, she never forget to grit her teeth and laments, "If only
I was the first person summoned......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"In
the end, I was the third person summoned after Aoyuki-san ... At least if I was
the second, I might still have been able to win. I can't really stand
it..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
the way, Mei was the first to be summoned. The second was "SUR, Genius
Monster Tamer Aoyuki Level 9999", who always wearing a cat hoodie and had
a small breast and short body. The third was Elly, and The last one is the red
eyes, silver hair, and armored "SUR, True Vampire Knight Nazuna Level
9999".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
seems that Aoyuki and the idiot Nazuna are also trying to win God Raito's love,
but they are no better than Mei. Aoyuki is too childish, and God Raito sees her
as a younger sister rather than a girl, and Nazuna is a stupid
child......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
couldn't help but look far away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Whenever
they see each other in Naraku, she usually makes fun of Nazuna and often
argues.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
two of them are famous for their teasing each other in Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
it's not that Elly doesn't like Nazuna.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, she even respects her in a way.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"</span>
<span class="calibre13">She's
very lighthearted, but that's what God Raito is looking for, isn't it? That
stupidity and cheerfulness support the atmosphere of "Naraku" itself
as a mood maker. No matter how smart I am, I can't replace Nazuna-san."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
Elly had suspected, Raito really likes Nazuna's cheerfulness.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna's
cheerfulness was so natural that even Elly could not copy her with her genius
mind.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But
it's a fact that she' s too stupid to be loved by the God Raito. After all, my
biggest rival is only Mei-san, isn't it? ...... There are no rules in love and
war, and in war and justice, the more capable allies you have, the better. I
wonder if I team up with Aoyuki-san, will we be able to win. But sometimes she
looks at me like I'm a disappointment, and that bothers me. I wonder if she's
plotting something."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
is too childish to be her enemy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
reassuring to have Aoyuki as an ally. But she's also concerned about why Mei is
looking at her that way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
also thought of the faces and personalities of the other 9999 level residents
of Naraku. She began to consider who she could recruit to get an advantage.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
can't take Nazuna-san for now. Her fighting ability is perfect, but she's just
too stupid to be on my side."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though that's one of her good points, but Nazuna is too explosive(unpreditcable,
full of surprise).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"In
that sense, God Raito is really an amazing person, isn't he? He's able to handle
and control Nazuna well."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Once
again, Elly felt respect for her Lord and God, worthy of her total devotion.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the same time, her sense of loyalty explodes again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"--In
any case, it is important to complete this plan perfectly. If I complete
the" Sasha Revenge Plan", God Raito will surely praise me! Ahhhhhh! I
can't be happier as a woman. Ufu, Ufufufufufufufu... I love you, God
Raito."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
holds her cheeks with hands, thinking of Raito and whispering her crazy and
paranoid love.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Kikikiki--"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">What
answered her whisper of love was a group of ape-shaped monsters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Because
she had moved too far into the virgin forest, where even high-ranking
adventurers usually won't enter. She had run into a group of ape-shaped
monsters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
level is around 50, and their number is over 100.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are over a meter tall and strong, and even one of them would be dangerous for
an ordinary adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
ape-shaped monster with red eyes and a big mouth on its belly seems to have
recognized Elly as delicious prey and gathered around her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other hand, she quietly became very angry when her ritual of offering her
love to her beloved Lord was interrupted.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
can't believe that a low-level beast like you would dare to interrupt my
whispers of love for the God Raito....... Don't expect you will get an easy
death."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Kikiki!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
ape-shaped monsters were terrified as they looked into her eyes, which looked like
holes darker than the night.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
the higher-level monsters were intimidated by their pack because of their
numbers and teamwork.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
understood that she is a dangerous opponent and attacked Elly at once like
arrows fired before the danger could reach them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Kikikikik!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
if a few of their friends are killed, they would not stop and continue to attack
her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
attack faster than the wind, covering almost everything except the area under
their feet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was inevitable that even high-ranking adventurers would fall to their knees in
the face of such violence and numbers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
they pick the wrong opponent.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Black
Hole."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Elly
snaps her fingers and activates <span>a spell that created as many
"black holes" as </span>the ape-shaped monsters<span>
and trapped them.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Kikiki!"
</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Uki,
Kikiki !?" </span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Ukikiki!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
black holes suck in the monkey monsters' bodies and start sucking them like a
vacuum cleaner sucking in the garbage.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
momentum was so strong that it sucked in all the ape monsters without letting
any of them escape. The apes try their best to resist, but they can't, and one
by one, they are sucked into the black holes and vanish.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
herself did not know where these dark holes led. However, she understood that
it is a hole of despair, where if one is sucked in, it would never be able to
escape and would have to die.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
just a few seconds, the pack of over a hundred monsters vanished as if they had
never been there in the first place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
plays with her blonde hair as if she is bored.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
chose to use a simple spell because I was afraid that if I used a flashy spell,
people would notice it before the plan started....... It's really too simple.
After all, this magic is not suitable for me."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
looked bored and grumbled, but the Black Hole is a high-level void annihilation
magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
chanting the spell and just a snap of her fingers, she immediately activated
such high-level magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
Elly, this level of magic is like a magic trick that she can perform without
using the magic books floating around her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
nickname Elly the Forbidden Witch is not a joke.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now
that the interruption has gone away, I must get back on track and start
preparing for my plan."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
forgets about the ape monsters and resumes her work for her beloved Lord.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Welcome
back, Elly. Good to see you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"God
Raito......!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
she returned to Naraku after completing her site inspection, Raito, who had
been on the surface world as an adventurer, showed up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
had heard that he would return to Naraku using the "Transfer" card.
Still, she didn't expect Raito would come alone to see her personally. The
unexpected surprise caused her voice to rise louder.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
just wanted to ask you about our plan progress. Is it okay if I talk with you
now?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the surface world, he wears a mask pretending that he has a burn on his face,
but in Naraku, there is no need to do so, so he shows his true face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
has black hair, black eyes, and a babyface because he stopped growing at 12
years old. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
could not help but stare at him, but she replies to him with a strong will and
loyalty.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course. I just finished my inspection of the stage for Sasha's Revenge Plan.
Actually, I wanted to report it to you, Lord Raito!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
see. So, the timing was just right. Then, can you please tell me about
it?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Then,
since this is a good opportunity, let me report to you while drinking tea just
the two of us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
accepted Elly's offer with a smile.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
was so struck by his smile that she almost dropped her knees and desperately
fought not to faint.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Oh,
my God, God Raito, with your sparkling eyes, you're the most, the most
precious.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
feel like I'm going to get a nosebleed just from being around you! Just being
around God Raito is enough to make my maiden's circuit go crazy! Haaaa, I'm
glad that I'm alive!)</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
desperately try to calms herself down, but she is very happy in her heart. Her maiden
instinct goes crazy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
this day, Elly reported the progress of Sasha's revenge plan to Raito with a
very happy heart.</span></p></div>
