<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">This is the third volume. Just
as Ryuuto broke through the <i>&#8216;two-month
wall&#8217;</i> for Luna <i>(who breaks up with
her boyfriend after two months),</i> this work has broken through the <i>&#8216;two-volume wall&#8217; </i>for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">It's all thanks to all of you
who have supported me. ...... Thank you so much for your support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Of course, I wanted to publish
the third volume, but I did not want to get my hopes up too high, so I was
slightly flustered when the decision was made to publish the third volume, but
I am very happy to be back in the world of this story again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Once again, I have refined a
youth that I had never experienced before. I ain't done no folk dancing! Who's
the Savage?</span><span style="font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;;"> </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">There are just boys at
our alma mater!</span><span style="font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;;"> </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">We're going to a co-ed school~....
in the next life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">So I was able to publish the
third volume, and as the author, I am glad that it helped to improve the resolution
of Maria. I love Maria as well,... I also have feelings for Icchi and Nisshi,
you know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I thought that the metaphor of
Dragon Ball in the story might not be applicable to teenagers today,......, However,
I couldn't come up with a metaphor that would appeal to a wide range of ages in
today's trend, and since it is a legendary work, I thought that even the
younger generation would know it, so I pushed through the metaphor of a middle-aged
man in full throttle. ...... Sorry, young people. You didn&#8217;t get it? Because
you&#8217;re still a little boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Again, I would like to thank Magako-sama, our illustrator, for her great help. Akari is so much like Akari,
I was surprised and impressed when I saw the character design.. Thank you for
always enriching the world of my work with your wonderful illustrations!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Thank you also to the editor in
charge, Matsubayashi-sama, for his continued support. We are of course grateful
