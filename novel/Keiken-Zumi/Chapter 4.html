<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">At the end of the year, the new
year has begun. On New Year's afternoon, I went to <i>Hatsumode </i>with Luna.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;The scenery is beautiful,
isn't it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Arriving at the hilltop shrine,
I turned around as I climbed the stairs and unconsciously commented.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Although there were residential
areas and busy train lines nearby, the panoramic view stretching far into the
distance and the clear blue sky in winter were pleasant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The shrine near A Station,
where Luna had been taken by her father and grandmother a long time ago, seemed
to be a popular New Year's destination for the locals. Although it was already
noon, the line of people who wanted to pray was still long.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Hmm...you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna, who responded to me with
few words, hid her head in a soft white scarf and put her hands in my coat
pockets with a chill.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna was dressed in formal
attire appropriate for the New Year. The light, cool-colored kimono suited her
perfectly and had an elegance that I wanted to see forever.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">However, unlike her outfit, her
expression was not radiant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;.........&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Since Christmas, Luna's
condition had been lackluster. She should have fully recovered from her fever,
so it probably wasn't her physical health.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...Tomorrow, he said Fukusato-san
will come to my house.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Fukusato was the name of her
father's fiancee. She works as an administrator at a hospital in Osaka, and it
seems that the two of them met through a dating app and have been dating since
this summer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">It seems that they see each
other several times a month, going back and forth between Tokyo and Osaka for
several months, but she found a new job in Tokyo and recently moved to this
area.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">They seemed to see each other
several times a month, going back and forth between Tokyo and Osaka, but she
said she found a new job in Tokyo and recently moved to this area.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;You remember when I told you
that my father suddenly couldn't come the day before the sports festival,
right? He said he went to look at a month-to-month apartment where his current
girlfriend lives. He was contacted by a real estate agent who said, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">"There is an empty apartment in the
place you want. Since there are other people looking, please decide soon&#8217;. </i>So
he was asked to go to Tokyo to look together. So it doesn't look like it was a
business trip.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;.... Is that so...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I didn't know what to say, so I
could only reply with such an ambiguous answer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I didn't want to criticize him
because he was Luna's father, but I was still angry with him. Even though he
had a daughter.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Even though he was a single
parent and had the freedom to have a girlfriend and meet her, did that take
precedence over the event his daughter was looking forward to?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;&#8230;I don't want tomorrow to
come. I had promised to play with Nikoru, but I was told to say hello to her
first. Fukusato-san seemed surprised by my attitude on Christmas Eve. So I have
to apologize to her."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Did Luna really have to
apologize? Maybe that was what her father wanted, but I really wasn't sure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I really don't want to...
Unpleasant things followed one after the other. When March came, it turned out
that Fukusato-san was going to move in here. She's going to use the room next
to me....That place used to be my grandfather's study, and now it's going to be
that person's room.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I really didn't want
to...before that happened, I wanted to get out of that house. Nikoru even
offered, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">'You can stay at my house,' </i>but
Nikoru's house only has two rooms and that would be a hassle for her mother, so
how could I stay there for a few months, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna sighed when she said that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I really don't want to... What
should I do next? Maybe I should get a part-time job? But can a high school
student really rent an apartment to live on her own?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Hmm....&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I don't know because I've never
looked into it, but it might be difficult without parental permission.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Seeing me at a loss for an
answer, Luna suddenly smiled softly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I wish I could live with
Ryuuto.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Her words sounded like a joke,
but I knew she was half-serious.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Let's do that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Eh...?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Hearing my answer, Luna's eyes
lit up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Well, but how?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;The two of us will go to a far
away city...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;And where will we stay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;In a hotel... that's too
expensive.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">In that case, maybe we could
have stayed at Luna's grandmother's house or my grandparents' house, just like
during the summer vacation... But if we continued to laze around and skip
school, our parents would be contacted immediately. So it would be impossible
to stay for a long time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">So it seemed like the only
option was to go to a boarding house. But before that, we had to find a way to
earn money.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I'm going to work. I don't
know how, whether it's a part-time job or day labor.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Uhm, but what about school?
Ryuuto, you've been trying hard to study at the cram school ....&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">That's right, if that's the
case, high school life and college entrance exams aren't top priorities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Besides, I couldn't imagine
what kind of daily jobs were available or how to find them. Even if I was lucky
enough to get a job, it would probably be physically demanding work, and I
lacked confidence in my fitness. Under such conditions, would I be able to make
Luna, who wanted three children after marriage, happy?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The more I thought about it,
the more I could only imagine failure, and I could only remain silent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;....Sorry.... that's not
realistic at all, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I'm already happy
with just your feelings.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna smiled softly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;It's impossible now, isn't it?
So the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">'if we could live together'</i>
analogy was just a joke, fufu.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Seeing my worried face, Luna
said with a smile. Her voice was bright and cheerful. I felt hopeless because
of my own weakness. Seeing Luna's renewed strength was my savior.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As we continued to talk, the
prayer line suddenly moved, pushing us to the front of the collection plate.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Mimicking the adults around us,
we did two bows and clapped, then stood side by side with our hands together.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">After I finished praying and
opened my eyes, Luna, who was next to me, still had her eyes closed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;What were you praying for
before?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As I entered the shrine with a
feeling of relief after getting out of line, Luna asked me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Hmm...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I was unsure if I should say it
or not.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...I hope this year will be a
happy one for Luna.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">When I saw her earlier, I
couldn't help but pray for that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Well, don't worry. This is a
prayer for two people, surely it will be conveyed to God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">My prayer and Luna's prayer.
Since everyone should pray for themselves first, the effect transmitted to God
should definitely be greater.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Hopefully, there would never be
an event that would take away this girl's beautiful smile.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As a last act, I prayed
silently.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Ryuuto...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna's eyes seemed to glaze
over and she looked at me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">And then, with an expression
like someone crying and laughing at the same time, she opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...Fufu, sorry. In that case,
I may have done something unnecessary.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">What does that mean? I thought
and Luna smiled at me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;'<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Please make Ryuuto happy for me too,&#8217; </i>I prayed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...Luna...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">My heart warmed and I
immediately felt a touching feeling.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She really was such a good
girl. Even though she was in a difficult and miserable state like a root, she
was still able to pray for the happiness of others.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Hey, what would happen in this
situation?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna asked me curiously.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Does that mean that we can both
be happy?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I smiled at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Yeah, maybe.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">We held hands and walked down
the steps of the temple.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The sun should be hot right
now, but the wind that hit my face was so cold it made my nose hurt.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As we walked close together,
seeking each other's warmth, I felt that God was quickly granting Luna's wish.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Hey, how about we drink some
tea first?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna said as we walked down the
hill where the shrine was and somehow made our way to Luna's house.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I don't mind, but... are you
sure? Your father and grandmother are home today, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Yes...that&#8217;s why...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna looked down with a dejected
expression on her face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I don't want to be with my
father now...because he might say something about tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I see...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I empathized with Luna's
feelings, so we went to the front of the station and entered a cafe that was
open.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Haaa... I really don't want to
go home.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As we took our seats and sipped
our drinks, Luna suddenly sighed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Starting in March... do I have
to feel like this every day .... when it's my own home?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;But you haven't talked to
Fukusato-san yet, have you? She might be a good person...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Impossible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna refuted my words and tried
to cope with the situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;After all, if she becomes
Father's marriage partner, that means she'll become my <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">'new mother'</i>, right? To me, mom is just my real mother...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna shook the cup with both
hands, as if to melt the caramel macchiato whipped cream in the cup.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Although the heated room was
warm and comforting, Luna's expression remained stiff.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I still can't accept it. Under
the same roof my father sleeps with a woman who has nothing to do with me...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna said as she stopped
shaking her cup.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I don't want to think about
it... it's so disgusting.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She said with disgust.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;........&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Lately I've started to
understand a bit. Luna wasn't just a nice girl who was understanding and
mature.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">What she received every day
with a smile might actually be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&#8220;one of
the two&#8221;</i> for Luna.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As in the case of Operation Two
Lotte, Luna was stubborn, conservative and selfish when it came to things she
did not want to give up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She is not only as bright as
the sun.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She also has a shadow like the
moon. Because she is [Luna]. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red;">(TN: Luna's name </span></i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;;">月愛</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;"> is made up of two kanji, one of which </span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;;">月</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;"> means moon, while the other</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;MS Gothic&quot;;">愛</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;"> means love/affection).</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She's neither a good girl nor
an adult.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">She's just a 17-year-old girl,
an ordinary girl you can find anywhere.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Haaa...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna sighed in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8212;&#8212;
If only I could live with Ryuuto.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">In my head, Luna's words that
she had mentioned earlier kept ringing out. At the same time, the helpless feeling
I had just felt returned. Even though she was so sad, could I only rely on God
to help her?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">If only I were an adult.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">If I had my own income and
could be independent... I could confidently say, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&#8216;Come to my house. Let's live together.&#8217;</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">With my current condition, I
couldn't do anything. It's obvious that if there are two high school teenagers
who run away out of sheer emotion, sooner or later they can't last long.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">So what could I do?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I have to think.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">If I couldn't create a new
place for Luna, the only thing I could do was to protect the place where she
was now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But how?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Luna, can I come to your house
now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna looked a little surprised.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;But my father and grandmother
are still there, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Yes. I apologize for bothering
your family since New Year's. But I'd like to talk to your father for a
moment.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I didn't know if I could
convince him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But it was the only way.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I've never wanted to grow up so
much.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">However...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I'm not an adult. Even though
I'm annoyed to admit it, I still haven't gotten to that stage yet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Children can only rely on the
protection of adults. It was an inevitable thing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Therefore, instead of
recklessly running away with Luna, I would ask Luna's father to protect Luna's
residence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">It was probably the only thing
I could do.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">A New Year's special comedy
show was playing in the living room of the Shirakawa family.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;So, what did you want to talk
about?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Seeing me sitting on my knees
without sitting on the offered kotatsu, Luna's father felt something was wrong
and showed a confused look.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna's father was wearing
casual clothes such as socks and his hair was messy, looking very different
from his previous appearance and looking relaxed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">On the kotatsu, there were
several plates of osechi-like dishes and several cans of beer. Feeling like I
was invading the privacy of someone else's home, a feeling of regret made my
body feel stiff.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Grandma Luna, although
surprised by my sudden arrival on the first day of the new year, said, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&#8216;Would you like to eat mochi soup? I'll make
it now,&#8217;</i> and went into the kitchen. She was the same fashionable and
cheerful person Luna had told me about, with gray hair dyed slightly purple,
which was beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Well, actually...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I barely managed to get a
quivering voice out of my throat.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...I have a request to
make...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;A request?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;U-Umm... Luna-san was very
surprised when she heard that she would be living with her father's spouse from
March... umm, so could you wait a while...?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I said as I nervously bowed my
head, and Luna's father shook his head as if to say, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&#8216;So you want to talk about that&#8217;.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;If that's what you want to talk
about, I already told Luna.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I felt a surprised and annoyed
look on his face, as if he was asking<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">,
'You came here just to say that?&#8217;</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna, who was sitting upright
behind me, felt that look as well. After a quick glance at his daughter, Luna's
father opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I have my own life too. Even
as a family, we are all independent individuals. Even though we live together,
we have to respect each other's freedom... That's why I think I've given Luna
enough freedom. She's seventeen years old and an adult, she should understand
this kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">When I heard those words, it
felt like something stabbed me in the heart.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The remorse and humiliation I
felt at the shrine tripled.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;High school students are not
adults...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I wanted to grow up fast and
chase after Luna. Neither Luna nor I were adults. High school students are
distorted beings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Although I looked like an
adult, had clear interests and preferences, had my own thoughts, and could do
things that adults usually did, I sometimes felt like an adult myself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But I couldn't live alone. I
still didn't have a way to make a living.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I feel so frustrated and
restless, but what can I do? Because high school students are still considered<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> &#8216;children.&#8217;</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">And adults have a duty to
protect children.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;It is the responsibility of
adults to provide a place where children can live in peace.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Otherwise we wouldn't be able
to live.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Please... don't take
Luna-san's place from this house...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">With her head bowed behind me,
I could tell from the rustling sound of her clothes that Luna was also bowing
her head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Even if you say it like
that...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">After a few moments of silence,
Luna's father began to speak.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I have my own situation here
as well. I didn't want to tell my daughter, so I kept quiet...&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">When I lifted my head, Luna's
father looked at me awkwardly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;My future wife has a health
problem in gynecology... she has a disease of the uterus. She is already 37
years old, and since she is getting married for the first time, she wants to
have a child. It may be difficult to conceive naturally, so she wants to start
infertility treatment.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Scratching his neck casually,
Luna's father began to explain quietly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;We have consulted doctors, but
proactive infertility treatment seems to be possible only between a man and a
woman. So we need to get married as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna's father tended to look
away, so I felt I shouldn't look directly at him, so I turned my eyes to the
floor and the walls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I haven't completely given up
hope of a natural pregnancy... That's why I want to live together right away.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As a virgin, I kept looking at
him with a gaze that kept wandering in different directions without fully
understanding what he meant. And with the tension of Luna's father telling me
this, my heart was beating abnormally.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I felt completely uninvited and
wanted to go home right away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">If I backed out now by saying,
&#8220;Haa, I see,&#8221; Luna's situation wouldn't improve.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna's father's situation is
Luna's own father's problem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The thing I think about is
Luna's happiness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Because I put Luna first, there
was something I had to leave behind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">In my mind, I was thinking
about Kurose-san.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Even if I did this, why didn't
Luna's father, who should love her the most, do the same?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">After taking a deep breath, I
opened my mouth again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;...U-Ummm...I thought there
was such a thing as order in everything.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I probably would have said
something very rude to Luna's father by now. But since I was the one who ended
my friendship with Kurose-san, I couldn't help but say it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;I'm sorry if I'm rude, but...
Father, no, Luna-san's father... did you divorce Luna's mother to marry this
person?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Luna's father looked very
surprised.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;That's impossible. I just met
her recently.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Seizing the opportunity, I
pressed further.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;If that's the case... a
relationship with that person wouldn't have been possible if you... hadn't cheated
on her, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I felt that for the first time
in my life I saw a look of confusion on the face of the adult in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Before I could counterattack, I
turned my head completely and searched for words to reassure her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Besides... instead of thinking
about a child that might not be born yet, can't you prioritize the happiness of
the daughter who is already in front of your eyes?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I wanted to say something
cruel. It would definitely hurt Fukusato-san's feelings if she heard it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But Luna's father was the first
to do bad things.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Because she's already suffered
a lot.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Although I didn't ask who I was
referring to, Luna's father must have been able to understand my words. This
way, Luna's father's impression of me would definitely be the worst.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But I didn't care. Although I
didn't like being hated by others. As long as it was for the sake of protecting
Luna, I didn't mind at all. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">However, when I saw that Luna's
father was still silent, I became even more agitated and opened my mouth to try
to defuse the situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Ah, umm, it's not like
Luna-san wants you to get married. I think she doesn't mind if it's just a
marriage registration first. I just want you to wait a while to live with your
partner. At least for another year or so... until Luna graduates from high
school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I don't know if my words were
heard or not, because Luna's father kept his head down and remained silent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">From the direction of the
kitchen, I could hear Luna's grandmother humming along with the sound of
kitchen knives. She must have been completely oblivious to the situation in the
living room.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The popular comedians joking
around on the TV looked like they were from another planet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">".........."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I was at a loss for words.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">As I endured the horrible
silence, Luna's father suddenly stood up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Please get out of here right
now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">His face showed obvious anger.
I guess it was a natural reaction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">&#8220;Y-Yes... I apologize for
disturbing you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">I got up from my kneeling
position shaking. I was ashamed of myself for making him angry without being
able to convince him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">But when my eyes met Luna's, there
was a gentle glint in her eyes.</span></p>
