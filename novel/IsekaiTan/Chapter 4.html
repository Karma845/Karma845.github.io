<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; A World That Begins To Creak</h3>

<p>24th January, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>The southern part of the Great Grantz Empire is warm even though the season is winter.</p>
<p>This is because the vast expanse of the empire has resulted in a drastic shift in the sense of seasons from region to region. As a result, the temperature differs significantly from region to region, making it easy for those who are not used to traveling to get sick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why a book called &#8220;A Beginner&#8217;s Journey&#8221; is selling well in the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, be careful of the monsters in the south&#8230; And there seem to be more bandits than in other areas. Is it because of the heat that they get impatient? I sometimes get frustrated too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The red-haired girl nodded her head in admiration as she read the Beginner&#8217;s Journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same everywhere, isn&#8217;t it, Liz-dono?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman with greenish-blue hair smiled bitterly, but she looked pale as if she wasn&#8217;t feeling well.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl sitting next to her nodded in agreement, but her gaze was fixed on the book in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like Skaaha said, they&#8217;re everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I guess you could say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz closes the book with an indescribable expression and places it on the chair.</p>
<p>The girls were currently in a carriage. When she looked out the window, she saw a land of green and brown mixed together.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We&#8217;ve almost arrived at Sunspear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunspear is a large city in the south ruled by one of the five great noble families, the Muzuk family.</p>
<p>Among the five regions, the southern region was the hottest, with half of the land occupied by wastelands and deserts due to the arid climate. However, in the north part of the region, the land is fertile and habitable for people. Sunspear is built on the land to the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunspear is&#8230; famous for its trade, but also for its gold, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s amazing. There are many specialties that come from all over the world. Even the Great Imperial Capital can&#8217;t beat it. I think Sunspear is better in terms of glamour. You would be surprised to see the palaces built with gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>It connects to the Great Imperial Capital in the north, the Principality of Lichtine and the Steichen Republic in the south, the Third Imperial Capital in the west, and the Iron Eagle Castle in the east. It&#8217;s also a gold-producing region, where the wealthy of the Grantz Empire are concentrated. There are many other merchants and get-rich-quick schemes in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the Steichen Republic is targeting may be the interests in that area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz tilted her head at Skaaha&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But there is something wrong with it. Aren&#8217;t they a little calm for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>When they entered the south, Liz decided not to head to the Berg fortress but to go to Sunspear in order to prioritize the meeting with the Muzuk family. That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s on her way at full speed with about thirty guards in tow. Incidentally, the rest of the soldiers are on their way to the Berg Fortress with Ghada.</p>
<p>However, Liz had a strange feeling. The closer she got to Sunspear, the stronger it became.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The atmosphere is definitely strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so too, Aura?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s wrong with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skaaha said in a low voice and pointed out the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have arrived at Sunspear.&#8221;</p>
<p>In front of the main gate, where merchants were coming and going, soldiers were checking luggage.</p>
<p>But the guards of Sunspear, perhaps noticing the flag that Liz&#8217;s carriage carried, saluted her. He then approached the carriage, exchanged a few words with the coachman, and peered in through the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Celia Estrella, welcome to Sunspear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz responded with a smile, but her expression was tense.</p>
<p>Something is wrong after all ― she can&#8217;t believe the soldier&#8217;s relaxed attitude.</p>
<p>As soon as they get past the main gate, their doubts are confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aura&#8230; are you sure the Steichen Republic is invading?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aura, who had been asked the question, only snorted nervously and did not answer. She also looked at Skaaha, but she also crossed her arms and tilted her head.</p>
<p>Liz looked over the letter of intent that the head of the Muzuk family had sent. He had sent several urgent letters while Liz was on her way.</p>
<p>After all, no matter how many times she looked at it, she could still see the impatience of the head of the Muzuk family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; why? The Steichen Republic is supposed to be closing in on the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last letter said that an army of about 60,000 troops was about to surround the city. However, when they looked out the window at the city, no one looked as if war was imminent.</p>
<p>The streets were filled with people, just as they had been when she had visited in the past. Above all, there were people dressed in flashy clothes, probably in high spirits because of the new year. No matter who she looked at, there was a smile on their face. The atmosphere was so cheerful that it was hard to believe that we were in a time of war.</p>
<p>Before long, Liz was confronted by a palace built entirely of gold.</p>
<p>The vainglory of the Muzuk family was apparent as if they were showing off their power.</p>
<p>The carriage stopped, and the doors were opened, filling the interior with dazzling sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Liz set her feet on the ground, she saw a man bowing his head.</p>
<p>Vetu Rüger von Muzuk. He was the young head of the Muzuk family, one of the five great noble families.</p>
<p>He took over the position of head of the family at the young age of twenty-seven after the previous head passed away due to illness.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, he disposed of the corrupt nobles and contributed to the development of Sunspear by working hard to attract merchants from neighboring countries to establish trade routes.</p>
<p>He is a shrewd young man, but he is a man of great ability, and his entourage is also full of talented people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dream come true to have Your Highness Celia Estrella in my palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flashy woman was standing next to Vetu. She was dressed so lightly that her underwear showed through, perhaps to keep out the heat.</p>
<p>However, perhaps because of the hot climate, she did not give the impression of being indecent, and the lines of her body were clearly visible, indicating that she was a woman of artistic beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Selvia Sephone von Muzuk. I&#8217;ve only met Your Highness Celia Estrella once. Do you remember me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz made a smile as she responded to Selvia&#8217;s offer of her hand with a handshake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I remember you. I hope you are well, Madame Selvia.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liz came of age, she had been the first to congratulate her. She seems to be on good terms with her sister, Rosa, and they have been exchanging letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weather has been getting colder lately, making it easier to spend the day. Oh, by the way, how is Rosa-sama? She seems to be busy, so we don&#8217;t exchange letters as much&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s doing fine. I think it would be good if my sister came here at least once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped. She is the acting head of the Kelheit family, after all. She&#8217;s in a position where she can&#8217;t move around as easily as she used to, so when things settle down again, I&#8217;ll pay her a visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means, do that. I&#8217;m sure my sister will be delighted to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz replied with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little early, but the meal is ready. The weather is getting colder, so let&#8217;s go inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the Muzuk family, Vetu, interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p>Aura and Skaaha, who hid her face from the public, stood near Liz as they finished their greetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean to talk too long here. Shall we go inside?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as she said this, Selvia approached Aura and the others and began to greet them.</p>
<p>Vetu gave Liz a wry smile as they watched the scene with dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should go inside first; the food is getting cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But first, I&#8217;d like to ask you a few questions about the Steichen Republic&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s question was interrupted. Because of Vetu&#8217;s hand urging her to enter the palace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can talk about that during the meal because you never know who might be listening in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s true, too. Can you show me the way, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu bent at the waist in a graceful gesture and began to walk ahead of her.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the entrance to the palace was a wooden door. Even so, it was made of the finest wood, and its luxury was not inferior to that of the imperial palace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you surprised? Why aren&#8217;t the doors made of gold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;just a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz couldn&#8217;t help but touch her own cheek to see if it was showing on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was heavy. When you make a door out of gold, it takes a lot more manpower and time than you think to open it. My wife discarded it as a waste of money and time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason was even more trivial than expected. And it was a reason to which she was not sure what to say in reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz smiled lovingly and decided to cover it up appropriately.</p>
<p>While they were having this conversation, the door opened, and the air inside was expelled outside.</p>
<p>Liz tried to step in but failed.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the hall, she found many people on their knees, bowing to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they heard that Your Highness Celia Estrella was coming, they insisted that they should greet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were all southern nobles. Liz raised her eyebrows suspiciously at the enthusiastic welcome. However, she could not get the words out of her throat as the head of the Muzuk family moved on before she had a chance to question him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, Your Highness Celia Estrella. I warned my husband to stop, but he insisted that this was the one thing he would not give up, and I could not stop him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, he was showing off his power of control to Liz. By claiming that the southern part of the country revolves around the Muzuk family, he emphasizes how important a position he holds.</p>
<p>If Hiro had been present, he would have said sarcastically, &#8220;Thanks for your useless actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But unlike Hiro, Liz could not be ruthless. She felt that she should say a few words of gratitude to the people who had gathered for her.</p>
<p>As she passed by the southern nobles, she gave them a few words of appreciation.</p>
<p>When she had finished talking to the last one, she looked behind her with a tired expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Let&#8217;s eat quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was looking at Selvia, who was smiling at her with a hand on her cheek, looking at her lovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was led to the dining room by Selvia, who pushed her back.</p>
<p>In the room, servants were lined up against the wall, waiting. Vetu was smiling near the long table where the food was placed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Celia Estrella, please come this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned his hand to the honorary seat. Liz gave a slight nod before taking the seat. The others followed suit and sat down in their chairs. Then Vetu raised his silver cup.</p>
<p>He glanced at Liz as if he was asking her to propose a toast.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m not very good at&#8230; this kind of atmosphere. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to get used to it.)</p>
<p>Liz sighed, trying not to be noticed.</p>
<p>She then raised the silver cup and looked around to make sure everyone had it.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I&#8217;d like to thank Lord Muzuk for this opportunity&#8230; and the twelve great gods of Grantz for bringing us together&#8230; Oh, and the Spirit King?&#8221;</p>
<p>The atmosphere was awkward. Her red eyes swam as if to ask for help ― but there was no help in sight.</p>
<p>Aura&#8217;s face is expressionless, and as usual, it&#8217;s hard to read what she&#8217;s thinking.</p>
<p>Skaaha has a motherly look and a satisfied smile on her face. Liz felt like holding her head in her hands, but she decided to raise her silver cup proudly and let it pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;C-cheers&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone responded with a cheerful toast. It was as if they were trying to cheer Liz up. However, there was no time to be crushed by regret and reflect on the situation.</p>
<p>She quickly changed her mind, put the silver cup on the desk, and looked at the head of the Muzuk family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a few questions I&#8217;d like to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sweetness disappeared from Liz&#8217;s face, and the air changed as her expression became serious. As if sensing this sensitively, Vetu finished her drink with a sip and gave her a sharp look.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, you seemed to want to ask me something earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was wondering what on earth is going on here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s so strange about it? We have made all the necessary preparations to welcome Your Highness, the Princess of the Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s temper flared as she slammed a stack of papers on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter repeatedly emphasized that the Steichen Republic was invading ― oh, who wrote that ― and you don&#8217;t have to dodge that. Can you just tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liz got up from her chair in anger, Vetu felt that it was not a good idea to deceive her, so he let out a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;As it turns out, it wasn&#8217;t my idea to deceive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s eyes grew cloudy, and she began to feel a rush of emotion. Vetu put his elbows on the table and covered his mouth with his hands, wondering if he should answer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when the sound of a crash echoed through the dining hall.</p>
<p>Liz turned her attention to the source of the sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Aura?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aura&#8217;s figure standing there jumped into view. Behind her, a chair had fallen over.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Aura did not respond to Liz&#8217;s words, her face pale and trembling. Next to her, Skaaha seemed to have noticed something as well, gritting her teeth in frustration and angrily shaking her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Celia Estrella. The contents of the letter are all lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liz slowly returned her gaze to its original position, what came into view was a man with a cunning smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a lie. Because we have already negotiated with the Steichen Republic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was astonished. Her eyes widened in disbelief. Her clenched hands trembled as if she was trying to suppress her murderous intent. It was as if she was telling herself to stay calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-if that&#8217;s the case, why did you send me so many letters&#8230; asking for reinforcements?&#8221;</p>
<p>In Liz&#8217;s mind, there was a desperate assumption that he was in cahoots with the Six Kingdoms. She summoned the Flame Emperor and prepared for battle, ready to fight at any time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that the Six Kingdoms are invading, right? You know that this is not the time to play around. This is not a joke, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a joke, and it was a request from someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone? Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s not the Six Kingdoms&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her patience was at an end.</p>
<p>A clear murderous intent gushed out of Liz and pierced into Vetu. An ordinary man would be intimidated by the situation, but a man who has been through a lot of painful situations is able to handle it calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an order from His Highness Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>In an instant, her murderous intent and rage dissipated. Instead, what appeared was agitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what are you talking about? Hiro&#8217;s orders? Why should he do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s eyes were twisted with grief as if she was about to scream that it was a lie. She couldn&#8217;t find the words as the mystery swirled around in her head, fueling her confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you&#8217;re surprised. I was surprised, too, when His Highness Hiro asked me to write you a false letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu&#8217;s voice was tinged with sympathy, but his words did not reach Liz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, why&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz said.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t directed at Vetu, but at the image of the young man in her mind.</p>
<p>But Vetu took it as a reply and tried to open his mouth.</p>
<p>But――</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he didn&#8217;t want to put Your Highness Celia Estrella in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his wife, Selvia, who took the initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the current central government is dysfunctional, so there is no point in having Your Highness stay there, and it is natural to send you to the south in search of strength. But even so, he doesn&#8217;t think that the Six Kingdoms will just end up rampaging in the west. He probably wanted to evacuate you to a safe place in case of an emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evacuating me&#8230; won&#8217;t stop the Six Kingdoms, will it? If the central falls, they will invade the south as well. Then it is better to fight them together&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why His Highness Hiro decided to buy you some time until you can build up your forces by using himself as bait. But he did not tell you the truth. Because you would surely have stopped him from going to his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selvia echoed Hiro&#8217;s sentiments, her long eyelashes quivering with sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosa-Aneesama&#8230; won&#8217;t allow that to happen. She&#8217;ll stop him even if I&#8217;m not there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. All of us know the truth, except you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Vetu turned his compassionate eyes on her, a tremor ran through the long table where the food was placed.</p>
<p>Liz had struck it. It was not anger but sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, are you trying to tell me that this is something that Rosa-Aneesama planned together with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>With tears in the corners of her eyes, Liz&#8217;s appearance was painful.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result&#8230; but Rosa-dono also made a painful decision&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu cut off his words in the middle of the sentence and called out again to Liz, who had left her seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you planning on going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. There&#8217;s no reason for me to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make it. A messenger arrived before Her Highness Celia Estrella did. By now, he will have clashed with the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll join up with the Fourth Imperial Army right away and head west.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll join up with the Fourth Imperial Army right away and head west.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once Liz started walking, Skaaha and Aura followed suit. They seem to feel the same way and will not listen to what Vetu has to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have known this, but&#8230; it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sigh of exasperation, Vetu snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>The door that connects to the hallway swung open and armed soldiers rushed in.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz looked at him and drew her Flame Emperor from her waist. Aura also has a spirit weapon in her hand, but Skaaha beside her is empty-handed for fear of revealing her true identity. When Liz and the others indicated that they would not back down, the soldiers, sensing that their lives were in danger, quickly readied their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please listen to me. We have no intention of fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let the soldiers go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. I would never break my promise. I believe that trust is more important than life. So, will you please comply obediently?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll just have to force myself to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Liz and Vetu stared at each other, both determined not to give up.</p>
<p>Tension was building between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now that you&#8217;ve taken the Fourth Imperial Army?&#8221;</p>
<p>Selvia was the one who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opponent has swelled to an army of 200,000. Even with the Fourth Imperial Army with only 20,000 troops, the result is obvious. Above all, are you going to let His Highness Hiro&#8217;s resolve be for naught?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; but with Hiro&#8217;s plan, we might be able to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. But the chances of winning are close to zero. Your Highness Celia Estrella must know that. There is no point in rushing for reinforcements now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s lips tighten in frustration, perhaps because she knew what she was getting into. The Flame Emperor let out a small burst of flame as if to represent Liz&#8217;s emotions.</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s gaze wandered around, desperately trying to find something to deny, but it created impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;that&#8217;s right. Blutar is in the Felzen region! We should contact――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the Third Prince Blutar has been captured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selvia said without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who raised her voice was not Liz. It was Aura who was behind her. She was looking at Selvia with eyes wide open in surprise, which was unusual for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard that the army of the Third Prince Blutar, which was deployed in the Felzen region, was destroyed by the Queen of Anguis, one of the countries of the Six Kingdoms. In the meantime, we have received reports that many of the western nobles have shown their vassalage to the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We have to inform Hiro!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He already knows about that, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was about to run when Vetu blocked her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please stand down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Highness Hiro is aware of this. It was he who reported the capture of the Third Prince Blutar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Highness Hiro has 20,000 troops, and you have 20,000, for a total of only 40,000. If you go now, you won&#8217;t make it. Now is the time for you to save your strength. Or do you have a secret plan to defeat an army of two hundred thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230; But I feel like I have to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz felt like she was going to lose sight of Hiro&#8217;s back. She was finally able to grasp it, but fear crept up her toes as if she could never catch it again. A cold sensation enveloped her entire body as if her body was sinking.</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t keep her composure as she couldn&#8217;t understand what Hiro was thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When Vetu saw Liz shivering even though she was not cold, he felt something and lowered his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I now understand why His Highness Hiro did not tell you the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu&#8217;s eyes, which had once again been staring straight at Liz, were not lit with any emotion.</p>
<p>Liz narrowed her eyes and glared at Vetu.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Vetu lifted his hand sluggishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a little too intuitive, as His Highness Hiro wrote in his letter. It&#8217;s all well and good to be impetuous, but if you go too far, you&#8217;ll become overzealous, and disaster will befall you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu continued to talk about Liz&#8217;s shortcomings indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Highness Hiro is using himself as a pawn to further your development. Your personal feelings are secondary to his desire for the well-being of the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu stroked his chin curiously with a mysterious light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But then ― how far does he look ― no, does he mean it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s expression stiffened as Vetu lowered his face and began mumbling to himself. But he was unconcerned, entering more and more into his own world.</p>
<p>The strange silence soon passed. Suddenly, Vetu looked up happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see. Your Highness Celia Estrella, I have come up with a plan that will allow you to rush to reinforcements right now. Moreover, we may be able to drive back the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s eyes were filled with anticipation for a moment, but when she looked into Vetu&#8217;s eyes bared with desire, she felt a chill run down her spine. She thought she had caught a glimpse of this man&#8217;s true nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;But on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>A creepy hint of a grip around his throat emanated from Vetu.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will take my son as your husband, I will lend you a hand in this war against the Six Kingdoms. If you ask me to assemble them right now, I can gather about thirty thousand. If you can give me some time, I can get you more&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you help me&#8230; if I accept your conditions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, if you become my son&#8217;s wife, I will give you my full cooperation. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Political marriages are not uncommon nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aura, who was listening to the conversation between the two behind Liz, moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well ― Mm!?&#8221;</p>
<p>However, she was unable to move forward and was dragged backward. Skaaha tried to rescue her as quickly as possible, but Selvia, who had blocked Aura&#8217;s movement, put her index finger over her mouth.</p>
<p>That was all it took for her to realize her intentions ― for Skaaha, she pulled back straightforwardly and looked at Liz with pleading eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right――&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to have made up her mind. There is no hesitation in her eyes. She stared straight at Vetu and opened her mouth without hiding her discomfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse. Don&#8217;t joke with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz brushed her sideburns off her shoulders and put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>Her eyes darted to Vetu, who tilted his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Didn&#8217;t you just tell me not to be so impulsive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As an aspiring emperor, I can&#8217;t give in to the threats of my subordinates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz declared proudly.</p>
<p>Vetu held his temples as if he had a headache.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the country collapses, how can you talk about being emperor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But as a member of the Grantz Imperial family, I cannot accept such a demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; that was well thought out, wasn&#8217;t it? How can you help His Highness Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiro would be furious if I rushed to his aid under such conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before leaving, Hiro told Liz to follow her heart. Then, there was no way she could follow through with Vetu&#8217;s unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by ‘furious’&#8230; Hahaha, to be rejected for such a reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife interrupted him from behind the laughing Vetu.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should stop teasing Her Highness. It might put you at a disadvantage in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu smiled and had the soldiers put away their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Highness Celia Estrella&#8230; please forgive my rudeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selvia, who approached Liz soundlessly, bowed her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no sons. We do have daughters, but the eldest one is just two years old. Therefore, my husband&#8217;s suggestion of a political marriage was a jest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-is that so? I thought he was serious&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your quick decision is refreshing, Your Highness, but at the same time, it is also dangerous. In the future, you should take your time and think before you make a decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selvia advised her with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;But since the fault lies with us, we shall listen to Your Highness&#8217; request.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hey, Selvia, don&#8217;t just decide that yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu shouted at his wife, who was trying to get a hold of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glare he gets instantly turns him off.</p>
<p>Silence coiled between them for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vetu gave up. He showed a slight hesitation, but then he knelt down in front of Liz with a look of instant determination on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The preparations are already in place. The southern nobles will now stand up to save the Grantz Empire from danger. It would be a shame to our ancestors if we let the savages from the west go unchecked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz let out a silly voice, unable to comprehend the situation.</p>
<p>It was Selvia, after all, who gave her a helping hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally, it was a promise we had made to His Highness Hiro to cooperate with Your Highness Celia Estrella, but things got complicated when my husband got greedy and went out of control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz didn&#8217;t know it, but Hiro and the Muzuk couple had made a secret pact. Vetu agreed as it was in the best interest of both parties. This is why it was decided from the start that they would cooperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;R-really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz couldn&#8217;t understand it yet, but she could only reply dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I would like you to add 50,000 troops under your command. Oh, it won&#8217;t take long. We&#8217;ll be ready to go in about a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Didn&#8217;t you say it was thirty thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said before, we have been making preparations since we decided to cooperate with His Highness Hiro. Although the marching speed of 70,000, including the Fourth Imperial Army, is slow, I think it is enough to provide reinforcements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was momentarily taken aback but gradually understood and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for your generous cooperation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then please give your orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like her husband, Selvia dropped to one knee on the floor. The soldiers and servants followed suit and knelt down on the floor.</p>
<p>Liz regained her composure with a single cough and stomped across the floor, raising her arm and pointing her palm at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;After joining up with the Fourth Imperial Army, we&#8217;ll take on the Six Kingdoms in a decisive battle to save the Grantz Empire! We may be outnumbered, but I&#8217;m convinced that the quality of our soldiers is superior. We are the dominant lions of the central continent, and we must know that defeat is not an option!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Yes!&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>All of those who knelt in front of Liz gave her a pleasant reply in unison.</p>
<p> &#8220;I shall head to the Berg fortress and make preparations. I&#8217;ll join you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Vetu looked up, he could only see the back of the princess as she left.</p>
<p>Vetu smiled at the now tiny lioness.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a healthy girl, don&#8217;t you think? Fate is a cruel thing since His Highness Hiro will no longer be in this world when she runs to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing up, Vetu followed Liz&#8217;s now invisible back with his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not be in time, not even close. His Highness Hiro&#8217;s plan was brilliant and flawless. Losing him would be a great loss for the Grantz Empire, but it would be good news for the enemy&#8230; as Her Highness Celia Estrella would be easy to control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is unlikely that you will be able to do as you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when Selvia warned him, Vetu frowned uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl will get stronger. Although I&#8217;ve never met His Highness Hiro, but&#8230; I&#8217;m sure he will stand in your way as even more of a nuisance than he was before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose side are you on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Waving his hand in the air as if to say it was deafening, Vetu summoned his entourage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever, let&#8217;s just go along with it for now.&#8221;</p>
<p>As her husband began to walk toward the entrance, she watched his back and put her finger on her chin.</p>
<p>After a beat, she immediately beckoned one of the servants with her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at the servant kneeling in front of her with eyes that were not lit with emotion. She gave off a far different vibe than before and lifted the edge of her mouth in a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be best to take out insurance. Contact Rosa-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she cast a glance at her husband&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women will do what they please. The men should just shut up and kneel down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here she was, smiling a bewitching smile befitting her appearance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― Mark territory at the western end of the central region.</p>
<p>On the borderline connecting the central and western regions, 20,000 troops led by Hiro had formed a camp. They are investigating the movements of the Six Kingdoms from here.</p>
<p>There are many collaborators. Villagers whose villages had been burned, nobles who had been expelled from their cities, soldiers who had been defeated.</p>
<p>Hiro told them to report any information to him, no matter if it was false or not.</p>
<p>Even now, another messenger was galloping his horse in a hurry toward the center of the camp.</p>
<p>Beyond him, the &#8220;Black Dragon&#8217;s Banner&#8221; was raised at the top of the tent. The imposing majesty of the banner fascinates the hearts of those who see it. It seemed to have an unbreakable faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have discovered an enemy scouting party three cells (nine kilometers) away. The flag shows that they are definitely the Second Conquest Army. This is consistent with the testimony of the villagers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fifth Conquest Army is a little too far away. It seems that they are using the city of Serus as their main base, and they are dispersing in all directions to loot the village. The city of Serus is twenty cells (sixty kilometers) away from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fourth Conquest Army, perhaps aware of our presence, has deployed its forces on the Larix Plains and is waiting for us. I couldn&#8217;t get a grasp of their commander, but judging from the situation, I&#8217;d say he&#8217;s belligerent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside the tent, people were coming and going rapidly. The civil servants who processed the information were sweating profusely as they sorted through it.</p>
<p>However, it was unimaginable to deal with the never-ending reports of messengers.</p>
<p>One after another, bundles of reports piled up on the desk. They were more than the reports that the civil servants had scrutinized. The central nobles around the desk were scratching their heads at the ever-increasing number of parchments.</p>
<p>Not that it was anything too much trouble. They were in despair over the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Hiro, who was sitting at the honorary seat, also glanced at the pile of parchment with a problematic look on his face, sighed, and then turned his attention to Orléans, the head of the Mark family, who was sitting nearby.</p>
<p>&#8220;The damage is much greater than I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently so&#8230; I don&#8217;t know where to start with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans nodded curiously, then picked up a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy has divided its 150,000 troops into six armies ― five armies excluding the main army ― and is invading. They will be merciless to those who stand against them, merciful to those who follow them, and fearful to remind those who are ambiguous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;More importantly, any confirmation of the rumor that the third prince Blutar has been executed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears to be true. The report of the third prince Blutar&#8217;s death seems to have had enough of an effect to discourage minds, and the western nobles are showing their willingness to surrender one after another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans slammed his fist down on the desk, lamenting the unworthy western nobles.</p>
<p>The flashy sound of it brought about a moment of silence. Everyone stared at Orléans with surprised faces, but they immediately got on with their own business with a glare.</p>
<p>In the midst of the renewed noise, Hiro waited for him to calm down before addressing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, are there any western nobles who have not shown any intention to surrender and are still resisting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The son of Lord Kyrthia, a western nobleman, has asked for reinforcements. The city of Sabelt seems to be under siege by the Six Kingdoms&#8217; Second Conquest Army. The city has suffered considerable damage, and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before it falls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The son asked for reinforcements?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that his father, Lord Kyrthia, lost his life in the battle against the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the location?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please wait. The report should have just come through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans fished through a stack of scrutinized reports to find what he was looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is it, yes. It&#8217;s a little under-reported in some areas, but&#8230; shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, can you give me a rough idea of the position of the Second Conquest Army, along with the other armies? You can put the pieces on the map behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The desk in the center was overflowing with reports, so Orléans placed the pieces on the map prepared behind Hiro. Hiro stood up, turned around, and walked over to the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the Second Conquest Army is two days away from here ― the one closest to it is probably the Third Conquest Army, and the one deploying its forces a little further away is the Fourth Conquest Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Have the surrounding nobles surrendered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of what their true intentions are, at this point, I think they are likely to turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing as they please, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one wants their territory to be destroyed. Therefore, the situation seems to be that they are forced to run for protection. In addition, it is unavoidable now that they have lost the third prince Blutar. It&#8217;s not something that can be forgiven, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans muttered regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the Third Imperial Capital safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of garrisoned troops is not very large, but they are strong, and it will be difficult to bring them down with the Six Kingdoms dispersing their forces. Even if they try to take the war to an endurance battle, the Six Kingdoms will be in trouble with food, and I think the Six Kingdoms won&#8217;t be dealing with them in this war.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if they&#8217;re aiming for the Central, it&#8217;s best to ignore them. Forced attacks will only result in the death of more soldiers for nothing. Maybe the idea is to create a siege situation by forcing the surrounding allies to surrender and then have them raise the white flag when they are isolated to minimize the damage&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re safe, it&#8217;s fine to leave them alone for now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what do you want to do? We could head to the Third Imperial Capital and join them in the siege?&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans pointed out, Hiro shakes his head to deny it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no point if we are not taken seriously. If we are not careful, we could be surrounded and trapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>But most importantly ― Hiro said in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose of our mission is to drive the Six Kingdoms out of the west. There is no point in staying in the Third Imperial Capital. So let&#8217;s keep in mind that we have to destroy the Second Conquest Army that is besieging the city of Sabelt. Since the enemy is dispersing, for the time being, it&#8217;s fine to adopt a policy of destroying them individually.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy to eradicate the Second Conquest Army is to use a pincer attack. In order to do that, they must get in touch with Lord Kyrthia&#8217;s son in the city of Sabelt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you instruct him to strike when we attack from behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how big the siege will be, but I&#8217;ll send out a skilled secret agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay if you fail. If that is impossible, I will think of another way. But please do that first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro returned to his chair and looked at the central nobles who were struggling with a stack of reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s decide on the roles of each of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro told them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>＊＊＊＊＊</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― Hadrian&#8217;s Border Fortress at the northern end of the central region.</p>
<p>The border fort that connects the central and northern regions was visited by an unusual force.</p>
<p>The number of them is five thousand. It was eerie to see them march in silence, without revealing their faces, wrapping their huge bodies in armor, and without exchanging even a single word. Moreover, the flags they were carrying were unfamiliar, which made the people look even more uneasy.</p>
<p>The families of the soldiers living in the border fort looked on with anxious faces.</p>
<p>Two sharp horns on a purple background ― the flag is the emblem of the demon race that once plunged the world into chaos.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, no matter what the family members thought, the soldiers were not afraid.</p>
<p>The reason lies in the other flag.</p>
<p>This flag depicted a white horse with a single horn growing out of a purple background. It was the banner of the great general Rox Van Levering, once called the &#8220;Five Generals of the Black Sky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flag of a general who served the God of War. Even though they respected the army led by the descendant of the general, the soldiers of the Grantz could not be rude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&#8230; the seal of the fourth prince Hiro and the second prince Selene are stamped on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guard captain in charge of the border received the letter and examined it for anything suspicious. However, when he saw that the royal family&#8217;s seal was affixed to the letter ― and that it was written in their joint names ― he immediately broke into a salute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Majesty Queen Claudia, welcome to the Great Grantz Empire. You may pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize for the inconvenience. I was in a hurry, so I hope you&#8217;ll forgive my rudeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No problem. I&#8217;m grateful to the Spirit King for allowing me to meet the descendant of Rox-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled at the bowing captain and kicked the horse&#8217;s belly. The captain of the guard shouted uncharacteristically loudly at the back of the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Claudia! If you&#8217;re going to stay here for a while, you can stay at the mansion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m in a hurry at the moment, so I&#8217;ll just take your kind offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia skillfully maneuvered her horse and raised her hand to the captain of the guard to show her affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guard captain sat down on the ground from the waist down as if he had lost his back in the face of that charming smile.</p>
<p>Claudia laughed happily as she increased the speed of her horse and headed for the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Claudia!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of her aides rushed her horse to the front of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there something wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The messenger we sent to Hiro-sama has returned. It seems that the situation is not good after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia put her finger on the tip of her chin and slightly lowered her eyes. Then an aide presents her with a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a letter from His Highness Hiro as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the letter from him and looked it over quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufufu&#8230; you can think of something quite amusing, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Claudia smiled a girlish smile for her age and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;You intend to deceive everyone&#8230; Are you going to be a pawn for that? Really&#8230; you really are a horrible person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia is shivering alone, and her aides are making quizzical expressions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we stop cooperating after all? Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if we were to cut down the northern part of the country and build up our forces on our own?&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t understand the meaning of Claudia&#8217;s laugh, and when his aide asked a question, she glared at him with frozen eyes. It didn&#8217;t take long for the aide to realize that he had chosen the wrong words when he noticed that she was filled with such murderous intent that she could have killed him with just a glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;M-my apologies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia looked away from the aide, who bowed down in panic, and raised one hand to the sky.</p>
<p>The purple crystalline stone glowed brightly in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get much by jumping to such a short-term gain. Look at the big picture. Don&#8217;t look at the bait that is offered to you, but at the one who holds the bait that is offered to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She formed a fist with her raised hand and pointed it in the direction of the Great Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the way for the demon race to survive. There is no <i>king</i> among us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to get the sun shining in the sky again, they must grab it with their own hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ara&#8230; You don&#8217;t look convinced, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The unhappy look on the aide&#8217;s face seemed as if he was afraid to say anything as if he knew it would upset Claudia.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think that I am a dictator who does not listen to her subordinates, then leave this place right now. If not, then as a vassal, you will speak out to remonstrate with the ruler that she is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-with all due respect&#8230; we do not have the power to fight the Six Kingdoms. With the current state of warfare, I thought it would be more&#8230; convenient to cooperate with the Six Kingdoms in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia let out a sigh of dismay when she heard the words that were more unconvincing than she expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will only make you a puppet. Big favor over small favor, in order to make the Levering Kingdom an even bigger power, it will only be a loss if you follow the Six Kingdoms, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t it be the same if we lost even if we joined Hiro-sama?&#8221;</p>
<p>The aide persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all honesty, the Six Kingdoms have no regard for the Levering Kingdom. They don&#8217;t see the value of a country that is located in the far north, where resources are scarce&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing more irritating than to demean one&#8217;s own country, but Claudia felt that this was the best way to convince and inspire her aides.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we cooperate, we will only be used as a stepping stone and then annexed. It&#8217;s no different from a vassal state of the Grantz Empire. How can you ask your people to be slaves once again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T-that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The aide fell silent at the painful words. Claudia saw that and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why we have decided to cooperate with Hiro-sama. We, the demon race, are going to use the Six Kingdoms to let the world know that we have returned to the central continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conditions that Hiro had offered were even better than that. If they followed the Grantz Empire, they would get what they wanted. It was a valuable item that could not be obtained by joining the camp of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Your Majesty. I will follow all of Your Majesty Queen Claudia&#8217;s instructions. Please forgive me for asking such a trivial question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter. If you have any doubts, you can always ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia looked up above her head, narrowed her eyes, and smiled lustily.</p>
<p>Now that she has become queen, she will never again allow the demon race to be relegated to the shadows.</p>
<p>Always under the sun ― if that&#8217;s the case, she&#8217;ll take it easy and make a name for herself as a foolish monarch.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last sentence in the letter suddenly came to her mind.</p>
<p>All in one ― what on earth does that mean? Since it&#8217;s Hiro, it seems to have a deeper meaning, but she can&#8217;t think of anything now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I guess we&#8217;ll find out when we meet, Hiro-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would have gotten what she wanted by then. This is the reason why she moved her army like this because she had that condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so&#8230; this is going to be fun. The times to come are unpredictable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia struggled to hold back her laughter at the mayhem that was about to occur.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>6th February, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>The news came in the morning. Not a moment had passed since the morning sun had begun to shine on the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, only a few soldiers could be seen starting their morning exercises, and the main camp of the Six Kingdoms was so quiet that the sound of footsteps could be heard. A woman was walking through the camp in her underwear.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was absolutely confident in her body, but she showed no signs of shame in her gait. She was so regal that the soldiers were afraid to look away for fear of looking directly at her.</p>
<p>When asked who was the most dazzling woman in the Six Kingdoms, everyone would say her name — Commander Lucia Levia de Anguis ― also the Queen of Anguis.</p>
<p>She stepped into the command center with loud footsteps as if she couldn&#8217;t hide her annoyance.</p>
<p>In the room, there were already staff members and even the Urpeth siblings.</p>
<p>When they recognized Lucia, they stood up and saluted her at once, but several of the staff members blushed at the sight of Lucia. Even though they tried to turn their faces away, the sexy atmosphere she exuded was enough to draw their attention.</p>
<p>However, they are no different from stones on the roadside to Lucia, even if they look at her fondly. No matter what kind of feelings they have for her, she is an existence above the clouds that they cannot even talk to her outside of a meeting.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;At ease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia was woken up from a fitful sleep, and her eyes were fixed on the floor as though she were in a foul mood. The staff in their chairs turned their faces down in tension. The only ones who kept the same attitude were her assistants, Seleucus, and the Urpeth siblings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, are you trying to seduce me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle said with his arms over the back of his head and lust in his eyes.</p>
<p>But Lucia glared at him, not with embarrassment, but with murderous intent.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Do you want to die?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle hurriedly straightened his posture, unable to speak a word, and his whole body hair stood upright. The gravity in the room has obviously increased by some percentage. A large amount of greasy sweat poured down from Eagle&#8217;s forehead.</p>
<p>As the surrounding nobles groaned, Luca stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please forgive my brother for his rudeness. This fool was only trying to lighten the mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough of that, report the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia waved her hand as if she had just lost her temper, and the deadly atmosphere that filled the room dissipated.</p>
<p>Seleucus stood up from his chair in response to Lucia&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me explain it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up one of the pieces and placed it on the map. It is the place where the Second Conquest Army is deploying its forces. Lucia looked at Seleucus with a quizzical expression, wanting to know what he meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The descendant of the God of War has launched a full-scale campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others were particularly astonished as Lucia&#8217;s eyes sparkled with interest at his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Se-Seleucus-dono&#8230; is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure? How is it possible for reinforcements to arrive so quickly?&#8221;</p>
<p>The command center buzzed noisily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve just received a report that the Second Conquest Army has been destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What exactly happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>The command center shuddered in astonishment as the staff officer shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t there a report until it was destroyed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were the scouts doing? Are they scouting deep in the mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of you ― stop screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>After banging on the desk to silence the noisy people, Lucia glared at her surroundings and then opened her mouth again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seleucus&#8230; explain the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You all know that the Second Conquest Army has surrounded the city of Sabelt, right? However, the Second Conquest Army may have been careless and easily raided from behind by the Grantz Army under darkness. In addition, the Lord of the city of Sabelt struck out, completing the pincer attack. The commander&#8217;s loss added to the confusion, and they were annihilated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did they fall for such a straightforward plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were tributes from the surrounding villages and towns, and they were having a feast with the alcohol.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I can&#8217;t even say that I&#8217;m surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, a letter of praise for the commander of the Second Conquest Army was received from the lord of Sabelt, and the euphoria must have caused him to let his guard down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha&#8230; What about that guy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia laughed dryly and showed a form of anger as if she would kill him right now with her own hands. Seleucus, on the other hand, was not intimidated and continued to read the report without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that whether he was captured or killed in battle, we have not been able to confirm that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he has returned alive, bring him before me. I&#8217;ll strangle him to death with my own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia repeatedly struck her hands with her iron fan and breathed hard, perhaps to unify her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The tribute was probably a trap designed by the &#8220;Ancient King.&#8221; What country is he from? How can he make such a mistake in the time of war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Urpeth Kingdom, yes. Do you recognize the name General Lekigmaev?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, that&#8217;s our guy&#8230; Hah, he fell for such an obvious trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle covered his face with one hand and shook his broad shoulders in shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so ashamed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He exuded anger as he said this, and Luca, who sat next to him, quietly raised her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to regain our honor, we will defeat the Descendant of the &#8216;God of War&#8217; ourselves. Seleucus-dono, how many soldiers does the enemy have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Including the soldiers of the surrounding nobles, I&#8217;d say more than 30,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then 50,000 troops should be enough. Her Majesty Queen Lucia, may I have your permission to go into battle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should stop, I understand your desire to redeem yourself, but if this is part of the Ancient King&#8217;s scheme, you will be jumping into a deadly situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see&#8230; I cannot leave my country in disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just give up for now. It was all about our superior numbers, which led to our carelessness and the destruction of the Second Conquest Army. We may have the upper hand in the war, but we can&#8217;t afford to be complacent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t be careless!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle slammed his chair to the ground in a rage. Unfortunately, some of the debris hit a few of the staff members, and they lost their strength and fell down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Majesty Queen Lucia. Can&#8217;t you leave this to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stepping on the wreckage of the chair, Eagle, with a blue vein on his forehead, gives a twitching smile. He wanted to jump out of the chair right now, but his reasoning seemed to be holding him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a very short temper, you know. Or would you like to have some fight with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia glared at Eagle again and smiled venomously as she ordered the fallen staff member to be taken to the infirmary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a lot less bloody, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then stop barking. It&#8217;s only a loss of twenty thousand. The remaining 180,000 are still alive and well, so if the Grantz Army were to attack in the darkness, they would only be defeated individually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia stood up and pointed to the map with her iron fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Above all, the wedge has already been driven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia smashed the pieces of the Second Conquest army and poked at the pieces of the Third Conquest army nearby.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certain that the Third Conquest Army is the one closest to the Ancient King?&#8221;</p>
<p>When she asked Seleucus to confirm, he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, let them strike the Ancient King two or three times and then join up with the main army. The remaining three armies should do nothing and join up with the main army as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to bait them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. Listen, give strict orders to the Third Conquest Army not to make any serious moves. It will only encourage them. There is no guarantee that the western nobles who surrendered will not change their minds if they lose. So don&#8217;t take any chances. All they need to do is to repeat the provocation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what should we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca asked while patting his grumpy brother on the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must regain your wits and keep in mind that the Ancient King must be defeated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia also instructed them to change their supply routes and to disband the army temporarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why now? I don&#8217;t mind changing unit commanders, but disbanding the entire unit and reorganizing it will disrupt the chain of command.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia wrinkled her nose when she saw that Seleucus was trying to say that it was a bad idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, spread the word that the Six Kingdoms have not established a chain of command. You can also spread rumors about the Urpeth siblings and me not getting along.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent any escape, they lured the &#8220;Ancient King&#8221; deep into the west. It&#8217;s a blatant invitation, but if the entire army is forced to retreat temporarily, they will have no choice but to come after them. Then, many western nobles who have been freed from the threat will join the Ancient King.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when the Ancient King will be finished, and he will swallow the time bomb and explode.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you understand, you must act immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia said, and her staff and subordinates rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>In the hustle and bustle of the command center, Lucia stopped one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eagle, wait a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? I have to follow my sister, or she will get angry with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still love your sister, don&#8217;t you? But don&#8217;t worry, it won&#8217;t take long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia looked at the shining blue crystalline stone in Eagle&#8217;s left hand and cleared her throat.</p>
<p>Her eyes glistened like a ferocious predator that had found its food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ― are you prepared to die for your sister?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― near Sabelt in the middle of the western region.</p>
<p>Hiro had moved his main camp to this location and was receiving reports about the Six Kingdoms movements.</p>
<p>Around the command center, the staff and nobles were busily running around. They were busy making arrangements for the transport of prisoners of war, checking broken swords and armor, and calculating food rations for the increased number of soldiers since the Second Conquest Army had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Messengers were constantly coming and going through the tent. Priority was given to reports from the scout troops on the enemy&#8217;s movements, the status of the security of the camp, and the discovery of supply routes.</p>
<p>After that, the status of the roads and the locations of bandit and monster outbreaks were reported to the western nobles, who were mainly supporting the rear with a small number of troops.</p>
<p>If they can&#8217;t handle the situation, they are ordered to contact the central.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the Fourth Conquest Army, which has been deploying troops in the Larix Plains, has made a move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans, the head of the Mark family, comes to Hiro with a report in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that they are acting in response to the destruction of the Second Conquest Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Instruct the soldiers to increase their surveillance and remain vigilant. They will probably try to set us up. More importantly, what about the damage here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want the details?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just a rough estimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The damage is minor. Three hundred cavalry and one thousand infantry. But thanks to the western nobles gathering and joining forces, our numbers have swelled to 30,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; but there is something that concerns me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans holds out a sheet of report.</p>
<p>Hiro looked over it quickly. The names of the nobles who died in the war were written on the parchment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the central nobles have been killed ― I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The cause of death was all stray arrows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were from our side. It&#8217;s too much of a coincidence. Seven people killed by stray arrows, it can only be the work of assassins sent by the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s raise the guard by one level. I&#8217;d like to let as many people as possible rest, but we can&#8217;t afford to turn our backs on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is morale still low?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro asked. Orléans patted his chest and said not to worry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; morale has been boosted by the destruction of the Second Conquest Army. Saving the city of Sabelt seems to have helped, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s move on to the next phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>The enemy is consolidating their forces that had been dispersed, and it was going according to their expectations.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Orléans&#8217; forehead is sweating from anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it really troublesome to rally the opponents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are indeed tougher when they are concentrated than when they are dispersed, but concentrating together on the battlefield can sometimes be fatal. If you can&#8217;t establish a chain of command, you&#8217;re no better than a mob. If we take advantage of that gap, we can easily overturn the difference in numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hmm, I believe such a report came in.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that there is a quarrel between the commander and the deputy commander in the Six Kingdoms. In addition, it seems that they have been disbanding and reorganizing their armies, perhaps because they feel uneasy about the armies they have taken over due to suspicion. If the scattered troops are drawn there, the chain of command will be in complete disarray.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Is it working roughly as I expected?)</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s smile deepened, and he walked over to the map behind him to further ensure his plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about the next part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking sideways at Orléans with a piece in his hand, he nodded silently and urged him onward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the middle of the line to the western nobles who have joined us. If we send them to the front, once they have succumbed to the Six Kingdoms, they may immediately disrupt the formation and cause it to collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color of defeat, once ingrained, would never fade. The fear that has been kneaded into them is enhanced as if it were a beautiful memory. It was not hard to imagine what would happen if they were sent out into the battlefield.</p>
<p>(Well, their morale was low ― they should be sent to the rear support.)</p>
<p>If it had been a battle that they could afford, Hiro would have sent them to the front again and won the battle. That way, they could regain not only their morale but even their confidence. However, the situation of this battle was hopeless from the start ― in such a situation, there was even a sense of distrust in the upper echelons of the military among the soldiers.</p>
<p>(I think we could have removed this by eradicating the Second Conquest Army, though.)</p>
<p>The soldiers that Hiro led are no longer a problem, but the defeated soldiers of the western nobles who joined them are not. They have been completely subjugated once. Some of them may be burning with vengeance, but not enough to affect the whole.</p>
<p>Then why ― why did he incorporate them into the army?</p>
<p>(Now, Orléans, what kind of response would you give me?)</p>
<p>If possible, he would have liked to see a reaction that would have made him confident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it good? As expected, Your Highness Hiro, you are brilliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans praised Hiro&#8217;s choice excitedly. Hiro felt his emotions cool down at once. He desperately suppressed the impulses running through his body and tried to maintain his composure.</p>
<p>However, his black eyes were filled with an abyss.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, please proceed as such. The same goes for the western nobles who will be joining us in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was able to grasp a part of the anxiety that he had been harboring since the war with the Six Kingdoms began.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. It was something that had been on his mind for a while, but now he could do it without any problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, I&#8217;ll place the central nobles at the front and leave the rear to the small and medium nobles. I&#8217;ll also take command at the front.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will act together with Your Highness Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans happily expressed his opinion, to which Hiro responded with a ghastly smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be reassuring to have you as my assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro turned on his heel and strode toward the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll be leaving here in two days. I will leave you in charge of the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to go now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will rest for today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, then. let me take care of the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling the presence of a bow behind him, Hiro waved his hand and went through the entrance to return to his tent. Once outside, the air, monopolized by the cold air, froze the skin.</p>
<p>For Hiro, it felt like a gentle spring breeze, thanks to the &#8220;Black Princess Camellia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was walking silently in the dark night when he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Some things never change, even after a thousand years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking up above him, he saw that a star-filled sky dominated the world. The light of the full moon was shining down on the earth, accompanied by the colorful stars dancing in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who it was&#8230; Who was it who said that the stars are the souls of people?&#8221;</p>
<p>When a person dies, they become a spirit, and the spirit soul becomes a star and continues to watch over the world with the spirit king. So when people feel fear, sadness, or loneliness, they can look up at the sky and know they are not alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes, that&#8217;s right. It was Liz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro heard about it when they were camped at Mount Himmel. He was struggling to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the situation, and his memory had begun to fade.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I was so happy at that time. I felt like you were really talking to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now, he no longer feels the warmth of a hug nor the tenderness of being wrapped up in it.</p>
<p>Hiro stretched out his hand to the night sky as if he regretted the distant past.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I made a choice. A thousand years ago, I was afraid to walk, so I chose a path that I could shamefully run away from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro turned his face down sadly and raised his right arm, running his fingertips over his eye patch.</p>
<p>If Liz and the others aren&#8217;t here, he doesn&#8217;t feel the need to conceal it anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could be wrong, but&#8230; I finally found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly, he removed his eye patch, revealing eyes of sorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go. In order to be more arrogant than anyone else, more powerful than anyone else, more of a king than anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――<i>I will devour the world.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame I won&#8217;t be able to watch her grow until the end&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiles a wistful little smile. However, it is broken in an instant.</p>
<p>The next thing that appeared ― the face that peeked out from the abyss was a face of disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let us end an era for a new myth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro muttered a prayer and began to walk again. He stomped on the ground silently, yet forcefully, with unconcealed killing intent.</p>
<p>The sound of insects muffled, the cries of the wind disturbed, and the sound disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be a pawn for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro ducked through the tent&#8217;s entrance that had been prepared for him and looked around the room. His gaze immediately stopped. A man was waiting for him with his head bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hiro-sama, I have been waiting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind him was a chair, on which someone was sitting, tied up with a rope. A cloth had been bunched around his mouth, perhaps to prevent him from screaming.</p>
<p>Hiro walked forward and looked down at the man&#8217;s head, who knelt on the ground and gave him a word of encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your hard work. And thank you for assassinating the central nobles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I failed to kill one of them. I apologize for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of. It seems that you brought the one who you failed to kill with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the person who was raging behind the man. He was desperately trying to plead for something, but the biting cloth made it difficult to hear him over the animal-like snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many others are infiltrating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only ten, including myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro had made a deal with Claudia to cooperate with him before he started his plan.</p>
<p>One of the things that Hiro wanted was to have an assassin kneeling in front of him. The assassin&#8217;s skill was impeccable. He could tell from his presence that he was quite a skilled assassin.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is a letter from Her Majesty Queen Claudia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro took the proffered envelope, pulled a nearby chair, and sat down. He took out the letter, looked it over quickly, and lifted the edge of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; It seems that everything is generally fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stood up, flicking the letter around, and walked over to a desk in the corner of the tent.</p>
<p>As he glanced at the map spread out, he picked up a pen and began to fill out the words on the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry to ask you to bring him here, but can you please get rid of him? Now that I have proof, there&#8217;s no need to torture him to get him to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without even a glance, Hiro pointed his pen at the captured central nobleman.</p>
<p>He got confirmation from the exchange at the command center earlier.</p>
<p>The head of the Mark family, Orléans ― in all probability, he is connected with the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s the Black Death Village&#8230; Either way, Orléans is guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how he&#8217;ll react if he loses his entourage again. Will he be anxious and wary, or will he be dazzled by the opportunity before him?&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be nice if he felt even a hint of fear when he learned that an assassin was working in the dark within the camp.</p>
<p>Next, Hiro sighed ― a deep one that contained sorrow.</p>
<p>The nib of the pen that had been busy on the paper stops. Then he takes out a new piece of paper.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Liz, you will definitely take the throne.)</p>
<p>Even though he couldn&#8217;t get rid of all Liz&#8217;s opponents, if Rosa and the others supported her, the hardship would not be a problem. And the political strife would strengthen her mind, and she would finally have the strong spirit of an emperor.</p>
<p>(And I hope she will save her strength for the battles to come.)</p>
<p>There will be times of frustration. There may be days when she wants to cry.</p>
<p>But Hiro believes that she will be able to overcome them.</p>
<p>Sadness can make a person grow. Anger gives people energy. Joy gives people happiness.</p>
<p>(I pray that your thoughts will bloom in the world.)</p>
<p>Hiro put his pen on the desk and turned around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to need your help with a few things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the assassin sent by Claudia.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-whatever you need.&#8221;</p>
<p>The assassin nodded curiously, but his voice trembled in the face of the enormous amount of supremacy radiating from Hiro.</p>
