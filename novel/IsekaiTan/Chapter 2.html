<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; A Lie In The Darkness</h3>

<p>January 6th, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>The Imperial Palace Venetian ― ostensibly, it was getting back to its usual noisy days.</p>
<p>Many dignitaries were visiting, nobles were exchanging words, and soldiers were keeping a close watch. It seemed as if the scene before the rebellion had returned.</p>
<p>However, the interior was still intact, and the long corridor leading to the throne was covered in blood. Not wanting to be reminded of the horrific scene, people tended to avoid this corridor.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor, there was a faint sound of noise coming from the entrance.</p>
<p>But it was soon drowned out by the sound of the armor of the patrolling soldiers.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, Hiro was walking down the long corridor that connects to the entrance.</p>
<p>There is still a strange smell lingering in the air. The blood of the nobles who were killed during Stobel&#8217;s Rebellion was sticking to the walls.</p>
<p>(I wonder if they will temporarily seal off the passage and replace the wallpaper. Or will it be left as a warning&#8230;? No, it&#8217;s the next emperor&#8217;s job to think of that.)</p>
<p>Hiro traced the bloodstains with his fingertips and pondered the future plan.</p>
<p>(Now, there are plenty of ways to defeat the Six Kingdoms. But even if I could do that. The mastermind will never come out on the stage. I need bait to draw out those who are hiding in the dark.)</p>
<p>What kind of future does the mastermind not want? What kind of future does he crave?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that there is insufficient information to make a decision.</p>
<p>Then a decoy will be needed to make it clear.</p>
<p>(What they want is&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro paused. He found himself at the entrance of a heavily guarded building.</p>
<p>There was a familiar face in there ― Liz, looking around as if searching for someone.</p>
<p>When her red eyes caught sight of Hiro, a smile bloomed on her face, and she ran over to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been? I&#8217;ve been looking for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw her complaint without hiding it, and Hiro gave her a wry smile and scratched his head.</p>
<p>It was hard to say that he had been at the Emperor&#8217;s Cemetery just like the day before yesterday. He didn&#8217;t want her to know about it yet. It would be too much trouble for her to track him down, so he decided to lie quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some noblemen have approached me for advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, really&#8230;? Hiro is becoming very popular nowadays, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was easily convinced. It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s lying about being asked for advice by a nobleman, either.</p>
<p>It seems that the nobles see Hiro as the closest to the throne and are trying to contact him, talk to him, and offer him a marriage proposal. The latter, however, gave up with an apology when he told them that he wanted them to go through the Kelheit family, which unites the Eastern nobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly, have you prepared everything, Liz?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve left the preparations to Aura.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro lamented, without showing it, that this girl had thrown her duties away again. As if sensing the delicate atmosphere, Liz hurriedly waved her hands in front of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, that&#8217;s not it. The two of us discussed it and decided on it. Aura told me to leave the rest to her. It&#8217;s true, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stroked his chest in relief. If they have decided on their roles properly, there is nothing to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already grown up, you know? You can trust me a little bit&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She pouted her lips in frustration and made a kicking gesture at the floor. She emphasized, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to sulk, I&#8217;m going to sulk if you don&#8217;t apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. From now on, I&#8217;ll listen to you before I make a decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, good. Then listen to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her index finger was pointed at the tip of Hiro&#8217;s nose, and he replied with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. In the meantime, I&#8217;d like to hear what Liz and Aura have decided after discussing the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, since we can&#8217;t just stand here and talk about it, and since it&#8217;s not a secret either, so&#8230; let&#8217;s talk about it over there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz pointed to a couch in front of the entrance and grabbed Hiro&#8217;s arm. After being forced to walk, Hiro narrowed his eyes at the sight of Liz&#8217;s back, still as energetic as ever.</p>
<p>When he reached the chair, he was thrown into it and sat down next to her, who then put her finger on the tip of her chin and looked at the ceiling. It&#8217;s a gesture she makes when she remembers something.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to limit the number of guards I take to around three hundred because of the urgency and speed of the march. You see, we might have to start a war with the Steichen Republic, so we&#8217;d better hurry and go to the south.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz began to explain, bending one of her fingers and making a counting gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I can get to Fort Berg, there will be 20,000 of the Fourth Imperial Army&#8230; and if I can get the cooperation of the southern nobility ― depending on the Steichen Republic ― there could be over 50,000 of our troops by the time I arrive back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s voice was bouncing happily and beginning to heat up. She wanted to tell Hiro that she was being helpful. Hiro nodded with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>(After all, the time it takes to get back to the center is too delicate.)</p>
<p>Even if things go according to Hiro&#8217;s plan, it will take roughly two months.</p>
<p>(Even if I move in accordance with the plan, how much time can I gain against the Six Kingdoms&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro turned his face down and began to worry. In his field of vision, something passed by with great force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro snapped out of his thoughts and saw Liz&#8217;s white hand swaying in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Hiro&#8230; you didn&#8217;t hear what I said, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>A low voice struck his ear. A chilly sensation ran up his spine.</p>
<p>This is not good. Hiro hurriedly tried to make up an excuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no, I heard you fine. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no problem with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cowered deliberately, but Liz&#8217;s face was as indifferent as if she were a con artist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmph&#8230; that&#8217;s a pretty bland answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I didn&#8217;t have anything to point out. I think it&#8217;s unavoidable that the answer would be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. If you don&#8217;t want to hear it&#8230; then it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw him off. It&#8217;s too late to regret what he has done.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s shoulders slumped, and he was thinking about how to apologize when suddenly a large shadow appeared above him.</p>
<p>When he turned his gaze upward, he saw a knight standing there, his entire body wrapped in black armor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for you, One-Eyed Dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Ah, Ghada.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the time to be dealing with him. He could feel the anger flowing from Liz next to him. He knew that his life was in danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that react――&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, Ghada abruptly cut off his words and nodded as he looked alternately at Liz and Hiro. Although the helmet obscured his expression, he seemed to have grasped the current situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get into a fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we didn&#8217;t fight. It&#8217;s just that Hiro wasn&#8217;t paying attention to what people were saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; I see, that&#8217;s the One-Eyed Dragon&#8217;s fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>He suddenly appeared, interrupted the conversation, and instantly understood the situation.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s eyes appealed for help as well as he thought he was an intelligent demon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hah, why don&#8217;t you apologize anyway? That should make the little girl feel better, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. When I come back from the south, I can forgive you if you accompany me to the city to have some fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a very specific and lengthy request. Whether there would be time left to play or not, he wondered. But if he refused, it would be like pouring water on a fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s go to the city together when Liz comes back. I&#8217;ll buy you something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Can you promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. The next time I see Liz again, we&#8217;ll definitely go into the city together to do some shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm. Well, I&#8217;ll forgive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite her words, Liz&#8217;s mood seemed to have improved, as her cheeks relaxed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Even though she&#8217;s developing, she&#8217;s still got the little girl parts that go with age.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the dogfight is over, why don&#8217;t you listen to what I have to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro shifted his gaze to Ghada, letting his sarcasm wash over him. Liz also listened with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think I have to go to the south too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;m sure Liz told you, I want you to bring the Raven Army with you. If you add in those who have been healed and those who are practicing on their own, there will be around 3,000 to 4,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, send Hugin and Munin, and there will be no problem. I&#8217;ll be working with you, One-Eyed Dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If we have to fight the Steichen Republic, your knowledge and experience will be needed. And if the Raven Army is to join in, your command is absolutely necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; You&#8217;re going to fight the Six Kingdoms, aren&#8217;t you, One-Eyed Dragon? I think that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll need my help the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though Hiro clearly rejected him, Ghada was still stubbornly reluctant to admit it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a way to buy time. I&#8217;m not going to start a full-scale war until the Grantz Empire&#8217;s forces are in place. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to have you head south.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said forcefully as if he did not want to say anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you sure you&#8217;re okay with this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s mouth twitched as the stubborn Ghada refused to budge.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s Liz or Ghada, it seems that&#8230; they don&#8217;t trust him&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s okay; it&#8217;s not a problem. So I want you to get ready to leave, Ghada.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a waste of time to ask and answer any more questions. With no intention of giving in, Hiro decided to change the subject forcefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz, how are Aura and Rosa doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro&#8217;s attention turned to other issues, Ghada could not say anything more and fell silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Liz, who had been asked to speak, opened her mouth in a panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, it looks like Aura is headed to the spirit temple in the city. She said she was going to say goodbye to the children. Rosa-aneesama is having a meeting with her entourage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Liz clapped her hands loudly as if she remembered something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah, Skaaha regained consciousness. She wanted to see Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she hasn&#8217;t regained her strength yet&#8230; She also has some discomfort in her legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough for her to go with Liz and the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it really okay to take her with me&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz crossed her arms and tilted her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more she rests, the faster she will recover&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro could sense that Liz was concerned about Skaaha&#8217;s well-being from her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so too. But there is no one to protect Skaaha in the imperial palace to ensure her safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it were just her, it would be fine, but there would be a high possibility of ugly political disputes in the Imperial Palace. There&#8217;s no guarantee that Skaaha won&#8217;t get caught up in it. There is nothing more troublesome than the issue of succession to the throne. However, whether it&#8217;s Hiro, Liz, or the second prince Selene, the people involved don&#8217;t have time to think about such things. However, even if they don&#8217;t intend to do so, they are certainly in a situation where the people at the end of the line could go out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have time to think about who will be the emperor now, though. I guess for those who don&#8217;t go to war; politics is war.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for Liz to bother with such small matters. For now, her priority should be to gain experience and accomplishments. Hiro sees this period of turmoil as an opportunity. He was convinced that it would encourage her to grow even more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I agree. Now the heirs to the throne must join hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz nodded her head in agreement with Hiro&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>At that moment&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Celia Estrella!&#8221;</p>
<p>A voice called out to Liz, and the three of them, including Ghada, had their attention drawn to it.</p>
<p>A soldier was standing there.</p>
<p>The three of them looked at him at once, and he stopped as if he had shrunk. He was so nervous that he could not continue to speak but only moved his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Do you need something?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liz called out in a calm tone, the soldier saluted her with a panicked look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Lord Bunadhara wants to see you. She wants to ask for permission to bring in her luggage!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Bunadhara is Aura.</p>
<p>The Bunadhara family is a prominent family that has produced many excellent counselors known as the Five Counselors, and they reside in the west. Currently, they have switched factions, so their daughter Aura has taken refuge under Liz.</p>
<p>(It doesn&#8217;t look like the Six Kingdoms are closing in on Bunadhara territory yet&#8230;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time. If he considers the future of the west, he doesn&#8217;t want them to do anything rash.</p>
<p>(In the meantime&#8230; it is better to nail them and send them a letter later&#8230;)</p>
<p>While Hiro was pondering, Liz stood up vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Please tell her to wait for me; I&#8217;ll be right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood! Lord Bunadhara is supposed to be waiting for you at the Kelheit family mansion!&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldier who had fulfilled his role as messenger bows to Hiro and Ghada and then leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll talk again at dinner today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz waved her hand towards Hiro and started walking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ll see you at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>After hearing Hiro&#8217;s reply, Liz turned away to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, and give my regards to Hugin and Munin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro carved out a small smile as Ghada blended into the crowd flooding the doorway.</p>
<p>The calm air that had been hanging in the air earlier was gone.</p>
<p>Instead, Hiro wore a ruthless expression of wild madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s about to make her move&#8230; and it&#8217;s time for me to make my move in earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The image of the black-hearted queen who is steadily building up her power in the north comes to mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to fail from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Start the lie of a lifetime.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tightrope walk of life, to the abyss if one step is missed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat or be eaten&#8230; Only God knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro then laughed happily.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>A freezing wind was blowing. The snow was raging so fiercely that it was nearly impossible to go outside.</p>
<p>The Levering Kingdom ― the largest fortress city, &#8220;Purple Snow City.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to protect its people from outside enemies, it is surrounded by a deep moat, and its interior is fortified by double walls.</p>
<p>The only entrance and exit, a suspension bridge, is now closed, and the city is fully guarded.</p>
<p>Overlooking the city from the hillside inside the wall is the royal palace called &#8220;Purple Silver Palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Decorated with snow, the purple and silver castle became chalk white and looked down on the city.</p>
<p>Many nobles were gathered in the throne room. However, none of them chatted with each other.</p>
<p>The queen&#8217;s authority was so powerful that it was hard to resist her majesty.</p>
<p>The nobles focused their slightly tense gazes on the glittering throne. Seated on the throne is the newly crowned Queen Claudia.</p>
<p>She has a gentle face, but lurking behind it is the face of a cunning schemer.</p>
<p>When she first took the throne after many twists and turns, many of the Levering nobles underestimated her.</p>
<p>However, they would soon be shown a sore spot.</p>
<p>Countless nobles had been stripped of their titles and had their houses demolished. Most of these were self-inflicted due to collusion with merchants, embezzlement, and heavy taxation to oppress the people.</p>
<p>The people were happy, but the nobles shuddered.</p>
<p>Fear breeds rebellion. For a time, many people, especially the great nobles, criticized Claudia, but she challenged the great nobles to fight without fear and used intrigue to win and establish a solid system. In about three months, she found herself reigning unchallenged as queen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When the laughter that exuded a bewitching atmosphere echoed in the throne room, the nobles shook their shoulders and looked at her in unison. When Claudia laughs, everyone&#8217;s heart buzzes. She is the queen who can sentence people to death by laughing. The condemned nobles call it the &#8220;smile of death,&#8221; and they are hanged on the gallows.</p>
<p>&#8220;U-um&#8230; Queen Claudia, what was written on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A nobleman summoned his courage and asked the question. Her gaze was fixed on the letter in her hand. It&#8217;s a letter of friendship from the fourth prince of the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu&#8230; I&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s finally arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia put her hand over her mouth and laughed heartily in an amusing manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time has finally come for the Levering Kingdom to join the ranks of the powers. How can I not laugh and be excited about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the nobles raised their eyebrows, wondering at Claudia&#8217;s reaction. But Claudia was unconcerned and continued to laugh.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Majesty Queen Claudia!&#8221;</p>
<p>A soldier enters the throne room with an air of dignity. It was a soldier with a face that the nobles would recognize. He is the captain of the queen&#8217;s guard, which was established when Claudia ascended to the throne, and he is a military veteran who Claudia went there herself to appoint.</p>
<p>He walked up to the throne, dropped to one knee, and bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The army&#8217;s preparations are complete. We are ready to sortie at any time. And I just received a message from the other party saying that we can run to our destination without being disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your hard work. As expected of His Highness Hiro, he does everything with finesse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobles raised their eyebrows in disbelief at the conversation between the two, but some of them looked pleased. Claudia stood up after watching their reactions with amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time of silence is over. It is time for the demon race to once again stand on the central continent!&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia declares, leaving the throne and descending the stairs with graceful movements.</p>
<p>The way she walked on the red carpet was majestic and fascinated people.</p>
<p>Several nobles, who were beaming with joy, followed her. The nobles, who had not grasped the situation, bowed their heads in question as they watched the queen depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get started. From here on, we are in the dark. Only those who believe in me will be able to follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia drew her sword, which her ancestor, Rox, had left behind, and left the throne room majestically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>＊＊＊＊＊</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>January 7th, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>Hiro was in the imperial palace&#8217;s noble guest room. Seated opposite him was the second prince Selene.</p>
<p>There was no one else in the room. However, the atmosphere that both of them emitted was heavy, and the guest room was dominated by a strange sense of oppression as if a large number of people were crowded together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought that you would threaten me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The second prince Selene, looking at the map, spoke up first.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to ask if you will cooperate or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro gave a cold look to the second prince Selene.</p>
<p>The second prince raised his hands and smiled as if to show his surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, of course, cooperate with you, my lovely little brother. Our interests are aligned, you know. Above all, if I don&#8217;t help you here, your scary friends will go on a rampage in the north, won&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t. As long as you cooperate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to threaten me to get my unconditional cooperation, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that. First of all, I want to thank you for your wise decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro spoke plainly and then looked at the second prince Selene. To be precise, he was interested in the swords on his hips.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the reason why you don&#8217;t want to become emperor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have a right to answer that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I was just confirming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled coldly and stood up from his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to break your promise. I&#8217;d like to eliminate as many sources of anxiety as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approaching the second prince Selene, Hiro looked down at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that. That cruel look&#8230; is very intriguing. But I wish you would smile like you do when you treat Liz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re on my side, then I&#8217;ll welcome you into Liz&#8217;s camp with a smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s harsh. But don&#8217;t worry. I have no intention of antagonizing you just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro mended his ruthless smile and turned his feet to the door, carrying his luggage under his arm from the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz will be leaving soon, so I&#8217;ll be leaving now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment his fingertips touched the handle&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are truly a sad man, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was stopped in his tracks by the words of the second prince Selene.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be careful, you know. The enemy is everywhere. If you look around, you&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;re under siege, and we have to make sure we don&#8217;t get caught in the middle. They&#8217;re really&#8230; nasty people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro immediately responded to the second prince Selene&#8217;s advice, turned the handle, and stepped into the hallway.</p>
<p>Today is the day that Liz and the others will be leaving. He must see them off in good spirits.</p>
<p>Considering the high possibility that they were already waiting for him at the entrance, Hiro walked quickly down the hallway, but he recognized the figure of Prime Minister Gils walking in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Highness Celia Estrella was waiting for you at the door, Your Highness Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, as I expected&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take my leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>After exchanging light bows, Prime Minister Gils walked past Hiro.</p>
<p>At that moment ― an unfathomable chill ran down his spine, and he turned around.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just his imagination. Hiro put his hand on the back of his neck. The only time he has ever experienced that feeling of electric current flowing through him was on the battlefield. Certainly now, Prime Minister Gils has unleashed a murderous intent.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are really&#8230; nasty people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro muttered to himself without hiding his displeasure and then started walking again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a straight corridor that leads around a corner ― a place where many high-ranking officials lost their lives in the rebellion.</p>
<p>Looking at the back of the corridor, he could see many people gathered there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting colder, so make sure you don&#8217;t get sick. Wear as many blankets as you can when camping.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he reached the entrance, he found Rosa muttering a motherly remark.</p>
<p>Liz looked slightly annoyed as if she had been told repeatedly.</p>
<p>However, this changed when she recognized Hiro, and she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Hiro! You finally came!&#8221;</p>
<p>She waves to him, bouncing on the floor.</p>
<p>Aura was behind her, her gaze looking down as she read her favorite book, The Black Book. As Hiro approached the girls, he said some parting words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful on the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the emphasis on marching speed, there were less than three hundred guards.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that any ruffians would attack Liz right now, but it is important to keep an eye out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have crossed Mount Himmel with as few men as I have today, remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz mentioned the first time she met Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; right. I was a real slow learner back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even so, Liz and the others did not abandon him and continued their journey with Hiro. He wondered if he had been able to repay even a small part of that debt. Hiro felt deeply moved and vaguely aware of how fast time had passed.</p>
<p>Seeing his expression, Liz withdrew her smile and turned serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be reckless, okay? I&#8217;ll be back as fast as I can; just don&#8217;t do anything reckless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll be waiting for your return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro nodded, trying not to let his inner thoughts be noticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be more careful with the head of the Muzuk family. He&#8217;s a very sharp man. You never know what he&#8217;s up to. If you have to make an important decision, I&#8217;ll leave it to your judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll be fine. Like I said before, you can trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz smiled in annoyance. Hiro was worried about her, so it couldn&#8217;t be helped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it will be the last time. The only thing I want you to remember is to follow your heart, not the hearts of others. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro reminded her. The air was not conducive to joking.</p>
<p>Liz nodded nervously as if she sensed this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. I&#8217;m not going to give up my feelings on anyone. I&#8217;ll do what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro made a cheerful expression at Liz&#8217;s honest nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in you. Go and do your best.&#8221;</p>
<p>He patted Liz on the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spend all your time reading, Hiro. If you&#8217;re skinny when I get back, I&#8217;ll make you eat a lot of meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not healthy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Hiro could finish, Liz was hugging him.</p>
<p>The soft smell of her hug passed through his nostrils, and he could feel her gentle thoughts.</p>
<p>The warmth is calming and soothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really should stop being so reckless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice sounded as if it was about to fade away, and although he wanted to comfort her, he couldn&#8217;t think of any words to say.</p>
<p>In the first place, it would only make her look foolish if he were to say anything to her, having made her look like this.</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of regret, Hiro pulled away from Liz and wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time we meet, let&#8217;s meet again with a smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pulling his gaze away from Liz&#8217;s slight nod, Hiro looked at Aura behind her.</p>
<p>She also looked slightly unhappy about leaving Hiro alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to support Liz. I&#8217;m counting on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Leave it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled at Aura as she hugged the Black Book tightly, and then he approached the person he saw out of the corner of his eye. He saw the figure of Skaaha on the couch set up at the entrance.</p>
<p>Skaaha was sitting there, looking pale, as if she was still not feeling well.</p>
<p>She noticed the presence of Hiro approaching and turned her gaze to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t be of more help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skaaha lowered her head, saying so at the beginning of her speech. She seemed to be ashamed of her helplessness, biting her lower lip in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to feel responsible. I just want you to heal and get back on your feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate your concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The vibrations from the carriage may affect your wound, but I would appreciate it if you could bear with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ice Emperor&#8217;s blessing will take care of that. If anything, I have dragged you down, and I believe I deserve at least that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skaaha replied with a shrug. She tends to self-deprecate. For better or worse, she is hard on herself. Her main goal is to avenge her relatives. That&#8217;s why she has always kept herself strictly disciplined on the battlefield, not taking advantage of others. If she continues to fight like that, she will break down one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I know it. Someday you&#8217;ll find it — the purpose of your life.</p>
<p>Hiro wanted her to walk towards the goal she had found for herself, not the one that was forced upon her. He patted her on the shoulder and told her something meaningful, then turned to his subordinates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghada, I wish you a safe journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll pray for your safety too, One-Eyed Dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; I wish I could be with my wise brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. She&#8217;s been nagging me about staying since yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugin is teary-eyed, and her brother Munin is puzzled and scratching the back of his head.</p>
<p>Hiro let out a chuckle and patted Hugin on the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good to each other. And don&#8217;t fight too much and cause trouble for Ghada.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Hiro untied the luggage he was carrying under his arm. When the cloth was opened, it revealed two spirit weapons. They were a pair, and they were rare among spirit weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, take these for the two of you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was about to hand them to Hugin and Munin, but they opened their mouths in a panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t accept these! Spirit weapons are too much for us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugin shook her head, but her cheeks were loose, and her hands clenched the handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Oh, if I sell it, I can live happily for the rest of my life&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stupid brother! If you do that, I&#8217;ll chop your head off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230; It has a name, which is unusual. For Hugin, it&#8217;s &#8220;Kogarasumaru,&#8221; and for Munin, it&#8217;s &#8220;Nukemaru.&#8221; The shape is a bit unusual, but I think you can handle it well.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[T/n: You can probably find out about these two swords here -&gt; <a href="https://japaneseswordlegends.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/the-kogarasu-maru/"><b>Click</b></a>.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These two weapons were made by Hiro&#8217;s acquaintance, a &#8220;dwarf man,&#8221; a thousand years ago when he was calling himself Schwartz. They are in the form of Japanese swords, which Hiro once used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine is the Kogarasumaru. It&#8217;s the first weapon my wise brother has given me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugin looked as if she was about to dance with joy. She looked like a child who had just been given her first toy. On the other hand, his brother Munin also looks at the blade and lets out a sigh of admiration.</p>
<p>Hiro then looked away from the impressed siblings and saw Ghada giving him a strange look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have any questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give a demon race a spirit weapon, won&#8217;t they get burned?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro whispered, and Ghada sighed regretfully, saying that it was difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll have to make do with this for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ghada showed Hiro the large sword on his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you will be able to use any weapon you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are only a handful of people who can defeat a pure demon race. He would be able to compete with any strong man with an ordinary weapon. He&#8217;ll need his own special weapon at some point, but there&#8217;s no time for that now, so he&#8217;ll have to give up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Hiro, we&#8217;d better get going.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he turned around, Liz was standing behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and buy me something when I get back, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed at Hiro and ran out of the entrance with a fresh smile on her face. She seemed to be envious of Hugin and Munin. The next to follow was a petite girl named Aura.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I want you to buy me one too. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aura followed Liz with an expressionless face that did not allow for rebuttal.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fumu, I wonder what you want to buy me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a bloodless complexion, Skaaha also left with a few words.</p>
<p>Before Hiro could say anything, Ghada and the others also went out, and the entrance became quiet at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re going to be spending a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>A hand on his shoulder caused Hiro to shift his gaze to the person next to him. Rosa was standing there with a nasty look on her face.</p>
<p>He decided to take the initiative before she could say anything and pulled out two letters from his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;This one is for Liz, and the other one is for Ghada. I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could give them to me when they get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, but&#8230; are you going to start planning under these circumstances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s situations like this that I can&#8217;t help but take advantage of. I had to make some major adjustments, but it should work out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa didn&#8217;t say anything. She shook her shoulders slightly and looked anxiously down at the ground.</p>
<p>When the silence fell between them――,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Don&#8217;t die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa said as she couldn&#8217;t stand the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I know&#8230; Like I told Liz, I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled cheerfully and took out a spirit weapon from the Black Princess Camellia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Lion King.&#8221; You see the lion&#8217;s emblem on the hilt?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the spirit weapon that the first emperor Altius used until he acquired the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords.</p>
<p>Rosa&#8217;s eyes widened and her mouth half-opened as she had noticed the preciousness of the item.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to protect yourself from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought it was too much for self-defense, but her cheeks twitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I can&#8217;t accept that. There are several spirit weapons in the Kelheit family. I&#8217;m going to use that one. So why don&#8217;t you just keep this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can keep it; I don&#8217;t care if it has a name, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past and present, naming things, not just weapons, sometimes works miracles, as if they have a will of their own. People generally say that it is because the soul dwells in it, and it is no different with spirit weapons. In other words, a weapon grows with its user. Hiro thought that there was a difference between having a name and having nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to become a user worthy of the Lion King. If you do, he will surely respond to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro held out the sword to Rosa once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you prepared for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa looked at the Lion King and Hiro alternately, as if she was in doubt.</p>
<p>However, as Hiro seemed to have lost his patience, Rosa slumped her shoulders in resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you think I am? I am the acting head of the Kelheit family, one of the five great noble families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa snickered, took the sword, and hugged it as if it were dear to her heart. Then the tip of the blade was completely buried in the cleavage of her chest, which could be considered a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Hiro, who looked away involuntarily, scratched the tip of his nose as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I have some preparations to make, so I&#8217;ll be leaving now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro turned his back on Rosa to hide his embarrassment and started walking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, hey, what&#8217;s the matter with you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa threw a surprised voice at him, but Hiro didn&#8217;t have the courage to look directly at that scene again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really need to hurry! I&#8217;ll see you later!&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes down the corridor almost at a run. It wasn&#8217;t like he was lying.</p>
<p>There really is something he needs to do.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s from here. Once Liz and Ghada are outside the Great Imperial Capital, all that&#8217;s left is him.)</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s steps naturally became more leisurely, and the atmosphere he wore began to change.</p>
<p>(&#8230;There is no guarantee that we will meet again, but it is a strange creature that makes people smile and say goodbye. Because a while ago, we were laughing and talking――)</p>
<p>Hiro stopped and looked back. The empty corridor is quiet; not even a single sound can be heard.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Oh, that&#8217;s right. It was like this that day, too.)</p>
<p>The black eyes that do not allow light to pass through reflect nothing. It&#8217;s just an abyss that forbids everything.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s calm nature gives way to a sharp, deadly presence, and he starts walking again.</p>
<p>His destination was the noble guest room, a room that welcomed guests from all over the world.</p>
<p>In front of the door stood the head of the Mark family, with a thin face that could be considered somewhat frivolous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Hiro, the preparations are in order. I would like to ask for your decision on what to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your efforts. Then let&#8217;s have a strategy meeting right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. The central nobles who agreed to the plan are waiting in the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the Mark family opened the door of the guest room and bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So let&#8217;s get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>After confirming the departure of Liz and the others, Hiro headed to the west to defeat the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>He was not going just to stop them. He will have to deal with 150,000 enemies with only 20,000 troops.</p>
<p>(Liz, I&#8217;m breaking my promise to you.)</p>
<p>Hiro prayed for Liz&#8217;s safety and stepped out strongly to carry out his purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― Beirut territory in the northwest of the Western Region.</p>
<p>The main camp of the Six Kingdoms was built on the border between the west and Felzen.</p>
<p>The ground was filled with tents.</p>
<p>It was a place where as many as 50,000 soldiers would stay and sleep. The camp was formed like a kind of city.</p>
<p>As the sky was about to turn scarlet, the soldiers were hurrying around as if they were preparing for something.</p>
<p>At the center of it all is the command center, the heart of the Grantz conquering army.</p>
<p>Inside, people are crowded together. Even though it&#8217;s winter, the heat emanating from the people is enough to make a heater unnecessary.</p>
<p>This is where the generals in charge of the divisions and the commanders of the regiments are gathered.</p>
<p>A thin woman sitting at the honorary seat quietly raises her hand.</p>
<p>She is Luca Mamon de Urpeth, the acting commander of the Grantz conquering army.</p>
<p>She is a woman full of talent from the Urpeth royal family, one of the six kingdoms, and she is also the person who was expected to be the next king. At her instruction, the man standing by her side stepped forward.</p>
<p>This man is Eagle de Urpeth, the younger brother of Acting Commander Luca.</p>
<p>He is a tall and attractive young man with a beautiful face, just like his sister, but he has a wild and dangerous atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come here. Let&#8217;s start the regular report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle tapped the desk with his command stick and began to knock over the pieces on the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;General McRill, give me a status report on how the armies are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, excuse me for being presumptuous, but let me explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old general stood up and began to arrange the disarrayed pieces on the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first and second conquering forces are currently invading the western nobility, advising them to surrender. You can see the effect of this by looking at these bundles of letters of intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>General McRill ordered his subordinates to place the bundles of letters he had received from the western nobles on his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the third and fourth conquering forces are attacking the surrounding forts. They are also doing well, probably because the main force has left for Felzen, and the defensive strength of the Grantz side is greatly reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>After taking a breath, General McRill put down his last piece.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fifth conquering army has attacked the strongholds of the nobles who did not accept the surrender and is on a rampage, mainly looting foodstuffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>When General McRill looked at the people gathered here, everyone nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Both Luca, who was sitting on the honorary seat, and her second-in-command, Eagle, had smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the damage status?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fifth conquering army is by far the biggest. The statistics show that the number has decreased by about 7,000&#8230; The Felzen front army ― once Lucia-sama returns, there will be no problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the 50,000 of the Felzen army were to join forces, an unprecedentedly large army of 200,000 would be completed.</p>
<p>If the damage is around 7,000, there will be no problem. It&#8217;s the kind of damage that won&#8217;t earn a reprimand from their home country.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about food?&#8221;</p>
<p>The food problem. To feed an army as large as 200,000, a half-hearted amount would not be enough. Even if they were to send food from their home country, it would cost an enormous amount of money. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s imperative to procure food locally, but now that the winter season has arrived, it&#8217;s not going as well as expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stockpile is probably about two months, and we&#8217;re having people loot it, mainly for food, but if we have to feed 200,000 soldiers, the western part of the Grantz Empire will be filled with people starving to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if they tried to buy from the locals, there was no way they would release their reserves to last the winter.</p>
<p>Then they would have to resort to looting, but if they went too far, it might affect their rule later on. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re currently looting only the strongholds of rebellious nobles and not taking anything from those who have surrendered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no problem. You should continue to act as planned. Lucia-sama is going to bring us some food, so let&#8217;s leave this issue for later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca was the one who spoke up. She tapped her fingers on the armrest and looked at the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not all. General McRill, how are the people in the west? Are they doing what we want them to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, I think it&#8217;s fine there.&#8221;</p>
<p>General McRill placed pebbles on the main road to the west that was drawn on the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main roads to the west seem to be filled with people evacuating from their villages and towns to the central.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roads are important. They are essential for smooth logistics, preparation for the invasion, economic development, and national stability.</p>
<p>If a country is invaded by another country, that particular country must immediately rush to the scene. However, if the roads are blocked, there will be a fatal delay. It would be faster for the invading country to destroy it, but they would be in trouble after their rule if they did so. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they can afford to carry huge rocks.</p>
<p>So, what would they use instead?</p>
<p>Those who help and those who run away use the road equally. The more people who flee, the more damage they can do to the country. In other words, reinforcements from the Central of the Grantz Empire would surely be delayed. Above all, it will also play a role in preventing the western nobles from escaping.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as we planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle chuckled. He gave Luca a sideways glance, and she nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all going well, just as our country ordered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the operation went so well must be due to the fact that we defeated one of the five generals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of them bowed their knees without a fight.</p>
<p>At first, the western nobles were bullish, but once they were exposed to the corpse of one of the five generals, they began to surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Grantz Empire has fallen. Where has the lion that dominates the world gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Luca muttered regretfully, her younger brother Eagle raised his voice in a joyful tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see that the old lion is no longer scary. The less resistance, the less damage we suffer. First, let&#8217;s tear the west to shreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, but I&#8217;m afraid of what might happen if we get too violent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>I don&#8217;t know what you mean</i>, Eagle asked, and Luca sniffed unhappily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually, the west will belong to the Six Kingdoms, but the people will not easily follow if there is a disaster when we rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re using the whip and the candy. As General McRill said earlier, it seems to be going well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at the map, Eagle continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;We forgive those who obey us, and we punish those who turn against us. The point is, we are looting to make an example of them. What&#8217;s wrong with that? In fact, I think that if we burn down the villages and towns that we see and instill fear in them, they won&#8217;t rebel as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle pointed this out to Luca, but she immediately shook her head and denied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excessive aggression can cause hatred. It can be passed onto the next generation, and in time it can become a bug in the lion&#8217;s den and become a factor in the destruction of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>People are valuable only if they are kept alive. It is people who produce food, clothing, and shelter. Weapons, money, and even land cannot be obtained without people.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now is the time when we need fame and achievement more than infamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca emphasizes. Her tone was as if she was rebuking him for making such a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. That&#8217;s why we are following the instructions from our home country, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Crossing his arms behind his head, Eagle leaned back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we need achievements&#8230; what is our future plan? It seems that Lucia-sama is already on her way here, and with her numbers, the army that will conquer the Grantz will be as large as 200,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>General McRill is implying that joining Lucia will make it harder for them to earn achievements.</p>
<p>The main army is still on standby, divided into six armies, even though it leads 150,000 people.</p>
<p>In this situation, they cannot earn anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to keep waiting like this? Or should we head to the Central before them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we should attack the Central. It seems that there are no strong-willed men in the west. I think we should leave this place to the others and head for the Central alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Eagle, who wanted to fight against the strong, argued bloodily, Luca seemed to remain calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be in a hurry. First, we need to cut down the west and stop worrying about the future, and then join Lucia-sama to attack the central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sister&#8230; aren&#8217;t you a little too cowardly? You have obeyed the orders of the higher-ups in our country. I think you should be free to do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do something wrong, we&#8217;ll be finished. Do you realize that there is no end in sight for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I know. But the point is, even if it is arbitrary, the point is to win. We should beat the Grantz Empire completely so that they can&#8217;t complain about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, if we, who do not know the land, attack the central without a plan, we will not be able to gain the advantage of the land. Above all, it is winter now. You could even say that we are leaving the time of the heavens behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca dismissed her brother&#8217;s belligerence with a disgusted look and slammed his command stick down on the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing to do is to send out scouts to gather information about the Central. Read and understand the movements of the Grantz Empire, do things carefully, and accumulate achievements after reaching the original goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I understand. I&#8217;ll follow your lead, sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle is unhappy with this, but unable to disagree with Luca&#8217;s opinion; he fell silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to be patient. If we fail here, that <i>woman</i> will come out and take all the good things from us. That&#8217;s why we have to endure for now. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>After looking at his brother lovingly, Luca gently admonished him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle nodded obediently, losing his earlier bravado.</p>
