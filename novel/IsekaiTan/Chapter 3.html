<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Unquenchable Hatred</h3>

<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― the Imperial Palace Venetian&#8217;s guest room.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy&#8217;s invasion is much faster than I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s heavy words were spat out during the daily military discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it seems that two-thirds of the western part of the country has already fallen into the hands of the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils muttered in frustration as he held the map in front of him. The sleeve of his lost left arm was shaking slightly as if his body was trembling from anger.</p>
<p>But he wasn&#8217;t the only one. Everyone was revealing their disappointment. Some of them cursed the western nobles for their unworthiness.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils took a deep breath before placing the pieces on the map once again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The streets are blocked as many of the people have fled to the Central. It seems that the Six Kingdoms are deliberately driving them away. It&#8217;s also reported that the third prince Blutar has been captured, although this information has not been confirmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230; Blutar has been captured?&#8221;</p>
<p>The second prince Selene, who could not hide his surprise at this, lifted himself from his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blutar is cautious. I thought he had secured a perfect escape route&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa also covered her mouth with her hand in disbelief and dropped her gaze.</p>
<p>(<i>Aura&#8217;s absence is the only reason for this result&#8230; and I&#8217;m not surprised because he&#8217;s a worse fighter than expected</i>.)</p>
<p>But even if he is incompetent, he is the prince of the Grantz Empire. The value of his use is immeasurable. That was probably one of the reasons why the enemy invasion was accelerated. Above all, with the death of one of the five great generals, Bakish, the guardian of the west, the only hope for the west was the third prince Blutar. If he were captured, the chain of command in the west would have collapsed, and if he was to think about the future, he should have chosen the path of self-determination rather than live in shame in captivity. If he had done so, the vengeful nobles of the west would have been able to weaken the enemy&#8217;s momentum through their struggles.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s better to think that the Felzen region also fell into the hands of the Six Kingdoms.)</p>
<p>For the people living in Felzen, the Grantz Empire is nothing more than an invader.</p>
<p>If the Six Kingdoms had defeated the Grantz Army, claiming to be liberating them, their popularity would have been unstoppable. Probably, there must be defectors from the Felzen remnant army as well.</p>
<p>As a survivor of the Felzen royal family, Skaaha was like a hostage of the Grantz Empire. If they say that they will take her back, many people will follow the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>(<i>Are the clouds getting worse&#8230;?</i>)</p>
<p>There is an excellent chance that the past events will come to the surface, and things are taking a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>The blame for all of this will lie at the heart of the Grantz Empire, which has made many blunders.</p>
<p>Many of the people who should be held accountable died in the rebellion started by the first prince Stobel, although it could be said that they deserved it because their great power intoxicated them. If it were another country, Hiro would laugh it off, but the Grantz Empire is a country left behind by his friends, who are now deceased.</p>
<p>(<i>As long as I&#8217;m here, this country will definitely have to remain&#8230;</i>)</p>
<p>It is the last chain that is left by his friends.</p>
<p>Whether it is someone&#8217;s intention or not, he will not allow them to do as they please. No matter what it takes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing to do is to move forward. It is important to find a way to save the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&#8217;s statement brought Hiro back to reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to belittle the life of the third prince Blutar, of course, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s in any danger from his position. Whether it&#8217;s a ransom or a demand for territory, we&#8217;ll have to wait until the Six Kingdoms make their move.&#8221;</p>
<p>After confirming that there were no objections, Prime Minister Gils coughed loudly and straightened his collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I would like to hear about the progress of each of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll report back then. Can I have the permission to speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who raised his hand was Rosa. Prime Minister Gils responded with a nod.</p>
<p>As soon as she stood up with the report in her hand, the eyes of the nobles focused on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ordered my subordinates to gather forces in the east, but&#8230; it is going to take about a month for them to come to the central. But I have strict orders to send out the troops that are ready at any time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa shrugged her shoulders and growled dourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The power of war is only effective when it is assembled. If you send them out one by one, not only will they not be much of a fighting force, but if you send them to the battlefield, they will be wiped out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped. It would be better to wait until we are fully prepared. Don&#8217;t push yourself too hard and get as many people as you can before you leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After expressing his gratitude to Prime Minister Gils, Rosa whispered to one of his aides.</p>
<p>After two or three words, the aide bailed out and quietly left the guest room.</p>
<p>After Rosa finished, Prime Minister Gils turned to the second prince, Selene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, what is happening in the north?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you all know, there is a Spirit Wall in the north. The Marked People have been quiet lately, but we must stay alert. They probably know that the Grantz Empire is in turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>About five hundred years ago, a strange race of people was discovered in the northern part of the Grantz Empire. They scavenged for dead flesh, and the people named them &#8220;Flesh-eaters&#8221; and hated them, so they began to kill them. However, they were defeated because they possessed physical abilities beyond those of ordinary humans.</p>
<p>A sub-race called the &#8220;Marked People&#8221; was born from the subjugation team. They possessed intelligence and physical abilities that far surpassed those of the &#8220;Flesh-eaters.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the &#8220;Marked People&#8221; began to overtake the Flesh-eater, they began to invade the north. However, the emperor&#8217;s power of the time, a man who later became one of the Grantz Twelve Great Gods, and the combined power of the spirits pushed them to the western edge of the north. ――The north succeeded in driving them into an &#8220;uncharted territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, they could not be completely destroyed, and the emperor of the time built a &#8220;Spirit Wall&#8221; to contain them in the &#8220;uncharted territory.&#8221; Five hundred years have passed since then, but they are still watching vigilantly on the other side of the wall, looking to expand into the northern regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the advance troops, the Flesh-eaters, near the wall. They are probably hoping that our defenses will be thin. We can&#8217;t afford to move a large army for that reason. We have 26,000 &#8211; 30,000 in total since we brought 4,000 to the Great Imperial Capital. Although they don&#8217;t have much experience in actual warfare, they are well trained. I think I have assembled an elite force. I do hope you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, everyone is aware of the situation in the north. The instability of the situation. But when will the remaining 26,000 arrive at the Great Imperial Capital?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take about a month for them to reach the capital, just like Rosa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; So, what about the Mark family next?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils couldn&#8217;t hide his disappointment and popped the question to the Mark family.</p>
<p>The man who would be joining the five great noble families stood up proudly.</p>
<p>Orléans Longwill von Mark.</p>
<p>They were originally merchants, but after their grandfather invested a huge amount of money in the previous emperor and put him on the throne, he became a baron of the Grantz Empire. Therefore, the history of the Mark family is relatively short, and it is not a venerable and famous family.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they have achieved a great deal over the past three generations and have risen to become one of the five great noble families.</p>
<p>By using the negotiation skills he inherited from his grandfather and the imperial knowledge he received from his father, Orléans was able to become the head of the family at a young age.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about his skill, and his ability is well known.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the lingering effects of the rebellion, we can&#8217;t gather as much as we hoped, but many nobles have offered to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not surprising. Since the Six Kingdoms have already penetrated deep into the west, the nobles who have territories in the vicinity have no choice but to cooperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, the number that can be moved is around 20,000. If all of them were to join forces, it would be more than 40,000, but we decided that it would be better to use them to defend the central and maintain public order until reinforcements arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans said and then picked up a report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The security situation is worsening because people from the west are fleeing to the Central. Bandits have started to attack the people in the west, and I think that is one of the reasons. Above all, the report says that the winter has brought a shortage of food and that monsters are targeting the people in the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is one of the measures that the Six Kingdoms have come up with, it is safe to assume that they have quite a few military strategists.</p>
<p>They are definitely trying to contain their movements and cut down the west.</p>
<p>(<i>The assassination of the head of the Krone family, one of the five great noble families, followed by the rebellion of Stobel, the death of the emperor, the invasion of the west, the march to Felzen, the damage to the refugees&#8230; And we lost two of our five great generals. I can&#8217;t deny the decline in war potential.</i>)</p>
<p>There is a high possibility that they are still trying to do something else. Although it needs a way to contain them, the Grantz Empire continues to be on the back foot before it has a chance to gain a foothold. Everyone is aware of this fact. The heavy air swirling in the guest room was a clear indication of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can only hope that Her Highness Celia Estrella will return from the south as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the Grantz Empire needs now is time. They need to buy time in order to build up the strength to defeat the Six Kingdoms. But if they leave it to luck, it will never come true.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t keep hoping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stood up and spoke his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said before, it&#8217;s imperative that we buy some time now. For now, we should head west with only those who can move quickly ― 20,000 troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of that idea, but it is too dangerous. If the third prince Blutar is captured and the fourth prince Hiro is also captured, it will not make a good impression on the surrounding countries&#8230; There will be people who will ridicule the fact that the era of the Grantz Empire is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the nobles said sorrowfully.</p>
<p>However, now is not the time to be concerned about face-to-face meetings. If anything, his statement seemed too pessimistic. Hiro thought about reprimanding the weak noble to get the moment going, but he changed his mind, thinking that it would lead to unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand your concern. But if we keep our hands to ourselves, the west will surely be cut off. If the Six Kingdoms get a foothold in the Central, it will be extremely difficult to retake the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. However, I think that it is not right for Your Highness Hiro to be sacrificed just to buy more time. More importantly, isn&#8217;t it easier to retake the west if we gather the power of the Grantz Empire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. As long as the current situation can be maintained, it will certainly be easy to retake it. However, the political situation is changing every moment. The more time that passes, the more likely it is that someone will have second thoughts. This was also the case during the last rebellion. It&#8217;s also meant to be a check by making a clear move here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are certainly many people who harbor double-mindedness, but such people can be found in any country. But, you see, the Grantz Empire is not so weak or naive as to be defeated by the intentions of such people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great lion nation that dominates the world has survived for a thousand years.</p>
<p>There have been several times when the country has been in turmoil to the point of collapse. In the long history of the country, there have been more than one or two rebellions. There were times when the country was split in two by ugly battles between the heirs to the throne.</p>
<p>Repression, massacres, dictatorships, invasions, assassinations, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>However, in every era, the power of the &#8220;king&#8221; still remained.</p>
<p>(<i>Good grief&#8230; I can&#8217;t feel the Spirit King&#8217;s power anymore.</i>)</p>
<p>The spirits still remain in the world and watch over people. But, Hiro couldn&#8217;t feel the presence of the Spirit King, the creator of the spirit, since he came to this world.</p>
<p>It would be fine if Hiro&#8217;s senses were merely dull and unaware, but if he put his faith in wishful thinking, the nation would collapse.</p>
<p>If anything, the Spirit King&#8217;s departure from the world would explain the various problems that have erupted and the repeated wars that have occurred. If the existence of the Spirit King is really gone from the world, it means that from now on, people must walk the path of their own thinking and open up the era only with their own power.</p>
<p>(<i>That&#8217;s why I need insurance. An insurance policy that will ensure the survival of the Grantz Empire.</i>)</p>
<p>The preparations have been made. All that remains is to put it into action. No one can stand in their way.</p>
<p>Hiro exhaled a sigh and smiled fearlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weakness and laxity have nothing to do with it. Repeated wars have put pressure on the finances of the Grantz Empire. We have to renew our armor, pay our soldiers, build and repair our forts, and so on. This time, with the gathering of troops from other regions, the treasury will be further depleted.&#8221;</p>
<p>War requires a huge amount of resources. There have been many countries that have perished due to lack of funds because they started wars without a plan.</p>
<p>Wars are waged for political purposes, whether they are beneficial to the country or not.</p>
<p>It is up to the parties involved to decide where the threat is directed, within or without&#8230;</p>
<p>(<i>For the Six Kingdoms, this war is worth fighting.</i>)</p>
<p>If they know they will lose ― they won&#8217;t start a war.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what you mean. Do you want us to give the Six Kingdoms the West? It&#8217;s a contradiction in terms of what you just said earlier, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;? Give them territory without fighting back and protect your existing wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please listen to me until the end&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro didn&#8217;t even attempt to hide his anger at being interrupted and glared at the nobleman who had spoken without permission.</p>
<p>Looking at the silent nobleman, Hiro revealed the uneasiness that was coiled in his chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again&#8230; Due to the repeated wars, the prices of goods have skyrocketed, the economy has stagnated, life has become impoverished, and the people are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the unstable situation. In such a situation, the people&#8217;s anger would reach its peak if we let the outrage of the Six Kingdoms go unchecked. In other words, to leave the west behind is to commit a foolish act and is equivalent to abandoning the support of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be unacceptable to stand idly by and not help the west until the forces are ready. The people will think that their country has abandoned them. There is a high possibility that the western nobles will turn on them.</p>
<p>The effect of this will be felt throughout the entire Grantz.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now is the time to go to the west and fight the Six Kingdoms, even if it is only 20,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Grantz Empire, which had been forced to fight, would have to weigh the sacrifices it would have to make against the benefits it would receive. Whether to conclude a peace treaty or launch a thorough counterattack, it is necessary to assess the value.</p>
<p>(<i>We should launch a counterattack. Even if we are few in number&#8230; we should fight to protect the dignity of territory, people, and authority ― these three.</i>)</p>
<p>Among them, the biggest concern is that there will be riots. It&#8217;s easy to suppress them with force, but it&#8217;s not an act to ease the discontent; it&#8217;s an act to add fuel to the fire. It may be a temporary solution, but it is not a solution. What lies ahead of the crackdown is the collapse of the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand what you&#8217;re saying, but&#8230; what can you do with only 20,000?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a plan. If you leave it to me, I&#8217;m sure I can live up to your expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said with confidence and without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A plan that would allow a mere 20,000 to take on an army of 150,000? Is that what Your Highness Hiro says?&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobleman&#8217;s eyes shone with some expectation. It&#8217;s not just one or two people. Most of the people gathered in this room have that glow in their eyes. Hiro smiled inwardly at being able to draw interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only will it buy us time, but it will also reduce their strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone responded with surprise at these words. Once he had the atmosphere of the place under control, all he had to do was to make things go his way. Hiro cross-referenced the report and placed the pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Six Kingdoms are dispersing their forces and attacking to the west. It would be very troublesome if they were all together, but now that they are dispersed, we can bring them into equal numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the danger is too great, they will retreat gracefully, but they will strike fiercely if they think they can win.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to win a war, it is important to understand the situation of the battlefield and its characteristics, as well as the skill of the commander. If you can detect the foreseeable dangers in advance, winning is not that difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>When dealing with a large army, you have to devise a plan, but when dealing with dispersed individual forces, the difference in the commander&#8217;s intuition and experience will determine the winner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can turn back one or two of the enemy&#8217;s armies, I think we will have a chance to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could get to the bottom of the matter with an exaggerated hand gesture, he spoke next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you to cooperate. This is a time when we need everyone&#8217;s cooperation, across factions.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something he&#8217;s wished for many times. In order to deal with this extraordinary situation, everyone needs to be on the same page in order to defeat the Six Kingdoms. If the nobles, which are not concerned with the situation because it is happening in a remote place, do not wake up, there is no future for the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>Of course, if they are told that, there is no one who can say no to a matter of national importance.</p>
<p>However, there were a few people who looked at Hiro suspiciously.</p>
<p>Among them, the one who looked at him strangely was Prime Minister Gils, but the one who was even more curious was Orléans, the head of the Mark family. Hiro sensed a hint of strangeness from him, but after giving him a quick glance, he didn&#8217;t pay any attention to it and began to explain without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is, we just need to buy some time. If we can keep them in the west for a long time, we will win. After that, we will join forces with reinforcements from various regions, challenge them to a decisive battle, and use that momentum to push them back to Felzen.&#8221;</p>
<p>After regaining the west, they pushed forward to establish their control again. Once they had defeated the Six Kingdoms, which had attacked with a large army, the surrounding countries, which had been very noisy, would have no choice but to remain silent.</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the faces of the surrounding nobles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing I want you to do is to agree to attack the Six Kingdoms with the minimum number of troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Please raise your hands.&#8221; One by one, the nobles raised their arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fumu&#8230; I see no one is opposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said in an emotionless voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is truly wonderful. Your Highness Hiro&#8217;s dedication will be remembered for generations to come. We of the Mark family and the central nobility will give you our wholehearted support.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Orléans who poured out his praise. He was nodding his head with applause.</p>
<p>A strange feeling of discomfort swirled in Hiro&#8217;s mind at the sight of him, but he didn&#8217;t feel the need to devote his precious time to a formless object, and he immediately pushed it to the corner of his mind.</p>
<p><i>(If he&#8217;s up to something, I can just crush him as soon as he tries it.</i>)</p>
<p>For the time being, they were able to proceed according to Hiro&#8217;s intentions. He should be happy about that for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8230; let&#8217;s start the strategy meeting to defeat the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled and began to place the pieces on the map.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>A large number of soldiers had begun moving near the eastern border of the Felzen region. They numbered fifty thousand ― a huge army that could shake the ground.</p>
<p>Their armor glittered in the sunlight, and the tips of their spears shone brightly as if to show their prowess. The unhurried march of men and horses was powerful enough to make anyone who saw it marvel.</p>
<p>The flag bearers were running through the gaps between the soldiers, raising a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>The flag displayed a snake emblem flag painted on a red and black background.</p>
<p>It is the flag of Anguis, one of the countries of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>It was a royal family that once produced many unified kings, and the current queen was expected to be the next unified king. However, one incident brought her glory days to an end, and now she walks in the shadows as the one farthest from the throne.</p>
<p>She was currently sitting in a carriage running near the center of the march, her body shaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucia-sama, we expect to meet up with the Urpeth siblings in about four days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fumu, I see&#8230; It&#8217;s been awfully long getting there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia nodded absent-mindedly in response to her aide, Seleucus.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a big box in her hands. She hugged it carefully as if it were a fragile object. Seleucus, who was alert to the strange object, tilted his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a souvenir. I got some rare ingredients in Felzen. The Urpeth siblings will be pleased to receive it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are unusually thoughtful, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Seleucus said something to the queen, Lucia&#8217;s smile deepened, but she did not blame him.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Felzen, I did not meet a general worthy to enhance my reputation, but in the west, will I meet a skilled one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia&#8217;s eyes sparkled with anticipation as she licked her lips, but Seleucus did not even raise his brow at the lascivious gesture. Lucia frowned as if her dignity as a woman had been hurt by this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fumu&#8230; Am I really incapable that my sex appeal doesn&#8217;t work?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a rumor in the royal capital of Anguis. It seems that the noblewomen have all tried to seduce him at the banquet, but no one could get him to come to their room. A runaway noblewoman once broke into his room, but not only did he turn her away but later delivered a complaint to her parents, which made the woman a laughingstock and meet a dead end. Nowadays, it is said that he is a homosexual, and only strange rumors stick around Seleucus. It is because of this that he is able to serve as Lucia&#8217;s aide&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying something ridiculous. If I were to make a move on the belated Your Majesty Queen Lucia, I would be sucked dry to the bone, wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from a family of snakes, after all&#8230; Well, joking aside, I guess I&#8217;m just not a very attractive woman. It&#8217;s just that no one is coming on to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had a few proposals, but they all fell through, didn&#8217;t they? Didn&#8217;t you destroy one of those houses some time ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was because he touched me lightly on the shoulder. I am not a cheap woman, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia puffed up her cheeks like a child, her mouth pouting.</p>
<p>Seleucus sighed sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. It is the reason why no one comes up to you. They can&#8217;t afford to have their house destroyed just because of one little touch. I think the only way out of this is to get a groom from another royal family, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m done talking about this. Why should I be blamed by you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia threw her gaze out the window, not amused.</p>
<p>Seleucus scratched his cheek in exasperation and smiled again, just as he always does.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, when you said earlier that you wanted a general who would enhance your reputation&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, are there any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one&#8230; It seems that one of the five great generals has already been defeated, but the other famous one in the west is Aura, the &#8216;War Maiden&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;ve heard that name before as well. She&#8217;s said to be quite a knowledgeable general.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a twinkle in her eye, Lucia threw an expectant glance at Seleucus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she was banished from the west and is now working in the central, so it is unlikely that we will be able to meet her soon ― so, unfortunately, there is no one who can satisfy you, Your Majesty Queen Lucia.&#8221;</p>
<p>After raising her expectations, he drops her into despair. It is rude to treat the queen like that, but he can be forgiven. If he had been incompetent enough, Lucia would have immediately cut off Seleucus&#8217; head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are really&#8230; fearless, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate, but there is no more capable assistant in Anguis than him. So she doesn&#8217;t care if he speaks casually.</p>
<p>It was annoying, but Lucia had no complaints as long as he was competent.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s boring. Can&#8217;t I just fight with a strong one yet? Shouldn&#8217;t I just attack the Central at once instead of dealing with the west?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia, who expressed her disappointment without exuding anger, can also be said to have a wide range of abilities. No matter how capable they are, there are kings all over the world who would cut down a disrespectful vassal. There is no doubt that there is a bond of master and vassal between the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike Your Majesty Queen Lucia, I don&#8217;t like to meet strong people&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia giggled mockingly, but Seleucus did not deny it and nodded frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that the Grantz Empire will strike back any time soon. There are no forces in the surrounding countries that can respond to us. If they push us back, the surrounding countries might turn on us, and that would be a chilling situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of national stability, there is nothing more unstable than the Six Kingdoms. It was a coalition of six nations, so stability was not something that could be expected.</p>
<p>Although they are technically longtime allies and mooring their hands together, they still have a sword clutched in one of their hands. They are in a situation where they could stab each other at any moment.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this from happening, there is a unified king, but in recent years, their power has been waning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need to worry; the Grantz Empire has expanded its territory too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the reason why the war power is dispersed, and even if they want to unify, there is the barrier of the five major noble factions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that easy to get together. And even if they did, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to work together, would they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>After cutting off her words, Seleucus loosened his collar and opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, the conquering army, are made up of the armies of four nations. We have different tactics and weapons for each country. Our skills are different, and so is our training. There is no way we can coordinate with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why the conquering forces have been given different roles in the invasion. Even if my lovely Anguis army were to join up with them, they would only be the first or second team, and they would not play an important role together.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they joined forces, it would be a large army of two hundred thousand. There is no way they can push back with half-hearted numbers.</p>
<p>Just as the waves that come in cannot be stopped, any nation can be blown away by the violence of numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the enemy is inept, that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if it is rotten, the opponent is the Grantz Empire. Because of their vast territory, they have an abundance of human resources.</p>
<p>The western part of Grantz was not blessed with human resources, but it had rich and fertile land. As a specialty of cotton and sesame, it dominates the market, and if it could be obtained, the nation&#8217;s finances would be further enriched. However, that is not Lucia&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>She would like to acquire it if she can, but the other countries will not stand by idly. She doesn&#8217;t want to start a political war.</p>
<p>If nothing else, that <i>woman</i> is sure to take all the goodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;My purpose is different. While the rest of the world is arguing over how to deal with the West, I will have to get rid of my humiliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, it will not be a simple matter from now on. The rumored descendant of the God of War has yet to emerge. Although it is unlikely that he will appear under these circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you still think that the Grantz Empire will abandon the West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is difficult to gather the numbers in a short period. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t intercept us with a small number. It&#8217;s not going to do them any good if they&#8217;re just going to show up looking like fools. I don&#8217;t think they would bring out the descendant of the hero king under such circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then after a short pause, Seleucus nodded as if he had remembered something.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot about the Grand Duchy of Dral. As I recall, the descendant of the God of War attacked in small numbers. I&#8217;ve read some fragments of it in the reports of our spy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have read it myself. It was impressive, I must say. No, it can be said that the defeat resulted from being carried away by the title&#8230; Well, before that, the Grand Duchy of Dral had no man with the backbone to take on the descendant of the God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a foolish country that chose to surrender without a fight, despite the overwhelming difference in strength.</p>
<p>Lucia smiled deeply as she unfolded her iron fan, wondering if it would be a good idea to attack and destroy the Grand Duchy of Dral once she obtained the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of dragging out the descendant of the God of War. If possible, I would like him to go to the West on his own. That way, the first prize in this war will go to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking at his war record so far, he seems to be quite a belligerent man, so let me revise my opinion that there is a high possibility that he will appear. Hopefully, he&#8217;s good enough to entertain Your Majesty Queen Lucia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed. If he doesn&#8217;t come out, it would be interesting to avalanche into the Central. It would be even better if we could destroy the Grantz Empire straight away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it works out that way. As for me, I&#8217;m afraid that we will be confronted with the fact that a lion is still a lion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will work out. That is why I am here, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>After closing her iron fan, Lucia declared with an attitude that could be described as arrogant.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>January 12th, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>It was winter, and the rising sun did nothing to ease the dry, cold air. Still, this was the only day when people were not confined to their homes but were out in the heat of the day.</p>
<p>The central streets of the Grantz Empire were filled with cheering people.</p>
<p>Under a sky of mixed white and blue, confetti made of paper was flying through the air. The air was shivering with incessant applause and resounding cheers.</p>
<p>The crowds occupied both sides of the road, and marching in the center were a group of strong men.</p>
<p>Hiro, a descendant of the &#8220;God of War, &#8221; was leading the way,&#8221; astride his swift dragon. He waved to the crowd with a cheerful smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory to the Great Grantz Empire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May the twelve great gods of Grantz bless you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The people spoke words of farewell to the fourth prince. They were combined with the graceful music played by the musicians to form a chorus. This heroic march inspired the hearts of everyone, including the soldiers.</p>
<p>The wind blows. It was a gentle breeze that seemed to bestow blessings on the soldiers who were going into battle. The flag that swept gracefully across the sky was the emblem of the black dragon ― the &#8220;divine flag&#8221; that only the God of War could raise.</p>
<p>Sighs of admiration flew out of the mouths of the people. The eyes of those who gazed at the elegantly fluttering flag were filled with pure respect.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as high class or low class there.</p>
<p>The twin-black hero-king who built the foundation of the Grantz Empire. </p>
<p>Soldiers of all ranks were saluting Hiro with the greatest of admiration.</p>
<p>The number of soldiers following Hiro was 20,000 ― made up of the private armies of the central nobility.</p>
<p>The soldiers mentioned earlier belonged to the eastern nobility and would not be accompanying Hiro on his mission.</p>
<p>The reason for this was that Hiro insisted on using only the central nobility in order to emphasize cooperation.</p>
<p>Hiro removed his gaze from the people and looked at the breastwork built above the main gate.</p>
<p>(&#8230;..I&#8217;ve asked you to do the rest.)</p>
<p>The person who had opposed Hiro&#8217;s argument until the very end was reflected in his eyes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Rosa.</p>
<p>She gave a small wave of her hand and a stiff smile. It&#8217;s an unusually melancholy attitude for someone who has always acted so stoutly.</p>
<p>Hiro narrowed his eyes and formed a caring smile, but she didn&#8217;t smile back.</p>
<p>He knows why. They even argued last night, which is a rare occurrence. At the end of the night, there was no way to convince her.</p>
<p>(When everything is over&#8230; I&#8217;ll be back.)</p>
<p>Hiro felt his hair stand on end, but for now, he tried to look ahead and failed. The reason is that he spotted a curious sight out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t help but shout.</p>
<p>He spotted a girl in the crowd with her hands held up, and her voice raised.</p>
<p>He remembers it well. It&#8217;s an event he couldn&#8217;t possibly forget.</p>
<p>The first time he made his triumphant return to the Great Imperial Capital, she had presented Hiro with a red flower.</p>
<p>Today, the flower is in her hand again. However, there was no sign of her approaching.</p>
<p>He thought selfishly that she might have been put off by the noisy crowd, but then he realized that the atmosphere she wore was different from that time. She was staring at Hiro sadly ― or perhaps resentfully.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s whole body felt like it was burning at the sight of such an outpouring of emotion that was not typical of a child. But before he could speak to her, the girl disappeared into the darkness that pervaded the alleyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Am I making the wrong decision?&#8221;</p>
<p>As if asking someone, Hiro looked up at the sky and muttered to himself. But there was no one to answer him. Even he himself could not find a clear answer.</p>
<p>As Hiro smiled to himself, the swift dragon passed through the main gate.</p>
<p>A loud cheer erupted from behind him.</p>
<p>With a quiet fighting spirit, Hiro pulled out the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; from his waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory to the Great Grantz Empire, and may it be blessed in our path.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brilliant radiance of the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; shone down upon the ground, and the flowers and grass danced with joy.</p>
<p>(Until we meet again&#8230; please be healthy.)</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the girl he had in his mind, Hiro looked forward.</p>
<p>There is no stopping him when he starts to move. His heart is boiling, and he pursues the battlefield. His hungry heart yearns for war, where his flesh and blood boil and dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an honor to be able to fight alongside the descendant of the God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the voice that came from next to him, he looked over to see Orléans, the head of the Mark family, wearing silver armor, riding a horse. The way he clutched the reins without bending his back was quite a sight to behold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do my best to assist you so that you won&#8217;t be slowed down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to get too worked up. It&#8217;s just a way to stall for time, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro gave Orléans a cold stare as if he were looking at a scandalous person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Hiro must have a plan, don&#8217;t you? It has already been rumored among the nobles that you will create a new legend that will rival that of your ancestor.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mouth moved as if it had been greased, and Hiro was not happy with his brusque manner of speaking.</p>
<p>He can&#8217;t figure out how serious he is about this&#8230; frivolous attitude.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s endearing if he&#8217;s just flattering Hiro for fame and achievement&#8230; but there&#8217;s no way a man like that can rise to the level of the five great noble families. He must be planning something, for sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if there is a groundbreaking plan to defeat 150,000 with 20,000, the chances of failure are higher. How can you come along with such a reckless battle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro made a light probe. It&#8217;s more of a check and balance&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s even a ten percent chance of winning, I&#8217;ll go along with it no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tightrope fight. If we&#8217;re not careful, we&#8217;ll be wiped out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we win, our name will be engraved on a page of history. The central nobility, who are dissatisfied with me as a newcomer, will gladly join my command.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your goal, to use this war to establish your position&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He may have meant it, but Hiro didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d revealed all of his innermost thoughts. He is still hiding something. How can Hiro fish out his true feelings that have sunk to the bottom of his dark belly?</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. If there is no profit and only loss, no one will follow me. Everyone goes to war because of the potential for huge profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of these soldiers care about their country. Not just people like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are, but most of them want to make a name for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro heard Orléans&#8217; words and came to an uncomfortable answer. He realized that he was fundamentally incompatible with this man and that there was a definite difference between them.</p>
<p>This man has no need for a country. It&#8217;s just a business partner for him to make money.</p>
<p>(He&#8217;s a merchant at heart. I&#8217;d be reassured if the situation was stable&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you one of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans asked Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say forty percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro is not a saint, so he is not giving free allegiance to the state. He also has more than a little of his own personal feelings mixed in.</p>
<p>However, he is not neglecting his country like Orléans.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what is the position of this war in your mind, Your Highness Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. I&#8217;ll let you find that out in the battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled coldly as he pushed him away painfully.</p>
<p>In contrast, Orléans also smiled, but his eyes were not smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; I haven&#8217;t gained Your Highness&#8217; trust yet, have I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It also depends on the future of the battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro replied nonchalantly and crossed his gaze with Orléans. There was a chilly laugh as they probed each other&#8217;s insides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s best to leave it at that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When they looked at the interrupting voice, Driks was running alongside them with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a spy sent by Prime Minister Gils, and he has no intention of hiding it anymore. Or is it better to think that other spies are using him as bait to blend in?</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would appreciate it if you wouldn&#8217;t question it in front of the soldiers. If word gets out that the commander and first officer don&#8217;t get along, it could affect morale in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fair point, but&#8230; they didn&#8217;t expect to be warned by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear that. I&#8217;ll be careful in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans hits the back of his head and says his apologies in a deliberate manner.</p>
<p>Hiro pulled the swift dragon away from Driks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. This is fine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When he muttered as they passed each other, Driks raised an eyebrow as if he didn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly, how are the roads? Can we use it for the march?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the overflow of refugees, the army is not in a position to use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still not possible, huh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s to be expected. This is because there is a way to take advantage of an opponent&#8217;s weakness by using an odd path rather than the right one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue into the west by deviating from the road. Before that, can you send out scouts to check the position of the enemy army?&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of alertness, the enemy is probably stronger than them. They should be able to see where gaps are being created. Hiro&#8217;s army is still at the backfoot. The first thing they need to do is to get behind the opponent by avoiding the road, and they need to get a better position to catch up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>After hearing Hiro&#8217;s order, Driks saluted on his horse and then left. His obsidian-like eyes were removed from his back, and Hiro looked up above him.</p>
<p>Looking at the clear blue sky, he let out a smile.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m ready. I can see the path to victory. What remains to be seen is how my opponent will react.)</p>
<p>He must fight resolutely. Act cautiously so that the opponent does not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Your Highness, Hiro, I will lead the advance party ahead of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hiro replied, Orléans bailed lightly and left with his guards. All that remained was a few of his entourage, who had been left behind for the purpose of monitoring Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu&#8230; Hahaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation of having enemies both inside and outside is so funny that it makes him laugh.</p>
<p>(Now, if my prediction is correct&#8230;)</p>
<p>The Six Kingdoms will either retreat without a fight or retreat after two or three battles. They&#8217;ll probably lure Hiro deep inside to make sure he can&#8217;t escape.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll use you&#8230; as a springboard for all my goals.)</p>
<p>In order to make the millennium&#8217;s grand plan come true again, Hiro tightened his grip on the reins as if to show his determination.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>January 14th, the 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>The Grantz Empire ― Beirut territory in the northwest of the western region.</p>
<p>The Grantz conquering army from the Six Kingdoms ― the main army ― still hadn&#8217;t made a move.</p>
<p>There were a few soldiers here and there who were drinking in the daytime. They had set up desks outside in the cold and were engrossed in gambling.</p>
<p>It was difficult to be vigilant when the people around them had already shown their intention to surrender and no orders had been given. In addition, the screams of women could be heard everywhere, as they were the spoils of war from the burning of rebellious villages and towns ― gifts from the western nobility who had shown their willingness to surrender.</p>
<p>The main camp of the Six Kingdoms is a whirlpool of various desires, but there is one place where the atmosphere is different.</p>
<p>It was the command center where the executive officers of the Six Kingdoms were gathered.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no one who is drunk. What permeates the air is a strict atmosphere.</p>
<p>There is a sharpness in the air that can burn the skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;To choose to surrender without a fight&#8230; Lord Kyrthia, a nobleman of the West, is shameful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The acting commander, Luca Mamon de Urpeth, spoke with a tone of mockery in her voice. In front of her, about a dozen western nobles hung their heads and prostrated themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it feel about going from being an absolute winner to a loser?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Grantz Empire used to boast of its great power, and its overwhelming power extended to the surrounding countries.</p>
<p>However, that was a thing of the past, and the western nobles of the Grantz Empire, which had been victorious in a series of battles, bowed their heads in unison. This foreshadows the end of an era.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t just accept your surrender. Considering what you have done to us, you will have to pay a suitable punishment ― a reasonable sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The back of the western nobles trembled as they felt the clear murderous intent in the cruel words.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is food, we will assist you. We have said that we will agree to all of your demands&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;That is not enough. There are many people who have died in this battle. They were supposed to eventually become the people of the Six Kingdoms and give their allegiance to the unified king. However, they died unexpectedly, and their relatives hold a great grudge against the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Luca sighed in regret, Lord Kyrthia closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Luca was happy to see that reaction and spun her words as if she were playing with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to nip the rebellion in the bud as much as possible when I think about what will happen when we annex. I want to soothe the anger of the people as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give one of your daughters, sons, or other blood relatives to the people. Then watch them being tortured and killed. Then the Fairy King, our King, will be rid of your evil thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T-there is no way I can do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca gave Lord Kyrthia a frozen stare as she stood up in anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you can remain unscathed at the expense of others, Lord Kyrthia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why I surrendered! And you want me to kill my blood relatives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca looked at her subordinates. A soldier who sensed her intentions suppressed the screaming Lord Kyrthia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go! Are you going to violate those who have surrendered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up and die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle slipped his sword into Lord Kyrthia&#8217;s neck with great force, seemingly annoyed.</p>
<p>Blood spurts out violently, instantly creating a pool of blood. A few western nobles sobbed as if they were nauseated by the rapid filling of the smell of iron rust.</p>
<p>The executives of the Six Kingdoms standing by the wall also had grim expressions on their faces, but they didn&#8217;t take any action and watched the situation in silence.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Eagle stomped on the head of Lord Kyrthia, who was lying on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister&#8230; that&#8217;s enough. You&#8217;re wasting your time, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still wanted to play, but&#8230; You&#8217;re so impatient, Eagle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca sighed while shaking her head in exhaustion.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Lord Kyrthia had a daughter, she would be a comfort to the soldiers; if he had a son, he would be tortured and then beheaded. As for his wife and other relatives, we will leave them to his people. Let&#8217;s strip him naked and throw him out into the streets&#8230; If he truly ruled with his people in mind, they would take good care of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the absence of the lord, the city will be burned and looted for the injustice done to his people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In front of Luca, who was nonchalantly uttering cruel thoughts, the remaining western nobles had regret on their faces. Some of them even fainted from the extreme tension caused by the combination of cold and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about the rest of you? For my part, I&#8217;d like you to nod your head honestly&#8230; What do you need to be confused about? The sacrifice of just one person will protect your current position, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no way they can say no to that. Even though they were not convinced, everyone had to show their approval.</p>
<p>People are creatures that fight to the end when cornered. However, if they have a way out, they will not choose to die. Moreover, the fact that only one person was sacrificed as an example had a psychological effect on them.</p>
<p>When their thinking ability was dulled, they had no choice but to take the sweet bait.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, the entertainment is over. The commander will be back soon. If you offend her, she&#8217;ll chop your head off immediately, so be careful with your attitude. Unlike me, she&#8217;s not gentle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca made a final gesture as though she were brushing off a dog with a sigh. She meant to say that she had no more use for them and that they should leave, but surprisingly it was her brother Eagle who stopped her.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and looked down at the western nobles with contempt in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you people have any pride as nobles? Even if your people are tortured, even if your friends die, even if your family is murdered, do you not even bother to dirty your clean hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were harsh. It was harsh, so harsh that it shattered their self-esteem.</p>
<p>However, the western nobles just bowed their heads without saying anything. A few of them were still biting their lower lips in frustration and dripping blood.</p>
<p>In response, Eagle added a further provocation with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know if you want to keep your current position even after being ridiculed like this and how attractive it is. From now on, no matter how proud you people are or how much you dignify the surrounding countries, you&#8217;re still losers, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stomped on the head of the western noble and sometimes kicked them hard in the cheek, making him laugh loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s a ring around your shabby neck. From today on, you are slaves of the Six Kingdoms. Don&#8217;t expect to be treated as human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca scowled at his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; sister, these people&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step back now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made him step back with a stern gaze, and she herself stood up and looked down at the western nobles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those of you who have lost your pride, those of you whose fangs have rotted away, those of you who have become cats instead of lions, your sins are serious, but if you go down to the Six Kingdoms, you can assert yourselves like cats. Give thanks to the generous fairy king.&#8221;</p>
<p>She may be trying to use the whip and the candy, but it&#8217;s not going well because these siblings are too devilish at heart. Their true intentions are hidden in every word they say. The other members of the entourage were looking at the two of them with subtle expressions.</p>
<p>At that moment&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahahahaha, the ungrateful siblings are as funny as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of hurried footsteps with loud laughter came from outside. Everyone in the room turned their gaze to the entrance of the command center at once.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman was standing there with a halo on her back from the sunlight streaming in from outside. Everyone was taken aback by her unusual attire, which could be described as bizarre.</p>
<p>They threw rude glances at her, but she smiled more happily than angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Lucia Levia de Anguis.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is a woman who likes to stand out from the ordinary. She likes to act eccentric, wear flashy clothes, and behave roughly. But even so, her dignified demeanor, befitting a queen, fascinates all who see her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Has my beauty blinded you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She became queen at a young age because of her father&#8217;s early death, but perhaps it was because she was a people-pleaser that she received the loyalty of her subjects, was popular with the soldiers and was fervently revered by the people of Anguis for her unparalleled military skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do apologize. It was so sudden&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to Lucia&#8217;s point, Luca smiled and dropped to one knee.</p>
<p>When Eagle and the entourage all kneeled down at once, the western nobles also turned their bodies and bowed their heads. Lucia looked around contentedly and began to walk inside the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umu, no need to be so tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down on the honorary seat and carelessly threw a box in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gift for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca was the one who questioned this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, with all due respect&#8230; it&#8217;s not for us, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca&#8217;s statement sounded brazen, but it was also a natural statement in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the box was thrown down to the western nobles. There were an endless amount of questions as to why there were souvenirs for the western nobles who had chosen to surrender rather than achieve anything, but Lucia just smiled happily, as if she had no intention of answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out when you open it. As for me, I would love to have the western nobles open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia waved the tip of her iron fan at Seleucus, her aide at her side, and gave him instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let him open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to a western nobleman who was watching Lucia and the others with a suspicious look on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus asked the guards to put the box in front of the nobleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what do you want me to do with this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia smiled coldly at the western nobleman who cast a frightened look at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a gurgling sound. They could hear the western nobleman&#8217;s throat so clearly that a strange atmosphere prevailed in the command center.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing? Why don&#8217;t you open it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that there was a hint of anger in the urging words, the western nobleman hurriedly put his hand on the box. He lifted his arms, trembling with fear, and opened the box hesitantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh? Eh? Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of question marks emerged from the western nobleman. His eyes darted around as if he couldn&#8217;t understand, and he looked around as if he was asking someone for an answer.</p>
<p>Lucia began to laugh, holding her stomach at the sight of the ridiculousness of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahahahahahaha! Good! That&#8217;s good! That&#8217;s a really great face!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears welled up in her slitted eyes as she repeatedly slammed her iron fan against the armrest.</p>
<p>Luca, perhaps puzzled by this reaction, checked the contents of the box&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fu, fufufufu, I see&#8230; So that&#8217;s what it is; it&#8217;s terrible taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed in exasperation and shook her shoulders as if trying to hold in her laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a masterpiece, isn&#8217;t it? Come on, Eagle, you can show it to the rest of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Why do I have to&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know it when you see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle approached the box, clicking his tongue at the mischievous glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>He looked down and saw an astonishing sight, and his mouth lifted up in the same way as the two wicked women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, this is ridiculous!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Eagle kicked up the box, the contents rolled on the ground with a sound.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Some held their mouths and turned their faces away, while others vomited on the spot, without shame or remorse. Others cried out in lamentation and shed large tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhh&#8230; Your Highness Blutar! Your Highness Blutar!&#8221;</p>
<p>A western nobleman shouted and crawled out of the ground in a hapless state as if he had no strength in his legs and feet.</p>
<p>A head with a painfully twisted expression was lying on the ground in front of his gaze.</p>
<p>It was the head of the third prince Blutar.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh&#8230; W-why did he end up like this&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The western nobleman hugged the head of the third prince Blutar and glared angrily at the Six Kingdoms group. The others were stunned in disbelief, their mouths half open as they gazed at each other, but no one said a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an order from our home country. Those related to the Grantz family are to be killed without mercy, including women and children. The same thing was done to the Six Kingdoms by you, so I guess it&#8217;s karma, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia, who had her arm resting on the armrest, turned serious as if satisfied with her laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;ll soon follow in the path of the third prince Blutar.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Lucia snapped her fingers, armed soldiers came rushing in from the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-you people! This is not what you promised!&#8221;</p>
<p>A series of screams came from behind the glum western nobles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cowards! To do this to an unarmed opponent ― Guh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>An axe is swung down mercilessly, and the brain fluid splashes. Some of them tried desperately to resist the attack, but without a sword, they were powerless.</p>
<p>No ― they would only suffer longer if they were using swords.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it over. The only thing that awaits us is betrayal when we welcome you, the greedy ones, into our camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia said, but she didn&#8217;t give them time to think it over.</p>
<p>A sharp, well-honed blade mercilessly pierced their hearts from behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure to write a report, saying you were killed in action. That way, your honor will be protected. Be thankful that a pest like you can die with the honor of your nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Lucia muttered calmly, one by one, the western nobles fell to the ground under the deadly blade. They collapsed while shouting curses. The western nobleman who was holding the head of the third prince Blutar also died of heartbreak as his neck was chopped off. In the blink of an eye, the command center became a sea of blood, and a strange smell dominated the space.</p>
<p>None of the soldiers who had created this horrible situation had not been bathed in blood. However, they didn&#8217;t seem to be frightened, and their expressions didn&#8217;t even move slightly.</p>
<p>They simply created a horrific scene with their vacant eyes.</p>
<p>Blood sprinkled from the swords in the hands of the soldiers whose armor was dyed reddish-black.</p>
<p>Even when their targets were all dead, their insane and abnormal behavior did not end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, they let out a yell and thrust their swords into the corpses one after another. They began to attack relentlessly, even though the victims were already dead. With grudge-like malice on their faces, they were cutting up the corpses of western nobles. Some of them even began to feed on the corpses while shedding tears of blood.</p>
<p>Even Lucia couldn&#8217;t help but frown at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough! That&#8217;s enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>With Lucia&#8217;s angry voice, a loud sound rang out. The iron fan was snapped off when she slammed it against the armrest. The empty eyes of the soldiers reacted to the sound and turned on her all at once, but Lucia glared back at them without fear and quietly opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re already dead. There is no need for more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia turned her face down and put her hand on her forehead as if she were trying to hold back a headache.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for your efforts. You can go now, someone, bring the western nobles who are waiting outside here.</p>
<p>Lucia pointed her iron fan at the entrance and urged the soldiers to leave.</p>
<p>In the midst of the sound of metal clanging together&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, can you explain this situation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca, who had been looking at the brutal situation that could be called a massacre, walked up to Lucia. The cold look in her eyes was slightly reproachful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;? Yes, of course, because you don&#8217;t seem to be satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wry smile appeared on Lucia&#8217;s face as she held an iron fan to her mouth to catch her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you recognize any of the soldiers from earlier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, are they an elite guard or something? It&#8217;s not a very tasteful choice for that, but&#8230; In the first place, we do not belong to Your Majesty Queen Lucia&#8217;s country, so there is no way we can know what kind of troops they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sarcasm that confronts the obvious fact, while answering at least in part, is the nature of the Urpeth royal family. They pretend to be intuitive in order to induce you to let your guard down, but at heart, they are a cunning and unusual royal family that takes supreme pleasure in kicking others down. The flag they display is the fox, and they are also known as the land of greed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve just been established, and I call them the Ghost Corps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their eyes were indeed all dead, but&#8230; was there no other name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they were as good as dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had lost relatives in the wars waged by the Grantz Empire. They had all been subjected to unspeakable cruelty by the Grantz soldiers. They can&#8217;t bear the reality of what happened before their eyes and are despairing of the world. They are wandering around in this world with indelible scars in their minds and bodies just to take revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s the Ghost Corps&#8230; huh? Exploiting the passions of these people who are consumed by grief is not something I would call noble, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exploiting them. I gave them a purpose in life. But if you say so, does that mean you can handle them better than me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; I would ease them after giving them the same despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca said with a smile on her face; she was truly enjoying herself. What swirled in her eyes was a frenzy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pain-twisted face and hatred-infused eyes will surely have an irreplaceable beauty ― oh, but it will be fun to feed and keep such people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia raises her eyebrows uncomfortably, wondering who has the more twisted taste.</p>
<p>Then Eagle looked at the two of them with a dumbfounded look.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt your conversation, but&#8230; I&#8217;ve brought in the western nobles who were waiting outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked in front of them, grabbing the hair of one of the western nobles. He&#8217;s as vicious as his sister in that he makes them step on the corpses of their friends.</p>
<p>Behind him were about seven noblemen with their arms bound and following him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, it&#8217;s your beloved lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle made the western nobles sit down in front of the carelessly rolling head ― the changed figure of the third prince Blutar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Uugh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, look at it properly. Can you make sure it&#8217;s him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle slapped the cheek of the western nobleman, who turned his face away and refused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that if you go against the Six Kingdoms, this is what happens. It&#8217;s not just you, but your family as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough of that, Eagle. Unlike the previous western nobles, they are the people that the Six Kingdoms need. Threatening them unnecessarily will make it harder to do so later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>After slamming her iron fan into her hand, Lucia stood up and walked over to the western nobles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to cut off the heads of all the members of the Grantz Imperial family, whom you worship. Those of you who are not prepared to accept this, you may offer your heads here and die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia said in an especially gentle voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do not want to die, follow the Six Kingdoms. Those who lie there are all incompetent, and we have disposed of them, but we value your abilities so much that we won&#8217;t let anything bad happen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gentle smile was full of compassion as if she were a mother telling her child. However, in this reddish world, it is more like the smile of a demon than an angel.</p>
<p>In fact, the western nobles were gnashing their teeth. It may have been because of the cold, but fear naturally made their bodies shake more.</p>
<p>Eventually, with twitching faces, the western nobles began to bow their heads as if to show their vassalage.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s honest and flattering. Then there is nothing for me to say. We&#8217;ll return you to your home safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bewildered western nobles were taken out, unable to grasp the situation as the punishment was decided so easily. Lucia watched in silence, but then she noticed the figure of a messenger who had come in to replace them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia&#8230; I have a report for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Lucia tilted her head, the messenger put his mouth close to her ear. After muttering a few words, he handed her the letter and quietly left the room. Behind her, Luca looked away quizzically and walked up to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umu ― I&#8217;d like to talk to you about it, but&#8230; everyone else should leave this place first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can stay, Eagle.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Lucia&#8217;s instructions, the entourage obediently followed her lead and headed outside the command center.</p>
<p>After a while, there was only a pile of dead bodies and the three of them inside the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the descendant of the God of War has begun to move. He moved with 20,000 soldiers, and they didn&#8217;t intend to take things seriously, but&#8230; how much should I believe this letter? This insider is not exactly trustworthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia, who was reading the letter, said, and the Urpeth siblings looked surprised. In response, Lucia cleared her throat in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever his intentions, it seems that what he wanted came all the way from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me 30,000. I will get his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle pressed Lucia, but she shook her head without a hint of hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t accept that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle glared at her angrily, but surprisingly, the rebuttal came from next to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not strong enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle looked at Luca with surprised eyes, perhaps not expecting to receive a scathing rebuke from his sister. It was a harsh word, but Lucia agreed with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t defeat him with half-hearted strength. Even if you can beat him, if he escapes, there is no way you can chase him. We do not yet have complete control of the west. We have to be mindful to lure him deeper―&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lucia stopped speaking and looked at the ground to see a rolling head.</p>
<p>A masterpiece of a plan came to her mind.</p>
<p>In the bloody landscape, Lucia makes a vicious expression as if she has come up with a devious plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come up with a better plan with that face?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia nodded deeply at Luca&#8217;s point and unfolded her iron fan to cover her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come up with a very amusing plan.&#8221;</p>
