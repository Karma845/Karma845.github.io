<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>A huge flame was spreading. Strands of flames were erupting from everywhere.</p>
<p>The world was enveloped in a storm of a red, cloudy, disastrous fire.</p>
<p>Hiding in the background was a strange odor that was driving one&#8217;s sense of smell crazy.</p>
<p>In addition, the sky was covered in black smoke, and a sea of blood dominated the ground.</p>
<p>As far as the eye could see ― it was endless and went on forever.</p>
<p>The flowers and grass that had sprouted on the ground were dying out endlessly. Beside them, corpses that were still in their original form were burning and smoldering.</p>
<p>The corpse, pierced with countless swords, is suddenly crushed by horseshoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anyone still alive?&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldier on the horse was running with a large amount of fresh blood dripping from his side. He stepped over the corpses of his friends who had laughed with him yesterday and continued to run away. Even though he looked around desperately, what he saw was a plain covered with dead flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it! Damn it! Why, why!&#8221;</p>
<p>Deciding that it was too dangerous to go any further, the soldier threw himself forward and started to run as fast as he could.</p>
<p>But life is cruel. There are no miracles for those who are trapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, the remnant soldier. Where are you running to?&#8221;</p>
<p>A girl appeared in front of him with a fan in her hand, looking out of place on this battlefield and, one might add, very out of place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me? How can you escape in such a disgraceful state?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyii!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is no need to be afraid. I am a kind woman. I will kill you painlessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a bottomless smile, the girl spits out cruel words and takes just one step forward.</p>
<p>That was enough to break the soldier&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>The core of the soldier, who had been through many death rays and had overcome many difficult situations, was broken instantly. He lost all hope of living, his face turned pale, and his spirit collapsed.</p>
<p>At that moment&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyaaaaaaahhh――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>He exploded.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a metaphor. Just as the words say, without a second notice, the soldier&#8217;s body exploded from within.</p>
<p>The deafening sound shook the air, and fresh blood poured onto the ground along with pieces of flesh.</p>
<p>However, without getting a single drop of blood on herself, the girl who opened up her fan smiled lustrously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all collapsing. The great empire that has kept out all foreign enemies is about to collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not at fault ― except for the misfortune of your birth in this land.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one can stop this flow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just being born in Grantz is enough to deserve death.&#8221;</p>
<p>No human being can stop a raging storm. All they can do is wait for it to pass. The weak are left with no choice but to hide behind doors and hide their breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overrun it. Annihilate. Conquer!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s prayerful murmur was accompanied by a series of grievous cries around her.</p>
<p>It was not just one or two. There were dozens of them, piling up and echoing as if they were splitting the air. No one could survive. Even a single breath was enough to send out dozens of spears. There was no way to escape the beasts that were relentlessly targeting their prey.</p>
<p>Even so, there were some who bravely stood up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up! Anyone who can stand up, follow me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The way he mass-produced corpses with a single swing was truly one of a kind.</p>
<p>The way he sprinkled fresh blood on the ground was just like an evil demon.</p>
<p>His martial prowess is so overwhelming that it is hard to imagine from his ordinary appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not allow those people to trample on the land of Grantz!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the great heroes, known as the Five Great Generals, began his assault with the remaining defeated soldiers in tow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be Bakish, one of the five great generals who protects the west. If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to have your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman with blood all over her body smiled miserably in front of the hero. In her hands, she holds a giant hammer that is well over her height.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop joking around&#8230; You don&#8217;t want to get your sickening face smashed in, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Then I&#8217;ll crush your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment the woman stomped on the ground, the winds of the world converged and exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha ― Nnggh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected of one of the five great generals who have made a name for themselves in the world, I was going to spare only your neck, but you are quite sturdy, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;R-ridiculous&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakish knelt on the ground and vomited blood when he saw the large hole in his stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems you have high vitality to spare. Then perhaps you will entertain me a little?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman raised her hand, and her soldiers smiled sneeringly and took out their daggers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gghhh, what are you doing&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much more pain you can endure, but it has to be torture, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the cruel words, the woman revealed a refreshing smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, I&#8217;ll rip out your nails, shave off your ears, and cut off your nose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fuhahahahaha ― you rotten bastards!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakish kicked the ground with his sword in his hand with all the strength he could muster.</p>
<p>But fighting back was a foolhardy and childish act.</p>
<p>The sharp blade only cut through the thin skin, which reminded him of the futility of resistance.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a vast number of enemy soldiers, Bakish was swept up in a storm of hatred.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions on the battlefield, no matter how famous a person is.</p>
<p>There is no mercy. Everyone was dying by the blade.</p>
<p>Eventually, the head of the general whose limbs had been torn off was exposed, and shouts of joy erupted from all over the land.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have defeated one of the five great generals, Bakish! Let it be known throughout the land that the heads were exposed on the streets! Let them know that we, the Six Kingdoms, are the strong ones, and let them fear us by telling them who has attacked them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, they did not stop. They didn&#8217;t end the war even after taking out the general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eradicate them! Let none of them live! Give them an equal death, regardless of their status!&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the voice, an inexhaustible amount of dead people were created as if to release the accumulated resentment.</p>
<p>Even surrounded by such a horrible situation, the girl did not stop smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is the time to take revenge for our ancestors.&#8221;</p>
