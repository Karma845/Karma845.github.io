<h3>Afterwords</h3>

<p>Thank you for reading &#8220;The Otherworldly Tales of a Mythological, Legendary Hero Vol 6&#8221;.</p>
<p>For those of you who have continued to read it from the previous volume, it&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this volume as well. And If you feel that your left eye is tingling, thanks to this, congratulations! Now you too can be a great &#8220;Heterochromatic Eye&#8221; ――let&#8217;s find a way to the other world.</p>
<p>Now, this volume is going to be the next step ― a volume that will go on the offensive, including the cover.</p>
<p>Now that the stage is set, it looks like I&#8217;ll finally be able to write the story I wanted to write the most.</p>
<p>In the next volume and onwards, I plan to develop the story from various perspectives, including Hiro&#8217;s past, and accelerate the chuunibyou further, so I&#8217;ll be paying close attention to that part of the story.</p>
<p>Liz is also developing into a heroine, beautiful and noble, worthy of the throne.</p>
<p>Still, there are characters with various agendas, and the situation is not straightforward.</p>
<p>There is one more thing I would like to talk about: Lucia, a new character who appeared in this volume.</p>
<p>I think she is an erotic character whose likes and dislikes are clearly divided.</p>
<p>By the way, I do like her. I love her, including her underboob. So, although it may not be necessary, I dare to cast a mysterious spell to increase her fans.</p>
<p>Actually ― Lucia&#8217;s pants are actually missing. She&#8217;s not wearing pants.</p>
<p>Her underboob draws the eye, but the shocking fact is that she hides the important part with a snake ornament.</p>
<p>Oh, did anyone just check the cover? Did you think, &#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you did, you&#8217;re the same as I was when Miyuki Ruria-sama told me (with a smile).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, let me give my gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you, Miyuki Ruria-sama, for always exceeding my expectations with your illustrations, which are both a feast for my eyes and a comfort to my soul. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>S-sama, the editor in charge, I&#8217;m sorry for the trouble I&#8217;ve caused with every volume. Although I&#8217;ve done a lot of other things, I&#8217;d be happy if you could continue to watch over me warmly.</p>
<p>I-sama, also the editor in charge, thank you for your help with this volume. I&#8217;m sure there are many things I haven&#8217;t done right, but I would appreciate it if you could continue to help me and not give up on me.</p>
<p>To the editorial staff, proofreaders, designers, and everyone else involved in this book, it is thanks to you that this book has been completed, and I look forward to your continued support.</p>
<p>And to the readers who have been reading since the last volume, I have been able to come this far thanks to your support. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I will continue to send out more of the never-ending Chuni, so please support me.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you again soon.</p>
<p> </p>
