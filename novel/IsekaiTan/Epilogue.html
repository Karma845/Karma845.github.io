<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>The crowd was cheering.</p>
<p>In the midst of the violent dust, a cry of victory echoed around the world. The flag with the black dragon on it was burned and turned into ashes that flowed down the ground.</p>
<p>Many corpses with the lion&#8217;s emblem engraved on their chests were being trampled by the frenzied soldiers.</p>
<p>Forgetting the military code, they were all gazing at the same place.</p>
<p>One woman was holding a head up to the sky.</p>
<p>Some are quietly gazing at such clamor. Blending in with the soldiers, nobody could see them, but the air was clearly different here.</p>
<p>There is a chill in the air like cold air cowering and tearing at one&#8217;s guts.</p>
<p>Even though the soldiers around them were screaming with joy, their expressions did not change at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The king&#8217;s presence is gone. The &#8220;usurper&#8221; is definitely dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what do we do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no joy on their faces, no sadness in their voices, no anger in their bodies.</p>
<p>Just the facts, spoken in a voice with no inflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time has come for us to emerge from the abyss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind trembled, and the air creaked.</p>
<p>A definite change â€• and yet no one notices.</p>
<p>No one will notice the changes in the isolated world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Father. Give the fools eternal torment. Our Father. Give peace to the saints.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that, they disappeared unnoticed.</p>
