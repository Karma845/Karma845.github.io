<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Sun Will Rise Again</h3>

<p>Under the clear skies ― there was a group of horsemen riding briskly through the sunlit streets.</p>
<p>A lily on a red background was painted on their banner.</p>
<p>It was the flag of Celia Estrella Elizabeth von Grantz, the sixth imperial princess.</p>
<p>10th February, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar. In the capital city of the Great Grantz Empire, Cladius, Liz was returning with a small group of guards.</p>
<p>People looked back to see what was happening, but her back was already too far away to see.</p>
<p>The echoing roar of horseshoes left a reverberation everywhere along the way, but it ceased once they reached the imperial palace. Liz jumped off her horse and headed for the entrance of the imperial palace.</p>
<p>However, the door opened first, and a familiar figure stepped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosa-Aneesama!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sister. You&#8217;ve come back safely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t go back to the east?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz jumped into Rosa&#8217;s chest with her arms outstretched and looked up at her sister.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; Well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rosa awkwardly averted her face and scratched her cheek, Liz narrowed her eyes and backed away from her sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about Hiro from the head of the Muzuk family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; so there&#8217;s no need to hide anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa let out a tired sigh, looked up at the sky, and began to mutter clerically and indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all the truth. I&#8217;m sorry that we deceived you, but it was all necessary for you to take the throne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why――&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz closed in on Rosa.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She frowned at the envelope that Rosa suddenly presented to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My lord gave it to Liz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa smiled as if she was troubled as Liz took the letter from her.</p>
<p>Then she looked around and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Ghada-dono?&#8221;</p>
<p>She asked Liz, but she seemed to be too busy reading the letter to hear her. Another chuckle escaped Rosa&#8217;s lips, and Tris came over to see whether he had heard her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Raven Army is coming with the Fourth Emperor&#8217;s army. Of course, the Muzuk family&#8217;s army is also coming with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; so you&#8217;ve succeeded in persuading the Muzuk family to join?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will reach the Great Imperial Capital in about a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The soldiers from other regions are gathering in the capital one after another. It looks like we can finally fight back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa patted Liz&#8217;s head happily, but she was still concentrating on the letter and was left to her own devices. She took her hand away from Liz&#8217;s head and pulled out a separate letter from the one addressed to Liz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to give it to Ghada-dono as soon as possible&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head as if she had no choice but to hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Liz, are you hung――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa&#8217;s words were cut off in mid-sentence, and her beautiful eyes suddenly widened. This is because there was no sign of Liz in the place where she had just been.</p>
<p>She looked around hurriedly to find her and found that she was just about to jump into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz! Where do you think you&#8217;re going? Hold on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa shouted unusually loudly, but Liz was turning her horse&#8217;s head and would not stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tris-dono, you have to stop her too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Princess! P-please wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of them ran towards Liz&#8217;s back, but there was no way they could catch up to the horse with their human legs.</p>
<p>As soon as they see it, they are separated from each other. Rosa continued to call out to Liz during that time, but she stubbornly ignored her, not even looking back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going by yourself, are you? Damn it; if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re planning to do, I&#8217;ll stop you with all my might.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clicked her tongue and stopped in her tracks. Realizing that she couldn&#8217;t catch up, she thought about moving her troops to capture Liz. But there was no need for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Selene-Aniisama?&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene appeared leisurely in front of Liz, who was galloping at high speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to stop you, you know, Liz? You&#8217;re being too reckless!&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood drained from Rosa&#8217;s face as she recognized Selene&#8217;s figure with his arms outstretched. There was no sign of Liz slowing down her horse. On the other hand, Selene doesn&#8217;t seem to have any intention of giving way either.</p>
<p>A horrible scene appears in Rosa&#8217;s mind, but there is nothing she can do about it.</p>
<p>Even as she ponders, the distance between them is closing.</p>
<p>And then ― they collide.</p>
<p>A violent cloud of dust rolls up. Due to this, she was unable to grasp the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz! Selene-Aniisama!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dust was blown away by the wind in front of Rosa, who hurriedly approached the scene.</p>
<p>The next thing she saw was a surprising sight.</p>
<p>It was not the sight of Selene being hit by a horse, nor was it the scene of Liz falling off her horse and fainting in agony.</p>
<p>Rather, she was being pinned to the ground by Selene. The horse, which had lost its rider, was whinnying anxiously, turning its head around, seemingly unaware of what had happened.</p>
<p>Rosa, too, was filled with confusion, but she stroked her chest and began to walk, relieved that he could stop Liz for the moment.</p>
<p>As she closed the distance between them, she could hear their conversation drifting through the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to hurt the horse, so I had to take a rough approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Selene-Aniisama? Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That should be my line. Right now, we should wait for the nobles to arrive from all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz put all her strength into trying to escape the restraints, but Selene didn&#8217;t move an inch.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was astonished. Her physical abilities have been enhanced by the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of the Flame Emperor, one of the Five Emperors of Spirit Swords. An ordinary person should be no better than an infant in this regard. And yet, no matter how much effort she put into it, she could not free herself from Selene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step back! Selene-Aniisama! I have to go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz, I know how you feel, but let&#8217;s calm down first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz glared at Selene, who tried to warn her with a smile.</p>
<p>And Liz&#8217;s eyes moistened when she saw Hiro&#8217;s letter shimmering at the edge of her vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no way I can calm down! Get out of my way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz tried to hold back her tears and failed. Tears flowed down her cheeks and onto the ground, dampening the soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, hey, please let me go to the west&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz pleaded with Selene, letting out a sob.</p>
<p>Selene&#8217;s eyes twisted sadly as he recognized his sister&#8217;s painful appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. If I did that, his resolve would be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need his resolve&#8230; Let it go to waste!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re probably confused, so I&#8217;m going to pretend I didn&#8217;t hear that gibberish. We have to wait until we have the strength to do it. It&#8217;s the only thing we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we wait, Hiro will die! I can&#8217;t let that happen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The murderous intent of Liz&#8217;s body is increasing in pressure to an uncommon degree.</p>
<p>Selene&#8217;s face was tense as he restrained her, perhaps because her power was getting stronger and stronger. But even so, Selene pushed her to the ground with all the strength he could muster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what the letter said?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liz nodded hesitantly in response to Selene&#8217;s question, a shadow fell over their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz&#8230; please respect my lord&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa bent forward and gently stroked her sister&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;You too, Anee-sama! Why didn&#8217;t you stop Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I could have stopped my lord, the Great Imperial Capital would have been besieged by a 200,000-strong army by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering the speed of the invasion of the Six Kingdoms, the prediction was not wrong. If the Great Imperial Capital were to be surrounded, its authority would be destroyed.</p>
<p>The reinforcements gathering from all over the world would have no place to go, and the Grantz Empire would have collapsed.</p>
<p>There would also be a betrayal by the nobles in search of their own interests, and some would even turn to other countries.</p>
<p>In fact, an investigation has shown that many of the central nobility are linked to the Six Kingdoms. It seems that they were originally linked to the Krone family, but the First Prince Stobel solidified it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My lord, he went into battle to expose those people. If they stay hidden, there&#8217;s nothing we can do. He said that if we show them an opening, the traitors will bite us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But that doesn&#8217;t mean why should Hiro have to sacrifice himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz, who had lost the will to resist, was released from Selene and sat on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the best person for the job. For the enemy, the descendant of the God of War is a great way to increase their prestige, and for the traitors, he is a nuisance. However, there was no way that they would easily turn tail on him in a straightforward attack. That&#8217;s why my lord bought himself as a decoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..isn&#8217;t that too much to go on. Hiro didn&#8217;t have to use himself as bait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But we have to trust him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa put her arm around Liz&#8217;s shoulders, her eyes red and swollen, and held her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m sure my lord will come back alive. He would return with his usual aloofness. We can&#8217;t trust a letter written by a naughty young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa&#8217;s voice trembled as if she were saying to herself.</p>
<p>Behind her, Selene stands idly, looking at his sisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..is this a prank?&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene frowned and tilted his head at Rosa&#8217;s words and actions.</p>
<p>However, he quickly smiled to mend the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to your room and get some rest. Liz is probably tired from running in so early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right&#8230; get some rest first. Then we&#8217;ll talk again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>With Rosa pushing her back, Liz turns her feet towards the imperial palace.</p>
<p>The gait is heavy and unsteady, so weak that it looks as if she might collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>The old soldier, Tris, bowed to Selene and followed the girls.</p>
<p>Selene responded by raising his hand and looking after the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; I wonder what it is. I can&#8217;t get it off my chest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tilted his head and wracked his brain, but no answer came out.</p>
<p>Sighing in resignation, Selene approached the horse that Liz had left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Driks, are you there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driks, who had been hiding in the blind spot, appeared as if in the shadow of the horse.</p>
<p>But the sudden appearance of Driks didn&#8217;t seem to surprise him, and Selene stroked the horse&#8217;s neck and mumbled a few words to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you received anything from Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have a letter for you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brown envelope slid across the ground and stopped under Selene&#8217;s feet. He pretended to pick up the reins and the envelope at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think my uncle knows about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The brown envelope contained a single letter with a brief message.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reported it to him, so he knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; he would have checked the contents. My uncle loves to snoop, you know. Did he say anything to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause ― a moment of hesitation for Driks, but the meaning behind it was profound.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;He&#8217;s notified everyone that he&#8217;s going to start the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just typical of him, but&#8230; there is something wrong with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene tilted his head, eyeing Hiro&#8217;s letter with suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to verify the content, but I haven&#8217;t tampered with it in any way. What&#8217;s so strange about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say for sure. At the moment, it just feels strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene shrugged his shoulders with a wry smile and headed towards the imperial palace, pulling the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see my uncle first. He might be plotting to undermine the stability of the north.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Gils-sama would do such a thing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Driks complained, but Selene did not listen to him and turned his fierce eyes on him.</p>
<p>His right eye ― the one with the golden color ― made Driks stand still there, forgetting to hide himself. And then he sat down as if his back was shattered.</p>
<p>And then ― Driks held his throat and began to suffer.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-agh&#8230; W-what are you&#8230; doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>As if he had run out of oxygen, Driks face turned red as he watched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just venting my anger to you. But if you get too carried away, I&#8217;ll kill you next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene tapped Driks on the shoulder happily, and Driks began to breathe frantically as if he had been relieved of his suffering. A large amount of sweat poured down from his face and was sucked into the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all one ― if this is true, then my uncle is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Selene begins to walk with a grim expression on his face as he rereads Hiro&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>The sun is setting. Along with the deep, piercing wind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The world was shrouded in darkness. The sky was covered with clouds, and the stars had lost their brightness.</p>
<p>The moonlight had failed to reach the ground, and the cold wind was blowing relentlessly.</p>
<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― the Larix Plains in the northwest of the western region.</p>
<p>The main camp of Hiro and the others were set up in a circle here. There was no sign of any soldiers in the camp due to the cold. On such a quiet night, the sound of metal often echoed with the footsteps of the patrol.</p>
<p>The soldier on guard noticed the sound and turned to look. He was breathing into his clasped hands but stopped and turned to salute the patrolman.</p>
<p>The patrolman returned the salute and then walked past the guard, keeping a sharp eye on his surroundings. Just as the guards were relaxing, they saw a figure walking in front of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is everyone assembled?&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans Longwill von Mark.</p>
<p>He was the head of the Mark family, who had successfully taken over after the fall of the Krone family.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are already gathering.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldier on guard took a glance behind him before replying. Orléans, who nodded in satisfaction, stepped forward. The soldier on guard hurriedly opened the entrance curtain, and Orléans walked in without saying a word of thanks.</p>
<p>The room was filled with warm air, which enveloped Orléans&#8217; body. There seemed to be a heating system in place. Also, the temperature in the room must be high due to the large number of people gathered there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, thank you for gathering here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans called out, and the nobles who had been looking at the map in the center of the room stood up at once. There were eight of them ― all of them loyal to Orléans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was surprised to be called upon at this hour, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t complain; I wanted to let you know as soon as we were ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans handed his jacket to the approaching nobleman and went to his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, won&#8217;t His Highness Hiro notice us if we are seen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I have changed the patrolmen&#8217;s schedule. The security will be thinner during this time. Well, besides, not many people will be out in this cold weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans sat back in his chair with vigor, leaned his left elbow on the desk, and rested his cheek on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourself comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to his right and shouted for the nobles to take their seats. He waited until they were all seated before he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll skip the greetings. I know some of you are anxious, so I&#8217;ll keep it brief: the plan is working. His Highness Hiro is unaware of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sigh of relief escaped from the nobles at his strong words. They all lifted their cheeks to express their joy as if they had won a battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the reaction of the other side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are fine. We&#8217;ve been in constant contact with them. The response has been excellent, so I&#8217;m sure the treatment won&#8217;t be too bad. Above all, the first prince Stobel is over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, we must act more carefully. If our plans are exposed here, the whole thing will go down the drain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobleman&#8217;s opinion was reasonable, so Orléans nodded in agreement. But the nobleman&#8217;s expression took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is only one thing to worry about, is our position really secure? Isn&#8217;t a verbal promise too risky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand why you are worried, but as I said earlier&#8230; the first prince Stobel, is also there, so you can rest assured. Even after the fall of the Grantz Empire, our territory will not be ravaged. As long as we continue to cooperate, that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;but you must hand over His Highness Hiro&#8217;s head to them. He has a huge following among the people, and many of your subjects adore him, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobleman looked around as if to ask for agreement, and everyone nodded in agreement, though their expressions were bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were known that we had betrayed him, we could be forced out of our position as lords.&#8221;</p>
<p>What he meant was that the Six Kingdoms would be able to take advantage of their weakness. In peacetime, the nobles treat the people like slaves, but they are always on the lookout for a rebellion in times of war. If a disgraceful rumor were to circulate that they had betrayed the immensely popular Hiro and turned to the Six Kingdoms, their downfall would be inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Six Kingdoms would not do such a thing to ensure smooth governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally, we were supposed to be the ones attacking and destroying the Great Imperial Capital&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>A heavy atmosphere filled the room as another nobleman spoke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was happy to see the Krone family&#8217;s old man dead, but&#8230; what followed was worse. I didn&#8217;t think that His Highness Hiro would be able to defeat the rebels. He really went the extra mile for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan needed to be revised from there. If the rebels had persisted a little longer, the Six Kingdoms would have flooded into the center of the country by now, and together with the rebels, they would have brought down the Great Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>It was the nobles, including Orléans, who were gathered here, who were supposed to be in agreement with that. There were others, but they were killed by stray arrows in the battle against the Six Kingdoms&#8217; Second Conquest Army.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way we can beat the Six Kingdoms, but then again, patriots are really a pain in the ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans looked at the map on his desk.</p>
<p>Repeated skirmishes with the Third Conquest Army have lured the Grantz Army deep into the west. According to the scouts&#8217; report, the number of soldiers of the Six Kingdoms that had joined the entire army had swelled to 180,000. In the beginning, there was some confusion, but it had already been settled, and the reorganization of the large army had been completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And besides, it&#8217;s not as if we can turn back now that we&#8217;ve said something.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no turning back now. There was no turning back from the day they decided to betray the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>&#8220;That anxiety will end with tomorrow&#8217;s battle. With the death of His Highness Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battle will be over soon. They were happy to see Hiro on the front lines.</p>
<p>After he is defeated by the Six Kingdoms, the arrangements for their surrender will be made. After that, they will return home as defeated soldiers in a disgraceful state, and if the Six Kingdoms attack the Central, they will turn to tears for the sake of their people.</p>
<p>And if they accomplish the historic feat of bringing down the Great Imperial Capital, their stigma will be blown away, and they will be remembered for generations to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, His Highness Hiro is a descendant of the God of War, so isn&#8217;t there a possibility that killing such a person will bring about a curse? I&#8217;m afraid of incurring the wrath of the Spirit King.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who said those pathetic words was Lord Kyrthia, the lord of Sabelt and a western nobleman.</p>
<p>His father had expressed his willingness to surrender to the Six Kingdoms but had apparently made a mistake at the meeting and had his head chopped off. As a result, he was invaded by the Second Conquest Army as an example, but it was the Grantz Army that saved him from that predicament. However, it seems that all of this was a ruse by the other side, and he, who succeeded his father, also turned on the condition of his own safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no such thing as a curse. As the first prince Stobel had said. The power of the gods has already been lost. What is there to be afraid of? Tomorrow, we will deliberately run for our lives and give His Highness Hiro&#8217;s head to the Six Kingdoms, and that will be the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans slammed the desk in frustration. Surprised by this, Kyrthia shook his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Kyrthia, you&#8217;ve got a cowardly wind up here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no, it&#8217;s not like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, for the future, your decision to join the Six Kingdoms is not wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans, who repeatedly slammed the desk, urged Kyrthia to look at the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be prepared to use the Six Kingdoms to your advantage. Then we will definitely have the central region in our hands. But that&#8217;s not the end of it. With the power of the Six Kingdoms behind us, we will attack and destroy the east, north, and south. We can be the new rulers of the Great Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I understand. I&#8217;m sorry for saying such a trivial thing. Please forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha, it can&#8217;t be helped. He has just taken over the position of the lord. You can&#8217;t blame him too much, Lord Mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another nobleman put his arm around Kyrthia&#8217;s shoulders and comforted him as he was overwhelmed and frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Forgive me, Lord Kyrthia. But I hope you will consider my words for the sake of your people&#8217;s peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sorry I made Lord Mark uncomfortable by saying something unnecessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose we are both to blame&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>And the nobleman who had his arm around Kyrthia&#8217;s shoulder fell back with a loud thud. With the sudden and incomprehensible event, everyone&#8217;s thoughts stopped.</p>
<p>The map spread out on the desk turned red. A head rolled there with a smile on its face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, ah, Uooghh――&#8221;</p>
<p>Kyrthia took a good look at the head rolling around on the desk ― the severed part ― and vomited.</p>
<p>The nobles widened their eyes in surprise. Orléans also stood up from his seat in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be enjoying your conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flat voice interrupted the stunned nobles. Everyone felt a chill run down their spines at the lack of emotion in the voice, and all eyes turned to the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a tip-off from an anonymous person. Some fat livestock has taken over one of the tents.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had black hair and dark eyes, and his soft face looked young for his age, perhaps because he was not wearing an eye patch.</p>
<p>However, despite his gentle appearance, the expression on his face is a cruel smile.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback by his calm and natural appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food is precious. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve come to slaughter them myself before they escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro, his voice trembling with enjoyment, took one look at Kyrthia and quietly walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be a part of this historic meeting that will bring down the Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone on guard――&#8221;</p>
<p>A nobleman was about to speak up, but his head instantly fell to the ground. A dull thud, like a bag of dirt being slammed, echoed through the tent, and the headless body collapsed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the guards are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new head was placed on the table.</p>
<p>The soldiers were killed without being able to figure out the situation, but a tight smile remained on their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a fuss, livestock. If you utter even a single word, I will kill you without a second thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro put his index finger to his mouth and formed a gentle smile. It was eerie to see that his eyes were not smiling at all.</p>
<p>Everyone was stiff with fear and stood still. There was no way they could say a word.</p>
<p>Hiro nodded in satisfaction and walked over to the head of the Mark family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Orléans. Are you doing well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;how long have you been aware of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans&#8217; voice trembled as he turned pale.</p>
<p>Hiro showed signs of thinking and laughed innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from the beginning. I&#8217;ve been struggling to hold back my laughter since you&#8217;ve been acting exactly as I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro tapped Orléans on the shoulder in amusement as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I turned to the central nobility and appointed you as my second-in-command was all for this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orléans&#8217; expression changed as he watched. He gritted his teeth in frustration as he understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was easy to see through your shallow schemes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro turned behind Orléans and glared around at the nobles with a deepening smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there might be one way for you to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what is that&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for that reason. Orléans, you&#8217;re going to help me out a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hiro stretched his right arm into the empty space, a crack appeared, and the hilt of a sword popped out.</p>
<p>It was not a spirit weapon. It was an inwardly curved sword, a favorite weapon of the southerners.</p>
<p>However, it had no shape as a weapon and was rusted and covered with mud.</p>
<p>In addition, the blade had a saw-like shape and was not in a condition to be used as a weapon. It looked as if it would break immediately upon impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, clench your teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro thrust the rusty sword into Orléans shoulder without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aghh, fumuhh―!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Orléans opened his mouth wide, Hiro reached out and covered his mouth. Orléans struggled to move his arms and legs, but Hiro didn&#8217;t budge an inch. The central nobles cowered in fear and gnashed their teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will torture Orléans now. If I can extract useful information from him, I will forgive whatever you&#8217;re up to. But if he doesn&#8217;t give anything up until he&#8217;s dead, I&#8217;ll get information out of each and every one of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro pulled out the rusty sword and found a piece of flesh stuck to the chipped blade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what tetanus is?&#8221;</p>
<p>This made Orléans&#8217; eyes widen with tears, and his body tremble.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sword is called the Balance of the Vile. It was named after the second son of the Principality of Lichtine, who used it as a torture weapon. And I heard that tetanus has a mortality rate of five to one, so I named it Balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro put his mouth to Orléans ear, adding at the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take my hand away from your mouth, but if you make a single sound without my permission, I&#8217;ll cut off your right arm with the Balance of the Vile. But this thing is not as durable as it looks. So I&#8217;ll use it as slowly as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said in a calm tone and then removed his hand from Orléans&#8217; mouth. He sank his teeth into his lower lip so hard that blood dripped from it.</p>
<p>He kicked the ground with both feet over and over again, trying his best to distract himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know what, I don&#8217;t need you for my plan. Kyrthia is all I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he whispered this in her ear, Orléans stiffened as if he had forgotten the pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;C-could it be that&#8230; everything was your――&#8221;</p>
<p>As he was about to say this, Hiro covered Orléans&#8217; mouth again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a pity. You spoke without my permission. I&#8217;m going to cut off your right arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>This night is short, and there was no time left to torture everyone gathered here.</p>
<p>(If I don&#8217;t start moving soon, I&#8217;m not going to be on time&#8230;)</p>
<p>In order to make sure that he would be able to speak quickly, Hiro moved the &#8220;Balance of the Vile&#8221; with a wish.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>At the same time, in the main camp of the Six Kingdoms, the final preparations for tomorrow&#8217;s decisive battle were being made.</p>
<p>Three people, a man and two women are in a tent set up in the center of the main camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not heard from the head of the Mark family. Isn&#8217;t it possible that his scheme has been exposed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca said with a serious expression, and her brother Eagle sat next to her, biting his nails in frustration.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lucia was smiling with a relaxed smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no problem. I have prepared several measures, and if one of them collapses, it won&#8217;t hinder the operation. And what about the military formation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If things go according to plan, there will be no problem. But if they get caught in the cracks, that&#8217;s pretty bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle tossed the report to Lucia.</p>
<p>It seems that the formation could not be completed in a short time after all. The report in Lucia&#8217;s hand stated that there was a breakdown in many areas.</p>
<p>It seemed that the reason for this was that they tried to avoid friction with other countries as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Six Kingdoms, as the name implies, is a union of six nations.</p>
<p>Although they have been allied for many years, they do not work hand in hand in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>The current situation is that everyone is checking each other for supremacy in the Krim region.</p>
<p>For example, the Anguis Kingdom of Lucia is not on good terms with the Urpeth Kingdom of the Urpeth sibling.</p>
<p>When the previous king of Urpeth was still alive, it was not unusual for the nobles of both countries to marry each other. In other words, it could even be said that they had a close relationship.</p>
<p>However, when the previous king collapsed, the throne that should have gone to the Urpeth siblings was taken away from them.</p>
<p>If they had succeeded to the throne without any problems, the friendly relations between the two countries would have continued.</p>
<p>However, since the previous king and the current king ― the friendship that had been built up over the past two generations ― had been destroyed, the relationship between the two countries had grown cold. This kind of problem exists in every country, no matter how small. That is why, when it comes to a large-scale invasion like this, problems such as disobedience to someone from that country erupt. That&#8217;s why at first, they divided their army into several groups to invade.</p>
<p>In the name of the unified king, each of them had a different role in order to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be a minor problem. It should serve as bait to attract the God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>They need an element that makes them think they can win.</p>
<p>It must not be known that they are tampering with the rules of victory without being noticed. That&#8217;s because it will lead to their retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the &#8220;Ancient King&#8221; was biting it. It is not for nothing that we have not heard from the head of the Mark family. It ties into the fact that the poison has been introduced into the body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia was honestly happy that the head of the God of War was at hand, but for the Urpeth sibling, it was a different story.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Although it&#8217;s possible that we invited the poison instead. As for us, we would have preferred to let the five armies invade and take the west for the certainty.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they had just let the five armies run amok, the war might have been prolonged. Even the western nobles who surrendered did not necessarily swear allegiance. If the Grantz Empire had launched a counterattack, they probably would have betrayed them immediately.</p>
<p>Above all, they took the initiative, but they have been on the back foot since the descendant of the God of War went into battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Urpeth sibling is unaware of this.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s just brilliant&#8230; only 20,000, but despite that, it&#8217;s an action that gives hope to the western nobility. If they had continued to fight, the war would have been prolonged.)</p>
<p>The secret of war is speed ― how to win without letting the opponent resist.</p>
<p>However, with Hiro coming into battle, the speed will slow down. Therefore, in order to gain the upper hand in future battles, they sacrificed the Second Conquest Army.</p>
<p>Gaining the greater than the less. Rather than choosing a local victory, it is far better to have a big-picture victory.</p>
<p>(Besides, I&#8217;m not interested in the territory.)</p>
<p>This is where Lucia and the Urpeth siblings are definitely different.</p>
<p>The Six Kingdoms have not expanded their territory in over 400 years. No country has the ability to manage the territory it has taken. As expected, even if they acquired the western regions, it would be difficult to manage them due to their lack of experience. In addition, even if they were to acquire the western regions, they would have to deal with the issue of ceding them to other countries. In addition, there is still the issue of Felzen.</p>
<p>Lucia would really like to avoid such troublesome problems.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Let&#8217;s see what happens first.)</p>
<p>Some countries will fail to govern, while others will succeed.</p>
<p>After observing them and taking their governing skills, she can take a part of the west from other countries. That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s aiming for a certain achievement right now: the descendant of the God of War.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Ancient King is defeated, the strength of the Grantz Empire will be greatly reduced. If we don&#8217;t get rid of as many capable people as possible, we will be the ones who will be cornered later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The enemy, despite its rottenness, is the Grantz Empire. It&#8217;s not only the land but also the quantity of goods and the far different number of soldiers.</p>
<p>They could create the current situation because they invaded without giving any time for the Grantz Empire to prepare their forces.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no guarantee that they will continue to be outnumbered in the future.</p>
<p>There is a high possibility that they will have more troops than the Six Kingdoms. The problem of food and supplies has not been solved yet, and if the situation becomes prolonged, they will surely be defeated. The Six Kingdoms will be driven out of the west and will be left with nothing but enormous losses.</p>
<p>(We have to find a compromise somewhere.)</p>
<p>In order for the negotiations to go in their favor, it was necessary to show their strength.</p>
<p>As a queen, she looks ahead to the future for the peace of the nation. She should not only think of victory but also the worst-case scenario, which is defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, he is a descendant of the God of War. His value is immeasurable. It&#8217;s an achievement that the united king will recognize. Perhaps you could even get your throne back with <i>her</i> help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, if Your Majesty Queen Lucia doesn&#8217;t monopolize the credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not trust me? Didn&#8217;t we once play together and grow up together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were young, we were still pure and could play without suspicion. But now that we are grown up, we know the horror of the snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca threw a stern look at her. Lucia shrugged her shoulders without denying it.</p>
<p>Their gazes sparked, and Eagle, caught between them, kept his eyes downcast.</p>
<p>A moment of silence drifted through the room.</p>
<p>Lucia couldn&#8217;t take it any longer, and she broke the silence with a loud bang of her iron fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it would be good for you to cut off the head of the Ancient King and return. With that, you will trust me, will you not? Is that not enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you serious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it makes you feel better, then fine. As long as it is to our credit, I have no problem with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Urpeth siblings were delighted to hear this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. Then we will continue with the mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem with that if you&#8217;re okay with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the discussion is over. Tomorrow, you will take the head of the Ancient King, so you&#8217;d better rest up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Your Majesty Queen Lucia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll act as a decoy to draw the Ancient King away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia unfolded her iron fan and smiled. Luca tilted her head in disbelief at this behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be that&#8230; do you want us to fight alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I think you&#8217;re going to lose, I&#8217;ll help you at least a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Lucia&#8217;s provocative words, Luca&#8217;s expression became more and more intense. It was probably because she could tell from her words that she planned to use the Urpeth siblings as a stepping stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s―&#8221;</p>
<p>The chair collapses with a rumbling sound as Luca stands up vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take it as a parasitic statement that you will take the best part?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca&#8217;s eyes, filled with anger, began to glow with a red lotus flame. But that anger instantly dissipated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, you will have no role to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eagle? What are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle, who had no say in the matter, thrust out his arm as if to restrain Luca.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8230; the Urpeth siblings will triumphantly return with the head of the God of War. That&#8217;s all you need to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without hiding his anger, Eagle made his way to the entrance with high-pitched footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-wait! Eagle! What&#8217;s the matter with you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca&#8217;s expression was bewildered as she chased after her brother&#8217;s back in a panic.</p>
<p>It was clear that she was confused by Eagle&#8217;s sudden change in attitude. The attitude of a younger brother who rarely rebelled against his older sister. Luca&#8217;s back was looking forlorn as she walked out of the command center like a child clinging to their parents, forgetting the anger she had just felt, for fear that feels akin to hostility might be directed at her as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kukuku, fumu&#8230; it&#8217;s a good feeling of dependence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Urpeth siblings have been fighting the adults around them alone since the throne was taken from them. Even if they are from the royal family, when they lose their power, they merely become toys for the nobility.</p>
<p>The humiliation and hatred that the nobles had suffered from the king were all directed at the two of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luca&#8217;s eyes were dead back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia, who felt sorry for the treatment of the Urpeth siblings, advised the unified king, and although she was the youngest, she was once again recognized as a member of the royal family and was able to lead a decent life.</p>
<p>Her talent had always been good, and she rose to fame at a breakneck pace, but her dream of regaining the throne has yet to come true.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dream remains a dream&#8230; and you will be happier for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Urpeth siblings will never be able to regain the throne.</p>
<p>The woman is the closest thing to a unified king and has the power to do anything she wants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not something that can be surpassed by hard work ― Lucia gnashed her teeth in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to use you&#8230; for my ambitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the name of the queen, she must take advantage of all those she can. The management of a nation is not a charity. The national interest must always be the top priority.</p>
<p>Personal feelings are secondary.</p>
<p>Unless one can overpower their emotions and punish even their parents and siblings, they cannot be a king.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have too many weaknesses. You show too much emotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Urpeth siblings are dependent on each other. If either one of them is missing, it will break the other&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s their biggest flaw as commanders. There is no room for personal feelings in war. It&#8217;s a kill or be killed world.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Many people die defending others, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a world of bloodshed, a good story is certainly a glorious thing. In a war, they can be used for propaganda purposes. After the war, they can be hailed as saints and inscribed in history.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can die ugly and disfigured, or they can die beautiful and miraculous&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She should at least be given that option.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her die as a pawn for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pathetic. It&#8217;s just so pathetic.</p>
<p>There is no life more miserable than being born into a royal family and ending your life as a puppet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what will happen to the ones left behind&#8230;? It&#8217;s going to be really fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia spread out her iron fan and continued to laugh while her face was agitated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>11th February, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>The darkness was being lifted from the sky. The sun rose in the east, giving the world a kaleidoscopic glow of color.</p>
<p>The sky was a deep blue, with white clouds adding color, and the sky was filled with peaceful scenery.</p>
<p>On the ground, however, the atmosphere was bleak and desolate.</p>
<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― Larix Plains in the western region.</p>
<p>Among the many flags moving about, the one that stands out the most is the &#8220;Black Dragon&#8221; banner.</p>
<p>A vigorous shout roared out. It was so loud that it almost broke the air.</p>
<p>The soldiers raised their weapons high above their heads and offered words of honor to the sky in praise of the nation.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was directed at the enemy troops facing them. The main camp of the Six Kingdoms was set up not too far away.</p>
<p>In the center of the main camp of the Six Kingdoms, which was set up in a position that overlooked the battlefield, was a simple command center, where Lucia and the Urpeth siblings, as well as the heavyweights and bureaucrats of each country, had gathered.</p>
<p>There was a flashy bed in the higher part of the room, on which Lucia was lying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; their morale is quite high, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She grabbed an apple from a basket of fruit and bit into it.</p>
<p>The entrance to the tent was wide open, giving a good view of the battlefield.</p>
<p>A cold wind came in and brushed her hair. Her body, which had been heated up by the murderous intent of the enemy, was rapidly cooling down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, it seems that the entire army is ready for battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then give the order. Let them surround and annihilate the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had 180,000 troops on their side and 40,000 on the enemy&#8217;s side. The difference in strength is obvious. However, even though there are many of them, the people gathered in this place will not let their guard down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so quiet?&#8221;</p>
<p>The command center was filled with a strange silence. It was almost suffocating. No one foolishly thought that they could win the battle easily. It was the tension of the possibility of losing that created the strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>The enemy was the Great Grantz Empire, which had reigned as the ruler of the central continent for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commander is the fourth prince, the descendant of the mythical &#8220;God of War&#8221; who had left behind many legends.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, none of the people present had ever seen him before.</p>
<p>Those who live in the distant Krim region have only heard of his wisdom through hearsay.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have never been so afraid of forty thousand men.&#8221;</p>
<p>A member of the staff muttered nervously. Everyone nodded gravely as if to say they agreed.</p>
<p>Lucia wondered if she should threaten him with pity but decided that there was no point, as it would only make him shrivel up further. And she could not help but feel uneasy. She was not sure whether her plan would succeed or not.</p>
<p>(&#8230;The House of Mark has been completely destroyed.)</p>
<p>There was no communication from Orléans, who had been linked with her secretly. It is safe to assume that the fourth prince has found out about the plot.</p>
<p>(But well&#8230; I still have a hand to play.)</p>
<p>At the very least, they succeeded in dragging the fourth prince to this point, which is something she should be happy about.</p>
<p>Lucia looked at the bundle of letters on her bedside table.</p>
<p>When she was about to take one of them, a horn blew loudly.</p>
<p>Lucia squinted her eyes and listened carefully, trying not to forget the sound. It was the overture to a battle that would be remembered for generations to come.</p>
<p>The command center became a little noisier. The tense atmosphere from earlier had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first group is moving ― the first and second cavalry corps have moved first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing the report of the staff officer looking at the battlefield, the aides hurriedly placed the pieces on the map.</p>
<p>The first line of the Six Kingdoms has taken a dragon wing stance. It is the most suitable formation for encircling the enemy.</p>
<p>Their first cavalry corps is 20,000, and the second cavalry corps is also 20,000.</p>
<p>And the first infantry corps, which occupies the center, is made up of 30,000 highly trained soldiers.</p>
<p>The total for the first group was 70,000. This alone was more than the 40,000 soldiers of the Grantz Army.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the enemy&#8217;s formation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is also&#8230; a formation that is difficult to react to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; a common formation with a bunch of people who can&#8217;t even coordinate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia was impressed, but inwardly she could not hide her surprise at the enemy&#8217;s daring, even reckless, leadership. It is a strange formation in which the troops are arranged diagonally.</p>
<p>It was named &#8220;Ryuko-jin&#8221; because it resembles a dragon swimming in the sky, and it can transform into dragon wings and dragon scales. However, it is a formation where coordination is most important, and no one likes to use it with a hodgepodge of troops. It has the feature that all the troops can fight immediately, but because of this, it is not suitable for enduring battles, and it was even reckless in the face of such a large army.</p>
<p>In other words, the fact that they were using it meant that they were most likely planning something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope for the first group first. We&#8217;ll know soon enough what they&#8217;re up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia narrowed her eyes and looked to the front lines.</p>
<p>The first and second cavalry corps are about to bite into both wings of the enemy army.</p>
<p>A fierce sound rang out. The rumbling of the ground reached the main camp. Screams could be heard, and shouts of anger were launched.</p>
<p>Swords overlap, sparks fly, and to demonstrate their strength, they cut off the heads of their opponents.</p>
<p>Blood smoke rises violently as the five organs are scattered.</p>
<p>Over time, tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of lives will be scattered across this ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia thought it was a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>It is in these life-and-death battles that the inner workings of human nature come to life.</p>
<p>This is the moment when the ugly and the beautiful are all brought out without hiding.</p>
<p>There is no mercy. There is no malice. There is only a pure heart ― the desire to live.</p>
<p>They crush each other with it. In order to live, they pluck the lives of their opponents with their childish hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can say nothing about it&#8230; Fufufu, it&#8217;s a privilege allowed to humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia looked ecstatic and licked the edge of her mouth, which was covered with apple juice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when will they do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The more time passes, the more conspicuous the inferiority of the Grantz Army becomes.</p>
<p>But the enemy is also desperate. They&#8217;re trying their best not to die, and they&#8217;re putting up a desperate resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second group of fifty thousand has begun to move. I&#8217;m afraid this will be the end of the Grantz Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way&#8230; are you planning to annihilate them like this ― no, that&#8217;s not possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia picked up one of the letters that lay on her bedside table. It was a letter from a different informant than the head of the House of Mark, Orléans.</p>
<p>It was written that the fourth prince Hiro was thinking of a raid operation.</p>
<p>(Hmm&#8230; could it be that he too has been exposed as an informant?)</p>
<p>Lucia crushed the letter in her hand and stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seleucus, how is the reconnaissance going?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the call of his name, the handsome assistant approached with a grin and a frivolous smile, as usual. It was indeed annoying under the circumstances, and Lucia glared at Seleucus, making no attempt to hide her annoyance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Lucia, your gaze is frightening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an emergency. I&#8217;ll pretend I didn&#8217;t hear you say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Your Majesty. So, the reconnaissance was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what&#8217;s the situation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the reconnaissance unit&#8230; there were no suspicious shadows around. But we&#8217;re not familiar with the geography of the western regions, so we think there are a few places to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia put her hand on her chin and stepped out of the tent. The main camp is built in a high position, so it is easy to see the state of the battlefield.</p>
<p>There was nothing that seemed like a plot by the Grantz Army, and there were no traps to speak of. They just continued to fight like savages on the spot and suffered many casualties.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third group of 30,000 should be sent out to thin out the enemy lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you still not satisfied with just winning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus spoke to her. Lucia turned around, anger rising in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you speak like that after serving me for so many years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus retreated, holding on to his smile in response to the unhuman-like form of rage he had just seen.</p>
<p>A wild wind swirled around Lucia, gouging the ground as if to express her anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize for my mistake&#8230; Please forgive me. And I believe that the descendant of the God of War will be appearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus said slowly, choosing his words carefully as if his life was in danger. Lucia&#8217;s eyes widened, and for the first time, she realized that he was mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you certain that the Ancient King will attack here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus&#8217;s smile faltered at this statement, and his eyes darted around in a dazed expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is it that angers you, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too responsive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ignoring the absent-minded reply, Lucia pointed her hand at the battlefield.</p>
<p>Her fingertips pointed towards the Grantz Army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they continue to fight? Who&#8217;s in charge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the descendant of the God of War, but he&#8217;s hiding in plain sight to raid the main camp, so by process of elimination, we followed him. ――Wait, who are the ones giving the orders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that strange? You can&#8217;t blame me for being angry, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The central nobility that followed the fourth prince Hiro in the Grantz Empire ― most of them are those who turned to the Six Kingdoms. But Lucia is convinced that they were exposed as informants and were executed by Hiro. If the central nobility were still alive and well, they would be raising the flag of the Six Kingdoms and slashing at their allies right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Isn&#8217;t it the western nobility?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense――&#8221;</p>
<p><i>That&#8217;s impossible</i> ― that word was lost in the screams that came from the battlefield.</p>
<p>When Lucia turned around to see what was going on, the people in the tent came running out with surprised expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>A strange scene was unfolding on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Several familiar flags were raised from the dying Grantz Army.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Anguis Serpent banner, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca, who had been standing next to Lucia for some time, said in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible. The central nobility who planned the betrayal must have died. No, even if they are still alive, they should have taken action earlier in the battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seleucus! What are the instructions for the first group commander?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we were prioritizing reorganization, we put off&#8230; rescinding the instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia had given strict orders not to attack if the central nobility turned. If it were faithfully carried out, they would be showing their backs to the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then immediately――&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia thought about sending a message to revoke the instruction, but that would have disrupted the chain of command. It was a very rudimentary mistake, and Lucia&#8217;s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We have no choice but to withdraw them temporarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victory is at hand, but if they persist, the damage to them will be enormous.</p>
<p>Lucia calmly made a decision and opened her mouth to give instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-stupid&#8230; What are they doing&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>However, what came out of Lucia&#8217;s mouth were completely different words.</p>
<p>Below her eyes, an unimaginable scene was unfolding.</p>
<p>Some troops began to charge into the backs of the first and second lines that were surrounding the Grantz Army. Everyone was speechless at this. It was definitely not the Grantz ambushers or reinforcements. It was definitely the Urpeth cavalry, one of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey! It&#8217;s not Urpeth. We didn&#8217;t make a separate force!&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who denied it was Eagle, the youngest member of the Urpeth royal family.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Is he going to come here and use the ploy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Things get confusing. It is hard to keep up with all the problems being thrown at them one after the other.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that is certain. If this continues, it will provoke another battle.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn&#8217;t the Urpeth cavalry, soldiers from the Ezell Kingdom are actually being attacked.</p>
<p>This is very troublesome ― the harmful effects of the allied forces will come to the surface.</p>
<p>Even though they have been cooperating with each other for many years, they are still just a mixture of different countries.</p>
<p>There are no family ties to be formed there. Nor will they be able to form bonds of friendship. A large army of 180,000 people, not all of whom knew each other.</p>
<p>If the Ezell soldiers fought back against the fake Urpeth cavalry under such circumstances, the Urpeth soldiers, mistakenly thinking that their allies were being attacked, would attack the Ezell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Order the army to retreat immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they were not careful, the situation could become irreversible. They did not expect that they would attack each other when it was not even dark yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the staff members ran to the flag bearer in a panic.</p>
<p>What to do next ― Lucia couldn&#8217;t get her thoughts together. The sensation of a blade being held to her throat kept coming back to haunt her. But if she didn&#8217;t regain her composure here, she would fail as a commander.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calm down&#8230; It&#8217;s only the first battle. There is still a chance to make up for the blunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia said to herself. She didn&#8217;t want to be humiliated like that again and to be laughed at by that <i>woman</i> if she exposed herself like this.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t want to cry out like a little child.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I will not be defeated again, no matter who it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at the battlefield with indignant eyes and struck her own cheek with her iron fan.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It is a trivial matter. If we can deal with it properly, we can solve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the enemy, to make them upset. The enemy&#8217;s plan was like a child&#8217;s trick. It was an event that could be resolved by calming her anger and assessing the situation.</p>
<p>However, Lucia had spent too much time trying to unify her mind. In addition, she has been so busy dealing with repeated problems that she has forgotten one important thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Wait, why did they come up with that plan after all this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as it became clear that the enemy was going to be defeated, why did they choose to wreak havoc on the battlefield by playing one trick after another?</p>
<p>Lucia looked around and noticed that everyone&#8217;s eyes were glued to the front lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this what you want? God of War!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then――</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――The world was covered in darkness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Screams can be heard. It is a pitiful voice that cannot hold back the pain and tearfully appeals to others.</p>
<p>Unable to avoid the torrential downpour, one by one, they plummet to the ground.</p>
<p>However, the momentum of the arrows that painted the sky black did not stop. The arrows pierced mercilessly and took their breath away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Focus on the command center. Do not miss the opportunity that the opponent has taken the trouble to come out of their walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Great Grantz Empire ― the fourth prince Hiro Schwartz von Grantz.</p>
<p>He has black hair and dark eyes that stand out on the battlefield ― a unique characteristic that only one person in the world possesses.</p>
<p>His gentle face is not adorned with the usual eye patch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuh, it&#8217;s a nice view. It&#8217;s a scene worthy of the end of the foolish people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s left eye had been released, giving off an eerie glow that gave people chills.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hard to get here. The security was pretty tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro straddled the swift dragon and smiled at the command center of the Six Kingdoms from the top of a small hill.</p>
<p>Last night, Hiro had decided to take 2,000 cavalrymen and go around the back of the enemy army. Hiro knew geography better than the enemy. However, he wanted to be sure to get behind them, so he appointed Lord Kyrthia, a western nobleman, as his guide and bypassed the battlefield. In other words, what he saw below him was the main camp of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;War requires elegance. Just one eye-catching tactic is enough for the historians of the future to praise it. They will beautify history on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone of the man&#8217;s voice was lighthearted, but there was a hint of joy in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the unnamed commander of the Six Kingdoms ― the one who will become my stepping stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro narrowed his eyes and began to search happily, but he could not find anyone who looked like the commander.</p>
<p>In the meantime, archers have been firing arrows over and over again.</p>
<p>As a result, the ground is now a hellscape of screaming and agonizing cries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Horns were blown from all over the place to announce the enemy&#8217;s attack. The brave sound echoed throughout the battlefield. The first and second lines of the enemy must have noticed.</p>
<p>Still, the order to retreat had not been given. They had no choice but to continue fighting.</p>
<p>Turning over, fighting each other, confusion in the main camp ― before they knew it, the situation had become irreversible.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a single decision is delayed, it can be fatal on the battlefield. The commander of the Six Kingdoms seems to be slow in making decisions on the spur of the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how Hiro intended it to be, but he wondered how the enemy would feel about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s get going; it&#8217;ll be troublesome if they fortify their defenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro drew his silver sword from his waist and released it. The soldiers behind him paid attention as the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; glowed in the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;All troops, mount up!&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldiers who had been firing their bows all lowered their arms and jumped into the saddles of the horses beside them.</p>
<p>Hiro, who sensed their presence at his back, held the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; horizontally.</p>
<p>The flag with the black dragon on it fluttered in the wind.</p>
<p>It is a magnificent flag that was once famous throughout the world as the &#8220;divine flag&#8221; of the &#8220;God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat up the fear in your own jaws, and bite down upon your enemies with fangs that boil with rage!&#8221;</p>
<p>They will bring the hammer down on the savages who trample their land.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the name of the &#8220;God of War,&#8221; all troops charge!&#8221;</p>
<p>As if pushed by the shout, Hiro kicked the belly of the swift dragon.</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing the group of cavalrymen galloping down the hill, Hiro saw the enemy archers readying themselves.</p>
<p>Hiro waved his &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; to the right and encouraged the entire army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid! Don&#8217;t be a coward! Put your heads down in front of your shields and keep moving!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of the wind breaking was heard in their ears. And then, just as Hiro thought, several soldiers fell off their horses behind him.</p>
<p>Hiro clicked his tongue and swatted away the oncoming arrows with one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in my way!&#8221;</p>
<p>After kicking the back of the swift dragon, Hiro landed in the middle of the enemy army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ko ― Goaahh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a single thrust, he crushes the enemy&#8217;s throat and uses the momentum of his pull to chop off the head of a nearby enemy soldier. He twisted his body to dodge the spear thrust by the enemy, and in an instant, kicked down the distance and thinned out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyii!&#8221;</p>
<p>After delivering a reverse shoulder slash to the enemy, who let out a small scream, he picked up the dropped spear and threw it at the enemy soldier who was about to fire an arrow. The spear continued to fly vigorously, shattering the skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s clear the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro leisurely announced, the cavalry that had finally caught up with him blew away the enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the wall of humans built by the enemy soldiers crumbled.</p>
<p>Horseshoes crushed screams, the tips of spears burst into cries, and a rain of blood poured into the sky.</p>
<p>Hiro steps over the corpses and begins to walk.</p>
<p>Without a single glance at the oncoming enemy, he cut them down with a single sword and walked like a king.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;There are more of them than I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if they had anticipated the attack, the enemy&#8217;s main camp has deployed their forces to the rear.</p>
<p>The cavalry was rampaging, but some of them began to be dragged down in front of the enemy soldiers, who appeared one after another. Still, without giving up, the Grantz soldiers are on their feet, determined to win.</p>
<p>With spears in their hands, swords in their hands, and shields raised, they continue to fight for their families. Until the end of their lives, they will never retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled weakly and said he was sorry for the scene.</p>
<p>Human desire knows no bounds. They take advantage of good intentions by painting them with bad intentions.</p>
<p>It is――,</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro waved the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; at the approaching enemy group. It was only a simple movement, but it posed an unbearable threat to the average person.</p>
<p>They could not scream, and they were not allowed to suffer. They are lured to death without even realizing it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What lies there is a mad dance of absolute death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blackness paints over everything in the world.</p>
<p>Life, death, and even light cannot assert themselves in the face of the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Endless despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone muttered in fright, but unfortunately, it was impossible to identify the person.</p>
<p>Because every single enemy soldier around Hiro was dead.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s glare was enough to cause everyone to take a step backward.</p>
<p>After releasing his supremacy as a check, Hiro put the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; on his shoulder and opened his mouth to the people around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldiers of the Grantz. Gather together, don&#8217;t scatter――!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shock that struck his back forced Hiro to close his mouth. As if a torrential downpour had fallen on him, his eardrums were violently shaken by the roar.</p>
<p>There was no pain. Thanks to the Black Princess Camellia, all threats have been removed.</p>
<p>However, the suddenness of the event did not erase the shock, and Hiro took a step forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; it was here, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not a single scratch on his body, but Hiro felt the pain and held his chest.</p>
<p>When he looked around&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to be betrayed by an ally, even if you already know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the enemy soldiers, those who were on his side were pointing their spears at him now.</p>
<p>The banner of the black dragon is thrown to the earth one after another, and the banner of the snake is dancing in the sky instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Hiro&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, but I need your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Receiving clear hostility, Hiro turned to the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, let me ask you what you mean by that ― Lord Kyrthia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Please forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear an apology. Explain what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro tried to approach Kyrthia with a deadly glint in his eye but was immediately attacked. The soldiers around him thrust their spears at Hiro.</p>
<p>Hiro swung his &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; and lightly flicked the tip of the spear, which was filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>With his left hand, he took the spear and severed the carotid artery of the enemy soldier in front of him. He thrusts the hilt at the enemy soldier behind him and cuts his throat. As he swung the spear around in the dust of war, several heads were flung away. When Hiro threw away the spear, the impact of the fall caused a spray of blood to bloom from the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up and wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro told them, holding his forefinger over his crescent-shaped mouth. It was a small gesture, but it made the soldiers&#8217; faces tense up, and they stopped moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, can you explain to me&#8230; Lord Kyrthia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps unable to endure the horror, Kyrthia dropped to his knees with a broken smile on his face, as if he had forgotten how to express his joy, anger, and sorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me! Please forgive me! Your Highness Hiro, please forgive me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m asking you why you did this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My people! They are being held hostage!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the face of a young man who is more than a year older than his son, the sight of a good old nobleman shedding tears, his eyes painted with shame, and his back arched is pitifully small.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s why you told me that Orléans was a traitor, to gain my trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;F-forgive me&#8230;! I have no reason to be ashamed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubbing his forehead on the ground, Kyrthia uttered an apology.</p>
<p>Looking down at his head with cold eyes, Hiro quietly turned his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it, actually. I know you&#8217;ve been connected to the Six Kingdoms since the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh? You knew that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Protecting the people? Don&#8217;t lie to me. You&#8217;re just trying to save your own life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro turned around with great vigor and flashed the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>A large amount of blood was sprayed into the sky from the base of Kyrthia&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..I&#8217;m done with you. The only reason I kept you alive was to create this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro takes a glance at the rolling head with a frozen expression. He then looked up vaguely, with the sound of the world crumbling behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Hiro! Please run away! At least you alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldiers who hadn&#8217;t been turned over tried to break through the encirclement to let Hiro escape.</p>
<p>However, some were stabbed in the back, some were pierced in the chest, some had their arms cut off, and one after another died a cruel death.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were raised by the Grantz, were you not? I will not forgive you, traitor! I will not forgive you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood-curdling cries of the soldiers that resembled curses did not reach them. One after another, spears were thrust out to scatter their lives. But they still wielded their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit King, bring death to the traitors! Glory to the Grantz!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason they decided on this betrayal was for their own protection. If they showed any hesitation, they would be killed immediately.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why everyone closes their hearts and kills the friends they had yesterday.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking cries echoed in the surroundings.</p>
<p>The screams of those who were betrayed by their allies echoed ceaselessly.</p>
<p>Hiro smiled a self-mocking smile, but his face instantly twisted into a grim expression.</p>
<p>It was because he heard the angry voice of a creature that had no place on a battlefield.</p>
<p>When he looked around, he saw the swift dragon surrounded by a large number of soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tch, it&#8217;s so stubborn. Let&#8217;s kill it now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Many spears pierced the dragon&#8217;s scales and tore into it. A scream of grief was launched into the sky.</p>
<p>One after another, the soldiers surrounding it were kicking and tossing it around.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rare to see a swift dragon. Their skins sell for a lot of money, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>However, no matter how violent or unreasonable the attacks, the swift dragon boldly stood up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, we&#8217;d better use it ourselves. Even so, I don&#8217;t know why it would blend into a battlefield like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not let it escape. Be sure to choke it out. We have to take care of this pest.&#8221;</p>
<p>They certainly had a point.</p>
<p>But even so, they are humans, and there are always limits to what they can do.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s too much trash in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro kicked at the ground with such anger that it made his head boil.</p>
<p>Dark and stagnant supremacy rises from his whole body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; don&#8217;t mess with my familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>After cutting off the head of the soldier who was grabbing the head of the swift dragon with a single swing, Hiro immediately attacked the enemy soldiers surrounding it. No one who hurt the swift dragon was left behind, and those who cursed the swift dragon were mercilessly decapitated, and then, as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, the other enemy soldiers around the swift dragon were also decapitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro approached the swift dragon, which was looking at the bloody world in a daze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was late to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gently stroked the swift dragon&#8217;s neck and rubbed its head against his chest.</p>
<p>Hiro smiled at its loyalty to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s all right. Now, you should just run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>After gently stroking its neck, Hiro left it regretfully. At that time, he picked up the banner on the side of the swift dragon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your legs will get you off the battlefield.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled and took out a letter from his pocket and placed it on the saddle on the back of the swift dragon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to deliver it to Liz.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a cute squeal, the swift dragon tilted its head.</p>
<p>There was a strong feeling in its eyes that it was going to be with him forever, that it was going to follow him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro put his hand on the swift dragon&#8217;s neck and pulled its head back, resting his forehead on it and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be coming after you&#8230; can you wait for me under Liz?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said with a gentle voice and a youthful smile that suited his age.</p>
<p>As soon as Hiro left the swift dragon, it heeded his wish and began to run. However, in the middle of the run, the swift dragon stopped, looked back, and let out a small cry.</p>
<p>Hiro smiled and waved his hand, a sad sound like a lifelong farewell.</p>
<p>Only a few people could stop a swift dragon that started running at an incredible speed. If it were only to escape without a fight, it would be able to get out of the battlefield safely.</p>
<p>Witnessing this beautiful scene, the enemy soldiers forgot even to attack and stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for waiting for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro held up his &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; and stabbed the &#8220;Black Dragon Banner&#8221; into the ground.</p>
<p>The sight of a dragon swimming through the sky on the wind is a sight to behold.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a flag, but the enemy soldiers retreated as if pressured by it.</p>
<p>When Hiro looked around, there were only enemy soldiers ― including former allies ― left.</p>
<p>But when he listened carefully, he could hear the sound of sword fights. It was being created by the soldiers who were still resisting somewhere. Every time Hiro took a breath, the sound would fade into thin air.</p>
<p>Hiro let out a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s begin; this is what you wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snaps his fingers with a show of flair.</p>
<p>The surrounding space begins to distort. It cracks, emitting a dazzling light.</p>
<p>It was a privilege reserved for those who possessed the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great number of spirit weapons filled the space, and tens of millions of stars were born on the ground. Even though it is daytime, the starry sky created on the ground shines as bright as the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounded like a death sentence, and everyone&#8217;s face was filled with fear.</p>
<p>If he had been an ordinary young man, the soldiers would have laughed it off. But the young man standing in front of them, radiating a strange atmosphere, was no ordinary person.</p>
<p>He exercises a power equal to that of a God and shows glimpses of cruelty similar to that of a devil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, don&#8217;t make any unnecessary moves. You don&#8217;t want to die in pain, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――The young man&#8217;s figure disappears.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>At that moment, the battlefield fell silent, as if the sound had disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>As if they forgot even to breathe, the soldiers looked at only the &#8220;Black Dragon Crest Flag&#8221; in a daze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh ― hey, what&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The beginning was abrupt.</p>
<p>One soldier collapsed without any notice as if his back was shattered. Two soldiers fell, five fell, six fell, ten fell, eleven fell, twenty fell. It all happened in the blink of an eye, and yet the number of casualties was visibly increasing. Without understanding, the soldiers were dragged into the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyii, hyiiaaaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The panic and the mental breakdown of the soldiers were simultaneous.</p>
<p>Everyone threw down their weapons and ran for their lives. They were unaware of where to run.</p>
<p>One after another, the soldiers of the Six Kingdoms fell to the ground while they were lost.</p>
<p>Soldiers who had prayed to the Gods with their backs to the ground had their throats ripped out. Those who turned their backs and fled were mercilessly pierced through the heart. Those who dared to stand up to it were mercilessly beheaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Black Raven. The one who heralds the end will appear.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the silvery glow passed over the necks of the Six Kingdoms soldiers, fresh blood spurted from their necks.</p>
<p>One, three, eight, fourteen spirit weapons floating in space disappear at an alarming rate. Only the sound of the air being cut through propagated in the battlefield where the one-sided slaughter occurred.</p>
<p>The white flashes cut through the screaming soldiers, drowning out even their moans.</p>
<p>The fierce slashes did not stop but accelerated further.</p>
<p>It was a &#8220;privilege&#8221; and a &#8220;divine speed&#8221; allowed to those who possessed the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――Divine flash of lightning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The heavens fall, and the world turns silvery white.</p>
<p>Everything in sight was dyed white with a light intensity that burned out the eyeballs.</p>
<p>Eventually, when the ground was filled with corpses, no one left could speak in vain. The ground was blackened by the blood of the dead as if a cloud had covered the sun.</p>
<p>In the midst of this hellish situation, swimming gracefully in the center of it is the &#8220;Black Dragon&#8217;s Banner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I guess this is it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stopped quietly under the flag, which was surrounded by dead bodies. However, the enemy soldiers who were watching Hiro from afar closed the distance with their weapons at the ready.</p>
<p>Their eyes were filled with blatant fear. But even so, none of them are running away, as if they are trying their best to keep their spirits up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very impressive; I&#8217;ll give you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the two staring at each other, a bright sound of voice poured out of place.</p>
<p>The crowd of soldiers that filled Hiro&#8217;s eyes split in two like a wave breaking.</p>
<p>A woman walked from the center of the crowd, clapping her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonderful man, not even hiding your power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her skin is as smooth and white as glass. Her eyes, as clear as amber, have the coldness of red copper in them, and her long, slit eyes give the impression of sharp blades. Still, this does not diminish her charm, and her fine features with an interesting character will make anyone who sees her sigh in admiration. However, what makes her appearance stand out is the fact that she is wearing an eccentric and flashy kimono that is not appropriate for the horrific battlefield.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a look that would normally be considered insane. She was not wearing armor, which is a way to protect herself from threats such as arrows and swords. Her body was so thin that it would likely break if struck, and a normal person would mistake her for a noblewoman who had wandered into a battlefield.</p>
<p>(It means that she possesses some kind of power&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro let out a sigh of relief that he had finally met someone he really desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Lucia Levia de Anguis.&#8221;</p>
<p>She proudly announced her name and pointed her iron fan at Hiro.</p>
<p>She then smiled a bewitching smile, like a snake seducing a human.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be Hiro&#8230; the descendant of the &#8220;God of War,&#8221; right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;majestic&#8221; suits her well. Even in the face of Hiro&#8217;s supremacy, she didn&#8217;t choke on her words but rather looked calm and smiled fearlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah ― I&#8217;m Hiro Schwartz von Grantz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to meet you&#8230; I really, really wanted to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moistened her lips with her tongue and smiled lustfully, her face as sinister as a snake that has found its prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that. Coincidentally, I&#8217;ve been wanting to meet you, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel a twinge of dread. Your deadly eyes make me want to cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hugged her body happily, her cheeks flushed, and Lucia breathed hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a woman as beautiful as you staring at me, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to move either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it like a snake and frog? You don&#8217;t seem like the kind of guy who would do something that encouraging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their words were strangely empty, and their gazes crossed in an eerie, gut-wrenching way.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, you cut down Lord Kyrthia&#8217;s son without hesitation, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Whatever the reason. I won&#8217;t let anyone who commits betrayal to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. The report said you were ruthless, and that&#8217;s exactly what you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to his claims, he put his people first, not his family. I would have let him live, but I could see in his eyes that he was lying.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had the eyes of a man on the verge of self-preservation. He never acted with the people&#8217;s best interest in mind. There is no reason to keep such a man alive, and if considering the future, it would be better for the world if he were beheaded there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite all your pretty words, what you&#8217;re doing is relentless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any regrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a graceful man. I don&#8217;t hate men who make quick decisions like that, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia threw a licking glance at Hiro as if she was judging him. Hiro felt a chill run down his spine, and Lucia seemed to have noticed this and cleared her throat happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the Master?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro shook his shoulders.</p>
<p>How could he forget? He was one of the people who had been good to him a thousand years ago. He was like a grandfather to Hiro, who had just been summoned to this world and had taught him many things.</p>
<p>Above all, the &#8220;Master&#8221; is one of the &#8220;Five Generals of the Black Sky.&#8221; Even if he wanted to forget, there was no way he could.</p>
<p>Hiro frowned at the strange question. Lucia saw his reaction and laughed in amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, only a few people who know the &#8220;God of War&#8217;s&#8221;&#8230; old Master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was at a loss to reply to the unexpected words that were thrown at him.</p>
<p>It was unknown what Lucia thought of Hiro&#8217;s attitude, but she held out her hand with a calm expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must know about this, don&#8217;t you? You know the truth behind the founding of the Six Kingdoms. I believe that you are on our side, as you should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I say no?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your head. I feel bad for my ancestors, but I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered immediately. There was not a hint of hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is no choice but to fight. I will never abandon the Grantz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled sadly and held up the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to respect his intentions, Lucia also replied in a sincere voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I apologize for asking such a trivial question. I hope you will forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her eyes down, as if ashamed of herself, and spread her iron fan to cover her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s no need for further questions and answers, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are right. Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me your last effort against thirty thousand. Then, you may disperse in splendor as the God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Lucia pointed her iron fan at Hiro with great force, two figures jumped out from behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Queen Lucia! It&#8217;s not too late to call us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eagle, I&#8217;ll be sure to crush your tongue. I&#8217;ll make your impudent mouth shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh&#8230; What is this, so suddenly.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a strange pair of men and women who jumped on Hiro.</p>
<p>Hiro instantly judged that they were skilled, and from the start, he did his best to intercept them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha, you little shit! You won&#8217;t be able to withstand my attack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so noisy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; that was raised above his head caught the man&#8217;s weapon, and a powerful force was transmitted to him.</p>
<p>The ground could not withstand it, and it caved in violently as if it had been crushed.</p>
<p>Hiro leaped backward to gain distance as a cloud of dust rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ara, too bad it&#8217;s a dead end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing a voice behind him, Hiro switched the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; from his right hand to his left through his back.</p>
<p>He then held it vertically and defended himself with his right hand on the blade, barely blocking the oncoming attack.</p>
<p>However, he could not kill the impact, and Hiro rolled on the ground.</p>
<p>The two men and women in front of Hiro, who stood up instantly, were leisurely holding their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luca Mamon de Urpeth. Please make your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although she politely bent down to greet him, he could see that she was somewhat scandalous and had an insidious personality.</p>
<p>In addition, despite her slender body, the weapon she used was a large hammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eagle de Urpeth. That is the name of the one who will kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had short hair and a neat face. However, his unconcealed arrogance gives him a sense of intimidation. On his shoulder was a three-section club that emitted strange particles.</p>
<p>However, what is clear is that both of them are clad in the supreme energy that only the strongest of warriors have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiro Schwartz von Grantz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro kicked the earth and started running.</p>
<p>First of all, he waved the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; lightly to measure the strength of his opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, you&#8217;re too slow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Three-section club wriggled like a living creature, clacking its joints and flicking back the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A large hammer flies from the side, roaring the air. Hiro rolled up the dust with his foot, ensured that the hammer&#8217;s trajectory had deviated, and thrust the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; into the dust with great force.</p>
<p>A dull sensation came back to him, indicating that his opponent blocked him. Hiro twisted his body around his right leg on the spot and slammed his left heel into Eagle&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aghh!&#8221;</p>
<p>After glancing at Eagle as he rolled on the ground, he stepped forward and unleashed a palm strike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ughh!&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw it at Luca&#8217;s jaw, causing her to back away as she stomped her foot bellows.</p>
<p>He struck it with the intention of breaking her jaw, but her physical structure was sturdier than he thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that the World&#8217;s Five Greatest Treasured Swords?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro doesn&#8217;t remember what weapons the two of them are carrying, but if they can keep up with Hiro&#8217;s attacks, they must be the World&#8217;s Five Greatest Treasured Swords, which are the same as the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor.&#8221; If they were a pure demon race like Ghada, they would not be limited to that, but if they were from the Six Kingdoms, they would most likely be the equivalent of a human race with their mixed blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well. As you said, this is the Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords ― the Vajra Mallet. By the way, the three-section club that Eagle has is also the same and is called the &#8220;Holy Destroyer Club.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[T/n: I don&#8217;t know why they called these weapons as swords when one is a mallet and the other is a club, but I may be mistaken the name for these too :D]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the five treasured swords that were refined when the &#8220;Human Race&#8221; and the &#8220;Long-Ear Race&#8221; were in a cooperative relationship.</p>
<p>However, they were created not by the Spirit King but by the Fairy King.</p>
<p>The spirits of those who have been converted into fairies are contained in the holy principle swords, and just like the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords, they have a will of their own. Compared to the other five treasured swords in the world, there are no restrictions on the owner&#8217;s choice, and if they like the sword, it will appear in their dreams and give them the weapon with immense power.</p>
<p>(I guess I should have asked for more details.)</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, Hiro had only met the holder of the Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords ― the one chosen by the Pure Phantom Mist. In those days, the holders of the World&#8217;s Five Greatest Treasured Swords would have been dispatched to various parts of the world to stop the &#8220;Demon Race&#8221; invasion. By the end of the war, the Human Race and the Long-Ear Race became enemies and never made contact again.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, your weapon is also the World&#8217;s Five Greatest Treasures Sword?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca tilted her head and asked. Eagle looked at the Black Princess Camellia, but he didn&#8217;t need to ask; he just glared at Hiro.</p>
<p>Hiro decided that there was no need to hide anymore. His time for deceiving people was over.</p>
<p>No ― he had to let them know for the sake of his future plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords, the Heavenly Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;――Really&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who was surprised was the person behind the Urpeth siblings, Lucia.</p>
<p>She covered her mouth with her hand as if ashamed of herself for trembling with astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say that no matter how many enemies you slaughter, your sword will never be stained with blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>A beautiful, shining silver sword is a sign of a hero.</p>
<p>This is the royal sword that saved a country from destruction and conquered the surrounding countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The undefeated sword that swung by the twin black king who controls heaven, earth, and people, and will surely bring victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legendary sword was buried in the long history of the world and is now called the lost sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufufu, I knew it was suspicious, but&#8230; this gives me the confidence to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro could see Lucia giving Eagle a look.</p>
<p>Before he could find out what she was planning, Luca was approaching right in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see that power! The power that the hero king used!&#8221;</p>
<p>The large mallet ― Vajra ― comes at him with a roar of the wind. Hiro repelled it but felt a strange sensation in his hand. But before he could be sure, Eagle rushed at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, it will be hard when there are two people who possess the Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords against you, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The three-section club moved erratically and caught Hiro in the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I can see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He avoided the attack and drove his fist into Eagle&#8217;s nose. He rolled around on the ground several times and was blown away but stopped forcibly by flexing his arms and standing up.</p>
<p>For some reason, his expression was tinged with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you only use your fists from the beginning? Get serious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just playing, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air froze when he said it clearly, and Hiro tilted his head, shaking his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a question for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I use all my strength to kill just one ant?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blankness, silence, stillness, closure. There was an inexpressible silence that coiled between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, Hyaa!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle&#8217;s face turned creepy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hihihahahahaha! You bastard!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a simple matter of killing. Eagle&#8217;s clear intent to kill exploded.</p>
<p>In contrast, Hiro narrowed his eyes calmly and then smiled provocatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, your words are terribly difficult to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The distance between the two was reduced in an instant, and Eagle came right up to Hiro&#8217;s nose. He bent down to avoid a blow aimed at the back of his head. Eagle, who deliberately lost his stance, swung his toe toward Hiro&#8217;s left eye with great force while his hand held down the left knee that was immediately thrown at his face.</p>
<p>Hiro slammed his fist into the ground, forcing his body to twist. In a brief moment of successful evasion, he saw Luca swing her Vajra down from the edge of his vision.</p>
<p>Hiro tried to kick Luca&#8217;s ankle, but the Black Princess Camellia took a defensive reaction before he could. This turned Hiro&#8217;s attention to Eagle only. At the same time, &#8220;Vajra&#8221; and &#8220;Black Princess Camellia&#8221; clashed violently.</p>
<p>A large amount of dust flew up due to the violent shocks caused by the battle between the three.</p>
<p>The sound of fierce sword fights rang out, and sparks bloomed and then scattered. This was repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>At the end of the fierce battle, two shadows emerged from the dust.</p>
<p>They were Luca and Eagle. Both of them had scratches all over their bodies, and they were breathing on their shoulders, staring at the beast lurking in the dust.</p>
<p>Eventually, when the dust cloud is blown away by the wind, Hiro appears, standing unharmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; Are you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled, though he was breathing a little harder.</p>
<p>The Urpeth siblings purse their lips in frustration as the overwhelming martial prowess is shown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the two of us&#8230; you monster&#8230; are you really a human?&#8221;</p>
<p>To Hiro, who could not get even a single attack hit him, Luca&#8217;s eyes fluttered as if he could not hide her surprise.</p>
<p>Whenever he hunted down an enemy&#8230; he would always get the same line.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s really annoyed with it, and he let out a sigh of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Of course, I&#8217;m just a slightly more sturdy person.&#8221;</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, he set it upon himself that he should work harder than anyone else. There were people he wanted to protect, so he spent all his time training, even to the point of death. He struggled to become stronger and gain more power.</p>
<p>The fact that he obtained the Black Princess Camellia and the Dark Emperor was part of that process, not because he used foul techniques. It&#8217;s the result of trying to be stronger than everyone else that connects to what he is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I always failed to make it in time. I always lose something important.&#8221;</p>
<p>While muttering in an indifferent tone of voice, Hiro smiled miserably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; tell me, when will my heart be full?&#8221;</p>
<p>They knew that Hiro was not looking for an answer.</p>
<p>However, they were confused by the sudden question, and more importantly, the Urpeth siblings were completely delayed in their initial response to the sudden change in atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hiro, clad in madness and with the agility of a beast, attacked the Urpeth siblings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buh!&#8221;</p>
<p>A strong blow to the cheek and blood spewed from Eagle&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>As his white teeth bounce off the ground, Luca tries to fight back, but a fierce kick hits her in the abdomen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh~~~!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca held her stomach and tried to kneel on the ground. But Hiro&#8217;s clutch on her chest pulled her to him and slammed her back down to the ground without pausing for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gahah!&#8221;</p>
<p>With his left hand on her thin neck, Hiro dexterously rotated the hilt of the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; in his right hand and swung it backward with great force into Luca&#8217;s chest. However, the blade bounced off the ground in the middle of the swing, and the trajectory deviated so that the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; was thrust into the ground, only giving a small cut on Luca&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<p>The one that interferes is the three-section club that extends from the side ― the Holy Destroyer Club.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you touch my sister!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro kicked the ground and jumped backward, putting all the strength in his legs. The Urpeth siblings are also more cautious now that they are outmatched and move away from him to start over.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;You have no one on your side. How long are you going to fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle said as he wiped away the blood dripping from the edge of his mouth. Next to him, Luca is catching her breath and only gives Hiro a resentful glare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around but could not see any of his allies.</p>
<p>All that surrounded Hiro were enemy soldiers with spears, swords, and bows at the ready. Even the soldiers on his side, who were desperately resisting, had been defeated or had lost their vigour. In the first place, due to the betrayal of the western nobleman Kyrthia, it is as if there were no allies from the beginning.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be wrong if I gave up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a desperate situation, a normal person would have given up and prepared for death. However, Hiro was not equipped with the soft feeling of being frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you being so relaxed&#8230;? Do you think you have a way to escape from this deadly place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle was unhappy with Hiro&#8217;s attitude; he didn&#8217;t even try to hide his annoyance and distorted his eyes.</p>
<p>Victory or defeat has been decided. There was no power left in the Grantz Army that could reverse this situation.</p>
<p>Even so, even in a situation where he is under siege from all sides, Hiro&#8217;s calm and composed stance makes him unable to shake off his anxiety, and Eagle&#8217;s sharp eyes were shaken with agitation.</p>
<p>(A little more&#8230; I think I need to show a few more gaps.)</p>
<p>Hiro loosened his collar and let out a breath. He had been purposely provocative in order to prevent people from realizing his purpose, but he was now in the finishing stages.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a problem if I just want to escape. I alone should be enough, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro took a step backward and glanced behind him to check the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you escape!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle rushed in with a blue vein on his forehead.</p>
<p>Hiro provoked him repeatedly, and if he showed an intent to escape, Eagle would launch a desperate attack.</p>
<p>Hiro looked at his left hand as he accepted the heavy blow that resonated in his guts.</p>
<p>――A blue crystalline stone.</p>
<p>The crystal, which bathes in sunlight and spills blue skylight, is a mass of principle power.</p>
<p>It is also known as a principle stone, and it contains the miraculous power that is characteristic of the Long-Ear Race.</p>
<p>If the magic stones that the Demon Race carried on their bodies are the power of domination, the principle stones that the Long-Ear Race carried on their bodies are the power of healing. In fact, the small wounds on Eagle&#8217;s body have already been healed.</p>
<p>However, he does not have the pure bloodline of the Long-Ear Race. However, since the Krim region where the Six Kingdoms are located was originally home to many Long-Ear Race, their blood must have flowed deeply in Eagle&#8217;s veins. This was also true of his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eagle, I have kept you waiting. Let&#8217;s crush this guy right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro dealt with Eagle&#8217;s attack, Luca jumped when there was a gap between them, swinging her big hammer. There was no scar on her but beautiful white skin that radiated luster.</p>
<p>A violent quake ― the Vajra shattered the ground.</p>
<p>A cloud of dust obscures her figure as she is caught up in a violent gust of wind, but it is clear that Luca has healed her wounds with the principle stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. That is as expected of the holder of the Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords. It wouldn&#8217;t be fun if you died easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been so noisy for a while now ― can you just shut up, you little shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle couldn&#8217;t even give him a single blow. Not even a single blow landed. So it&#8217;s no wonder he&#8217;s so frustrated.</p>
<p>(Now, let&#8217;s get to work.)</p>
<p>Hiro shook off the dust with one hand, dived into Eagle&#8217;s chest, and held the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; at the underside.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a distance that will certainly reap a life, and when he showed an opening, Eagle&#8217;s face twisted pathetically.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t want to die, and his expression was like he wanted to say something, and he looked at his sister as if he was about to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait――!&#8221;</p>
<p>When he heard Luca&#8217;s stopping voice&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A small, light sound is heard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, ah, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle made a dumbfounded sound.</p>
<p>He must have noticed the lack of pain ― the chain around his neck. He put his hand on his slightly reddened forehead, keeping his eyes open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really prepared to die?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said with a heartfelt joy in his voice. His left hand was making a gesture of curling his middle finger inwards.</p>
<p>Even though he could have certainly killed him, Hiro only struck a blow with his finger on Eagle&#8217;s forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230; what is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiles provocatively and arrogantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;――I&#8217;m just playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hihi―&#8230; hihihahahahaha!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle&#8217;s voice twitched, and he opened his eyes. The unbearable shame completely broke his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle&#8217;s principle stone was swollen with rage and shone with a flash of dazzling brilliance in response.</p>
<p>Hiro narrowed his eyes and watched the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>A considerable amount of power that could make the atmosphere swirl was about to overflow from the principle stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister! Please take care of the rest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle shouted and turned his gaze to Lucia, who was standing still.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not break your word!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as he said that, he recklessly charged at Hiro.</p>
<p>The three-section club drew an irregular trajectory and aimed at Hiro&#8217;s head. Hiro twisted his head to avoid the first blow and blocked the second blow with the hilt of the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor,&#8221; but the momentum of the impact caused the chain of the connecting part to wrap around his arm. His right arm was bound as if it were caught in a vise, and Hiro was pulled with tremendous force.</p>
<p>At that moment, Hiro let go of the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; from his right hand, handed it to his left hand, and thrust the tip of his sword vigorously toward Eagle. However, the blade aimed at his neck only ended up slicing through the skin of his left cheek. As he dodged, a look of joy appeared on Eagle&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>At the same time, a hidden blade shaped like a sickle comes out of the club he&#8217;s clutching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got you, you little shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>He kicked up the ground and unleashed a strike with all his might.</p>
<p>Hiro clicks his tongue. His right arm is restrained, and he can&#8217;t get any distance. If there was no time to avoid it, it was only natural that the Black Princess Camellia would react to her Lord&#8217;s crisis, and just as the blade was about to pierce his neck, the black robe entangled and stopped it. It only took a moment, but Eagle stopped moving in shock.</p>
<p>A really short blink of an eye ― but it&#8217;s a deadly moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t let an opening go by.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no way that Hiro would let such an opening go by, and the &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8217;s&#8221; blade mercilessly pierced through Eagle.</p>
<p>Eagles&#8217; left arm flew up into the air, staining the sky red.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a devilish look on his face, Eagle pulled Hiro in with only the strength of his right arm and head-butted him.</p>
<p>The collision between their foreheads caused Hiro&#8217;s vision to waver.</p>
<p>However, Hiro wasn&#8217;t going to be beaten silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bufuh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; was pierced deeply into Eagle&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little shiiiitt!&#8221;</p>
<p>The intense pain contorted his face, but he fought back with the expression of a young man. The blade that pierced his own side was of no concern to him. With his undiminished strength, the three-section club caught Hiro in the face. Hiro didn&#8217;t even show any sign of avoiding it and left his partner, the Black Princess Camellia, to defend him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it. I knew that the Black Princess Camellia would get in the way!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was as if he had been waiting for the Black Princess Camellia to make a move, and he opened his mouth wide with a glint in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me back my left arm!&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw away the &#8220;Holy Destroyer Club&#8221; and hit Hiro, who fell to the ground and got on his stomach. At the same time, his left arm came swinging from the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to you. Eat this!&#8221;</p>
<p>With his left arm still bleeding profusely from the cut surface, Eagle slammed it into the Black Princess Camellia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――It was then that something strange happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Black Princess Camellia stopped moving, and the black robe flowed down to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like the lore was true, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle&#8217;s fist slammed into Hiro&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, if it&#8217;s made of &#8220;that,&#8221; as the lore says, it can be sealed with a principle stone!&#8221;</p>
<p>His right fist swung down again and again. Hiro accepted the impact while still in the &#8220;大&#8221; position.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll torture you to death like this! I&#8217;ll clear up the humiliation――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagle suddenly stops moving. His body stiffened like a frog stared at by a snake.</p>
<p>The moment he swung his fist down, he &#8220;saw&#8221; it.</p>
<p>He can see the evil smile and the eyes of the abyss that swallow up everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the extent of it, huh? Disappointing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;――Nnhh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>A single blow, a fist filled with unusual power, was released by Hiro.</p>
<p>Eagle&#8217;s huge, well-trained body flew through the air, but he twisted his body dexterously to adjust his stance and landed cleanly. However, he immediately collapsed to the side, agitated by the wind.</p>
<p>It was no wonder. It was strange how he was able to stay conscious.</p>
<p>A large amount of blood was gushing out from his left shoulder due to the loss of his arm, and fresh blood was pouring out of his side at an unstoppable rate. Even so, he was determined to keep fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eagle, you need to rest. I&#8217;ll take care of the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Vajra,&#8221; a large hammer disproportionate to Luca&#8217;s slender form, was slammed into the ground. And then, lifting the huge weapon lightly, Luca kicked down the distance in an instant. Hiro stepped forward to take evasive action, but</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Can you hold it down this far?&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t move. No, he could not move.</p>
<p>There was no response from the Black Princess Camellia. She was completely silent. The next thing that happened was that a fierce blow pierced through Hiro&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro couldn&#8217;t even kill the impact and was slammed into the ground. He tried to stand up immediately, but his body was as heavy as steel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Black Princess Camellia has taken in my beloved brother&#8217;s principle stone. If you don&#8217;t break your vow with the Black Princess Camellia, it will affect you, the contractor, as well. Well, all you have to do is break the vow&#8230; but it&#8217;s not that easy to break it, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fufu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s so funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think we&#8217;re finally even now.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hiro turned his gaze upwards, he saw Luca&#8217;s mouth twitching.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a joke!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was kicked in the stomach and rolled around on the ground. Luca was right in front of him as he used his momentum to sit on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Die ― leave only your head and spill your guts!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with joy as she imagined the tragedy to come.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Vajra&#8221; was swung at Hiro&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>Immediately, Hiro turned around, but he could not avoid it.</p>
<p>He heard the sound of something being torn apart. There was a surge of pain as if his own body was being torn apart.</p>
<p>Before he could confirm the meaning of it, Eagle jumped out from the edge of his vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha! Oraaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>
<p>His vision goes dark. Only the sound of gravel played on his eardrums. But he was still conscious.</p>
<p>With the following action in mind, Hiro tried to put his hands on the ground and failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t feel anything. It was as if there was a hole in the ground, restricting Hiro&#8217;s actions. He looked at his right arm with vacant eyes and saw that it was missing from the shoulder down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Die, you bastard!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

p>&#8220;Die, you bastard!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s face was lifted forcibly into the sky, and the eerie sound of jaws shattering echoed in the air.</p>
<p>――He could hear the sound of the world collapsing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah――&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw a blue sky.</p>
<p>The azure sky ― the ultramarine sky ― turned red.</p>
<p>As a warm sensation touched his cheek, an arm wrapped in a black robe fell from the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha, it serves you right ― you can&#8217;t be too careless, you know&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the reddening world, a man shouted in triumph.</p>
<p>What makes him so happy&#8230;? Hiro wants to look at his face covered with tears of despair. The woman next to him was also looking at Hiro with a look of triumphant relief on her face.</p>
<p>He wants to see her crying face that would surely bring great joy to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;One more thing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro unconsciously spat out a few words and tried to stand up.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t move because of the Black Princess Camellia, right? You&#8217;ve lost your dominant arm, so be quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was kicked furiously by the man who was laughing happily and sat down helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister will now be the queen, and I will be her assistant. I&#8217;ll take your head to end the arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snorted excitedly and lifted the corners of his mouth as if he couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, &#8216;God of War,&#8217; do you have any last words?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of a thud shook his eardrums. The warm sensation of spurting blood poured down from above Hiro&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>Next, a dull tone like a bag of dirt being slammed into the ground rang out in the quiet battlefield.</p>
<p>Hiro moved his blank eyes to look at the head that was rolling aimlessly on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;――Don&#8217;t whisper in my ear. It makes my hand go out of control, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly ― a scream was heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;NOOOOOOOOOO――&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anger was painted over by sadness, and sadness was stitched together by confusion as a scream.</p>
<p>Hiro turned his attention to the source of the voice.</p>
<p>There, covering her face with her hands, was Luca, trying to distract herself from reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pride creates gaps. That advice is meaningless if you&#8217;re dead, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stood up, his smile deepening.</p>
<p>&#8220;――Let&#8217;s all hope for the next life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Heavenly Emperor&#8221; is now gone from Hiro&#8217;s left hand, and the &#8220;Dark Emperor&#8221; has appeared, emitting evil darkness.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Black Princess Camellia&#8221; is still silent, but the blood loss from his right shoulder has stopped. His senses were becoming dull, but he was able to carry out his purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;――Kill, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>An explosion could be heard. When Hiro turned his attention to the source, he saw Luca glaring at Hiro with the expression of a demon. Her supremacy swelled, and her feet caved in ― a large amount of dust flew up.</p>
<p>For some reason, Hiro hung up the edge of his mouth in an eerie way as he felt Luca&#8217;s fury on his skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives you hope, feeds you despair, hangs a sliver of hope in front of your eyes, and knocks you into the abyss.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is how to make the principle stone more powerful.</p>
<p>It shines more beautifully than any other jewel in the world and transforms into a principle stone with immense healing power.</p>
<p>Those who possess the Five Destructive Holy Principle Swords will have a principle stone with unimaginable power.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the condition. You can finally complete the second one.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro held up the Dark Emperor, Luca jumped at him with an ugly, twisted expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, I will kill yooouuuuu!&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to her left hand, which was embedded with a beautifully shining principle stone, her face was stained with ugliness, turning her into a pathetic beast that was unbearable to look at.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;You can hate me all you want. I&#8217;ll take all of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled at her, lowered his hips, and ― with a flash ― slashed Luca&#8217;s left arm.</p>
<p>For a moment, Luca&#8217;s body floated, but it didn&#8217;t stop her momentum, and a violent wind hit him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaaaaah, Give me back! Give me back! Give me baaacckk!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was too big and full of gaps, but the current Hiro couldn&#8217;t avoid it, so he took the hit.</p>
<p>He could hear the sound of bones shattering. It&#8217;s not clear how many bones were broken, but Hiro endured the intense pain without falling.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;A person becomes strong only after losing something. I can guarantee you that you will also become stronger.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro made a slight movement with his left arm, Luca jumped back as if sensing the danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless. You can&#8217;t escape the darkness from a distance like that.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――Deadly fear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luca&#8217;s movements stopped ― no, only her eyes were tinged with surprise.</p>
<p>All the living things around her have forgotten the ticking of time. The grass, the wind, the insects, the horses, the people, everything was frozen in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killing time is the blessing of the Dark Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro held the &#8220;Dark Emperor&#8221; horizontally and pointed the tip of the blade at Luca.</p>
<p>&#8220;All life is equally lured into emptiness.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――Dark Mirror Corpse Water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No change will come. The time in the world has been standing still for a long time.</p>
<p>And yet, the sense of intimidation only increases. The world is enveloped in an eerie atmosphere of fear.</p>
<p>At that moment, a splash of blood splashed into the air from Luca&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, ah?&#8221;</p>
<p>As she watched the fresh blood splattering in the air, Luca fell to the ground with a blank stare.</p>
<p>After seeing that, Hiro also fell to one knee and vomited blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guh&#8230; Is it too shallow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro narrowed his eyes with a pained expression and looked at Luca. He could tell she was still alive by the way her back was moving slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medic! Treat Luca immediately!&#8221;</p>
<p>A loud and vigorous voice rang out. The order was immediately carried out, and Luca&#8217;s treatment began in front of Hiro&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really are&#8230; a monster, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The person who had been hiding revealed herself.</p>
<p>The way she spread out her iron fan and smiled elegantly is truly worthy of great beauty. However, her smile was distorted like a snake chasing down its prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to lose her yet. I&#8217;ll deal with you from here on out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, now you&#8217;re going to show up&#8230; and take away their achievements?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the battlefield, life and death depend on one&#8217;s abilities. They were not good enough to get the credit ― that&#8217;s all, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia smiles fearlessly, showing no sign of shame.</p>
<p>Hiro smiled and stood up, thrusting the &#8220;Dark Emperor&#8221; into the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8230; are you going to play with me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I want your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled seductively, giving off a dark, demonic vibe that would seduce any man.</p>
<p>The name &#8220;wicked woman&#8221; is appropriate for her. When compared to this woman, Claudia is nothing more than a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you know, even if you resist, you won&#8217;t stand a chance. I don&#8217;t want to hurt your pretty face, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took out a glittering principle stone.</p>
<p>Judging by the blood on it, it must have been from Luca&#8217;s left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. No matter what condition your corpse will be in, I will love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her arm went hazy, and she thrust her hand into Hiro&#8217;s stomach like a sharp blade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro screamed unbearably at the feeling as if his internal organs were being stirred up.</p>
<p>Lucia, with her flushed cheeks, embraces him lustfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was watching you fight, and my body started to heat up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a look of ecstasy on her face, she bites Hiro&#8217;s ear as if she can&#8217;t bear it any longer. Her sweet breath shook Hiro&#8217;s eardrums, and her wet tongue crawled around coquettishly.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the &#8220;Black Princess Camellia,&#8221; whose power had been sealed away, tried to move with all her might.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; it still moving?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia frowned in annoyance and unfolded her iron fan.</p>
<p>With that simple movement, the &#8220;Black Princess Camellia&#8221; fell silent once again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let me tell you something. I am also the holder of the Five Destructive Holy Principle Sword.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia slowly removed her hand from Hiro&#8217;s stomach as if to emphasize her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aghhh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>An eerie sensation came over him as if his internal organs were being pulled out. It&#8217;s as if he had lost something fundamental.</p>
<p>But nothing was lost ― in fact, she left the principle stone as a souvenir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu, don&#8217;t look so sad. Are you feeling so comfortable with my hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro was about to say something, but as he moved his mouth, all that came out was fresh blood.</p>
<p>While watching Hiro&#8217;s face turn pale, Lucia licked her bloody hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious&#8230; It tastes terribly immoral.&#8221;</p>
<p>She licked the blood dripping from the back of her hand like a cat and looked down at Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this how you ate the Formless King?&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just after that ― Lucia&#8217;s body was blown away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She glided across the ground with great force and plunged into a group of medics who were treating Luca. The impact was so great that it created a violent dust storm.</p>
<p>In the midst of the clamor, a voice sounded as if confirming Lucia&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro shook his shoulders unsteadily. His face was as pale as a dead man&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But what dwells in his eyes is a raging passion ― wrath.</p>
<p>Hiro took a step forward, lost the strength in his knees, and fell to one knee on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see, so that&#8217;s how it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro noticed that his right shoulder was bleeding profusely. The hole in his stomach shows no signs of closing, and a great amount of blood is being sucked into the ground.</p>
<p>The power of the principle stone had completely sealed off his high-speed regeneration.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;d love to know how much you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro glared at her, Lucia was standing there unharmed and relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all about it. As I said in the beginning, that &#8216;woman&#8217; told me everything about who you are and how you ended up in your pathetic state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..I&#8217;d definitely like to know. Who was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason, Lucia looked surprised at Hiro&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she had met you several times, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Nameless?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was the one who created this situation. She&#8217;s the one who connected with the Black Death Village, which is planning to revive the &#8220;Father,&#8221; and manipulated Stobel into a rebellion.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, the target has been set&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The small murmurings did not reach anyone, and Hiro stood up, encouraging his trembling knees.</p>
<p>At that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;All troops, take the head of Hiro Schwartz von Grantz!&#8221;</p>
<p>An angry command was heard.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t Lucia. Yet another ― Hiro instantly understood.</p>
<p>Luca, who was still in the healing process, was being supported by a soldier and glaring at Hiro with a grudge-filled look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you ordering them to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up! I must avenge Eagle&#8217;s death!&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldiers looked puzzled at the two arguing superiors.</p>
<p>However, Lucia was the one who broke down, and after a single sigh of exasperation, she raised her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may kill him as long as he can still be identified.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Hiro, this was a ruthless order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell, &#8216;Black Dragon King&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time as Luca&#8217;s hateful command resounded, a violent tremor hit from the ground. The soldiers that filled the field of vision started to run, causing the ground to shake violently.</p>
<p>Hiro looked around with a pale face that had lost its bloodlust.</p>
<p>(&#8230;There seems to be no way to escape. I guess I won&#8217;t be able to keep my promise to her after all.)</p>
<p>It is not out of heroism that he took on the role of decoy. He just wants to return the favor he received a thousand years ago. That&#8217;s what he genuinely wanted.</p>
<p>He just wanted to return the kindness he received from his former friends through Liz.</p>
<p>People might laugh when they hear that. They might snicker and say it was a trivial reason.</p>
<p>But still, for Hiro, it was a good enough reason.</p>
<p>It was the most important reason, the most non-negotiable reason, worth risking his life for.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll keep fighting. I want them to know through her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said quietly as he stared at the 30,000 enemies surrounding him. And that&#8217;s when the image of her popped into his mind.</p>
<p>(Liz&#8230; please forgive me for being clumsy and only being able to convey my feelings in this way)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Hiro looked at the sky with a gentle smile on his face.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m going to die here so that my plan can be fulfilled.)</p>
<p>Even though many people have sacrificed their lives on the ground, the sky remains clear and unconcerned.</p>
<p>The heavens will not hold anyone back, nor can the heavens hold anyone in its grasp.</p>
<p>The azure sky that stretches out endlessly is truly the one and only ruler of the world.</p>
<p>(I bought some time&#8230; I left a way for the Great Grantz Empire to survive.)</p>
<p>Hiro challenged this battle by imposing a discarded pawn on himself.</p>
<p>(Liz&#8230; i hope you&#8217;ll forgive me for saying goodbye to you through a letter.)</p>
<p>With a self-mocking smile on his face, he looked down at the ground again, and the noise around him faded away.</p>
<p>(This is a test of your capabilities as an emperor. So, please don&#8217;t overlook the options that lead to victory. If you make one or two mistakes, that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ve left countless possibilities open.)</p>
<p>Hiro picked up his own coat of arms flag that had fallen to the ground and set it up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now ― come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro formed a fierce smile like a beast and clutched the &#8220;Dark Emperor&#8221; with his left hand again.</p>
<p>Standing in a place where there were no allies, he stared at the enemy who was approaching, stepping over the corpses of his dead allies.</p>
<p>The enemy was clearly agitated. They were shaking with astonishment as though it was reckless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to see if you can surpass despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a flash to the approaching enemy. It was a light swing, but the power that went into it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, a number of red blossoms bloomed in the sky.</p>
<p>Before they had time to scream, multiple heads hit the ground, making an eerie sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on the verge of death! There is no time to be distracted, just kill him quickly――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped the head of the enemy that was buzzing around his ears.</p>
<p>(&#8230;..Around here?)</p>
<p>Everyone was aiming for Hiro&#8217;s head, so it was like there was no formation at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, now that I have recovered, I think I&#8217;ll go on a rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried to be tough, but to tell the truth, both of his knees were trembling as if they were about to break. His physical strength had already been depleted. But that didn&#8217;t mean he could give up so easily.</p>
<p>There were people waiting for him, so Hiro kicked the ground with all his might.</p>
<p>&#8220;M-monster!&#8221;</p>
<p>He only aimed at the commander class and only killed the soldiers in his path that were in his way.</p>
<p>(This situation is&#8230; not good. I need to be more conspicuous.)</p>
<p>He was surrounded by more enemies than he expected. This is going to hinder his plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough, just give up already!&#8221;</p>
<p>The commander tried to draw his sword from his waist, but Hiro instantly kicked it away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re unarmed; aren&#8217;t you afraid for your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guh, damn it――!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without giving the commander time to draw another sword, Hiro kicked the hilt and jumped.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t let your guard down on the battlefield.&#8221;</p>
<p>He twisted himself in midair and vigorously chopped off the head of the commander.</p>
<p>Then, with a natural motion, Hiro landed on the ground and looked around him.</p>
<p>What came into view was enemy soldiers holding their bows at a distance. A great number of arrowheads were pointed at him. Even so, Hiro did not stop smiling coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Your decision is not wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>People made weapons to defeat monsters because they could not win with their own strength. The bow is a prime example. You can overwhelm your opponent with the number of moves you can make.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not something you can fire at close range, is it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hiro muttered in exasperation, the enemy commander&#8217;s order was followed by a storm of arrows blasting the ground.</p>
<p>If he took evasive action, the arrows would pierce the enemy soldiers swarming behind him. He thought it was pathetic and even felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>In order to defeat just one person, how many people must be sacrificed to make it worthwhile&#8230;?</p>
<p>But the commander who can make a ruthless decision is strong and knows that hesitation creates an opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, what a good decision. There is no hesitation in that&#8230; you are definitely planning to kill me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the absolute defense of the Black Princess Camellia has been sealed, there is only one way to prevent the oncoming arrow.</p>
<p>With only one of his arms left, he could only use the single sword in his hand to repel the barrage of arrows.</p>
<p>In other words ― it was all he could do to avoid a fatal wound.</p>
<p>When the violent storm passed, the place where Hiro was standing was filled with so many arrows that he had no place to step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230; not yet&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving his feet, which were sewn into the ground, Hiro took a step forward.</p>
<p>(Did they take my right eye&#8230;?)</p>
<p>He rubbed the dark haze with the back of his left hand and got a slimy, eerie feeling back.</p>
<p>But he still had his left eye. There was no problem as long as he could see, so long as he could move his left arm even if he lost his right.</p>
<p>(No, I can&#8217;t even feel my hand, can I?)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all. Hiro realized that he had lost other things as well.</p>
<p>(If there is no pain from the wound&#8230; then this is definitely&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Now! Draw your sword!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so happy&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My troops are first in line! You&#8217;ll be rewarded handsomely! Let&#8217;s finish him off――!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, don&#8217;t be so happy. It makes me want to resist, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro encourages his weakened body and kicks the ground, sending the commander&#8217;s head flying.</p>
<p>He attacked nonchalantly like a machine repeating its work.</p>
<p>He stroked the head of the agitated enemy soldier and slashed it open, crushed the skull of the unsettled enemy soldier with a single swing, and then plucked the life out of them one after another with the &#8220;Dark Emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;――Kuh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>He suddenly lost the strength in his knees and fell down on the ground helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah ―― so this is where it ends&#8230; huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t move a single finger. With his face pressed against the ground, Hiro felt his vision narrowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take his head! Take his head off!&#8221;</p>
<p>They grabbed him by the hair and forcibly lifted his head. The faces that flashed into his hazy vision all had expressions of greed on all of their faces.</p>
<p>When the blade was pressed against his neck&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! I&#8217;ll chop his head off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca appeared in front of him, breaking through the wall of soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good grief&#8230; you&#8217;re really not cut out to be a commander, stealing the show from your subordinates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia appeared next to Luca, stepping on the gravel.</p>
<p>&#8220;But then again, your struggle is in vain, is it? You can&#8217;t run away, and you can&#8217;t overturn a losing battle even if you go on a rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia raised her eyebrows as if she were looking at a strange creature.</p>
<p>Hiro snickered in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; the Six Kingdoms are losing, you know ― can&#8217;t you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear anything. Have you gone crazy from dying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Maybe, I don&#8217;t know. But I can hear the sound of the Six Kingdoms collapsing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see your life fading away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ― I won.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew Lucia&#8217;s plan from the beginning.</p>
<p>He was aware of the fact that the head of the Mark family and other central nobles were in cahoots with her, as well as the fact that she had the western nobles, including Kyrthia, in her corner.</p>
<p>It was obvious that their existence would be a hindrance in the future, but if he killed them without showing evidence, he would surely be criticized, so how could he get rid of them at the same time?</p>
<p>As a result, the Grantz Empire was able to buy enough time to prepare its forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I knew you were reading this. But I&#8217;m satisfied with the situation since my goal was only to get your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with the situation, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia&#8217;s smile froze, and Hiro sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;My plan will be completed with the death of the hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Did you think I wouldn&#8217;t cut off your head if you threatened me?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a fact that warriors of great renown are often deified after death. If a person is praised as a war hero, he is likely to be revered as a god of war.</p>
<p>In the military state of the Grantz Empire, Hiro&#8217;s death would be used to great effect in the future.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s death will help the people understand the war, and his deification will boost the soldiers&#8217; morale. It could also work to the advantage of diplomacy with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even at the cost of all this, the head is still more valuable than the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s fine. It is necessary for the fulfillment of my plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never stop talking, do you&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia sighed in exasperation and closed her iron fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you, then! Queen Lucia, stand down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca approached with high footsteps, his sharpened blade resting on Hiro&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luca&#8217;s intense anger caused Hiro to drop his gaze to the ground.</p>
<p>Hiro carved a wild smile as he looked at the small stone that shook slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;――You&#8217;re really late.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately afterward, a blade swung vigorously down on Hiro&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>＊＊＊＊＊</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Hiro? Are you listening?&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of a hill at sunset, she looked into his face, holding his sideburns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230; what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geez! As I said. Why do you want to help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need a reason to help people.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly and shrugged her shoulders, grabbing his cheek gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cheat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuwa&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her physical punishment is penetrating the heart.</p>
<p>His mind is filled with guilt from being punished without pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not very smart, you know. I think I&#8217;m probably causing Hiro a lot of trouble. You see, I get angry easily and move without thinking things through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; you&#8217;re right. You were able to analyze yourself properly, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sad that you don&#8217;t deny it, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>She twitched her mouth as if she was expecting him to deny it. But she quickly regained her composure and put her arms behind her back, and folded her hands.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; well, anyway, that&#8217;s why, Hiro, you should find out what you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you say that&#8230; what&#8217;s wrong with you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Hiro really, truly, truly believes that I am worthy of the throne, then I need your help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be strong. I want to be smarter, too, so I can lessen Hiro&#8217;s burden, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, I guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing Liz&#8217;s embarrassed smile, Hiro narrowed his eyes sadly.</p>
<p>(Even though they don&#8217;t look alike, her heart and soul are just like Altius&#8217;.)</p>
<p>He wondered what he would say if he came back to this time and saw Liz.</p>
<p>He would be surprised.</p>
<p>He would be shaken with emotion to see a girl who looked just like him.</p>
<p>(Even though they don&#8217;t have the same personality, she looks exactly like Rey.)</p>
<p>The future envisioned by his friends may not be the same as this world.</p>
<p>But&#8230; it will never fade away.</p>
<p>There was always good and evil in every era.</p>
<p>The world he lived in a thousand years ago is no different from the world he lives in today.</p>
<p>(Surely&#8230; the future you wanted is beyond her.)</p>
<p>Hiro narrowed his eyes as he watched the setting sun.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Until the day her will is sprouted&#8230;)</p>
<p>He had to protect her from all malice and keep her safe from all threats.</p>
<p>This is the mission that has been imposed on him, and it is the redemption of a man who has abandoned his past.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The roar of the black dragon distorts the world&#8217;s logic, while the roar of the lion brings order to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stretched out his still unreachable hand to the heavens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the world roar.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――May her name reach you all.</p>
