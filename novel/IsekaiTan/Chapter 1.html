<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Calm Before The Storm</h3>

<p>January 4th, 1024th year of the Imperial Calendar.</p>
<p>On this day, a cold wind blew with a sharp pain that stung the skin.</p>
<p>Once outside, it was so cold that it was impossible to stop shivering. The Great Imperial Capital was experiencing a cold wave that could freeze people to death if they were not careful. However, even in such a harsh environment, the capital of the Grantz Empire, Cladius, was strangely filled with a strange kind of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The central street was filled with people, so many that there was no place to step.</p>
<p>And strangely enough, there was a sense of urgency on their faces as they all headed towards the main gate with large bags in their hands. It was as if they were frightened of something, as if they were running away from something as if they were in such a hurry that it could be called panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up! If we stay here, we&#8217;ll die! The Six Kingdoms are going to attack us!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a merchant who tried to break into the long line of people. Normally, this would be a blameworthy situation, but in the current situation, no one blamed him because there were many people around him who were trying to break into the line and get through the main gate.</p>
<p>Some people were glaring at them with resentment.</p>
<p>Although they didn&#8217;t say a word, what they spat out in their hearts must have been vindictiveness.</p>
<p>They must be cursing them as heartless people.</p>
<p>Watching the people running away from the city from afar were the people who had originally settled in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t abandon the land they&#8217;ve lived in for so many years just because the empire is in danger, and more importantly, there&#8217;s no way they can afford to move to another country.</p>
<p>Even if they had enough money and were fortunate enough to escape the war, if they lost their country, they would not be able to live their lives as before.</p>
<p>In other words, whether they stay or flee, it is the same either way.</p>
<p>So, unlike the merchants who never settled down, they could not move from this place.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a heartless bunch. What about the Six Kingdoms? This is the Great Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is everything alright? They say that the emperor was seriously injured in a battle with bandits who invaded the imperial palace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, it is rumored that the Six Kingdoms have 150,000 troops. We&#8217;re a large country, so our forces are dispersed throughout. Because of that, we can&#8217;t gather our forces as quickly as they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Grantz Empire has divided its vast territory into five regions, bordering on hostile countries. Skirmishes were an everyday occurrence, and the majority of troops were deployed and dispersed along the borderlines. If they tried to unify, there would be a breakdown somewhere soon enough.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the existence of the five great noble families, who are in charge of managing each territory, stands out in times of crisis, but that was only if they were still standing on their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rebellion started by the Krone family has temporarily cut off the logistics. Because of this, no one will go near the capital for fear of danger. And before the chaos was over, the barbarians from the Six Kingdoms invaded the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we can stop them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; It looks like the Mark family is going to take over the Krone family&#8217;s place, but those central nobles have started a rebellion, so we can&#8217;t count on them. The only thing left to do is to hope that the western nobility can hold out, but how long can they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rumored that not only the Steichen Republic but also other countries have begun preparing for war. If we start a full-fledged war with the surrounding countries, it will really be the end of the Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s going to happen&#8230; now that the new year has passed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The people turned their anxious gaze to the imperial palace.</p>
<p>With the sun shining in the cloudless blue sky, the imperial palace is shining brightly again today, unaware of the feelings of the people living on the ground.</p>
<p>At that moment, all the important people of the Grantz Empire were gathered in the palace.</p>
<p>Since the throne room was no longer available for use by the First Prince Stobel, a temporary command center had been set up in the antechamber. It was in the antechamber that the imperial family, including Hiro and other influential figures known as the great nobles, gathered to determine the future course of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;What should we do now that we&#8217;ve lost His Majesty and so many high-ranking officials?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was explained to the people that former General Loing started the previous rebellion with the help of first prince Stobel.</p>
<p>The fact that the first prince Stobel had invaded the imperial palace and killed the emperor and his entourage was kept secret so as not to confuse the people. It was only reported that the emperor was injured by the bandits and that there were casualties among the high officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an unprecedented event. No, there was only one similar incident three hundred years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s nothing compared to three hundred years ago. It wasn&#8217;t like 150,000 troops invaded like this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>That era was a time of turmoil, and every country had similar events. Above all, there is no mention in the literature of a single emperor being killed and the damage done to the high officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve managed to keep the emperor&#8217;s death a secret from the people, but we can&#8217;t do that forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>An announcement will have to be made sooner or later. However, this will only happen when the next emperor is chosen.</p>
<p>In order to counter the threat to the Six Kingdoms, it was necessary to prevent the heirs to the throne from fighting over the throne. Therefore, there was no choice but to shelve the situation temporarily.</p>
<p>Even if a temporary emperor were to be chosen, the noble lords who were dissatisfied with the interim emperor would support their own heir to the throne, which could lead to a joint rule.</p>
<p>This would lead to the division of the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>(First, we have to win the war against the Six Kingdoms. The next emperor will probably be elected after that. That is if the neighboring countries don&#8217;t invade&#8230;)</p>
<p>The Grantz Empire rests on an extremely precarious balance.</p>
<p>The Six Kingdoms to the west and the Steichen Republic to the south. There were other small and medium-sized states around.</p>
<p>If they were to join forces, the territory would be cut down in the blink of an eye, and the Grantz Empire would disappear from the map without recovering any lost ground.</p>
<p>(In order to avoid this&#8230; we must get rid of the nobles who fatten their own pockets.)</p>
<p>Betrayal begets betrayal. Many of the nobles who are obsessed with power will not want to give up their current positions. There is no such thing as patriotism.</p>
<p>Therefore, there will always be those who are misled by sweet words.</p>
<p>It is easy to change one&#8217;s mind if one is promised relief of territory.</p>
<p>(But a simple approach will lead to inducement. I have to be very careful, but with the Six Kingdoms invading, there&#8217;s no time to be complacent ― if that&#8217;s the case, the only way is to take forceful measures&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro sighed and quietly looked at the people gathered in the antechamber.</p>
<p>Everyone has a pained expression on their face as they think about their country.</p>
<p>Among them, there was one person who was watching over the scene with a calm face.</p>
<p>The second prince Werewolf Sharm Selene von Grantz.</p>
<p>He has a huge following among the people of the north and is called the &#8220;King of the North&#8221; and &#8220;Twin Wolf.&#8221; He has a neutral face and an eye-catching appearance, but what stands out even more is that his eyes are different in color. It is called &#8220;Distinctive Eyes&#8221; and is a physical characteristic that can be said to be a quality of heroes possessed by legendary figures.</p>
<p>The second prince Selene has a blue eye on his left and a gold eye on his right, which gives him a strange impression. His blue hair, reminiscent of the sky, is as soft as silk, and his body is covered in thin brown fur, with silver and white armor peeking out from underneath.</p>
<p>He seems to have no intention of being hostile at the moment, but it is unclear what he is really thinking.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not interested in the throne, but he&#8217;s obsessed with the northern part of the country, which he protects.</p>
<p>He was prepared to go to any length to protect the north.</p>
<p>If they were to become enemies later on, he would be the first to be eliminated.</p>
<p>(But it would be a shame to dispose of him in a situation where he has value. We still need the second prince Selene to do his best. At least until Liz&#8217;s position is established&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro turned his gaze to Liz, but her neat form was covered in deep shadows.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that her defeat by the first prince Stobel was still lingering. The fact that Skaaha was seriously injured in that battle and has yet to regain consciousness is also a factor.</p>
<p>(She lost to Stobel, but there were benefits&#8230; She was able to encourage the awakening of the &#8220;Flame Emperor.&#8221; But there are some things to be concerned about. She is too mentally immature to be an emperor.)</p>
<p>Then, she would not be able to win the support of the nobles and lords.</p>
<p>The sun is the ruler of heaven that shines on all people. It is not allowed to shine only on certain people.</p>
<p>If one is grieving for someone, one must grieve for all.</p>
<p>You must have compassion for your people, respect for your soldiers, and love for your country.</p>
<p>(These are emotions that many rulers have forgotten and abandoned.)</p>
<p>She would be able to feel heartache for the unnamed.</p>
<p>Hiro also knew well that Liz was a kind girl.</p>
<p>(But&#8230; that&#8217;s not what she needed right now. She should not be swayed by her emotions.)</p>
<p>If the emperor were still alive and well, less than a month ago, she would have been able to take the throne despite her naivety. But now&#8230; with the loss of the emperor and the invasion of other countries, it won&#8217;t be easy.</p>
<p>(What the next emperor needs to do is to make a calm decision. Only those who can assess the current situation without being influenced by emotions can be considered as the next emperor. Liz&#8217;s growth has been remarkable, but she hasn&#8217;t yet mastered the ability to stifle her emotions.)</p>
<p>Not bound by anyone. Not controlled by anyone. Not to be dictated by anyone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what an emperor, someone who aims for the top of the Grantz Empire, should be.</p>
<p>Although she is powerful enough, she does not have the dignity of a lion or a champion.</p>
<p>(There are other problems, too&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro loosened his collar and let out a deep breath, catching Rosa out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>Her bewitching beauty had a stern expression on her face. The reason would not only be that the emperor was dead. It was also because she was forced to revise her plan to put Liz on the throne.</p>
<p>(My presence is getting in the way. I should have changed my support to Liz earlier.)</p>
<p>With this incident, the order of succession to the throne had shifted significantly.</p>
<p>The first prince Stobel rebelled and was deprived of his right to the throne.</p>
<p>Next would be the third prince Blutar, but the power of the western nobles has weakened.</p>
<p>The second prince Selene was not interested in the throne, and he rarely came to the central. He was considered a low-ranking successor to the throne because of his weak health. So, who among the people in this room is the highest in the line of succession ― if asked, all of them would point to Liz.</p>
<p>However, this brings up the issue that concerned him earlier.</p>
<p>There is no faction that supports her. In short, there is no one to support her.</p>
<p>Then, even if the order of succession is high, it is meaningless. It&#8217;s just a title, a treasure trove. The next highest in line of succession, Hiro, would be a hindrance to Liz.</p>
<p>He has the support of the eastern nobility and is popular among the people because he is a descendant of the &#8220;God of War.&#8221;</p>
<p>Above all, Hiro&#8217;s accomplishments since he was adopted into the Grantz family, according to Altius&#8217;s will, are also impeccable.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s no one who can stop me even if I forcefully declare that I&#8217;m going to become the emperor here.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless&#8230;</p>
<p>(There would be a split. They won&#8217;t let me take the throne so easily.)</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the powerful nobles, including the Mark family.</p>
<p>The central nobles who have begun to look up to the Mark family as their leader in place of the Krone family, which has lost its power, are fed up with their lightness of foot. These central nobles are whispering to each other with anxiety on their faces.</p>
<p>Some of the whispers were directed at a certain person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he show up now&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was he before? He was supposed to be with the emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eyes were fixed on a thin, unhealthy-looking man.</p>
<p>Bizan Gils von Sharm.</p>
<p>He is the former head of the Sharm family, one of the five great noble families, and the emperor&#8217;s right-hand man ― he is also the uncle of the second prince Selene.</p>
<p>The other day, he suddenly appeared with an unconcerned look on his face and took part in today&#8217;s meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prime Minister Gils&#8230; how could you survive in such a situation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps thinking that it was useless to whisper to each other, one of the nobles said straightforwardly.</p>
<p>The fact that his words were a bit harsh was probably due to the possibility that Prime Minister Gils was linked to the first prince Stobel. But Prime Minister Gils opened his mouth without changing his expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that you want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Many of those who were in the imperial palace had been attacked by the deadly blade and had died. The only ones who survived were the women and children who had hidden in the hidden rooms beforehand. In such a situation, you, who had always worked together with the emperor, survived. It&#8217;s a question that anyone would ask themselves, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils shrugged his shoulders at the nobleman&#8217;s persuasive tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time, I was away from the throne room at the behest of the emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of order was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ordered to increase the security of the throne room. So I went to the door to send some of my knights to guard it and was attacked and wounded by the first prince Stobel.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, it all happened in a blink of an eye ― and Prime Minister Gils&#8217;s body shook with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone had foolishly let their guard down. It&#8217;s safe to say that everyone was relieved when the first prince Stobel, the holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Sword, showed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, they soon learned that it was a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;The slaughter began. All of them died without realizing what had happened. By the time I realized it, I had lost one of my arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils tightened his grip on his left sleeve. The sleeve creased as if to indicate that it was hollow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I then decided to flee in shame to inform His Majesty of the emergency. But I lost so much blood that I fainted in the process. But fortunately, a maidservant saved me, and&#8230; I am now safe and sound ― or rather, miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think such an explanation will convince us?&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the noblemen stood up, slapping the desk with both hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy is the holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Sword. In fact, no one other than you has survived an attack by the first prince Stobel. What does that mean!&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the angry nobleman, the others also complained as if they were not satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the face of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Sword, ordinary people are like babies. Encountering a natural disaster and being able to escape at the cost of only a single arm is&#8230; unbelievable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were working with the first prince Stobel, weren&#8217;t you? It would make sense that you sacrificed your left arm to avoid suspicion, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro also generally agreed with the questions of the nobles.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is second in rank only to the emperor. He is the most important person after the emperor.</p>
<p>If someone were planning to overthrow the country, they would not let Prime Minister Gils go.</p>
<p>(Since Stobel is powerful enough, he can take out Prime Minister Gils with little effort. But I have no proof. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to leave it at that.)</p>
<p>More importantly, a man as strong as Prime Minister Gils would not easily show his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous. You should be ashamed of yourself for framing me as an informant for such an unfounded reason!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice of Prime Minister Gils was filled with anger. It was a rare display of emotion for a man who usually embodied calm and collected.</p>
<p>The whispering of the nobles stopped as Prime Minister Gils slammed his right hand on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the time to be arguing. As we speak, the sacred territory of the Grantz Empire, given to us by the Spirit King, is being trampled upon by the barbarians of the west.”</p>
<p>He had a point. There is no time to waste in denouncing something that does not have any proof; there are other priorities.</p>
<p>He was putting himself on the shelf, but it was a good argument. This is why the nobles fell silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is the time for us to unite, but this is not good for the emperor! If you want to frame me, you&#8217;d better get rid of those barbarians in the west first!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro inwardly muttered that this was shameless, but it was fortunate that the Prime Minister of the Grantz Empire was still alive. With the loss of the emperor, there is no doubt that he is the head of the country, and it will certainly be easier for him to organize future policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Could we move the topic to the Six Kingdoms?&#8221;</p>
<p>A nobleman, the facilitator who had been watching the barren dispute, said in exasperation.</p>
<p>He then confirmed that there was no one to object and asked the civil servant for data.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the report of the spies, reinforcements are being sent one after another from their home countries, and it is possible that the final number will exceed 200,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobleman in charge of the proceedings read the report he had received from the civil servant without hesitation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the nobles who had been quietly listening to the report shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;If such a large army were to flow into the Central, it would be impossible to stop them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the reinforcements coming from outside the Central?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a month or two for the reinforcements from each region to gather at the central, and&#8230; three months at the earliest to prepare for an interception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the western nobles be able to withstand the threat&#8230; for such a long time?&#8221;</p>
<p>No one could answer the last question. A serious atmosphere filled the antechamber.</p>
<p>The nobleman who was in charge of the meeting spoke, looking at the quiet people in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Six Kingdoms that are currently invading the west seem to have divided their forces into several groups and are advancing through the western territories. According to reports, they are rampaging through the country, sinking forts and cities one after another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the army that was doing security work in Felzen doing? Why did they allow the invasion to happen so easily&#8230;? What is the third prince Blutar doing, and where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, I believe that one of the five great generals Bakish is in the west; what is he doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the nobleman in charge of facilitating the meeting was questioned, his lips pulled back in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main force of the western nobility ― the army led by the third prince Blutar ― seems to be stranded in the Felzen region. In addition, general Bakish, who fought hard to defend the borderline between the Felzen region, was killed in the battle&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The five great generals are the great military commanders that represent the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>The emperor has personally entrusted them with the guardianship of their respective regions, and as the last bulwark, they have been able to exert a glare on other countries.</p>
<p>It is not hard to imagine what happened to his corpse. It will be greatly used as an example to encourage the western nobles to surrender.</p>
<p>(Even so, Bakish-san was killed in battle&#8230;?)</p>
<p>General Bakish von Hass, the guardian of the West. Although they were not particularly close, he still helped Hiro during the attack on the Grand Duchy of Dral. If it weren&#8217;t for him, Hiro&#8217;s plan wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded, and he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get Liz back.</p>
<p>&#8220;The border garrison was less than 10,000, so it must have been a very tough battle. Above all, the Imperial Black Knights are also accompanying the third prince Blutar, so even one of the five great generals would not be able to withstand the onslaught of the Six Kingdoms&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, how did the Six Kingdoms manage to get a large army into the west? How could they have overlooked a number of 150,000? If they are able to move around without us knowing, they may have already invaded the Central. Considering that, we must take countermeasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobles, frightened by the invisible enemy, raised their voices as if to make a show of bravado.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&#8230; they were blending in with the Felzen remnant army.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing that the conversation was not going anywhere, Hiro pointed to a map in the middle of the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 150,000 were divided into small groups and gradually separated from the Felzen remnants. After that, it is reasonable to assume that they joined up in several places and then invaded the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Felzen region, there are plenty of towns, villages, forts, castles, and hiding places that have been ruined after several major battles. By using them, it is possible to hide a large army.</p>
<p>However, even with Hiro&#8217;s explanation, the nobles seemed unable to believe it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness Hiro, with all due respect. Sending a number of 150,000 in small groups ― that would take an uncanny number of years. Moreover, they must be very careful not to be noticed. Doesn&#8217;t sound very realistic, does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing something unrealistic ― that&#8217;s how serious they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Hiro could retort, the second prince Selene leaned one elbow on his desk and said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been preparing this for years. It may have been years ago&#8230; or it may have taken a huge amount of time, even decades. They&#8217;ve been preparing meticulously so as not to be noticed by us ― isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The second prince Selene smiled at Hiro as if seeking his agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it also means that there was an opening in the Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an elaborate and grandiose plan to destroy the Grantz Empire.</p>
<p>The Granz Empire was so proud of its great power that it only invaded other countries and overlooked it. This is the reason why the current situation is so irreversible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why we have to bear such a grudge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young nobleman said with a grieved expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many people who resent our country because it is a great country and has a long history.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old nobleman who knew the root of the reason why the Six Kingdoms had invaded this time let out a deep sigh. It&#8217;s not that the ignorance of the young nobleman dumbfounded him but that he was thinking of the karma that the Grantz Empire had borne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially the resentment of the Six Kingdoms is considerable. To borrow the words of the second prince Selene, it can be said that the Six Kingdoms have been under preparation for a thousand years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The oppressed past, those who crossed over to the west because of persecution. They are the descendants of the families that once worked tirelessly for the Grantz Empire or their relations.</p>
<p>This was the Six Kingdoms, founded by the descendants of the &#8220;Five Generals of the Black Sky,&#8221; who were Hiro&#8217;s subordinates.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the Six Kingdoms are a confederation of six royal families.</p>
<p>The unity of the Six Kingdoms is based on the unshakable unity of the unified king at the top, but three of the royal families have the &#8220;Five Generals of the Black Sky &#8221; as their founders. There are many different races, beastman, long-ear, dwarves, and human, and the characteristics of the people are also unique. Of course, none of the nations have forgotten the bitterness of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Even though their honor has been restored, the descendants of the &#8220;Five Generals of the Black Sky&#8221; are still treated as if they never existed in the Grantz Empire. The resentment of those who had been erased from history was immeasurable.</p>
<p>Therefore, this invasion was inevitable.</p>
<p>In the antechamber, where silence fell, the person who had been watching the event opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s think about the future first, shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sixth princess, Celia Estrella Elizabeth von Grantz.</p>
<p>She has red hair reminiscent of fire with a silky luster. Her blazing red jade eyes give a strong sense of will. She has an interesting face that is still young, but her appearance, which reminds of the tranquility of a sculpture made by a master sculptor, is irresistible to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we should be discussing right now is what to do about the Six Kingdoms that are invading us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz was taken aback by the back-and-forth, off-topic military discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-you&#8217;re right. Let&#8217;s continue the discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobleman who was facilitating the meeting cleared his throat, then unfolded the parchment in his hand and muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the 30,000 soldiers who participated in the rebellion have surrendered, but it would be difficult to have them accompany us if they are mentally unstable and going on a counter-offensive. In addition to that, considering the punishment of the nobles who were involved in the rebellion, the number of troops in the Central has been greatly reduced ― I estimate that only about 50,000 can move immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, security has been deteriorating as desperate fugitive soldiers have been running rampant in various places, and bandits have appeared to take advantage of the chaos at the Central.</p>
<p>The number of 50,000 can only be gathered if those factors are ignored, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, considering the maintenance of public safety, we can only gather about 20,000 at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not enough to push back an army of 150,000. Do we have to wait for reinforcements from all over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no choice but to do so. The west has no choice but to endure. For now, we should bring in forces from the north, east, and south.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is also difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils said with a face full of bitterness.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The nobles questioned, but at this point, Hiro stood up and pulled out a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I received a letter from the Muzuk family.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mention of the names of the five major noble families that ruled the south caused a slight commotion to rise in the antechamber.</p>
<p>Hiro tapped the letter with an exaggerated hand gesture and urged the nobles to silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;This letter describes a tense situation in which the Steichen Republic is deploying troops on the border. Their number is unknown at this stage, but it is said to be no less than ten or twenty thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridiculous. The Steichen Republic is not in a position to intervene in another country&#8217;s struggle for succession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree, but it&#8217;s true. The Muzuk family has written to me requesting me to move the Fourth Imperial Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sixth princess has the right to command it.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s gaze is directed at Liz at once, but she makes a difficult face and sighs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fourth Imperial Army is ready to move. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be ready in no time&#8230; But if I do, you won&#8217;t be able to count on any reinforcements from the south.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether to fight until the Steichen Republic retreated or make peace, it was clear that it would take some time either way. Moreover, since the command of the Fourth Imperial Army was in Liz&#8217;s hands, no orders other than her own would be accepted. In other words, Liz herself would have to head south to deal with the Steichen Republic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only current holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Sword in the Grantz Empire is Her Highness Celia Estrella. How is it possible to send her to the south? Right now, the Six Kingdoms to the west are far more of a threat than the rural south republic. I hereby insist that the Muzuk family should endure.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one nobleman expressed his opinion, the noble lords nodded one after another as if to show their agreement.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll ask Liz to head south. We don&#8217;t want to make the Muzuk family feel unhappy here. If we make enemies with them, it will be the end of the Grantz Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the west is about to fall apart, and the south is about to fall apart as well, the Grantz Empire will truly collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; what are you going to do about the west, Your Highness Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll head there myself. I&#8217;ll be taking 20,000 troops with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiro, wait. What are you going to do with only twenty thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz interrupted the conversation with a surprised look on her face.</p>
<p>Hiro smiles at Liz as he scratches the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay; I&#8217;m not going to do anything crazy. I&#8217;m just trying to stall them from pouring into the Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stall them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro nodded at Liz&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opponents are a huge army of 150,000. If all the nobles don&#8217;t join hands, we won&#8217;t be able to break through the desperate situation. If that is the case, we should gather our forces in the Central and challenge the Six Kingdoms to a decisive battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you planning to intercept the Six Kingdoms in the Central?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sorry for the people in the west, but they will have to endure. Right now, we have to concentrate on building up our forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as time goes by, the casualties in the west will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Many noble lords and princes will distrust the Grantz Empire, which could lead to informers.</p>
<p>To avoid this, Hiro himself will go to the west and use 20,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people of the West might be disappointed if they find out that the reinforcements are only twenty thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro took his gaze off Liz and looked around at the people participating in the military council.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I, a descendant of the God of War, head out as commander, I can alleviate some of the anxiety.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Hiro, who is an important figure in the Grantz Empire, rushes to the aid of the army, he can convince the western nobility and people that the home country has not abandoned the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the third prince Blutar is to remain in the Felzen region. Let him regain his wits in preparation for the coming day, and when the time comes, we will pinch the Six Kingdoms and defeat them once and for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an empty theory with no sense of reality, but it must be conveyed with confidence. It was also meant to discourage the nobles and lords who were harboring double-mindedness from thinking anything improper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like the acting head of the Kelheit family to head to the east, gather as many troops as possible, and return to the Central. The second prince Selene will remain stationed in the great imperial capital to consider countermeasures against the Six Kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hiro looked at Rosa and the second prince Selene, they all nodded.</p>
<p>Hiro continued to speak one after another.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to reassure the merchants to avoid further dissatisfaction among the people and further damage to the economy. I hereby propose that we change the unstable trade routes in the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, but&#8230; do you have a plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils interjected a question, and Hiro nodded as if to say it was obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s work with the Grand Duchy of Dral to avoid economic stagnation. We will also strengthen our trade with the Levering Kingdom in the north, and take in their abundant ore at twice the price of what it used to be, and have it flow to us on a priority basis. It will be temporary, but we will use it to stimulate the market until the war is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils held his chin and fell silent. After a few moments of silence, he nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Fumu, you want them to think that it is in their interest to join forces with the Grantz Empire?&#8221;</p>
<p>The first priority is to stop other countries from invading the Grantz Empire. If the neighboring countries believe that this kind of situation will not shake the Grantz Empire, the Six Kingdoms will become impatient because they will not be able to get any help.</p>
<p>While some of the nobles were convinced, Liz twisted her lips in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand about revitalizing the economy. You mean that in anticipation of a prolonged war, right? But I don&#8217;t think that will be enough to break the current situation. We&#8217;ve already been attacked in the west. The Six Kingdoms may stabilize the west and invade the Central before we are in a perfect state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her beautiful voice has no stagnation and is full of confidence.</p>
<p>Liz didn&#8217;t show any signs of hesitation and spoke her opinion with an air of authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no guarantee that the west will be able to endure while I&#8217;m dealing with the Steichen Republic. Even if you say that you can stop them with 20,000 troops, they have 150,000 troops, and if they organize a separate force, on the contrary, you might be the one to be stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Is there any way to stop them?</i> Liz added at the end, looking at Hiro.</p>
<p>Hiro, who had been listening to her silently, forgot the atmosphere of the place and made a dumbfounded face.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t expected Liz to point this out to him.</p>
<p>It seems that the nobles had noticed that he was trying to distract their attention from the problem and had made it vague by muddying the scene.</p>
<p>(No&#8230; It&#8217;s no wonder. Originally, Liz&#8217;s growth had been remarkable.)</p>
<p>Recently, he had heard that Rosa had been teaching her politics and Aura had been teaching her military strategy.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t something that someone had told her to do. It was because she had thought about it herself and had questions that she offered her opinion.</p>
<p>Her growth was admirable, and Hiro fought to keep his cheeks from loosening.</p>
<p>(Then I have to respond to this growth of yours&#8230;)</p>
<p>After regaining his composure, Hiro began to explain in order to dispel her fears and even suspicions.</p>
<p>&#8220;That question is natural, I guess. But the Six Kingdoms have no choice but to remain in the west for a while. I&#8217;ll explain some of the reasons now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro pointed to the map and then traced it around.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, the Six Kingdoms have not yet established their logistics. I don&#8217;t know how long it took them to do it, but they don&#8217;t have enough food to feed an army of 150,000 people. Nevertheless, they cannot just loot the cities and villages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? If they have a grudge against the Grantz Empire, why don&#8217;t they just loot them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled mildly at Liz, who tilted her head to express that she didn&#8217;t know honestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the winter season has arrived, looting could lead to people starving to death, and the backlash from the locals could lead to an armed uprising. When considering the future of governance, including expansion into the Central, such a blunder should be avoided.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are not too incompetent, you will not allow looting. If a defeat is imminent, there is no telling how they will respond, but as it stands, the Six Kingdoms have the upper hand, so they will not do anything reckless.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Y-yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at Liz, who was nodding her head several times to try to understand, Hiro spun his words slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One more thing, if they cross the Felzen region, the logistics with their home country will be fully extended. They have their collaborators in Felzen, but they also have their enemy, the third prince Blutar. For now, the priority for him is to find and destroy the supply routes, and he will remain as an obstacle until our forces are ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>War cannot be waged without food. Without people, food cannot grow. Without land, people cannot be born. These are three things that cannot be ignored when thinking about what will happen after the invasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they will invade the Central right away because of these concerns. I believe that they will challenge us to a decisive battle after they have made all preparations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since they have gathered a large army of 150,000, they will want to avoid defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we have plenty of time to prepare our forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, deep down, Hiro is convinced that they will attack very soon.</p>
<p>(What we&#8217;re thinking, they must be thinking it as well. They must have some sort of countermeasure in place ― just like the seasons; they want to settle this in a short period after moving a large army.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hiro gave Liz a look while he pondered.</p>
<p>She was not satisfied with the results&#8230; yet she groaned with a sense of reluctance.</p>
<p>(This will ensure that she can go down to the Muzuk family.)</p>
<p>After patting his chest, Hiro looked at the council members and asked if there were any other opinions.</p>
<p>No one wanted to say a word.</p>
<p>After confirming that there were no objections, Hiro sat down in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s discuss our respective roles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils stood up in his place and proceeded with the topic without hesitation.</p>
<p>(This is how it will be&#8230;)</p>
<p>Hiro dropped his gaze to his hands and stared at the letter sent from the Muzuk family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>＊＊＊＊＊</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that the meeting was over, Hiro stepped out of the antechamber into the hallway and began to walk in silence.</p>
<p>Many nobles were hurriedly running past him and then running away. There was a variety of fervour that could be felt from the people in this hallway.</p>
<p>The Central nobles with territories close to the west were in a state of agitation, while the northern nobles who lived far away from the Central nobles had a heavy gait as if it was none of their business.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s a huge atmosphere difference when it comes to this war.)</p>
<p>Until now, they have only fought localized battles.</p>
<p>This is the first national-scale war involving all of the Grantz, and most people think it&#8217;s just a fire on the other side of the river. People do not feel threatened until they themselves are affected, so the nobles do not panic unless there is a danger to their territory.</p>
<p>This is why there is such an atmosphere difference.</p>
<p>In other words, the nobles who have enjoyed peace for so long do not have a sense of crisis.</p>
<p>(In short, they are spoiled by peace.)</p>
<p>That is why they are too stupid to deal with national crises. They have become lax in their thinking.</p>
<p>When Hiro found the group of nobles chatting, he became even more grumpy.</p>
<p>Hiro tried to leave the place quickly, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiro, wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice drew him to look behind him, and he saw Liz standing there with her hands on her hips. She had a puffy but charming face that soothed the anger raging in Hiro&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t just what&#8217;s wrong me. Are you sure you can manage with only twenty thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said in the military council, I&#8217;ll just buy some time until we can gather our forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you serious?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz closed in on him. Hiro retreated, startled by the beauty that loomed before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m serious. As you can see, it&#8217;s a bit brutal to go up against 150,000 people.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro stroked his eye patch to hide his embarrassment, Liz poked her finger at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not do anything dangerous. When I&#8217;m done with the Steichen Republic, I&#8217;ll definitely come back, and you can wait quietly until then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. I&#8217;ll be waiting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro smiled, but Liz&#8217;s eyes were fixed on him as if she were looking at a suspicious person.</p>
<p>Liz has become more suspicious of Hiro lately.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that she doesn&#8217;t trust him. It&#8217;s just that she doesn&#8217;t take Hiro&#8217;s words with as much conviction as she used to. After examining and thinking things through in her own way, she began to say her own thoughts instead of agreeing with them outright.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good for the future, but it&#8217;s not good for this situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. When you head south, I want you to take Ghada and the others with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hugin and Munin too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz frowned quizzically at that. Hiro smiled and told her the reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Raven Army is currently returning to the Berg Fortress, recovering from their injuries. I want you to bring them with you when you come back to the Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll just bring them. I think it would be better if Ghada and the others stayed with Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Raven Army was originally mercenaries. You know they&#8217;re made up of roughnecks. They might not listen to Liz. I want you to take Ghada and the others with you in case that happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inwardly, he thought of the exact opposite but didn&#8217;t say it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, I want you to mediate between the Fourth Imperial Army and the commanders of the Raven Army. That way, they will feel more secure in knowing that they can rely on you, and it will be easier for them to work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll buy you some time until then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz nodded and made a difficult face. She looked up at him as if she wanted to say something as if she had something on her mind. Hiro sensed that and gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to worry. You can surely defeat the Steichen Republic. You&#8217;ll be fine even without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her his approval, but Liz&#8217;s mouth twitched in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, she was still reeling from her defeat against the first prince Stobel. The most important reason why she does not have complete confidence in herself ― in order to get rid of it, it will be necessary to take forceful measures.</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t worry. I have an idea&#8230; I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll get over the hardship.)</p>
<p>Hiro kept his thoughts to himself and decided to dodge the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. So, you just keep walking and don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a path for that. Give her enough confidence to break through her doubts. That&#8217;s what Liz needs for the day she rises to the sky and becomes the sun.</p>
<p>Liz couldn&#8217;t hide her anxiety, but Hiro assured her that any further words would be meaningless.</p>
<p>If it was the actual battle that made her lose her confidence, then it was only the actual battle that could make her regain it.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, how is Skaaha&#8217;s condition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t regained consciousness yet, though the doctor told me that she would wake up soon. Also, the wound seems to be healing well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I want you to tell her to remain here when she wakes up. She might say she&#8217;ll have to go with you, but you have to force her. She needs to prioritize her recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skaaha was badly injured in the battle against Stobel and the Fallen Ones.</p>
<p>She was not fatally injured because of the protection of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Sword, but if she had been an ordinary person, she might have been bedridden.</p>
<p>When she woke up, she would say that she would go with Liz since she had made a pact with Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a stubborn person and won&#8217;t easily give up, but if Liz can convince her, I don&#8217;t think Skaaha will be able to say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Skaaha needs to be healed first, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro gave a small laugh and then patted Liz on the shoulder, forcing the conversation to end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I can&#8217;t waste any more time. There are people in the west who are still being tormented by the Six Kingdoms as we speak. Let&#8217;s get ready right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes. I&#8217;ll let you know when I&#8217;m ready to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Liz&#8217;s puzzled reply, Hiro walked past her.</p>
<p>He then turned his back on Liz and began to walk down the hallway.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hiro?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her sad voice never reached Hiro but melted into the empty silence.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>In the Grantz Empire, there are several places that only certain people are allowed to enter.</p>
<p>One of them is the site of the former Imperial Palace ― a vacant lot behind the Imperial Palace Venetain.</p>
<p>The building was torn down after a horrific incident that occurred fifteen years ago. Even now, nothing is being built, and there is a gaping hole in the vast land.</p>
<p>The other is the tomb of the emperors. It is rumored to be located under the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>(Is this an area that only the current and next emperors are allowed to enter&#8230;?)</p>
<p>In the evening, in the corridor where the horrific incident occurred, the sound of footsteps echoed uneasily, perhaps due to the lack of people passing by.</p>
<p>When Hiro arrived in front of the place he was looking for ― the guest room, two men appeared and bowed to him.</p>
<p>One was Prime Minister Gils, and the other was the leader of the tomb guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming, Your Highness Hiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason Hiiro had come here ― he had been summoned by Prime Minister Gils, who was standing right in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, there were intruders in the emperor&#8217;s cemetery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that someone has taken advantage of the chaos to infiltrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils said as soon as he raised his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really ashamed of myself. I will take whatever punishment I can get for this blunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard, who was standing next to Prime Minister Gils, fell to his knees and apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please take me to the emperor&#8217;s cemetery first. Can you tell me about the damage along the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Right this way, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the leader of the tomb guard stood up and turned away, Prime Minister Gils turned to face Hiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take my leave here, then. Only members of the royal family are allowed in the cemetery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, I understand. Thank you for your efforts, Prime Minister Gils.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be leaving now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gils bowed and left.</p>
<p>Hiro was staring at his back ― or rather, his lost shoulder.</p>
<p>(That clown&#8230; I wish I could cut his head off right here and now.)</p>
<p>The urge to kill, the anger rising from the depths of his heart, almost painted his head. However, by beating his chest and repeating his breathing, he was able to release the heat and catch his breath.</p>
<p>(If I beat him here, the body would escape. He&#8217;s only a tail, after all.)</p>
<p>The first prince Stobel, Prime Minister Gils, and many others are corrupting this country.</p>
<p>But even they, who are at the center of the nation that dominates the central continent, are just the tail. There is no end to the curiosity of what is going on with the body covered in darkness and the head that lies beyond it.</p>
<p>(I will definitely drag them out. Until then, you can wait and laugh.)</p>
<p>Hiro smiled eerily and stared into the darkness that pervaded the depths of the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Your Highness Hiro, this way, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro came back to his senses when the leader of the tomb guard called out to him, and he followed him.</p>
<p>The underground cemetery where successive emperors are laid to rest is located in the corner of the imperial palace called the &#8220;Passage of Nothingness.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are several hidden doors, and some rooms have traps for intruders, making it a place that cannot be entered carelessly. Above all, it was impossible to even set foot in the place without the emperor&#8217;s permission. But now that the emperor was dead and the &#8220;Wind&#8221; was gone, no eyes were watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do not touch the walls. I can&#8217;t guarantee your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard warned Hiro, who was looking around curiously.</p>
<p>Hiro withdrew his hand from the wall and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see; there are traps in the wall as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he didn&#8217;t know the trap&#8217;s power, it would be better not to touch it.</p>
<p>Hiro, who was protected by the Black Princess Camellia, would be safe, but the thought of what would happen to the leader of the tomb guard who was caught in the trap frightened him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, the leader of the tomb guard stopped in front of a plain wall.</p>
<p>A heavy sound echoed through the air when he touched it, and the cold air blew against the skin.</p>
<p>The next thing Hiro knew, a staircase leading to the basement appeared in front of him. The walls were covered with torches, dimly lit but bright enough for him to see his feet.</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard led the way down the stairs, and after following his crooked back, a long passage appeared. The darkness enveloped them, and it was hard to see what lay ahead, but the leader of the tomb guard proceeded without hesitation.</p>
<p>On the way, there was a heavily damaged corpse lying on the ground, probably from a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Seeing that Hiro had noticed it, the leader of the tomb guard opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re my subordinates, the tomb guards. They were killed by intruders.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was more than one corpse. There were two, then five, then eight more as they walked down the passageway.</p>
<p>Hiro suddenly noticed something strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single body of the intruders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a disappointing story&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard muttered in frustration.</p>
<p>Hiro didn&#8217;t know the capabilities of the people under his command, but since they were entrusted with guarding the cemetery where successive emperors were laid to rest, they must be competent. However, they were defeated without being able to defeat any of the intruders.</p>
<p>As the leader of the family that has guarded the cemetery for generations, he must feel nothing but shame.</p>
<p>The damaged corpse gave Hiro a sense of déjà vu, and the existence of a group of assassins hiding in the darkness came to his mind.</p>
<p>(Black Death Village, the assassination group that once had the emperor in its clutches)</p>
<p>He recalled that the man who was the lord of the satellite city of Zuik had been killed by the same means. The method of gouging out both eyes and destroying the brain was so cruel that it made him want to throw up, and beside the body was a creepy mud doll without a head.</p>
<p>(Imitating the figure known as &#8220;Father.&#8221;&#8230;)</p>
<p>Although he doesn&#8217;t know what this means, he feels that something appeals to him.</p>
<p>The emotions that seep out are rage, hatred, and obsession. But he can&#8217;t find the answer. It was as if he had lost his way in the bushes and could not grasp anything.</p>
<p>Unable to find the answer, Hiro eventually exited the passage.</p>
<p>It was a vast space.</p>
<p>Even if he looked up, he could not see anything beyond the darkness. Only the area where the torches could reach shone brightly, and the place where the light could not reach was an abyss, as if once entering, one could never come out again.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand years ago, according to mythology, this place was ruled by one of the Five Great Heavenly Kings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard told Hiro as he looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lone and most fearsome &#8216;Black Dragon King&#8217; who has spread fear throughout the world. When he appeared to the world, everyone shuddered in fear, and every race was on the verge of extinction in the face of his overwhelming power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard began to walk slowly as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the most fearsome of them all, the Black Dragon King, was defeated by a single hero. Since then, this place has been ruled by the human race, and a capital city has been set up on the surface. Later, the first emperor, Altius, who realized his own mortality, designated the crypt as the resting place of the emperors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard added at the end that it was the most sacred place in the Grand Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so much warmer underground than it is above ground, where winter has arrived. Was it because the power of the ‘King’ still lingered, or was it the air created by the strange hills that lined the vast space?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..By the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro muttered in a voice that did not show any emotion and then changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask why I was called here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a descendant of the God of War, Your Highness Hiro has the right to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it has to be Your Highness Hiro, a descendant of the second Emperor Schwartz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The right to know&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard stopped and moved his arm in front of Hiro&#8217;s question mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Your Highness noticed the hills that dot the emperor&#8217;s cemetery?&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard pointed out, and Hiro looked around again.</p>
<p>As he had been told, the ground had risen in many places, forming a kind of hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to folklore, the hills were named &#8220;Thousand Hills&#8221; in the hope that the prosperity of the nation would last for a thousand generations, and on each hill, the emperors of the past have slept.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>And behind us</i> ― said the leader of the tomb guardian, turning around and bowing his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the tomb of the second emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hill covered with grass. The grass was neatly trimmed, and it was clear that it had been tended regularly.</p>
<p>There was a large fence around it, decorated with glittering jewels.</p>
<p>At what seemed to be the entrance to the hill was a large hollow.</p>
<p>However, the area around it was extremely unnatural.</p>
<p>For some reason, only the entrance was blocked by rubble, while the surrounding area was neatly organized. At a glance, it was obvious. Someone had wrecked the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally, there was a door and a coffin inside&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If it had been destroyed artificially, the scene would be exactly what he imagined when he entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this some kind of grave robbery to take advantage of the chaos on the surface?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro concluded, but the leader of the tomb guard tilted his head suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, I thought it was the work of grave robbers too, but the strange thing is that nothing was stolen, except for one thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard rifled through his pockets and offered him something.</p>
<p>&#8220;The body of the second emperor was the only thing that was stolen, not a single piece of jewelry. Instead, this was found in the coffin.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of his wrinkled hands was a headless mud doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the other cemeteries? Has anything been stolen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the mud doll with his cold eyes and then looked at the leader of the tomb guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the rest of the cemetery is safe. Only the tomb of the second emperor was vandalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t take any jewelry, but only the body of the second emperor. It seems that this was not a crime of grave robbery.</p>
<p>But before that, he was still alive and had not been in the tomb. There was nobody in the coffin.</p>
<p>If there was a body, it probably belonged to someone else who was placed there as a substitute.</p>
<p>What is more mysterious is why they targeted the tomb of the second emperor.</p>
<p>(Is it the Black Death Village, plotting to resurrect the Father&#8230;?)</p>
<p>Hiro looked again at the mud doll in his hands.</p>
<p>At that moment, a chill ran down his spine, and he instantly took a sharp look at his surroundings. The space begins to creak under the pressure of the enormous amount of energy being dispersed.</p>
<p>He took threatening action in case there were any hostiles present, but the leader of the tomb guard was unable to withstand it. He pressed his chest in agony and fell to one knee on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Hiro confirmed that there was no one lurking in the darkness, he suppressed the murderous intent at one level. But he never let his guard down.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, Hiro repeated his breathing and stopped his gaze at a particular place.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;W-what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard also looked at the same place, but there was only space.</p>
<p>The sudden release of murderous intent caused a large amount of sweat to appear on the face of the leader of the tomb guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro said it was nothing, but his black eyes did not waver one bit. They were pointed at the same place the whole time.</p>
<p>Darkness coiled quietly there, dark and somber as if refusing intruders.</p>
<p>Hiro&#8217;s murderous intent was more subdued than before, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what have you found?&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard asked as if he was suspicious, seeing that Hiro was still as alert as ever.</p>
<p>Hiro checked his expression with a sideways glance, then muttered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the cemetery of the first emperor?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the cemetery of the first emperor?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this question, the leader of the tomb guard pasted tension on his wrinkled face. Hiro wondered at the strange reaction but finally returned his gaze to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask you once again, where is the cemetery of the first emperor?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>No falsehoods are allowed.</i> As he said this, his voice was filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard bowed his head and spat out the words in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know. It is said that the cemetery of the first emperor appears only to the one who is chosen to be the next emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not lie. His body trembled from extreme nervousness, and there was no sense of deception. He must have been telling the truth. If he didn&#8217;t know, there was no point in questioning him.</p>
<p>Then, the only thing to do would be to go and check out the strange presence he&#8217;s been feeling for a while now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to check for any other traces of intruders. You don&#8217;t mind, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if sensing from Hiro&#8217;s words that he wanted to be left alone, the leader of the tomb guard stood up, took a moment to catch his breath, and then paused to think about what he was going to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I apologize, but I must take my leave now. I have to dispose of the bodies of my unworthy disciples and establish a new security system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ve learned the way, so I&#8217;m fine. You can go outside first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you need anything, just call out to me, and I&#8217;ll be here as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the tomb guard bowed repeatedly and walked away quickly.</p>
<p>After watching his bent back, Hiro began to walk to investigate the identity of the gaze.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he walked into the darkness ― towards the presence he had felt earlier.</p>
<p>Soon, a large rock appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The height was probably three times Hiro&#8217;s height, and the width was so wide that he couldn&#8217;t see the edges.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is strange&#8230; I have not seen such a huge rock before, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked back over his shoulder and saw that he was surrounded by darkness. He looked around, and the result was the same.</p>
<p><i>It didn&#8217;t seem like much of a walk, but&#8230; was there some kind of force at work?</i></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Though it is not surprising that Altius would have some strange tricks up his sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro chuckled and held out his hand to the rock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The moment the fingertips touched, a strange thing happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An erratic white light appears on the rock&#8217;s surface, flows towards the ground, falls, and pops.</p>
<p>It was weak like raindrops, yet it was divine, and it was repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>Light and dark alternately flickered across the world, striking a melancholy note in the hearts of all who saw it.</p>
<p>Eventually, the light began to change colors.</p>
<p>From black to white, from white to red, from red to gold.</p>
<p>The dazzling gold color covered Hiro&#8217;s vision and stained the darkness of the world with gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still&#8230; fancy as ever, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>While closing his eyes against the brightness, Hiro couldn&#8217;t help but relax his mouth in nostalgia. He felt the light converging on him. The darkness covers the world again, just as it did before.</p>
<p>When Hiro opened his eyes again, what appeared in front of him was a void.</p>
<p>Even if he looked into it, he would not be able to see beyond. But the feeling that welled up in his chest was not fear but a sense of relief that somehow put his mind at ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; let&#8217;s see what that gaze is all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro stepped out without hesitation and went inside.</p>
<p>The view of the world changes.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a complete change.</p>
<p>It was as if he had wandered into a different world, and the scene that unfolded before him was mysterious.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..How can you create a space like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a field of flowers. The entire area was covered with brightly colored flowers in full bloom.</p>
<p>When he looked up, the sun&#8217;s rays were streaming in, enveloping the world in a dazzling array of colors.</p>
<p>But there was one thing in particular that drew his attention.</p>
<p>Buried among the flowers, it stood out in the center of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>――A golden coffin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Haha, what a bad taste. It&#8217;s just like you, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro unconsciously said the words, a gentle wind blew.</p>
<p>As the wind dances away, caressing the body, he feels a slight sense of regret.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..You came, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt a presence and turned around to see a young man standing there, looking as if he was in peace.</p>
<p>Leon Werth Altius von Grantz.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the first emperor of the Grantz Empire, and he&#8217;s Hiro&#8217;s brother-in-law. However, it was clear that it was not him, despite the resemblance in appearance.</p>
<p>His entire body emitted a faint glow. When captured by the &#8220;Heavenly Spirit Eye,&#8221; it was clear that he was a collection of spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how you found this place. It&#8217;s not a place you can find with half-hearted determination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altius began to speak indifferently, his voice sounding machine-like.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of residual thoughts in this place. Strong feelings, no matter how many years pass, do not fade and remain forever. Therefore, by taking them into themselves, the spirits express the thoughts and wishes of the emperors and pass them on to future generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The theatrical tone of voice, combined with the lack of expression on his face, made him seem somewhat ridiculous.</p>
<p>From Hiro&#8217;s perspective, even though he knew the person himself, he could not help but feel uncomfortable, even though he was a collection of spirits.</p>
<p>Without noticing Hiro&#8217;s feelings, Altius, still expressionless, spread his arms to emphasize his presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been chosen for a severe ordeal. You have been chosen as a person who is worthy of inheriting the thoughts of the emperors of the past, of carrying on the work of the Grantz Empire, of the inevitable fate of the emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altius pointed to a place.</p>
<p>When he looked over, a man was hanging his head in front of a golden coffin.</p>
<p>His profile reminded him of Altius. Hiro tilted his head at the familiar face, but his thoughts stopped when he noticed the tears rolling down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father&#8230; please forgive me. I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m&#8230; His Majesty Schwartz, please forgive me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, a little farther away, a red-haired man holding four treasured swords that looked like the Five Emperors of Spirit Swords was standing proudly, staring at the golden coffin with a fearless look on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this chaotic time, many thoughts are swirling around. It seems to be foolishly trying to consume everything else. If this is karma, then let me slay it all and lead the Grantz Empire to greater heights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another man appears next to the man who made the heroic statement.</p>
<p>Hiro had seen him before.</p>
<p>How could he forget?</p>
<p>He was Liz&#8217;s father, the previous emperor who had been assassinated, Greyheit himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aah&#8230; why&#8230; Why&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He slumped back and sobbed. He exudes fragile supremacy that is unbecoming of an emperor.</p>
<p>In his arms, a baby with red hair was asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz&#8230; oh&#8230; Liz&#8230; forgive me&#8230; for not protecting your mother&#8230; please forgive your foolish father&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stroked the baby&#8217;s cheek lovingly, his eyes twisted with sadness. Hiro could feel the love and affection that was unimaginable when he was alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Majesty Altius, please don&#8217;t choose this child as your only choice&#8230; please give her a life free from war, please give her a life of peace and tranquility.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was filled with anguish, like a cry of the soul ― an outpouring of thoughts from the bottom of the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a sacrifice is necessary for that, I will bear the brunt of it and offer my body. Please, please protect my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were those who spoke of repentance, those who declared their power, and those who offered prayers.</p>
<p>A variety of residual thoughts is gathered here. Hiro had a headache and fell to his knees on the ground.</p>
<p>Anger, sadness, joy, hatred, and a host of other emotions mingled, knotted together and melted away. There was an enormous amount of information in this space where the first Emperor Altius slept.</p>
<p>Even Hiro, who possessed the &#8220;Heavenly Spirit Eye,&#8221; could not process the number of emotions flowing into his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who step into this place have the right to know everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro held his aching eyes as he looked at Altius, who was a collection of spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you how much you know and how much you can read, but I want you to be prepared for the coming &#8216;turning point.'&#8221;</p>
<p>They are very similar in that they say whatever they want and then try to disappear, even though it is not the person himself. Hiro didn&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because the spirit is impatient or just because the words to say are predetermined from the start. Either way, the explanation was insufficient to understand the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to take over my will, please. That&#8217;s all I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these last words, the collection of spirits dispersed.</p>
<p>A gust of wind erupted into the sky with a loud roar as it blew through the passage.</p>
<p>Hiro looked at the sky to see it off, but when he loosened his collar, he let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; but I still have to do something to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he was groping&#8230; he had to find the answer.</p>
<p>This is not fate but inevitability.</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, he parted ways with this world, and now he has returned, and by his presence, he must bear the responsibility of distorting the logic of this world.</p>
<p>Feeling his eyes tingling less than before, Hiro stood up and walked to the golden coffin. It was a plain coffin with only a few elaborate decorations to show its majesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I open it? I don&#8217;t want to see Altius&#8217; mummy, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hiro struggled to decide what to do, a strange object appeared at the edge of his vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an old book on the table.</p>
<p>He took it in his hand, examined the contents, and found that the power of the spirits was flowing into it.</p>
<p>It seemed to have been incorporated into the book itself so that the paper would not decay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incidentally, he was practicing his handwriting in case he wanted to leave something for the future&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro traced his finger over the masterful handwriting with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Altius&#8217;s handwriting ― in short, the journal of the first emperor.</p>
<p>At first, the contents were familiar to Hiro.</p>
<p>However, as he continued to read, Hiro noticed the strange timeline, and eventually, a book came to his mind. Hiro took out the &#8220;Book of White&#8221; that he had stored in the Black Princess Camellia.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Two books make one book. I guess that means it&#8217;s complete. I should have kept the Book of Black with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiro spread the two books out on the golden coffin and slowly turned the pages as if to compare them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>At the same time, when Hiro is pondering deep underground.</p>
<p>In the Felzen region, in the southwestern part of the former De jure territory, at Fort Mitte.</p>
<p>The sky, which had been clear and sunny, is now dominated by clouds. The world was covered with low, mousy clouds that made one&#8217;s heart uneasy.</p>
<p>The old De jure territory was the battleground where, a few months ago, Princess Skaaha of the Felzen Kingdom and Aura, known as the &#8220;War Maiden&#8221; of the Grantz Empire, had fought a fierce battle.</p>
<p>And the most fierce battle ground was at Fort Mitte.</p>
<p>Fort Mitte was built to protect the people from the monsters that spread in the foothills of the Travant Mountains, but it lost sight of its original purpose after the fall of the Felzen Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, even after many battles, the sturdy fortress did not collapse and continued to stare westward, but its function as a bulwark was completely lost due to the invasion of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Its cruel appearance could be described as a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>Completely collapsed walls, burning buildings, and a large number of burnt corpses filled the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The smell of burnt iron and rust dominates the area, and new bodies are thrown into the piles of corpses that have been built. The ground, unable to absorb the blood, had formed a large puddle of blood.</p>
<p>Yet, the battle continues because there are still people everywhere who continue to resist.</p>
<p>They know that their futile resistance will soon come to an end.</p>
<p>But still, a girl couldn&#8217;t help but speak out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a foolish thing to do when all that awaits them is suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl who was looking at the dust rising from the battlefield said unhappily. Surrounded by strong soldiers, the girl unfolded her iron fan as if to ward off the smell of death.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a waste of time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are that desperate. They don&#8217;t want to give up control of Fort Mitte, which they took from the Felzen remnants. Well, it hasn&#8217;t been preserved in its original form.</p>
<p>Her aide, a young officer, smiled at her. As he looked out at the horrific battlefield, his smile seemed cruel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third prince of the Grantz Empire, I was expecting you to be a very determined man, but you&#8217;re so boring and disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone of her voice showed her dissatisfaction without hiding it. The contempt in her gaze was directed at the man sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not very strong. You are neither good nor bad, and you are not the holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords. You&#8217;re making up for your lack of ability with your head, yet you&#8217;re just brutally attacking with brute force. I can&#8217;t hide my disappointment. Why do I have to deal with such a boring man?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl lamented as she stroked the iron fan in her hand.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the third prince Blutar?&#8221;</p>
<p>A flamboyantly dressed, bald man ― the third prince Blutar ― makes a bitter face.</p>
<p>If the nobles in the great imperial capital saw his shabby appearance, tied up with a rope, they would be speechless. They might fall over in disgust or in anger born out of loyalty.</p>
<p>However, the third prince Blutar stared stoutly and fiercely, as if he would not lose his dignity even if he was captured, and then looked at the coat of arms flag with a snake on it beside the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen that flag before. You&#8217;re from Anguis, aren&#8217;t you&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know that? Then do you know the name of the current king?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, I can hardly remember the name of the frontier king who lives in the far west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha, this is amusing. A frontier king is a funny thing to say&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled happily, but her eyes were not so kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gogaahh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the girl&#8217;s arm went hazy, the third prince Blutar&#8217;s body was blown away. He bounced several times on the ground, spewing blood and vomit as he rolled along the ground.</p>
<p>The girl rose from her chair and approached the third prince Blutar, who was covered in dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you my name. You may imprint it on your body along with the pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl instructed the soldier with her chin and made the third prince Blutar, who was suffering from extreme pain, stand up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucia Levia de Anguis. I am the queen of Anguis, one of the six countries you ridicule as a frontier.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spread her iron fan to cover her mouth, and her beautiful eyebrows raised in amusement.</p>
<p>Her appearance is very queenly and full of divine atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kukuku, I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t notice that you were one of the frontier kings. I thought you were just a prostitute blending in with the battlefield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..You fool, watch your words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gofuhh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar&#8217;s jaw shot up in an unseen and rapid attack. From his open mouth, several teeth covered the sky, along with fresh blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oaahh, gfunnuhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>He may have tried to clench his teeth to endure the pain, but a great deal of blood poured out of the gap between his missing teeth. As his knee was not strong enough to resist gravity, the third prince Blutar slumped to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guh ― You bastard&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar glared at Lucia with indignant eyes while his face was distorted by intense pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, you&#8217;ve made a good face; I like it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, you should refrain from playing with him; he&#8217;s a valuable prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fumu, it&#8217;s so annoying. So annoying to have to keep such a petty man alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the young officer rebuked her, Lucia tapped the tip of her iron fan against her brow in annoyance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no point in holding me as a hostage. It&#8217;s not like my father needs me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar muttered hatefully and then sneered at Lucia and the others.</p>
<p>Lucia laughed uncontrollably at this. It was the kind of laugh that could have sent her rolling if the ground hadn&#8217;t been covered in mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fukukuku, kuhaha, what are you saying? How lucky are you that you don&#8217;t know anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with her fingertips and replied, still choking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emperor is dead, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>What are you saying?</i> The third prince Blutar made a dumbfounded face as if to say so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unreasonable. It was known to him that the Krone family, one of the five great noble families, had risen in rebellion, but the higher-ups had concealed the emperor&#8217;s death. However, the result would have been the same even if they hadn&#8217;t hidden it because there was no way they could spare him the news of the battle against the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s not something for me to hide, I can explain it to you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bullshit! My father is dead, you say? What kind of nonsense is that? That man, that man! He&#8217;s the emperor of the world&#8217;s most powerful country, the Grantz Empire! He can&#8217;t be defeated by anyone!&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar interrupted Lucia&#8217;s words and let out his emotions. The straightforwardness with which he thinks of his father is dazzling, but the fact that he places such absolute trust in him is just a pity.</p>
<p>Even though he is an emperor, he is still a human being.</p>
<p>They are the most vulnerable of the five major races, with a short lifespan, a fleeting peak, and a high probability of dying from a minor injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords! Chosen by the Spirit King, the noblest person in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>His belief in spirits could only be described as blind faith. The Spirit King is one of the &#8220;Five Heavenly Kings,&#8221; but he is not an all-powerful god.</p>
<p>Spirits are beings that stay close to people, live with people, and protect people&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;To put it simply, the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords give power to their bearers in response to their thoughts. But that power is nothing more than a waste of treasure if the owner&#8217;s strength wanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emperor Greyheit&#8217;s prowess as a young man was well known to everyone. He was keen to achieve great things in his later years, but even a hero is no match for old age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that the first prince Stobel beheaded him, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230; my brother did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the words of the imperial gift, the holder of the Five Emperors of the Spirit Swords is the person chosen by the Spirit King, but isn&#8217;t the first prince Stobel the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar was so shocked that he looked down at the ground with a pale face.</p>
<p>Lucia&#8217;s words seem to have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was expecting more of a rant. I was expecting you to scream more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia had already received word that the emperor had been defeated and killed by the first prince Stobel. What was more curious was the existence of the descendant of the God of War.</p>
<p>It was astonishing. After a thousand years, the descendant of a hero has been discovered, and despite being vague, she feels that the times are beginning to move.</p>
<p>The abominable &#8220;Nameless&#8221; reports that he is sure it is him, but it is hard to believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I thought the pact was already over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia looked down at the translucent veins in her arm. Bloodlines are a tricky thing. Even if it was a long time ago, it is imprinted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What to do&#8230; There is nothing more difficult to deal with than the descendant of the hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will he be the one to usher in a new era, or will he be the savior who brings back the past?</p>
<p>At that moment ― the snake&#8217;s crest flag, stirred by the wind, brought Lucia&#8217;s consciousness back.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m a little deep in thought. I&#8217;ll think about it later. I think I should decide what to do with you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia smiled self-mockingly and unfolded her iron fan to cover the lower half of her face.</p>
<p>Her cold gaze is directed at the third prince Blutar, who is kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty Queen Lucia, have you decided on the treatment of the third prince Blutar?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young officer asks without losing his smile. Lucia nodded in response to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to the west of the Grantz Empire, so there will be times when we can use his value. You can interrogate him for a while and try to squeeze out some useful information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young officer gave a look to the aides, and the third prince Blutar was held from both sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be prepared&#8230; it&#8217;s not a simple matter. The Grantz Empire is a great champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third prince Blutar asserted even though his face was distorted by intense pain. His strength of mind is dazzling, but his baseless confidence is irritating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope we can pass the boredom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia sat down in her chair and said goodbye to the third prince Blutar.</p>
<p>&#8220;The existence of the third prince Blutar is useful. I&#8217;ve heard that there are still some nobles in the west of Grantz who are resisting fiercely. To remind them that it&#8217;s useless, why don&#8217;t we collar him and let him walk around as a spectacle during the march?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seleucus, can&#8217;t you do something about your bad taste?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia glared at the young officer Seleucus in a disturbed manner, but he cowered aloof.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was a good idea, but&#8230; many people hold the Grantz family sacred. If they see a prince being treated like a slave, there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll show reverence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll accept that as an option. So, what&#8217;s the status of the war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The control of the area around Fort Mitte is almost complete. The prisoners are probably close to 30,000. What should we do, take them with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will only slow down the march, it won’t benefit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keeping up with Seleucus&#8217; jokes, Lucia put her iron fan to her chin and snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umu, yes. We&#8217;ve got to get rid of the heads of those who are connected to the Grantz family. Since the third prince Blutar is in our custody, we don&#8217;t need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Then what should we do with the rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contact the home country. Those who can be ransomed will be taken away, and those who cannot will be sold as slaves to other countries. The rest can be executed as an example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia, her eyes shining with determination, unfolded her iron fan.</p>
<p>Then she pointed to the Grantz Empire in a distant land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will march, proclaiming the liberation of Felzen, and win the support and cooperation of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, will you rejoin the infamous Urpeth siblings?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucia nodded lightly in response to Seleucus&#8217; question as if to confirm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about leaving it to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the western part of Grantz has not been burned to the ground. The older sister is calm and collected, but the younger brother is too belligerent and troublesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability of the Urpeth siblings is certain. There is no doubt about it. That&#8217;s why we let them work together. And they won&#8217;t be too reckless. They know their position very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stolen throne, huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus&#8217;s muttering was small. It was so small that it was overshadowed by the sounds of the battlefield.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. The Urpeth siblings are geniuses. However, they are only ordinary geniuses&#8230; The real genius is that woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The person who comes into Lucia&#8217;s mind ― a military skill and an intellectual ability no one else can match. She is the closest person to the unified king in the Six Kingdoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;In front of her, the people who are praised as geniuses become ordinary people in general. The transcendent figure that reduces a genius to an ordinary person ― that existence itself is&#8230; a foul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus also made a bitter smile, perhaps thinking of the same person, and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even me, who was said to be the next unified king, was forced to lick her wounds. She deserved what she got for sitting on her laurels, but it&#8217;s ridiculous that she&#8217;s become so hungry for battle results.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four royal families have already supported her. If all goes according to plan, she will be the next unified king.</p>
<p>Lucia stood up and looked at the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to leave immediately?&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to Seleucus&#8217; question, Lucia clutched her iron fan and replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umu. If we neglect the siblings for too long, I won&#8217;t get any more achievements for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, isn&#8217;t Your Majesty Queen Lucia thinking the same thing&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seleucus chuckled, and Lucia slammed her iron fan on his shoulder, making a loud noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve got no more worries about the future, let&#8217;s go see the &#8216;old king&#8217; in all his glory.&#8221;</p>
