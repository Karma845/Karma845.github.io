<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Reason for the Dream</h3>

<div>"Rintaro....... Are you okay?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Mm......? Yeah, I'm fine." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't think so, though." (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yukio, sitting in the seat in front of me, looked into my face with a worried expression.</div><div>The time was past 10:30 when I turned on my phone.</div><div>It seemed that the third period was next.</div><div>Considering the fact that I couldn't remember anything up to this point, it seemed that I had slept from the time I arrived at school until now.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What's wrong with you? You seem to be getting more and more tired every day for the past few days." (Yukio)</div><div>"Nothing, I just started my part-time again yesterday, but I was busy with packing....... Sorry, but can I copy your notes later?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's okay, but......are you moving?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Yeah. There's a little bit of a situation....... The school will be close by, so if I can get through this, life will be a lot easier." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Oh, I see. Then, I'd better not ask you to hang out for a while." (Yukio)</div><div>"Sorry for that." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't mind. I think you should go to the infirmary and get some sleep. You still look sleepy." (Yukio)</div><div>"No, I've been perfect attendance. I don't want to end that record here. So I'll sleep here." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What are you talking about? You can't sleep even if you're attending." (Yukio)</div><div>"What......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Look, the third and fourth period is home economics cooking class."</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I completely forgot.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I went to the home economics room and looked at the menu on the blackboard.</div><div>It seemed to be hamburger steak, egg soup, and a salad.</div><div>Since rice is included, it will make the stomach feel fuller.</div><div>Shot, I've taken out to the usual I made a lunch-box.</div><div><br /></div><div>"There are no...... absentees, right? I'm going to ask you to work in groups of six now. The ingredients have been placed on each table, so please cook according to the instructions I will give you. The group that finishes the dish can have it first."</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as the home economics teacher gave the instruction, the classmates who had been standing in a random line began to move in a hurry. A group of six, huh...... honestly, that's a pain in the a*s.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rintaro, let's make a&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Yukio)</div><div>"Inaba-kun! Would you like to join our group......?"</div><div>"Eh......?" (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>A group of five girls called out to Yukio who was next to me.</div><div>There was one girl in the mix who had been apparently in love with Yukio for some time.</div><div>I believe it was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;yes, Miyamoto. I see, the other four seem to want to support her love.</div><div><br /></div><div>"B, but......" (Yukio)</div><div>"Go ahead. Even if two of us get together, gathering the four others is more hassle, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"W, well, it's true...... I've been wanting to see Rintaro cook after a while now, though." (Yukio)</div><div>"I'll show you when you come to my place again." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah...... okay." (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>With a somewhat depressing look, Yukio joined the group of five girls.</div><div>He's probably the only high school boy in this class who doesn't like being asked out by girls.</div><div>Well, me too, I guess.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Now then......, Shall I look for a place where I can mix with them?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I turned my back on Yukio and his group and look around.</div><div>Groups of only girls, groups of only boys, and other groups have already gathered six members.</div><div>But there's no need to rush. There are thirty-six of us in this class, so we'll always be able to fit into one of the groups.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, Shidou! If you haven't decided yet, why don't you join our group?"</div><div>"Mmm?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I turned around after being called, the first thing I saw was a dazzlingly fresh face.</div><div>Kakihara Yuusuke, a legitimately handsome guy who is known to be the most popular among the second-year girls.</div><div>According to what I heard, he was recently scouted by a modeling agency.</div><div>We've been in the same class since freshman year, and my impression of him is that he's just a "nice guy". He's so nice that I feel uncomfortable getting along with him. When I'm around him, all the ugly parts of me come to the fore.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kakihara-kun. Are you sure okay with me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup, of course. There were just five of us here. So there's one left." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Oh, really? Well, I guess I'll take your word for it." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thank goodness! Here, this way." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kakihara took me to a table where the four members who had already gathered were sitting.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The last member has been found! Thank goodness." (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>The woman with long black hair who gave me a gentle smile was Nikaido Azusa. She is the representative of Class 2A.</div><div>She's a beautiful Japanese woman with a different orientation than Rei, and although she seemed to be bad at sports, she excels in study to the point that I'd never seen her ranked lower than fifth in a regular exam last year.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oh! Umm......I'm pretty sure, right! Shidou-kun! I'm sorry, but I still can't remember the names of my new classmates."</div><div><br /></div><div>The brown-haired gal sitting next to Nikaido is Nogi Honoka.</div><div>She always wears her school uniform sloppy because the school rules are lax, drawing the eyes of boys. I didn't see her name in last year's regular exam rankings, so I don't get the impression that she can study well, but she has good athletic skills. I often see her wowing the students around during gym class.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, whatever the case may be, the gender ratio is now just right!"&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The man who smiles cheerfully is Doumoto Ryuji.</div><div>He's the biggest guy in the second year, and he's in the judo club. So, he is the number one guy you don't want to fight with. Incidentally, I only have the impression that he slept during class. According to what I heard, he almost got a red mark in the regular exam last year.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kakihara, Nikaido, Nogi, and Domoto. These four are the people who are in the highest caste in my eyes. I often saw them four together, and they seemed to hang out together on their days off as well.</div><div>Why do I know so much about them&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I'm not a stalker, but this much information is probably common knowledge among the second-year students.</div><div>This is how prominent they are.</div><div>This's a group of good-looking boys and girls.</div><div><br /></div><div>And the last one before me was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ri...... Shidou-kun, nice to meet you." (Rei)</div><div>"......Otosaki-san. Yeah, nice to meet you." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki Rei. Well, there's no need to explain anymore, is there?</div><div>She was probably asked by Kakihara. As an unspoken rule, people in the lower caste are not allowed to talk to people in the upper caste.</div><div>Inevitably, the only people who can talk to Rei, who is in the top caste, are those who are in the top caste as well. Of course, there is no clear rule, it's just that it's somehow difficult to approach them.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, let's all six of us do our best. Let's see...... is there anyone good at cooking?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Kakihara, who had naturally taken on the role of leader, looked around and asked.</div><div>But no hands went up.</div><div>I have a certain amount of confidence in my cooking skills, but I wasn't going to raise my hand here.</div><div>The most important thing in socializing with classmates is to be in the right position.</div><div>There is a possibility that there are people who don't like to boast or show off, so after a few tempos I'm going to reply, "I don't think I'm bad at it...... but if you ask me whether I'm good, I'm a little bit good".</div><div>I also don't want to be labeled as useless.</div><div>And Rei. Don't look at me with eyes like "Hurry, raise your hand".</div><div><br /></div><div>"Aa...I've made hamburger steak and that sort of thing before. It's not really my specialty, though." (Azusa)</div><div>"That's great, Azurin! The other day you brought me homemade cookies and they were so delicious! I was so surprised!" (Honoka)</div><div>"Y, you're overreacting, Honoka."&nbsp; (Azusa)</div><div>"Nope....... I saw in those cookies the qualities that will make you a good wife in the future. I'm totally sure of it because I said so!" (Honoka)</div><div>"Geez!" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>So this is how girls joke around. It's a little hard to keep up with.</div><div>I pretended to be smiling happily, but I also raised my hand fearfully.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I can do the basics too, I guess....... It's not like I have zero knowledge." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, that helps. It's not that I'm not good at it, but I've mostly only assisted. Then let's have Azusa and Shidou take the central role. For Honoka and Ryuji...... umm." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kakihara's eyes, with an indescribable expression, turned to Nogi and Doumoto.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Stop it! Don't give me that hopeless glance from the start!" (Honoka)</div><div>"Right, she's right! Yes, we indeed only specialize in eating, but it hurts to be judged from the start!" (Ryuji)</div><div>"What do you mean by "we"&#8265; I'm confident I can do better than you!" (Honoka)</div><div>"Bullsh*t! You burned the tip of your hair last Valentine's Day!" (Ryuji)</div><div>"Th, that was just a coincidence!" (Honoka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Certainly, these two had been in the same class since freshman. It's no wonder they're so close.</div><div><br /></div><div>'Leaving these two......how about you, Otosaki-san?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Me? I hardly ever cook&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Unpalatable. When I thought so, my mouth was opened.</div><div><br />
  
</div><div>"Speaking of which! I heard that you always make your own lunch, Otosaki-san? That's impressive! It must be hard every morning, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah...... Y, yes. I make my own lunch." (Rei)</div><div>"So you can cook. You don't have to be so modest." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked into Rei's eyes and reminded her "Don't make a scene". As expected, she sensed something and nodded several times in a way that only I could understand.</div><div><br /></div><div>"B, but...... I'm not so confident with hamburger steak, maybe." (Rei)</div><div>"In that case, I'd like you to focus on Shidou-kun and Azusa, as I said at the beginning. It would be great if you could help with each of them, Otosaki-san." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"I understand." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, following Kakihara's instructions, we moved on to our respective tasks.</div>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>The experienced ones among us, Nikaido and I, would be in charge of the main dish, the hamburger steak, while Rei and Kakihara would be in charge of the soup and rice.</div><div>By the way, Nogi and Duomoto were in charge of the salad, which did not involve fire.</div><div>Anyway, Nikaido and I would finish the preparation of the hamburgers as soon as possible and help them if they were in trouble. It's a pretty good division of labor.</div><div>I didn't know if Kakihara himself was aware of it, but I thought he was quite a capable leader.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You're really used to it, Shidou-kun." (Azusa)</div><div>"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You're so good at finely chopping onions, I'm a little surprised." (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked down at my hands.</div><div>The finely chopped onions were not all the same size, but they're not so uneven that you couldn't tell unless you looked closely.</div><div>Perhaps because I'd been doing this for years, I'd unconsciously done this.</div><div><br />
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i></div><div>"A, aah......, I personally like to prepare food. That's why I've been practicing a lot." (Rintaro)</div><div>"So that's it. I've always been bad at cutting....... See?" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I looked at Nikaido's hand, I saw that she was chopping onions into small pieces, which were certainly not very fine.</div><div>It's not that she was not good at it, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;she just seemed to be a little concerned about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You don't have to worry about it. It's small enough that you won't be able to tell once it's turned into a hamburger steak." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I wonder about it......" (Azusa)</div><div>"As long as the food tastes good, it's fine, unless you're in a restaurant. I think it's fine if the food tastes good to you or to the person you are feeding it to. Also, it's fun to make food according to your taste." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>The sound of the knife disappeared from Nikaido's side, and I looked at, curiously.</div><div>Then, for some reason, she was staring at me with a surprised look.</div><div><br />
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
</div><div>"Wh, what's wrong?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah...... It just, I just thought you had such a kind face, Shidou-kun." (Azusa)</div><div>"What?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I usually always tried to maintain a gentle face, though.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You usually look like you're trying to fit in with everyone else, but right now you seem very genuine." (Azusa)</div><div>"......Is that so?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah, S, sorry for it. I didn't mean to stare at you." (Azusa)</div><div>"No, it's fine, I don't mint it......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess it's not a fluke that she became the class representative.</div><div>She saw through me, even if she couldn't be sure, who usually tried to keep a low profile and maintain a good distance from others.</div><div>It didn't bother me that she could see through my real character, though.</div><div>The reason why I don't want to show my true self is that I'm afraid of exposing myself when I don't even know the person well.</div><div>If I am convinced that I can trust someone, like Yukio, I will be more than willing to talk to them without any pretense.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I really admire how good you are at what you do....... Did you learn that from your mother?" (Azusa) <b><i>(PTW/N: She stepped on a landmine.)</i></b></div><div>"......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>At that moment, I felt a sharp pain on the tip of my finger.</div><div>It seemed that I had cut myself with a kitchen knife.</div><div>I was stunned to see this, as if it was someone else's problem.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are you okay!?" (Azusa)</div><div>"......Yeah, no problem." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I laughed to myself. I had never made a mistake in the past few years, but I never thought I would make one here and now.</div><div>When I was a little stunned, the other members who were working around me came up to me to see what was going on.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou? What's wrong?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Sorry, Kakihara-kun. I just cut my finger a little." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Are you okay? You should go to the infirmary for now. I'll take care of the rest." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"......Okay. I'll be right back." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I told the teacher that I had cut my finger and left the home economics room.</div><div>As I was leaving, I caught Nikaido's gaze, her face twisted with guilt that she didn't need to feel, and I cast my eyes down a little.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br />

</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;With this, it's okay. It's not that deep, so disinfectant and a bandage will do. I wouldn't recommend working with water for a while. It will cause infection."</div><div>"Understood. I apologize for bothering." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's okay, it's my job after all. You can go back to class."</div><div><br /></div><div>After Mizuhashi-sensei, the health teacher, took care of me, I walked out of the infirmary into the hallway.</div><div>I frowned when I saw the bandage on my finger.</div><div><br /></div><div>(I didn't think I'd be so upset just hearing about it......)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's not Nikaido's fault. This is a mental problem for me.</div><div>I'm rather shocked that just hearing a word I don't like&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;can make me this way.</div><div>I opened the door to the home economics room with a melancholy feeling.</div><div>When I tried to rejoin Kakihara's group, they surrounded me with a very worried look on their faces.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou, how was your wound?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"It was nothing serious. But I was told not to do any waterworks. So I guess I can't be......of much help. I'm sorry." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I see...... Ah, but don't worry about it. As for the hamburger steak, we've already prepared it to the point where Azusa can cook it, so I think we can handle it. The other dishes will probably be...... fine as well." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br />

</div><div>When Kakihara looked at Nogi and Doumoto anxiously, they both gave him thumbs up.</div><div>Seeing this, Kakihara looked more and more anxious, and I was convinced that for once, these two were really unreliable.</div><div>Yup&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;even from my point of view, I don't feel relieved for some reason.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I, I'm sorry, Shidou-kun. I spoke to you while you were using the knife earlier." (Azusa)</div><div>"It was my carelessness, so there's no need for you to apologize, Nikaido-san. Instead, I'm sorry for making you prepare the dish by yourself." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mmmh! I was just doing what was natural." (Azusa)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I took my gaze off Nikaido and looked at Rei.</div><div>She looked vaguely worried about me, but there was a hint of confusion in her eyes. She had never seen me make a mistake before, so she must be shaken up.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the meantime, I checked the hamburger patties Nikaido had made. It seemed that bread crumbs and eggs were used as a garnish, and there were no irregularities. The hamburger steak would be perfect if we deflated it and then cooked it.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"Shidou, I'm sorry if I'm imposing on you to do some chores, but can I ask you to take out the trash or arrange the dishes?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"I'd rather you let me do that. I can't help with the cooking anyway......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay. Then, please." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>What a thoughtful guy he's. He anticipated that I would feel guilty about just eating the food without helping, so he assigned me the job.</div><div>If he can think so much about other people's feelings, it's no wonder he's so popular.</div><div><br /></div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Despite our troubles, we ended up finishing our dishes third overall. The hamburger steak, egg soup, salad, and rice lined up on the table. No matter how you looked at it, those were perfect home-cooked dishes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Let's dig in!"</div><div><br /></div><div>We all put our hands together on the food in front of us, declaring so in unison.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yup&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;this is delicious.</div><div><br /></div><div>The hamburger steak was well cooked, and the soup had a gentle taste that made me feel relaxed. As for the salad, the lettuce is rather uneven, but...... well, it's a salad. So, I don't mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yummy! Especially the hamburger steak!" (Ryuji)</div><div>"So delish! That's Azurin for ya!" (Honoka)</div><div><br /></div><div>After being praised by Doumoto and Nogi, Nikaido scratched her cheek in embarrassment.</div><div><br /></div><div>"No...... but half of it was done by Shidou-kun......" (Azusa)</div><div>"Ah, you're right! You're amazing too! I respect you, dude!" (Ryuji)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was a bit awkward, but I didn't feel bad about being praised by Doumoto. He was probably incapable of lying in the first place, and even more so since I knew he wasn't flattering me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I screwed up and hindered you guys, but I'm glad I was able to help." (Rintaro)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>The pain spread slowly as I lifted the bowl with my injured left hand. I tried not to let my expression show as I mingled with the laughter and tried my best not to break the atmosphere.</div><div>Their talk was always high schooler-like, like they were in the prime of their youth. They talked about club activities, their favorite music, tests, different friends, and their&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;families.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is it just my fingers that hurt?</div><div><br /></div><div>I ask myself, behind my smile facade.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's only my fingers. It's supposed to be just my fingers.</div><div><br /></div><div>I replied to myself, and my smile deepened.</div><div>When I looked at my finger, I saw that the bandage was smeared with red.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i><div>I couldn't really remember what happened after that.</div><div>I couldn't concentrate on the afternoon class and couldn't remember what it was all about, but I did take notes. I just wanted to praise myself for being so diligent, seeing that I had taken notes all thoroughly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are your fingers okay?" (Rei)</div><div>"Hmm? Yeah, I'm fine. It'll get healed soon." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, who had eaten dinner at my place as usual, gave me a worried look from behind. Washing the dishes did indeed cause the water to sink into the wound, but thanks to the fact that the bleeding had stopped, it was not that bad.</div><div>After I finished washing the dishes, I went back to the table, and for some reason, Rei started to fidget.</div><div>She was looking at her phone, looking around the room. She was unnaturally restless.</div><div>I was easily convinced by her attitude.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... I guess you have something you want to ask me." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......You can tell?" (Rei)</div><div>"It's about the cooking class, isn't it? ......That I've been so careless." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I've never seen Rintaro cut his finger before." (Rei)</div><div>"No, I used to cut my fingers once a week when I first started cooking, okay?." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You just said so yourself. When you started. That means it's not there at all now, right? That's why I felt it was a little...... unnatural. I talked to Nikaido-san, and I thought maybe something was bothering you." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei was right, in the last two years&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I have never made a mistake like cutting my finger. This was partly because I've gotten used to it, but most of all it was because I'd always been conscious of concentrating. She sensed that I had been distracted.</div><div>Apparently, Rei had been understanding me better than I had thought.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's not that I'm mad at Nikaido or anything. It's just that my temper was weaker than I thought." (Rintaro)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i><div><br /></div><div>I sipped the coffee I had made for after dinner and exhaled. The fragrant smell passed my nose, and my shaken mind regained a bit of its composure.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......It's a boring story, but do you want to hear it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I want to know more about Rintaro."</div><div>"What a curious girl...... Well, I hope I can satisfy your curiosity." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The truth is, I'm not in the habit to fool around&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>The dark side of me was about to show itself again.</div><div>Pushing it down, I opened my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's not a complicated story. My father was a workaholic, as everyone around him would say. He never came home more than a few times a year. I've heard that even on the day I was born, he prioritized his work." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......" (Rei)</div><div>"So, I was lonely, but it wasn't hard for me. &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;If only my mother had been with me." (Rintaro)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>I felt another twinge of pain in my heart.</div><div>But it was somewhat better just to have someone in front of me to listen to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"When I was in the fifth grade...... my mother walked out of the home as I was coming back from school." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sorry for this, I just want to be free&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I still dreamed of my mother's back as she told me that without turning around.</div><div>"Please don't go".</div><div>I couldn't even say that, so I just watched in amazement as the person who was my mother left.</div><div><br /></div><div>"In the end, she just tired of taking care of me. And I'm sure she was also tired of my father leaving everything to her. &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Ever since then, I've been a little allergic to my mother. So when Nikaido asked me "Did you learn that from your mother?", I got upset. And, that's all my story." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I, see......" (Rei)</div><div>"As I thought, it was a boring story, right? ......The coffees are getting cold. I'll go make some fresh." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I got up from the sofa, grabbing my cup and hers.</div><div>That time, for some reason, Rei grabbed my arm and made me sit back down on the couch.</div><div>She pulled the arm of bewildered me, holding it and drawing it closer toward her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm not, going anywhere." (Rei)</div><div>"......What are you talking about?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm not leaving you, even if you tell me to go away. I won't make Rintaro feel lonely." (Rei)</div><div>"What the heck are you, a kindergartener?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div>

<div>On the contrary, Rei was looking at me with a very serious face.</div><div>She was serious about this.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wonder why, this lass can be so earnest about me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't help but feel that I'm being treated with more affection than just a caretaker and his employer anymore, or is that just my imagination?</div><div>But anyway, for now&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thanks, Rei. I'm feeling a little better now." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That so. Then I'm glad." (Rei)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Rei smiled, feeling relieved.</div><div>As I regained my composure, I realized how close she was to me after all this time.</div><div>I felt a soft, squishy sensation against my arm. <b><i>(PTW/N: hmmmmm...</i>( &#865;&#176; &#860;ʖ &#865;&#176;)<i>)</i></b></div><div>That's no surprise. She's holding my arm upon herself, after all.</div><div>So it can't be helped.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Rei, isn't it time to let go?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I told you I'm not going anywhere." (Rei)</div><div>"You don't need to stick close to me! I'm a healthy high school boy myself, you know!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"What a weird tone, interesting. But I certainly don't want to be sultry." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps sensing my desperation from my slurred tone, Rei gently let go of my arm.</div><div>That was a close one. My heart almost exploded regardless of what had happened up to now.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That's right. I've told you the other day that I'm aiming to become a full-time househusband, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup, you have." (Rei)</div><div>"It's a dream that grew out of my mother's leave. I don't like my mother, but I also don't like my father who neglected us. I don't want to live a life like my father! As a result, I decided to become the opposite." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I had already heard how Rei came to be an idol.</div><div>So I thought I'd tell her too.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You said that you respect people who work hard to achieve whatever dream they have, but I'm sorry that my motivation for going for it is......such a stupid thing." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It doesn't matter what kind of motivation you have for your dream. In the end, it's about whether or not it can support the person until they achieve their dream. If Rintaro's past helps him run towards his dream, then I think that's fine." (Rei)</div><div>"...... You're making a lot of sense, yes. There's no room for argument." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I have to show that I'm smart once in a while." (Rei)</div><div>"Does it have anything to do with you being smart?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Her silly remarks&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;no, maybe she didn't mean to be silly at all, made me laugh uncontrollably.</div><div>The only time I can laugh like this outside of my own family is when I'm with Yukio.</div><div>Maybe I had unintentionally opened my heart to Rei.</div><div>I had a feeling that from now on, I wouldn't have any more bad dreams.</div>
