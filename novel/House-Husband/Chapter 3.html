<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Millefeuille Stars</h3>

<div>I looked up at the skyscraper towering in front of me.</div><div>This is the building of Fantasista Entertainment, which Rei belongs to. I've never been to a place like this, so I was a little nervous even before I went inside.</div><div>Well, nothing is going to happen if I stay here.</div><div>I exhaled deeply and stepped into the building.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Umm, excuse me." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes, what can I do for you?"</div><div>"I'm Shidou, and I have an appointment with Otosaki of the Millefeuille Stars at twelve o'clock. Can you please connect her?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Please wait a moment."</div><div><br /></div><div>The receptionist told me to wait here for a while after I mentioned Otosaki's name to her.</div><div>A high school kid suddenly mentioned her name, which made her look at me a little quizzically, but I guess it couldn't be helped.</div><div>Then about two minutes later. As soon as the elevator came down to the first floor, Rei appeared, dressed in a comfortable outfit.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry to keep you waiting. It's complicated inside, I'll guide you." (Rei)</div><div>"O-ou......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Hmm, what's wrong?" (Rei)</div><div>"No...... I just thought the atmosphere was different from usual." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Is that so?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Her hair, which is usually down, is tied back in a ponytail, giving her a vaguely sporty impression. She was dressed in a black sleeveless undershirt with white shorts underneath, exposing Rei's spotless thighs.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, can't I just hand over these lunches and leave?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"No. They're both already looking forward to seeing you." (Rei)</div><div>"Haa......, why should I?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>"This way." Following her words, I got into the elevator with her hands pulling me along. We went up about ten floors and came to a long corridor. The corridor was lined with several rooms, each with its own number.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are these all studios, by any chance?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. We have a lot of studios in the office because we also have a lot of music artists." (Rei)</div><div>"That's a lot of money......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"This building was just rebuilt about five years ago. Big offices are amazing after all." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei walked down the corridor without hesitation and turned a corner. At the end of the corridor was a sturdy door to a soundproof room. Or rather, it seemed that all the doors that existed up to this point were all soundproofed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Come in." (Rei)</div><div><br />

  </div><div>Rei slowly opened the heavy-looking door and led me into the studio.</div><div>Once inside, I could see the mirrors and huge speakers plastered all over the walls.</div><div>Then, leaning against the wall of the studio&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I could see two people were chatting.</div><div>When they noticed me, they turned their curious gaze to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Welcome baaack, Rei. Is he "Rintaro"-kun you were talking about?"</div><div>"Yes. He brought us the lunches." (Rei)</div><div>"Errr, I'm sorry, I'm being selfish."</div><div><br /></div><div>The one scratching her head as she apologizes is Kanon, the one who can be said to be in charge of MilleSta's energy.</div><div>Her red twin-tails are her trademark, and even though I know she's the same age as me, she looks a little younger.</div><div>It's even more so when compared to the other member standing next to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry for the trouble, "Rintaro"-kun. But I couldn't help but wonder what kind of man Rei had taken a liking to. I hope you don't take it personally."</div><div><br /></div><div>It's the third member of MilleSta, Mia.</div><div>She is a cool beauty&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;and is marketed as more of a prince-like girl.</div><div>She is sometimes called The Prince. Her face was more of beautiful than cute. If she were to dress up as a man, she would make men jealous of her good looks.</div><div>But that's just the face, her body is just as feminine as Rei's.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Aah, I'm not. I never thought I'd be able to have my lunch eaten by the three of MilleSta, who I'm a big fan of, so I'm really thrilled. Don't mind the hassle." (Rintaro)</div><div>""......""</div><div>"......Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I put on a friendly smile and put on my best gentleman's voice, but the two of them had puzzled looks on their faces.</div><div>Did I miss something? Confused and worried, I threw a glance at Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, I've already told them a lot about Rintaro. Like how he has a sharp tongue and how he's a wolf in sheep's clothing." (Rei)</div><div>"Tell me first! I've already made it up!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>So, these two already know how I usually am.</div><div>D*mn, although I've been trying to get by with a nice guy character.</div><div><br /></div>

  <div>"Pfft......Ahahaha! I knew it, you were as funny as I thought you were! Rintaro!"&nbsp;</div><div>"Tsk, whatever. You, you're getting far too familiar with calling me by Rintaro. We're not even friends." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's fine, isn't it. If you're a fan, you'll be jumping for joy, right."&nbsp;</div><div>"I'm not a fan tho." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Huuuhh&#8265; Not only you did lie about your attitude, but about your words as well!?"</div><div>"That's right. Just because you're a national idol, don't think that everyone is a fan of yours." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What is it? I mean, Rei only told me your given name! And you don't know anything but our given names!"&nbsp;</div><div>"......That's indeed true." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I only know Kanon and Mia by their stage names. Rei is the only one who knows their real names.</div><div><br /></div><div>"See, that's why it's not my fault."</div><div>"You may be right, but...... your attitude is annoying." (Rintaro)</div><div>"How can you treat a celebrity like such an attitude!? You're amazing, yes!?"</div><div>"For once, I have the upper hand. I have the right to do whatever I want with this lunchbox." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I swayed the lunchbox I brought in front of Kanon. Then a loud rumbling sound came from her stomach, and her eyes began to swim as if her eyes were locked to the lunchbox.</div><div><br />

  </div><div>"Well, well, you seem to be quite hungry. You can have it if you insist." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You are evil!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Say what you want! &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Well, since I have a contract with Rei, I have no choice but to give this to you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What the hell are you&#8265;" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Hmmm... I guess Kanon is a more interesting type to make fun of than I thought.</div><div>I placed the wrapped lunch box in front of her and opened it to show her the inside. Then, Kanon's expression, which had been upset until now, changed, and at the same time, Mia, who was next to her, leaked a voice of admiration.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Heh, your cooking skills are even better than I've heard. You've made such an elaborate meal for us, haven't you?" (Mia)</div><div>"Just in case. I didn't want Rei to think that the food I usually feed her is not that great, so I put some effort into it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In addition to stewed hamburger steak, fried chicken, and other meats, the lunchbox also contained potato salad and bacon-wrapped asparagus. The stewed hamburger steak was, of course, made from minced meat, and the fried chicken was made from chicken marinated overnight in a sauce made of soy sauce and garlic.</div><div>I couldn't bring myself to embarrass Rei, and I was conscious that I had made it very serious.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What...... It's a lie, isn't it? This hamburger stew is also homemade?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Of course. I'm not going to use a retort pack or frozen food when I make Rei's lunchbox. And also, I'm not going to cut corners just because I have to cook more portions." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Haa, somehow...... I've completely lost." (Kannon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite Kanon's astonishment, I took one of the three lunchboxes I had made and gave it to Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"C'mon, you too&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;What's wrong?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Nothing in particular." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei looked away, looking somewhat unhappy.</div><div>I asked her if she didn't like the contents of the lunchbox, but she shook her head in response.</div><div><br /></div><div>"No. That's not it." (Rei)</div><div>"What is it then?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Even though this is the first time you've two met, but you and Kanon seem to be getting along well." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I and Kanon are getting along? I wonder if her eyes are damaged.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oh my my? Hmm...... Rei got jealous that her best friend, Kanon-chan, was getting along with him. Watta beloved fella!" (Kanon)</div><div>"There's that too, and she's also jealous of the fact that Rintaro is suddenly getting along with you. So both." (Rei)</div><div>"......You're so honest, really you're." (Kanon)</div><div><br />

  </div><div>Kanon had been giving her a teasing look earlier, but now she had a dumbfounded expression on her face.</div><div>I've come to know Rei for a while, and she's indeed honest to a degree that you don't often see nowadays, and she's not afraid to speak her mind. I had always thought that jealousy was something hard to talk about, but it seemed to be different for her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, well, it's nice to have more friends, isn't it? I'm glad to have a new friend, too, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</div><div>"You guys......aren't you a little too careless? I'm just an ordinary guy, so don't carelessly call me a friend....... See, there's something, right." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Oh? Do you dislike it with being called as a friend?" (Mia)</div><div>"No, it's not that I dislike it....... But why don't you just call us acquaintances?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"If you don't dislike, then what should I call you with? It's indeed, we may still be at the level of acquaintances, but we are planning to become deep friends eventually, so I'm not saying anything wrong." (Mia)</div><div>"That's true&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;eh, what do you mean by "deep friends"?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Deep is deep. I'll leave that up to you to interpret." (Mia)</div><div>"...... I may, be very incompatible with you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I think I like your honesty a lot. I look forward to working with you." (Mia)</div><div>"As for whether or not I'm looking forward...... well, I'll do my best." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As if satisfied with my reply to some extent, Mia smiled with amusement.</div><div>I felt like I'd taken an eye of a ridiculous person. She is probably more troublesome than Rei. I'm not going to say that she's cunning or conniving&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;but she seems to be the complete opposite of me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I misjudged Rintaro's communication skills. I didn't expect you two to get along with so quickly." (Rei)</div><div>"Get along......? If that's how you really see, then your eyes must be badly damaged." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I came here, I understood well.</div><div>Including Rei, the three of MilleSta, live in a different world than me.</div><div>Is it what's called sensibility? It's not that we're incompatible, but if you're asking if there's an affinity, there's probably no.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Well, whatever.</div><div><br /></div><div>"For now, eat your lunch. Whether it gets cold or not is irrelevant at this point, but the sooner you eat it, the better." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Haa, okayy. Then I'll give you a proper food review to see if you can take care of Rei or&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Oh my&#8265; What's this fried stuff!?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Your reactions are really prompt, yes......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>She was reacting too promptly after putting it in her mouth. In a way, I'm sure I'll get a worth food review from this guy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"This is more than I expected. The hamburger steak was surprisingly tender, but it didn't lose its shape. And the demi-glace sauce tastes even more perfect than the store-bought stuff. So this is something Rei will want to keep on hand." (Kanon?)</div><div>"Your food review is a complete turnaround, yes......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm just telling you the truth." (Kanon?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess the three of them, each with their own unique personality, is one of MilleSta's strong points. Kanon and Mia alone are so different from each other, and the reaction of Rei was completely different from the two. She was already eating with all her heart. She didn't even look aside, just concentrating on the lunch in front of her. It's a little scary, though.</div><div><br /></div><div>"W-well? I'll give it a pass! I'd trust you to take care of Rei!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Give a pass, huh...... The first thing you have to say is it's delicious, am I right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I-It's not like I'm complimenting you, okay!? Wha&#8265; You want me to say it more? Okay, I'll tell you! It's delicious! It's as good as the best beef ribs at a high-class Yakiniku Restaurant." (Kanon)</div><div>"I've never had it, but I know what you mean....... I see. I'm glad it's good." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I rarely give out compliments to anyone other than these two! You should be grateful for it! And, thank you for making it for me! I hope I didn't leave anything unsaid!?" (Kanon)</div><div>"I thought you were a tsundere, but you're so honest, yes!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>By looking at her, I'm pretty sure that was definitely her character. Or, is it a fraud? No, I don't think she meant that way.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"Rintaro, thank you. It was very delicious." (Rei)</div><div>"You've already finished...... Can you move this afternoon after devouring so much so quickly?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm fine. I can already feel the digestion process starting. Rather, I feel energized and revitalized." (Rei)</div><div>"What's going on with your body, really?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite my efforts to cut down on the oil, there was no way that digestion could have started so quickly. Rei's body must be special. I'll try not to go any further into it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Well, I'd better be off now. I've done my job, haven't I?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Oh, you're already going to leave. Although if you like, you're welcome to watch our lessons." (Mia)</div><div>"Lessons?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. We're going to go through the performance for the next show from the beginning." (Mia)</div><div>"That's going to be long and tough, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes, It is, maybe will take two hours, but it's not often that you get to see us perform up close, don't you think? And for me, it makes me feel better to have an audience watching us." (Mia)</div><div>"That's true, but ......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I gave a sideways glance to Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Why are you always looking at me with a face full of expectations?</div><div><br /></div><div>As a result of my position, I was vulnerable to Rei. If I refuse here, it will be easy for me to leave, but if I do...... then Rei will make a sad face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Okay, okay......, while there is a chance." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's great. We'll do our best to make it feel like a real show." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia happily walked up to the speaker and began to operate it in a way that an amateur would have no idea what she was doing. Kanon, who was sitting next to her, let out a sigh.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you know? The price of our concert tickets is quite high, and the resale tickets cost more than double that....... Of course, I don't condone the resellers, but the tickets are so valuable that there are still fans who will buy them. You're in a great fortune, you know." (Kanon)</div><div>"That being said, it certainly feels like a big gain......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I mean, if you're not losing your life, it's a big gain! Come on, hurry up sit down right here." (Kanon)</div><div>"Okay, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon grabbed me by the shoulders and made me sit down on the spot. I was sitting in a position where I could see the three of them from the front. It's certainly a special seat that any fan would absolutely want.</div><div>It's not a loss, it's a gain. The words struck me unexpectedly. There's nothing to do when I get home anyway, so let's just give up and enjoy this situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro." (Rei)</div><div>"What is it......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Please watch." (Rei)</div><div>"...... Yeah, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As if satisfied with my words, Rei stood in the middle of the studio. She then made eye contact with Kanon and Mia, who were standing beside her, and gently closed her eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div>One, two,</div><div><br /></div><div>As Rei counted, the three of them jumped up in unison. At the same time, their song started playing from the speakers. It was their debut song, which even I knew.</div><div><br />

</div><div>(I knew...... It's completely different.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Their atmosphere was completely different from earlier.</div><div>There should be no difference in height between us, and they should be right there&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;within arm's reach, but for some reason, they seem so far away.</div><div>I felt as if I was on the stage.</div><div>When Rei, standing in the middle of the stage, turns herself, Kanon and Mia turn to match her.</div><div>What surprised me was that the movements of the three of them, who were supposed to be completely different in type, were perfectly synchronized for this moment.</div><div>And they were doing it while singing.</div><div>And yet, somehow, their individual personalities were clearly visible.</div><div>As a layman, I can't say much about them, but I'm sure this is what makes them top-notch.</div><div>The three members of MilleSta sang and danced their way through a variety of songs, from intense songs to moist ballads to bright and cute songs, they did it perfectly.</div><div>At the same time as they made their final poses and bowed, the three of them let out a big breath.</div><div>This seemed to be the end of the concert itself.</div><div>Rei looked at me as I applauded unconsciously.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......How was it?" (Rei)</div><div>"As you can see by the applause....... it was amazing. I have a great experience." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm glad to hear that." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>A bead of sweat ran down Rei's cheek as she smiled in relief.</div><div>She danced and sang. The sweat showed how hard those must be.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmph! I hope you're feeling a little more respectful now!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Yeah, I have more respect now than I did when I first came here." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......What? It's a little creepy when someone praises you so openly." (Kanon)</div><div>"What do you want me to do......?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If she looked dissatisfied with my praise, I'm losing my face here.</div><div>I left Kanon alone for now and turned my attention to Mia.</div><div><br /></div><div>"'Umm...... Thank you, Mia. It's been a really good experience." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm glad to hear that. If you bring me a lunchbox, I'll show it to you again anytime. That's how much I like your cooking." (Mia)</div><div>"What's so great about a normal person's lunchbox......? I don't really understand." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I wonder why. But, it made me feel really warm." (Mia)</div><div>"From my handmade lunchbox?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes, it is. When you're a student and an entertainer at the same time, you get stressed out little by little. It's fulfilling and fun now... but sometimes I envy those who are living a normal high school life." (Mia)</div><div>"......Aah, I see." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You know what I mean? Your lunch box reminded me of how it feels to be "just a normal high school student". So, I'm very grateful for that." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>At Mia's assertion, Rei nodded and Kanon silently turned her head away.</div><div>It seems they both feel the same way, because they don't even deny it.</div><div>It finally made sense to me why Rei liked my cooking.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, since you're here, why don't you exchange contact with me? You've already been in touch with Rei, haven't you?" (Mia)</div><div>"I have......Well, I don't mind that much." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Un un. Ah, by the way, the contact I'm about to exchange with you is private, not professional, so don't ever share it with anyone, okay?" (Mia)</div><div>"Don't worry, I won't do it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>We each took our smartphones out and exchanged our LINE contacts.</div><div>Amid all the names of my classmates, a slightly alien name blended in.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey! If you two exchange each other there, I'll be the only one left out! You have to exchange with me too!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Okay......There's no particular reason for us to LINE each other, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"There's a point in exchanging these things, you know! Like, it's a relief to know that that you can contact someone anytime." (Kanon)</div><div>"Well, that's true." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In the end, I exchanged LINE contacts with Kanon, and two idols were added to my list of new friends.</div><div>Even so&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Ugawa Mia and Hidori Kanon...... Aren't these their real name?</div><div><br /></div><div>"With this, it's done. I can keep you company during class or at night, so send me a funny story or something." (Mia)</div><div>"I'm not going to put any effort into it. Don't expect too much." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I stood up, straightened my clothes, and grabbed their lunchboxes. They ate it all up so beautifully. Those now became so light.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rei. What are you going to do today? If it's the usual, I'll make dinner and wait for you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, I'd like that." (Rei)</div><div>"Okay. Then, once again, I'll take my leave here." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If I stay here any longer, I'll just get in the way. So, I turned my back on the three of them and headed for the exit of the studio.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</div><div>"What is it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"See you again." (Mia)</div><div>"......Yeah, see you." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>See you again, huh.</div><div>I left the studio, confused by Mia's words that strangely stayed with me.</div><div>There was one thing that I had decided to do after today's experience. I should probably tell Rei about this as soon as she gets home.</div><div>I hope she'll accept it&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div>"Have you two thought about "it"?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yes. I thought it was fine. What about you, Kanon?" (Mia)</div><div>"......I was a little against it at first, but now I know that he can be trusted....... So, isn't it fine already? I don't think it's a problem either." (Kanon)</div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Thank you. I'll talk to him about it later tonight." (Rei)</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>It was a little after 20:00. I had long since returned home, and was cooking for a dinner for Rei.</div><div>The menu was cabbage rolls with tomato sauce and consommé soup. The cabbage was available at a reasonable price, so so I prepared it in abundance.</div><div>The tomato sauce was also based on ketchup, so the taste itself was never out of place.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......It's about the time." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Just after I checked the time on my smartphone, I heard the sound of a door opening at the entrance.</div><div>The next thing I heard was the sound of slippers scraping down the hallway.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm home. It's a little late. Sorry." (Rei)</div><div>"It's okay. I'm just getting ready." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm glad." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>When Rei came into the living room, she looked a little tired.</div><div>It's not surprising, since she had been practicing even after doing her best to make it through the concert.</div><div><br /></div><div>"By the looks of you, you seem like you're going to fall asleep soon. ...... Go take a bath first. I'll simmer the food so it doesn't get cold." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll do that then. Thank you." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>She went straight to the bathroom and came back to the living room about 20 minutes later.</div><div>She came to the table with her hair a little damp, which made her look vaguely sexy, and this was the only time I couldn't look directly at her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Today we have cabbage rolls. Try it with the sauce on top." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's also my favorite.......! Let's dig in." (Rei)</div><div><div style="text-align: center;">
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div></i>
</div></div><div>Seeing Rei eat so deliciously as always, a sense of satisfaction began to well up inside me.</div><div>At the same time, I made a decision.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What is it?" (Rei)</div><div>"I'm returning this." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I placed an envelope with a wad of bills in front of Rei.</div><div>This is the 500,000 yen that she gave me as salary.</div><div>I've been keeping it ever since I received it, without spending it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Why?" (Rei)</div><div>"I want to renew our contract." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I then took out my notebook and unfolded it on the table.</div><div>There was a new contract that I had devised.</div><div><br /></div><div>"First of all, we'll stop the salary system. Otosaki Rei will only pay for the rent of this room, utilities, and cooking materials. Whenever a cooking utensil breaks, we will discuss it. In some cases, I'll buy them with my savings." (Rintaro)</div><div>"But that's&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;." (Rei)</div><div>"Even if I paid them, it wouldn't be more than a hundred thousand yen. And in exchange, I want you to reduce my workload." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What do you mean?" (Rei)</div><div>"It's exactly as it says. First of all, I won't cook dinner on Wednesday nights and Saturday-Sunday afternoons and nights. However, I will prepare food that can be heated and eaten in advance. This is because of my part-time job. I have a set day to help out." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>And then&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I tapped my finger on the last sentence of my notebook.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Staying overnight is strictly forbidden unless there are unavoidable circumstances." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eh......." (Rei)</div><div>"You can't give me that kind of 'gaahn' look. It's not right for a boy and a girl of our age to be sleeping under the same roof. And today, I thought about it again. If you guys' dreams are ruined because of me, I'll probably have to live haunted by it for the rest of my lives." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>That's right. In the end, I was scared.</div><div>Regardless of the age Rei is thinking about retiring, but a scandal at a time when she could still play an active role could rob her of her future.</div><div>And taking away Otosaki Rei's future would also take away the future of the other two.</div><div>I can't live under such pressure.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, and this is unfounded. Rei first told me that my food was warm....... Thanks to Mia's verbalization today, I have renewed confidence. But if I'm cooking food for a salary, it's no different than a restaurant, right? So I thought, "If I take advantage of this, I'll forget about the warmth someday." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as many housewives and househusbands in the world are not paid, I should put myself in the same environment if I want to be one.</div><div>What I need is not the obligation, but compassion&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;although it may sound clumsy to say it, that is what Rei is looking for.</div><div>There is no need to exchange money.</div><div>The only reason I still asked for rent and everything else is that I'm not a softie enough to take it on completely free of charge.</div><div>I even think it is unavoidable as long as it is a necessary expense.</div><div><div style="text-align: center;">

</div></div><div>"If Rintaro says...... that's what he wants, I'm fine with these terms." (Rei)</div><div>"What? You seem desperately submissive." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's a shame that I'm not able to stay here. But what Rintaro is saying is right. So I thought I should accept it." (Rei)</div><div>"......I see." (Rintaro)</div><div>"But it will still be a hassle to go back and forth." (Rei)</div><div>"Well, yeah." (Rintaro)</div><div>"So I have a suggestion." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>With a sparkle in her eye, Rei held up one finger.</div><div>For some reason, I have a bad feeling about this.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm going to start living alone. This is not a decision I've just made, it's something I've been discussing with my family and with they two." (Rei)</div><div>"Ye-yea......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Actually, Kanon's father is a real estate agent. So we have already decided to rent an apartment. It's close to the office and it's more efficient." (Rei)</div><div>"You mean you guys are going to live together?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Not exactly. The apartment itself is a 1LDK, so it's really too small for the three of us living together. That's why all three of us will be renting each room on the same floor. There are only four rooms on the floor. Since there are three of us, one room is spared." (Rei)</div><div>"It can't be right&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. Rintaro will be renting the last one of the rooms. The rent will probably be higher than here, but I'll pay it, so no problem." (Rei)</div><div>"No, nonono! There's no way I'll pass the tenant screening, right!? And unlike you guys, I'm just a high school student!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll get Kanon's father to help you with that." (Rei)</div><div>"But Kanon and Mia won't like that, will they? The idea of a guy they don't know living on the same floor." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's okay. I've already got their permission." (Rei)</div><div>"What......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"The reason I asked Rintaro to come to the studio today was that Kanon and Mia wanted to be sure. The two of them concluded that it would not be a problem for having you live in the same place." (Rei)</div><div><div style="text-align: center;">

</div></div><div>I didn't think that was the point of today's face-to-face meeting.</div><div>Why didn't she just tell me in advance&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Well, I guess because if she had, they wouldn't have been able to judge me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The corridors of the apartment building are invisible from the outside, so people can't find us even if we go back and forth between our rooms. And since we live in the same place, there is no need to worry about us being together. The rooms are also soundproofed, so so our privacy is protected." (Rei)</div><div>"......Isn't too good to be true?" (Rintaro)</div><div>I don't think so. Moving is a hassle, and just because Rintaro's living quarters are changing doesn't mean his standard of living is going to rise." (Rei)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Doesn't she realize that being able to live in the same apartment building, on the same floor, and next door to an idol&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;is a tremendous value in itself?</div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Oh, no. This is because she understands that it's not an advantage to me. She knows exactly who I am.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... This is not good. There are no disadvantages. Rather, the advantage of lower risk is too attractive." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I know, right?" (Rei)</div><div>"By the way, being close to the office means being close to the nearest station as well, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. It is just around the corner from the office and the station. The school is three stations away." (Rei)</div><div>"Ah, I see......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Any problem?" (Rei)</div><div>"No, the opposite. There's not too much of a problem." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I hadn't told Rei about any of this, but the station closest to their agency office was also the station closest to my part-time job, at Yuzuki-sensei's workplace.</div><div>Next week, Yuzuki-sensei will start finishing up her manuscript, so I'll have to commute to her place again for a while. If it's in the same vicinity, I can get there by bicycle.</div><div>This is a definite advantage.</div><br /><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I get it. You have agreed to my terms, so I'll accept Rei's as well." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thank you." (Rei)</div><div>"So, when should I prepare for the move? I don't have much to pack, though......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"By next week, if possible." (Rei)</div><div>"That's too soon." (Rintaro)</div>
