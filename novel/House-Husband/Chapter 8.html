<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; That Line of Sight</h3>

<div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;In the end, I could not think of anything I could do for Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>I cooked dinner as usual and watched TV while relaxing with her.</div><div>There was nothing I could do to ease her, and her mood was getting tenser and tenser.</div><div>It was the same for Mia and Kanon.</div><div>The three of them were starting to build up their feelings for the concert, so much so that just standing near them made my skin feel tingly.</div><div><br /></div><div>(It's like a boxer before a fight.......)</div><div><br /></div><div>In my room, drinking coffee, Rei was watching the TV with intense eyes.</div><div>What was shown on the screen was a studio rehearsal that had probably been recorded today. Unlike the one she had shown me, she had made time for a costume change.</div><div><br /></div><div>The day of the concert was the day after tomorrow. July 7th, which is Tanabata. <b><i>(PTW/N: 七夕, 棚機 [Tanabata], Star Festival, takes place on the 7th day of the 7th month of the year.)</i></b></div><div>The girls would be at the venue tomorrow for a rehearsal and spend the night before at a nearby hotel.</div><div>This might be the last time we could see each other before the concert.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, did you find anything strange in this video?" (Rei)</div><div>"Don't ask me about it....... Apart from that, I thought the performance was awesome, just like the last time." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... That so." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei had her notebook open in her hand.</div><div>She probably had it to write down the points that need to be improved after watching the video, but the pen had not moved once yet.</div><div>It was not that Rei was slacking off, it was just purely because she couldn't find anything to improve.</div><div>That was how perfectly the performance was. It was so perfect that there was no way to make it any better.</div><div><br /></div><div>But&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"If I have to say, I'd say ......your face." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Face?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah. I think your face is stiffer than the last time you performed it in front of me." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know if it's desperation or what.</div><div>Compared to her previous TV shows and live performances, she seemed to be a bit different. It's a difference that I couldn't be sure of, but I'm more convinced it's not my imagination.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Maybe, Rintaro's point is correct." (Rei)</div><div>"...... Is that so. Well, I guess it can't be helped." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm......" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>The pressure of her father coming to watch her performance. It must have to be piling up inside Rei more than she imagined.</div><div>It was all a matter of how she felt. It was not up to the people around her to tell her what to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Have you done, everything you can?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Yes." (Rei)</div><div>"I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>There was nothing more that a mere normal person like me could say.</div><div>What remained to be done was to see how far she, as a professional, could concentrate on the performance.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro...... will you watch me properly?" (Rei)</div><div>"I've got a special seat you've prepared for me. So I'll be able to watch you properly." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I told her that, and then she got up and stood in front of me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you. If you're watching me...... I'll be able to keep focusing till the end then." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei chuckled and left my room.</div><div>I sat down on the couch and turned off the TV.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... You gave me a lousy smile, you know."</div><div><br /></div><div>It wasn't an idol-like smile, and I could tell that she was trying to be tough.</div><div>Rei's mental state was definitely not fine.</div><div>It was not easy to get rid of movements that were ingrained in the body, and no matter how nervous she is on stage, her body will move naturally.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, is just that enough for a top idol?</div><div><br /></div><div>As I thought&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;there's something uneasiness in her mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>(What's wrong with me being this nervous......)</div><div><br /></div><div>Before I knew it, I had forced myself to stop shaking my leg and pulled my smartphone out of my pocket.</div><div>It was a little late, but maybe he would still be awake.</div><div>I opened the LINE and made a call to my only best friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>[&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Hello? What's the matter, at this hour?] (Yukio)</div><div>"Sorry, man. I just wanted to hear your voice." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Fweh!? What the...... what's really going on?] (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>From the other side of the phone, I could hear the panicked voice of Inaba Yukio.</div><div>I felt strange. Even though I heard Yukio's voice every day at school, it felt somehow fresh through a device</div><div><br /></div><div>[...... what's happened?] (Yukio)</div><div>"What makes you think that?" (Rintaro)</div><div>[I was thinking that if Rintaro is calling me, there must be something that is difficult to talk about face to face. If you have a problem or something, I'll do my best to help you.] (Yukio)</div><div>"You know me so well, yes. I adore you for that." (Rintaro)</div><div>[I-is that so? Ehehe.] (Yukio) <b><i>(PTW/N: something seems wrong.)</i></b></div><div><br /></div><div>I used to think that a boy's "Ehehe" was just a creep, but when it came to Yukio, it's not at all.</div><div>I've been strangely wondering about that why&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"I have some problems, but honestly it's not a big deal. It's not even my problems, to begin with." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Is that so?] (Yukio)</div><div>"Yeah. My friend......? Right, my friend. My friend is troubled, and I want to do something to help, but I can't think of any way to do it." (Rintaro)</div><div>[First of all, I'm surprised you're calling that person a friend. In your case, at the most are just referred to as acquaintances or classmates.] (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was true that I didn't really define other people as friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, that's okay. It's just that I can't leave this guy alone." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Hmm....... So, what's the problem about?] (Yukio)</div><div>"Let's see...... this guy's trying to get famous, and has made a lot of effort to do so, and now has become quite famous." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Yes, yes.] (Yukio)</div><div>"But the father doesn't think so well of it and wants this guy to quit being of it if possible." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Being famous can be dangerous. I can understand his feeling.] (Yukio)</div><div>"So this guy is about to show the father all the stuff has done to become famous, but instead that put even more pressure and might unable to perform well." (Rintaro)</div><div>[I see....... So Rintaro wants to help that guy to perform at the true potential in front of the father, right?] (Yukio)</div><div>"That's what I mean. But I can't think of a way to do that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yukio was one of the best listeners I knew. He understood what I wanted to say almost perfectly with just one listen, and he never misinterpreted me.</div><div>He also understood my situation that I couldn't talk about in detail.</div><div>This is what made him very reliable as a consultant.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Hmmm, I guess that's something that guy will have to deal with.] (Yukio)</div><div>"......That's a good point. But that's not the answer I want." (Rintaro)</div><div>[I know. I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion. Rintaro just wants to know what he can do as a third party.] (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>That's right. But I couldn't think of one.</div><div><br /></div><div>[......Sorry, but I don't think I can give you an answer either. But there is one thing I can tell you.] (Yukio)</div><div>"Can you tell me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>[Yes. It's&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;you're the only one who absolutely must not look anxious.] (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>Look, anxious?</div><div><br /></div><div>[I don't have a basis, but I think anxiety is contagious. When a person's work goes wrong, and you are around, he'll feel the need to rely on you. And if you're the one with the anxious face at that time, it will completely demoralize him.] (Yukio)</div><div>"...... I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, if the coach looked worried at a high school baseball game, the students would be unsure of what to believe.</div><div>No matter how much effort they had put in before, if the coach, the "sign" that indicated the direction of their efforts, was "possibly wrong", they would not be able to believe in all the foundations they had built up.</div><div>In such a situation, how can they compete contentedly&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I've never actually been into sports, so I don't know.</div><div>This idea might be wrong about this, and I wasn't even Rei's coach to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>But one thing is for sure, there is nothing good about me being anxious.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thanks, Yukio. That was very helpful." (Rintaro)</div><div>[I'm glad I could be of some help to you, and it's kinda new and refreshing to be asked for advice by you.] (Yukio)</div><div>"You're the only person I can think of who'd be willing to give me advice. I really appreciate it." (Rintaro)</div><div>[&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I see. You're right.] (Yukio)</div><div>"Hmm? What's wrong?" (Rintaro)</div><div>[No, it's nothing. I hope that person you're worried about, will do well.] (Yukio)</div><div>"Yeah, I hope so." (Rintaro)</div><div>[Well, good night then, Rintaro.] (Yukio)</div><div>"Yea, good night." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I pulled the smartphone away from my ear and hung up the call.</div><div>At the end of the call, Yukio's voice suddenly brightened, but I was so relieved that it didn't even bother me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Don't look anxious.</div><div><br /></div><div>It might be a simple thing to do, but I believed it was very important.</div><div>Even if she didn't have time to look at me, I would continue to look at Rei, believing in her.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's what I meant by "You're going to be fine."&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div>

<div>And then, the day of the concert.</div><div><br /></div><div>The venue that Mille-Feuille Stars would be performing at this time was smaller than the Nippon Budokan, but it was still one of the largest in Japan.</div><div>The audience seats were divided into two sections, one at the top and one at the bottom.</div><div>Audience members who were far away from the stage could make up for the disadvantage in visibility by watching the girls on the huge monitors set up at the top.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's really spacious......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked down at the entire venue from a position even higher than the two-tiered seats.</div><div>This was the special seat that Rei had prepared.</div><div>The seats were higher than the two-tiered seats and had an unobstructed view, yet were still close to the stage.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I sat down, I glanced to the side and saw that there were already several people sitting in the special seats.</div><div>I guessed they were all related to the three of them.</div><div>And here, a problem that had completely slipped my mind stood in front of me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Hmm, you're...... Shidou-kun, right?"</div><div><br /></div><div>A man wearing a well-tailored suit sat next to me.</div><div>Yes, it was Rei's father.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Wh-what a strange coincidence! In a place like this." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You don't have to make up for it. I've heard from Rei...... You've been taking care of her a lot, haven't you?"</div><div>"A-ahahaha, no, it's more like I'm the one being taken care of. Ahahaha......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, if you are going to tell him, tell me first. What if I'm being questioned, "What is your relationship with my daughter?" That will have been a real head-scratcher.</div><div><br /></div><div>"There was one question I wanted to ask you. In all likelihood, you didn't lay a hand on my daughter, did you?"&nbsp;</div><div>"No way! I'm only a caretaker, and I'm not even considered a man!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then...... that's fine."</div><div><br /></div><div>D*mn, you act so high and mighty. Well, at least he's better than me.</div><div>I couldn't say anything hateful, so I put on an amiable smile to get through this.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Oh my, dear? Who's he over there?"</div><div><br /></div><div>It was then that a woman appeared on the other side of Otosaki-san.</div><div>She was a beautiful blonde with wavy hair. Her red dress was open at the chest, highlighting her cleavage. Her face had not a single wrinkle, and her beautiful blue eyes were crystal clear.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Aah, it's Shidou-kun that Rei mentioned."</div><div>"My! So that's it. Nice to meet you, I'm Otosaki Lilia, Rei's mother."&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Ah, that's how it's written in kanji. She told me her name in a way that was easy to understand. Lilia-san is a foreigner, as I could see. As I recall, when foreigners became married into, they were allowed to use an alias or a nickname. Therefore, she must have taken a Japanese name to avoid being too obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I mean, isn't she too young?</div><div>Her skin is so firm that it would be easy to believe that she is in her twenties, but it would be difficult to call her Rei's mother unless she is at least in her forties.</div><div>Is this what you call a beautiful witch? Time seems to stand still only around this person.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah...... Likewise, it's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Shidou Rintaro." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes yes, Rintaro-kun, right? Thank you for always taking care of our daughter. My husband and I are usually at work and can't even go home, so it's a great relief to have someone like you around." (Lilia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Unlike her father, who seemed to be a strict man, she seemed to be a somewhat mysterious and fuzzy person. Despite her atmosphere, she is probably the most convincing person to be told that she and Rei are related by blood.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Today, I finally got to see her on her big day. I've been working no~n-stop and haven't been able to come to see her, so this is really the first time, you know? I crammed a lot of work into my schedule and managed to free up a day." (Lilia)</div><div>"I-I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Hmmm, she really had a unique pace of speaking. I could tell from her first words that she was not a bad person, but she spoke without any regard for the distance between us, and I had a feeling that she would take up a lot of my energy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, by the way! Otosaki-sa&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Yup, this is going to be confusing. Rei-san was also pretty excited that her parents were coming to see her. She was probably very happy that they were coming." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Shidou-kun, you don't need to get us in a good mood. We know better than anyone that Rei doesn't feel that way." (Lilia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was at a loss for words.</div><div>I was rather surprised by the stern expression on Otosaki-san's face when she said that, not to mention the fact that the mask she was wearing had been removed in an instant.</div><div><br /></div><div>"She must be very nervous. What she's feeling is not joy, but pressure. If she were to make a mistake at this concert, she would be forced to retire as an idol today. I don't want anyone to see my daughter suffer any embarrassment."</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki-san looked down at the audience and said clearly.</div><div>The words were strong, but they seemed to express a father's concern for his daughter.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If that's the case...... why didn't you stop Rei from becoming an idol?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I have relationships with various industries, and of course, I understand the harshness of the entertainment industry. So I thought she would soon face reality and give up......."</div><div><br /></div><div>However, it turned out to be unexpectedly successful, he added.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I always had a faith that she would succeed, because she's just so cute! Don't you think so, Shidou-kun?" (Lilia)</div><div>"I-I do. She's very popular even at the school." (Rintaro)</div><div>"But I also understand my husband's feelings, you know? She's so cute that I'm worried that any bad people will do terrible things to her. I wish she could have been just a normal girl, though........" (Lilia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt a little relieved as I talked with this couple.</div><div>Both of them are sincerely worried about Rei. I had been considering the possibility that they might even think of her as a tool of their own, so this cleared up one of my concerns.</div><div>But that is why they're so stubborn.</div><div>No matter how much her fame as an idol grew, rather than being happy about it, they would regard it as a cause for concern.</div><div>Even if Rei succeeded in her live performance here without making any single mistake, if they kept on like this, she would sooner or later&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>(Huh, so......what's the point of me being weak?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I clenched my fists and tried not to think about anything else.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou-kun, what are your thoughts on this?"</div><div>"Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I heard that in exchange for taking care of Rei, she's paying the rent and living expenses. If that girl quits being an idol, you'll lose quite a bit of money too, don't you think?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki-san looked at me with cold eyes and asked me that question.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Yes, those are that kind of eyes.</div><div><br />

</div><div>Those were the same examining, piercing eyes as that f*kkin' father's.</div><div>And this man was asking me this question.</div><div><br /></div><div>[You don't want Rei to quit the idol because it would cause you trouble, do you?]</div><div><br /></div><div>"Right, my thoughts. It's true that we've just moved, and if Rei quits the idol now, I'll have a hard time." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Then, I'll take care of your living expenses for the time being. So can you help me convince her to retire from idol?"</div><div><br /></div><div>It was a tempting proposal.</div><div>It's true that Rei's income as an idol is extremely high, but her father's income is probably even higher and more stable.</div><div>It's obvious to anyone who looked at it which one is more dependable.</div><div><br /></div><div>But&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"D-dear! It's about to start!" (Lilia)</div><div>"Mm......."</div><div><br /></div><div>When Lilia-san pulled Otosaki-san's sleeve in excitement, the lights that had illuminated the venue disappeared, leaving only the top of the stage.</div><div>The lights that remained were each in the color of the girls' respective images.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, standing on the illuminated stage was "Mille-Feuille Stars".</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>The venue, which had been buzzing with noise until now, fell quiet instantly as the lights went down.</div><div>Rei, standing in the center of the stage, signaled the beginning of the show.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"&#8213;&#8213;One, two..." (Rei)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>It was the same signal she had used during the rehearsal in front of me.</div><div>At her signal, the song began to play at a volume so loud that it shook the venue. The intro was matched by loud cheers from the audience, and the place was instantly enveloped in heat.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon sang the first verse of the song.</div><div>Her high-pitched voice, which normally sounds harsh to my ears, took the lead to attract the audience's attention.</div><div>Kanon's facial expression changed richly as she danced, and if I blinked even for just a moment, I'd feel as if I had missed something.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to keep looking at them&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as the audience began to feel this way, Kanon was pushed aside. Then, Mia jumped out from behind her. Of course, the whole sequence of actions was a setup, and Kanon glared exaggeratedly at Mia for a moment before returning to his original position.</div><div>This kind of playfulness that was unique to live performances, made the audience chuckle and feel privileged to be there in person.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia's voice is a little lower than the other two.</div><div>It could be described as sexy, her voice melted the brains of those who were listening to. This is exactly what it means to be mesmerized.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia sang out one phrase.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then the spotlight returned to the center of the stage, illuminating the last person there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I couldn't help but mumble her name.</div><div>Dressed more gorgeously than I'd ever seen her, she held out her arms and sang.</div><div><br /></div><div>Everyone gasped.</div><div>Everyone fell speechless.</div><div><br /></div><div>Her voice, lower than Kanon's and higher than Mia's, was crystal clear and filled with a mysterious charm.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yeah, I won't be able to resist this.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once you fall for "REI"'s voice, you'll definitely get addicted and want to hear it again and again. This is the power of real idols&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>The tempo of the song became more intense.</div><div>The three of them danced in harmony with each other. Even in the midst of this all, the three of them kept their breath steady.</div><div>Their toes and fingertips were in perfect unison. Their movements had been sublimated to an artwork.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, dear? She's really shining." (Lilia)</div><div>"......Yeah, you're right."</div><div><br /></div><div>I could hear their voices coming from right next to me.</div><div>I clenched my fists in secret. Even though it wasn't about me, I was filled with a sense of "got that!".</div><div><br /></div><div>If the girls keep going like this, everything will end without any problems&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div>I was beginning to feel optimistic.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was an hour later that the problem arose.</div><div>The concert had just passed the halfway point, and the second half was about to begin.</div><div>The audience's enthusiasm was at its peak, and after each song, the entire venue was filled with cheers.</div><div><br /></div><div>But then I noticed something was off.</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei who was always standing in the center of the stage had her shoulders bobbing up and down every time she took a breath.</div><div>Both Mia and Kanon must have noticed this, because they were looking at her sideways.</div><div>She was breathing with her shoulders, so to speak. Her breathing was very uneven due to fatigue.</div><div>Singing and dancing constantly for an hour must have consumed a tremendous amount of stamina. However, the girls had been training to be able to sing and dance for two hours. As proof of this, Mia and Kanon were breathing hard, but their faces showed no signs of fatigue.</div><div>Even during the rehearsal, Rei's breathing hadn't been this erratic.</div><div>In other words, it was definitely an abnormal situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>(......is it due to the pressure?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I clenched my teeth as I watched Rei's back as she left the stage for a short break before moving on to the next song.</div><div>There were several of these intervals during the concert. I wondered if she could recover some of her stamina in this short time.......</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br />

Are you okay&#8265;"</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as I got backstage, Kanon's voice hit my ears.</div><div>I looked up and saw the worried faces of KANON and MIA. I looked at them and could only nod my head in agreement.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You don't seem to be all right. Are you feeling sick, by any chance?" (Mia)</div><div>"......I'm, not." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, I'm not in bad shape.</div><div>I was in top condition when I woke up this morning, and that didn't change right before the concert.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, with just one trigger, that state of my fitness had already been shattered.</div><div><br /></div><div>I could see my mother and father's faces sitting in the special seats I had prepared for them.</div><div>I tried not to look at them. But every time I saw them, even for a moment, my mind, which had been overwhelmed by the excitement of the concert, was instantly pulled back to reality.</div><div>It was hard to breathe. I felt as if there was something stuck in the halfway of my trachea.</div><div>If I couldn't breathe properly, I wouldn't regain my strength. The fatigue was so strong that my knees almost gave way.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Anyway, take your time and drink some water. We don't have much time before the costume change, but you need to catch your breath until the last minute." (Kanon)</div><div>"I under, stand." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>As Kanon rubbed my back, I drank a little more water.</div><div>Then I exhaled and inhaled repeatedly. I could still feel something stuck in my chest, but I felt like I had recovered somewhat.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Now that we're in the show, we can't afford to withdraw halfway through if we can help it. REI, you know that, don't you?" (Mia)</div><div>"I'm, fine now. I'm sorry I worried you." (Rei)</div><div>"...... I see. Then, let's go." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>We put our arms into the next costume.</div><div>The costume, which I usually wore as heavy as feathers, is unusually heavy today.</div><div>I made my way to the stage again, trying not to let anyone notice that I'm staggering.</div><div><br /></div><div>Cheers rang out into my ears.&#12288;</div><div>The heat and the dazzling spotlight made me dizzy. But I couldn't fall down here.</div><div>I stepped firmly on the stage and held on, trying not to stagger.</div><div><br /></div><div>Move&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br />

(Kanon)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>KANON's shout flew to the audience.</div><div>This is the start of the next song, the most intense one.</div><div>The audience responded to KANON's shout with the loudest shout so far.</div><div>The word "critical moment" passed through my mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>Move, smile&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div>I will stand on the stage as an idol until the very end.</div><div>In order for them to recognize the "Otosaki Rei" standing here.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>The concert resumed.</div><div>The audience responded to KANON's instigation, and even though there had been a brief cool down, the heat was once again at its peak.</div><div>I knew this from the previous performance.</div><div>KANON's instigation after the costume change signaled the start of the most intense song of MilleSta.</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wondered if Rei, who was experiencing extreme mental fatigue, would be able to endure such an intense song.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"Here we go!" (KANON)</b></div><div><b>"OOOOOOOOH!"</b></div><div><br /></div><div>With Kanon's shout, the song began.</div><div>The song was titled "Sweets Rock", and as it was the most intense song, the center position was shifted from Rei to KANON.</div><div>There was almost no difference between the three of them in terms of physical ability, but some of their moves were not particularly matched to each other.</div><div>KANON was the best at jumping and bouncing, while MIA was the best at sexy and sensual dances.</div><div>REI is a fairly orthodox type, giving the impression that she can handle anything. That's probably why she's the center of most of the songs.</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as the song entered its chorus, the audience started to get even more excited.</div><div>Rei was still able to keep up.</div><div>At this rate, I'm certain she'll make it through this song.</div><div>She's a professional. If she reassessed her pace, she might be able to figure out a way to finish the song.</div><div>In the first place, it would be foolish for an amateur like me to worry about her.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's just that&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I can't get rid of this bad feeling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even so, I tried to keep my face from becoming dark.</div><div>After "Sweets Rock" ended, the show moved on to the next song.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"Now it's my turn." (MIA)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The next song was "Ice Cream Day".</div><div>The lineup changed and this time MIA took the center.</div><div>MIA's unique lo-fi voice was a perfect match for the refreshing summer tune.</div><div>By bringing this song after KANON's song, she cooled down the overly excited audience a bit and set the mood of the venue.</div><div>The dancing was also less intense, which was a relief for Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>But I know.</div><div>After this song, comes the song where Rei is the center.</div><div>She has made it this far, and her next wall is definitely that.</div><div><br /></div><div>And&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;MIA's song was over, it was time for Rei to take the center again.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"...... 'Golden Morning'." (REI)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>As she mentioned the title of the next song, the audience cheered again.</div><div>The song "Golden Morning," featuring Rei, was different from KANON's and MIA's songs in that it was more about singing than dancing.&nbsp;</div><div>There was little in the way of choreography, and the singer sang into a stand microphone on the stage. Since there was very little movement, this should help Rei recover some of her stamina.</div><div><br /></div><div>Her clear, beautiful voice echoed through the venue, and the audience just listened, unable to make a single noise.</div><div>This song, inspired by her jewel-like blonde hair, is truly a song that only she can sing. All of "REI"'s fans said that this song was their absolute favorite. No matter if an old fan or a new fan, it'd be the same.</div><div>After the first verse, she started to sing the second verse after an interlude.</div><div>Her voice was tracing the lyrics smoothly, and she finally entered the chorus.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was then that something wrong happened.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (REI)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Rei's voice came to a halt.</div><div>With a look of disbelief on her face, she stared dumbly at the microphone in front of her.</div><div>MIA and KANON, who were in charge of supporting the song, looked at Rei sideways. They seemed to be somewhat flustered by the situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>(!! Did you skip the lyrics!?)</div><div><br /></div><div>At the part with the lyrics, her mouth didn't move.</div><div>I didn't expect her weariness, which I thought was coming from her exhausted mind, to come out in such a way&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>Just before the chorus, Rei's mouth still did not move.</div><div>As expected, the audience began to notice the unusual situation and began to look at each other and make noises.</div><div>Rei's impatience was palpable even to me.</div><div>The cold sweat I had just broken out in was incomparable to the sweat pouring out of my body, rendering me breathe hard.</div><div>But, Rei must be suffering even more than I am.</div><div>The brief time that passed seemed infinite, and even the scenery seemed to be moving slowly.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, Rei's gaze wavered.</div><div><br /></div><div>Her gaze slowly turned towards the special seat we were in.</div><div>She looked at Otosaki-san, then at Lilia-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;at me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"!! WHERE-ARE-YOU-LOOKING-AT! OTOSAKI REI!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know myself, how I could have done this.</div><div>I couldn't help but lean forward and shout at her.</div><div>Most of the people in the special seats, including her parents, widened their eyes in surprise at my action.</div><div><br /></div><div>There was no way my voice could reach them at such a distance, with the song and the crowd buzzing.</div><div><br /></div><div>But I couldn't help shouting.</div><div>She was an idol, and the person she should be looking at was not me, or even her parents.</div><div><br /></div><div>Please remember that. Remember who you have to entertain.</div><div>You're standing in front of thousands of fans right now.</div><div><br /></div><div>Please, please, please.</div><div>Remember why you became an idol.</div><div><br /></div><div>You didn't become an idol just to make your parents smile.</div>

<div><b>"......Th" (Rei)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Our eyes met, and a voice escaped from Rei's mouth.</div><div>Her eyes, which had been wavering, returned to their original straightness, and her hand grasping the stand microphone grew stronger.</div><div>For some reason, I felt as if Rei had comprehended my voice, even though it was impossible for her to hear me.</div><div>Her eyes were already looking forward, and she took a deep breath.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Thank you." (Rei)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The words probably came across as unintelligible to the audience.</div><div>But I understand.</div><div>Just as my voice, which should have been impossible to reach, reached her, her words reached me without reason.</div><div><br /></div><div>The time that seemed like an eternity was coming to an end, and the chorus that I had thought would never come was here.</div><div>Rei's mouth, which had stopped, began to weave its way through without delay.</div><div>Her voice, now liberated from suffering, echoed throughout the venue at once. Her voice was the clearest it had ever been, as if she could fly away to wherever she wanted. Her majestic voice made us forget all the troubles that had happened a moment before, and it shook our eardrums comfortably.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Golden Morning" was, as I said before, a song inspired by her hair color.</div><div>The lyrics are about the ephemeral love story between a blonde-haired woman and a man. The first part is from a man's perspective, and the second part, which she's singing now, is from a woman's perspective.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>"I want to be the first person to greet you when you wake up."</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>"I want to be the one you see every day, eat dinner with, laugh with, and cry with."</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>"I want to be the one who can be by your side when you're really in pain."</i> <b><u>(PTW/N: .......)</u></b></div><div><br /></div><div>These lyrics hit my ears.</div><div>Instantly, the time I spent with Rei flooded back into my mind.</div><div>I believe Rei herself wrote the lyrics to this song.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wonder who&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;she was thinking of when she wrote the lyrics.</div><div><br /></div><div>(......I feel jealous.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I sat deep in my seat and let out a sigh.</div><div><br /></div><div>I shall not convey this feeling to anyone.</div><div>I'm jealous of someone unknown, and this is unsightly&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>The rest of the concert went smoothly, as if everything that had happened up until now had been a lie, and then came the final song that signaled the end.</div><div>Rei's face, after singing and dancing through the songs, had the most beautiful smile I've ever seen.</div><div>Even the fans who had been supporting them since their debut had never seen such a smile on her face, and for a while, it seemed to have dragged them further into MilleSta.</div><div><br /></div><div>I could understand that feeling.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Soon, after one encore, the concert came to an end.</div><div>In the end, most of the audience didn't seem to care about Rei's little mistake (they might have thought it was staged or something, though), and they left the venue with a satisfied look on their faces.</div><div>I watched the scene with a bit of a blank stare.</div><div>A kind of escapism. No matter how satisfied the audience was, it didn't change the fact that she had made a mistake.</div><div>It was escapism because I would rather not think about how it looked in Rei's father's eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;But I couldn't stay that way forever.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Otosaki-san, how was Rei's performance?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I asked Otosaki-san, who had already started preparing to go home.</div><div>He then stopped and gave me a glance.</div><div><br /></div><div>"My own daughter made thousands of people happy. I was honestly proud of her."</div><div>"Then&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Rintaro)</div><div>"But there was a blatant failure that even I could see. If she gets distracted under pressure, I hope she quits before she makes some irreversible mistake."</div><div><br /></div><div>It's no use, huh?</div><div>As not a parent, I couldn't understand even half of what Otosaki-san was feeling.</div><div>That's why I couldn't deny his opinion to his face.</div><div><br /></div><div>But that didn't mean I didn't have something to say.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Otosaki-san, as for your earlier offer to pay for my living expenses." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm, Aah...... If you can persuade Rei to do that, I will pay you enough to cover your living expenses."</div><div>"Thank you very much. But I shall decline it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>His eyebrows twitched.</div><div>Maybe he didn't even think that I would turn down such a good offer.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm not with Rei because of the money." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, at first I was, though. I'll keep my mouth shut about it here.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei-san is a person who can make such tremendous dreams come true on her own, like the ones I had when I didn't even know if I could remember. I can't let go of...... my blessed position of being the closest person to support her." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then......, can you take responsibility for her life when she ends up ruined due to some kind of failure?"</div><div>"No, I can't. Or rather, "I won't". It's disrespectful to her who had fought with her own strength to date to have me take responsibility for her." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Hmm......."</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm only there to support her. It's all Rei's decision to continue her fight as an idol.</div><div>I'm certain that she doesn't want me to be responsible for her either. I've never seen a person with as much pride in life as Otosaki Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... but if she were to fall&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;then I'd be prepared to fall with her."</div><div><br /></div><div>With a bitter smile on my face, I told him so.</div><div>To be honest, I regretted it a little bit, imagining what it would be like if that happened along the way, but after saying all this, I can't back down now.</div><div>I really don't want to fall together with you......, but that's enough. A man does not go back on what he's said.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It would only be a problem for us if you were to fall together......."&nbsp;</div><div>"A-ahaha, I'm sure you're right." (Rintaro)</div><div>"But let me express my honest gratitude to you for putting aside your shame and outward appearance for raising your voice for that girl."</div><div><br /></div><div>Gratitude&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>As he said this, Otosaki-san bowed his head toward me.</div><div>Next to him, Lilia-san bowed her head as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I really appreciate it, Shidou-kun. Thanks to you, that girl looks like she's back on her feet~....... You've been supporting her all this time. If you haven't, she wouldn't have been able to hear you like that." (Lilia)</div><div>"I, wonder if that's right......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm Rei's mother, so I know right what I'm talking about....... I think she might need you." (Lilia)</div><div>"You're buying too much into myself. I'm just a regular high school kid......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, I'm nothing more than just a regular high schooler.</div><div>I'm just a high school student, a worthless brat who shouldn't even be around Rei.</div><div>There's really not much I can do.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;This is the only thing I can do.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......What is the meaning of this?"&nbsp;</div><div>"I'm sincerely asking you." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I bowed deeply and profoundly to Otosaki-san.</div><div>This is the first time in my life that I have ever bowed to someone to this extent.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Please, let Rei continue to be an idol." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... What makes you go this far? It can't be, are you in love with her?"</div><div>"It's not like that....... The other day she told me about her new dream." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Live concert at the Nippon Budokan.</div><div>With the current momentum of MilleSta, that dream will surely come true in the not too distant future.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mille-Feuille Stars can climb even higher....... Don't you think it would be a shame to let them quit here?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I understand your sincerity, ....... But I can not hold such ideals. Back to the topic at hand, what if those kids make an irreversible mistake down the road? What if they get involved in some kind of danger? Isn't it the role of parents to stop them before that happens?"</div><div><br /></div><div>What Otosaki-san was saying was not wrong.</div><div>Rei's family is wealthy, needless to say. No matter how much money she earned, her parents earned even more.</div><div>From my point of view, Rei was a spectacularly successful woman who had achieved her dreams, but from her parents' point of view, the risks were all the more glaring.</div><div><br /></div><div>But all of this was within the realm of "possibility".</div><div><br /></div><div>"You parents have a duty to protect Rei, that's for sure. But that's not a good reason to deprive her of her dreams. If you're afraid that she will fail, then why don't you just support her so that she won't end up that way?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mmm......"&nbsp;</div><div>"I'm going to support her. I'll be right there to support her before she almost fell like she did today so that she can keep looking forward." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know which way Rei will go.</div><div>But even so, I'm sure I can at least make her "lean to one side".</div><div><br /></div><div>"I am begging you......! Please don't let her dream come to an end." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I bowed my head deeply again.</div><div>I tried to persuade him with words that sounded right, but in the end, it was all the ravings of a stranger. It was a flimsy excuse that would only end if I was told not to interfere in family affairs.</div><div>This attitude was no longer a good idea. If this doesn't work, I'm just going to give up.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Raise your head, Shidou-kun."</div><div>"But......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's my loss."</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki-san let out a sigh, looking somewhat resigned.</div><div><br /></div><div>"There's no way I can resist when someone tells me not to end my own daughter's dream. At the very least, I promise that I won't do anything to make Rei retire from the entertainment industry in the near future."</div><div>"Really?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"However, I don't know what the future holds. If I find that there is an inevitable danger to Rei in the future, then as her father, I will force her to quit...... In the meantime, she can do as she please."</div><div>"!! Thank you, very much!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>He told me to raise my head, but instead, I lowered my head even more.</div><div>My voice had reached the person in front of me.</div><div>You can do it if you try, right, ME.</div><div><br /></div><div>"We're going to take our leave. I actually wanted to have dinner with Rei, but I have to go back to the headquarter. I'd appreciate it if you could tell her what I just told you."&nbsp;</div><div>"Understood." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I patted my chest.</div><div>For now, the matter was settled.</div><div>I wiped my forehead, which had somehow become soaked with sweat, and exhaled.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Nevertheless, I found your presentation quite moving. You are indeed the son of the "Shidou Group"."</div><div><br /></div><div>At that moment, I felt the sweat drain from my body.</div><div><br /></div><div>"How did you......know?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I remembered it after we passed each other at school the other day. You may have forgotten, but I met you a few years ago. Don't you remember? You were the kid that Shidou-san had with him at a social gathering of all the big corporations, weren't you?"</div><div><br /></div><div>At a corporate social gathering.......</div><div>My head hurt so badly that I couldn't help but look down.</div><div><br /></div><div>What came to my mind was the scene I had seen in my dream.</div><div>I was in elementary school when my father took me to a party. In front of me was a man in a suit and a little girl.</div><div><br /></div><div>She was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;That girl was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou-kun, are you alright? You look a little pale."</div><div>"I-I'm alright...... I was a little nervous, so it might be a reaction to that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>My palpitations were intense, but the pain in my head quickly subsided.</div><div>I wondered what the pain was all about.</div><div>I could only be puzzled by the strange changes in my body.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Ah, I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time. I'll be going to take my leave soon." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yea...... you know, this is probably not the right thing for an adult to ask such a thing, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;"</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;Please, take care of Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>He told me so clumsily, there is no such dignity as the head of several projects could be sensed from him.</div><div>The man here now is simply just a father.</div><div>He was just a father, struggling with how to deal with his adolescent daughter.</div>

<div><b>[He's on his way back. Also, a message from your father. If there are no problems, you can continue to be an idol for a while longer.] (Rintaro)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>It was twenty minutes after the concert when I received such a LINE chat from him.</div><div>I read it over and over again, and it made my smile broaden.</div><div><br /></div><div>Rintaro must have done something about it.</div><div>I made a mistake in a song where I had to take the center. There was no way my father would let such a serious mistake go.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rei!? Don't grin at me when you make an uncharacteristic mistake, okay!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Mm......? Ah, so Kanon was there." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>In front of me stood Kanon, who had taken off her costume and was dressed casually.</div><div>From the look on her face, it was clear that she was very angry.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Don't gimme "so you were there"! You! Do you know how worried I was on the stage!?" (Kanon)</div><div>"I'm really sorry about that. I was a little distraught." (Rei)</div><div>"......Well, if you're apologizing, fine then. Just be careful next time, kay!" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon said and left with the makeup artists to remove her makeup.</div><div><br /></div><div>I know it. I won't make the same mistake again.</div><div>In the middle of the concert, I felt a sense of suffocation that I had never experienced before. I hadn't been afraid of singing or dancing in front of people since my debut, but today I felt as if my body wasn't even my own.</div><div>It seemed that I am more vulnerable to pressure than I thought.</div><div><br /></div><div>But, I'm already&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"......So, What did Rintaro-kun say to you?"</div><div>"Eh?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, his name, which I had been imagining in my head, was mentioned, and a dumbfounded voice leaked out.</div><div>Mia, standing in front of me, was giggling with amusement.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I couldn't help but look with her because Rei was so blatantly looking towards the special seats. He was trying to shout something. And then she went back to her normal self, and I thought maybe he had said something." (Mia)</div><div>"......Honestly, I didn't know what he said." (Rei)</div><div>"You didn't? Well, it was obvious that you couldn't hear him from that distance......." (Mia)</div><div>"But I think Rintaro probably wanted to say something like this." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Where are you looking at, look ahead!</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I tried to cling to the support of a guy named Rintaro, but he pushed me away.</div><div>It was only natural.</div><div>I am an idol, and there are fans who have come to see us at the venue. I have to do my best to respond to them.</div><div>Of course, my father and mother are also important to me.</div><div>But I didn't become an idol to make them smile.</div><div>A lot more&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I wanted to put a smile on the faces of many more people.</div><div>I remembered my origin, and I'm sure I won't make any other mistakes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Rei really likes him, yes?" (Mia)</div><div>"Like...... yup. I like him. <i>'For eight years now'</i>." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>My hand gripped my smartphone with strength.</div><div>In the third grade, my father took me to a party for adults, where I met Rintaro.</div><div>I couldn't be allowed to eat sweets back then, but he was the one who taught me how delicious they were.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was also a boy named Rintaro who taught me the joy of sharing a meal with someone else.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro made me smile. That's why I wanted to make people smile just like him. Rintaro is the one who led me to this path of being an idol." (Rei)</div><div>"Yes, yes, I've heard that many times before." (Mia)</div><div>"Muu, I'd like you to hear more." (Rei)</div><div>"Give me a break. I'm not so tolerant as to be able to give ear service to other people's love stories, you know?" (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Once Mia told me that, I straightforwardly backed off.</div><div>I really wanted to talk more about Rintaro.</div><div>If I could, I would talk to him, but I'll hold off until he remembers me.</div><div>I don't want to bring up Rintaro's past, which has been darkened by his mother.</div><div>One day, when he remembers me naturally, I'll thank him again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you for making me smile that time."&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;that's.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But I didn't expect that Rei would go through the trouble of acting just to get in touch with one boy. How did you manage to come up with a situation where you collapse from hunger?" (Mia)</div><div>"That wasn't an act. I was really hungry and couldn't move." (Rei)</div><div>"That's what I'm worried about, you know.......?" (Mia)</div><div><br />

</div><div>The day I reunited with Rintaro&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;To be precise, we met again when I entered high school, but we didn't have any conversation, so I won't count it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Originally, I was going to have my manager take me home that day.</div><div>When I got home, the maid would cook for me. If I had just gone home, I would have been able to go to school the next day without any problems.</div><div><br /></div><div>But then I found him. I saw him walking through the roundabout at the station.</div><div><br /></div><div>I immediately told the manager to stop the car and I got off at a place I normally wouldn't get off.</div><div>It would be a lie to say that I was attempting to impress him in this situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, I wanted to talk to him in a friendly way, by saying, "What a strange coincidence, yes". But I almost collapsed because I was hungrier than I thought.</div><div>I was lucky that I didn't have to ask him out for dinner, but I still feel embarrassed when I think about that moment.</div><div>But I'm really glad I had the courage to do it, because it gave me the opportunity to break into.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mia, I've made up my mind." (Rei)</div><div>"...... Let me ask you what you've made up." (Mia)</div><div>"I'm going to work even harder to make Rintaro "fall in love" with me." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee...... I was wondering why I couldn't hear your sleeping breathing, so you were awake at "that time", huh." (Mia)</div><div>"......Sorry." (Rei)</div><div>"It's not a problem. We weren't talking about anything we didn't want to be overheard." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>On the day of the housewarming party, I was listening to Mia and Rintaro's conversation from the bed.</div><div>At that time, he said it clearly.</div><div><br /></div><div>He said he couldn't fall in love with someone he'd only known for a month or so.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8212;&#8212;So, I'm going to try my best to spend more time with him and make him more aware of me. To be honest...... I don't know what I should do." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was an incredibly high hurdle for someone like me who had zero love experience.</div><div>But I really want to get over it.</div><div>In order to make the lyrics of "Golden Morning," which "I wrote while envisioning a boy named Shidou Rintaro", come into reality&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"I see....... Then, I'll have to work hard, as weel." (Mia)</div><div>"Eh?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was so engrossed in myself that I couldn't process Mia's words quickly enough.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei, the mean one who was eavesdropping on me, must know about it, right? You know, about I made an approach to Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</div><div>"B-but......you said it was just a kidding." (Rei)</div><div>"What could have been a joke could have been a joke. Plus, when someone wants something, you kind of want it too, don't you......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia looked into my eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue.</div><div>A chill run down my back, a chill I have never felt in all the years we have been working together.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I had to compete with Mia, then, I would be&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Oo~psie. Rest assured. I'm really just kidding." (Mia)</div><div>"...... it's really bad for my heart." (Rei)</div><div>"But Rei, you can't relax, okay? I might really fall in love with him in the future, and Kanon is no exception. And you know, there are more girls out there than just us." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>In a corner of my mind, the face of class-rep, Nikaido Azusa, came up.</div><div>Come to think of it, I thought she was talking to Rintaro proactively when they ran into each other at the aquarium.</div><div>It seemed that what Mia was saying was not as funny as it seemed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"For now, I'll be rooting on you, Rei. Until one day I really want Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>The only thing that didn't sound like a joke to me was her bewitching smile as she said that.</div><div><br /></div><div>The story of my love for Rintaro may possibly be more difficult than I imagined&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div>
