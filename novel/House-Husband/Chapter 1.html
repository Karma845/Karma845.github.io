<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Hungry Idol</h3>

<div>Do you think such a custom of&#8213;&#8213;men working and women doing housework&#8213;&#8213;is old-fashioned?</div><div><b>I do</b>. I know families that have <i>"fallen apart"</i> because of this old custom.</div><div>There is no doubt that there are people who are not suited to work in this world, but those who still want to work can do so whether they are men or women.</div><div>It doesn't matter whether men or women are in charge of housework.</div><div>So no one can complain about me dreaming of being a full-time househusband.&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;<i>Am I right?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div>In my class, there is a very popular idol who is very popular right now.</div><div>Her name is Otosaki Rei. She has beautiful blond hair due to her mixed foreign blood, and a style that is well beyond that of a high school student. Her facial expressions usually don't change much, so it's hard to tell what she's thinking, but when she's on stage, her facial expressions have a charm that attracts everyone who sees her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Otosaki-san! I saw the music show last night! The new song is amazing!"</div><div>"Thank you. I'm glad." (Rei)</div><div>"O-Otosaki-san! C-ca-ca-can I get your autograph?"</div><div>"If it's okay with you." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Today as well, Otosaki is surrounded by everyone in the class.</div><div>Two years ago, she debuted with an idol group called the <b>"Millefeuille Stars"</b>.</div><div>The group is also known as <b>"MilleSta"</b>, consists of Rei, Kanon, and Mia, and Otosaki is the center of the group.</div><div>Naturally, no one in the school doesn't knows her. In fact, it won't be an exaggeration to say that everyone in the school is a fan of her. And unlike the most, I, Shido Rintaro, am&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;not a fan of MilleSta.</div><div>It's not that I dislike them, I like them, but I'm just simply not their fan.</div><div>I'm not really interested in idols to begin with.</div><div>I'm only slightly interested because one of them is my classmates. There's no need to turn the boys' gaze into killing intent to get close to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Still popular as ever, Otosaki-san is."</div><div><br /></div><div>The person who spoke to me is my best friend, Inaba Yukio, sitting in front of me.</div><div>He has a thin body for a man, and I even mistook him for a woman when I first met him, which was rude.</div><div>This guy is also not that interested in Otosaki, and looked at her with pity as she's surrounded by her classmates.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The new song she performed at the music show yesterday was quite radical. You can't blame her fans for getting excited about it, since it's so easy for people to accept." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Hey, Rintaro? You always say you're not their fan, but you do check out their new songs, don't you?" (Yukio)</div><div>"I've decided to watch and listen to what's popular. Well, I'm only told to do so by my part-time job." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Hmmm....But, how can that Rintaro, who says he doesn't want to work, continues to work. I was a little surprised." (Yukio)</div><div>"Right now, I have to earn my living. But eventually, one day I'll find someone who can work hard for me and I'll become a full-time househusband." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's always a noble goal of yours, isn't it?" (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>Whenever I talk about this, Yukio always gives me this look of amazement. However, <i>"not working"</i> is my core goal in life, and it is something that will never be shaken. No matter what anyone says, I have no intention of changing this goal.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Speaking of which, do you have another part-time job today?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Yeah. It seems that today is a particularly busy day, so I had to take an emergency job. As for me, I'm grateful for the extra hourly wage." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As we're talking, the classroom door is opened and the first-period teacher walks in.</div><div>The conversation between Yukio and me is interrupted, and the classmates who have been crowding around Otosaki go back to their seats.</div><div>Just after the class started, I look sideways at Otosaki.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>(She has a beautiful face no matter how I look at......)</i></div><div><br /></div><div>It's hard to tell from her expression, but as an idol, she must be going through a lot of hardships and troubles.</div><div><i>That must be a lot of trouble</i>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I turned my head to concentrate on the class.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>



<div>After school, I head straight to my part-time job.</div><div>The place I'm working at is a room in an apartment building about a fifteen-minute walk from the station. When I open the front door, I see several pairs of shoes in disarray and the presence of several people.</div><div>When I open the door at the end of the straight corridor, there're αdults working moving their pens.</div><div>The woman sitting at the far end is my employer, a mangaka, Yuzuki Himiko-sensei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you for your hard work, I bought you energy drinks." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I hold up the bag from the convenience store in my hand, they all turned to look at me at once. Probably they haven't slept at all, their bloodshot eyes are a little scary.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintarooooo~! Thank youuuuu~!" (Himiko)</div><div>"Sensei, you're scaring me. How long have you not been asleep?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't worry, it's only been two nights." (Himiko)</div><div>"It's not okay at all." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a sigh and hand out energy drinks to her and her assistants.</div><div>This is the workplace of a successful mangaka, Yuzuki Himiko-sensei.</div><div>I'm hired as her assistant, and I'm in charge of drawing the background and applying the tone.</div><div>I usually come here when days off, but when things get rough, I come here after school to help out.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa~......, you're a thoughtful cousin to have, yea." (Himiko)</div><div>"Energy drinks are only a stopgap measure, so go to sleep as soon as you're done." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You don't have to tell me. I think I'll pass out." (Himiko)</div><div>"You'll die young you know......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As Yuzuki-sensei said, she and I are relatives. This is why she hired me, and now I've learned the job and I'm a force to be reckoned with in this workplace&#8213;&#8213;or she thought so.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'll get to work." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I sit down at the seat prepared for me and receive the manuscript with the line drawings from Yuzuki-sensei. I draw the background with the composition as specified, and put the tones in the positions as specified. It's not an easy job, but once I got used to it, I didn't find it hard.</div><div>The new MilleSta song that was being talked about today is playing in my earphones as I work in silence.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Rintaro, It's time for you to go home." (Himiko)</div><div>"What, I'm not finished yet." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's already twenty-one o'clock. I can't let a minor work any longer. Plus, there's only one page left, so I'm pretty sure I can make it." (Himiko)</div><div>"......I see. I'm sorry, but I'll leave you alone." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup! See you next time!" (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yuzuki-sensei gives a thumbs up, suddenly energized by the prospect of the manuscript.</div><div>She usually draws at a steady pace, but the fact that she was working until just before the deadline meant that she had put a lot of effort into drawing the story.</div><div>In fact, the manuscripts I saw while she was working were of a higher quality than usual and made me gasp several times.</div><div>Originally, Yuzuki-sensei is an artistic person, and she is extremely particular about her works. That's why she finishes her work without compromise, and I feel sorry for her assistants who have to go along with her regardless it's their job.</div><div>They look like dead people. It's a wonder they're still alive.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Th-thank you for your hard work......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>After I said that, the blue-faced zombies&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;no, I mean, the assistants, wave off to me. To be honest, I'm a little scared.</div><div>I leave the apartment and head for the station.</div><div>My house's three stations away from Yuzuki-sensei's workplace, so five stations away from the school in total.</div><div>I get off the train at the last station, along with a group of office workers who had just finished working late.</div><div>Perhaps because it's a late time, but I feel a little relieved to see the same scene as usual in front of the station.</div><div>However, in the midst of all this, a luxury car that can be called a foreign object suddenly enters into such a scene.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>(Whoever drives that car...... must have lived around here.)</i></div><div><br />
<!-- ADSENSE -->
</div><div>I guess they don't have trouble with money. How envious.</div><div>With such sarcasm in my voice, I'm about to start my usual way home.</div><div>However, I can't help but stop when I see a figure coming out of that luxury car.</div><div>She has beautiful blonde hair and a style that's way beyond that of a high school student.&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;She seems to have disguised herself with a hat on her head and a mask as well as sunglasses on her face, but she's definitely the popular idol, Otosaki Rei.</div><div>It's probably a pickup car. After getting off the car, Otosaki and the driver seem to have a word or two with each other, and then left the station.</div><div>Perhaps because the area in front of the station is sparsely populated, no one seems to have noticed Otosaki's presence so far.</div><div>If that's the case, it'll be best for me to leave without getting involved. She and I have been classmates since this spring, and we're not friends or anything.</div><div>Besides, I don't want to be responsible for any scandal that might arise because of me.</div><div>I walk past her, pretending not to notice her at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;<i>That's when the trouble occurred.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"......!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, Otosaki's body sways. I reflexively reach for her body and support her before she touches the ground.</div><div>Through her sunglasses, my eyes meet her bluish eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou......-kun?" (Rei)</div><div>"Y-yo, what a coincidence. I was just about to call out to you when you suddenly fell down, it's startling me." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>She smiled a distant smile and spoke in a soft tone of voice. She is the pinnacle girl in the class hierarchy.</div><div>If I give her a bad impression with my usual tone of voice, I don't know how I will be treated in the class.</div><div>If you are in the position of Otosaki, you can disrupt the high school life of a classmate you don't like with a single word....... As one would expect, <i>I'm exaggerating it, ain't I?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"Uugh......." (Rei)</div><div>"You don't look well, do you want me to call an ambulance? If you're not comfortable with me, I can call an αdult for now&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm....... hungry." (Rei)</div><div>"......Huuh?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki's stomach growls loudly. It looks like, all of this unwell look of hers comes from hunger.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......I'm worried you lost consciousness." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Auuu." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I took the support off of her and then she falls to the ground. After I had done that, I couldn't help but give her a look of regret.</div><div><br /></div><div>"A-AAAH!, My bad&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;no, I mean, I'm sorry! I thought you were not feeling unwell, so I was caught off guard! Hahaha!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"......You're terrible." (Rei)</div><div>"Ugh." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Aaa, I can't fool her.</i></div><div>Just perfect time, I'm getting tired of this forced smile. I'll just treat her like I always do. If I'm going to get a bad reputation, there's no point in trying to make it any worse.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Tsk....... and you said you're hungry. In this day and age, is that enough to make you unable to move? Normally." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't know you talked that way, Shidou-kun......." (Rei)</div><div>"It doesn't matter right now. Just tell me about yourself." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... It's not usually this bad. But today's lesson was special. I'm tired, hungry, and I can't move anymore." (Rei)</div><div>"Lesson......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As expected of a top idol. In order to give the best performance in front of the public, she has to work hard every day.</div><div><br /></div><div>"As long as you get eat, will you be able to move?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Maybe......." (Rei)</div><div>"Maybe is not good enough. Well, it can't be helped. I'll go and get&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I'm about to say <i>'get you something to eat'</i>, I shut my mouth.</div><div>Even if I go into the nearest convenience store, I'll be leaving her here for about five minutes. In addition, even though the place was not crowded, she's starting to attract attention from the people around.</div><div>It's only a matter of time before people find out that she's Otosaki Rei, and there's a chance that someone with malicious intentions will take her somewhere while I'm gone.</div><div>Even though we're not close, it's not a problem that can be dismissed as unimportant.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I may be worrying too much, but this is just in case. If you feel uncomfortable, just bear with me." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I turn my back to her and crouch down on the spot.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'll carry you on my back. Come on, get on." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Where are you going to take me?" (Rei)</div><div>"To my house. I'll make you some dish." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Is it okay?" (Rei)</div><div>"As long as you're okay with it. If you don't want to go to a man's house, I'll leave you at the nearest diner. I have to use up some meat that expires today, so I'll just go straight home." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's homier than I imagined......" (Rei)</div><div>"Sorry about it then, I'm aware that it's not my character. So, which's your choice?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Then, I'm going to Shido-kun's house. I'm interested in Shido-kun's cooking." (Rei)</div><div>"That so? It's not really a big deal. But if you're disappointed then, don't blame me, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki, who barely moved her body, puts her weight on my back.</div><div>The two large bulges hit me through uniform and I stiffen, but I stand up, trying to get rid of the naughty thoughts. <span style="color: #800180;"><i>(<b>PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;Hou noice~&nbsp;</i>( &#865;&#176; &#860;ʖ &#865;&#176;)&nbsp;</span><i style="color: #800180;">)</i></div><div>Although I can feel her weight, Otosaki's body was relatively light.</div><div><i>Is this also the mystery of the female body&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"Then, let's GOO." (Rei)</div><div>"Why are you taking the lead." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The surroundings probably haven't found out that she's Otosaki yet. So I quickly walked to my house before it becomes a bad rumor.</div><div><br /></div>

<div>My house is about a five-minute walk from the station.</div><div>It's a room in a five-story apartment building, and there's where I live now.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You live alone?" (Rei)</div><div>"Well, I am. I've various circumstances." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I open the door with the key and step inside with her on my back.</div><div>The room is a 1LDK with a separate living room and bedroom, and the rent is in the 40,000 yen range. The reason why I was able to rent such a cheap room in Tokyo was because of Yuzuki-sensei. <i><span style="color: #800180;">(<b>PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;I don't know exactly, but I'm googling it and found it cost around 100000 yen, or&nbsp;907.84 USD, per today rate, July 12, 2021)</span></i></div><div>Originally, the rent would have been a bit higher, but thanks to her provision of a rent allowance, the price has been reduced to an unbelievable level.</div><div><br /></div><div>"For now, just sit on the couch and rest. You also can watch TV if you want." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay." (Rei)</div><div><br />
<!-- ADSENSE -->
</div><div>I sit Otosaki down on the couch and take off her shoes. After taking them to the front door, I head for the kitchen, which is visible from the living room.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've decided I'll be using pork today, but do you have anything you want to eat? I can listen to some of your requests." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then, ...... Shougayaki (Ginger fried pork)." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee, do you like it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. Since I was a kid." (Rei)</div><div>"That's surprising....... Oh, well. I'll make Shougayaki, then." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's a relatively simple dish, thank goodness.</div><div>I take out the pork, onion, half of the cabbage, and a tube of ginger from the refrigerator and start to cook.</div><div>Although Shougayaki's a dish that I haven't done much research on, I'm confident that I won't make it unpalatable.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......You're very skilled." (Rei)</div><div>"That's because I cook every day. I've even ever made Shougayaki once or twice." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't really have an image of boys doing that. Why do you cook every day?" (Rei)</div><div>"For saving money. I earn all my living expenses by myself. And also for the sake of my future wife." (Rintaro)</div><div>"For your future wife?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yes. My goal is to become a full-time househusband. My dream is to cook dishes for my hard-working wife with proper consideration for taste and health." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>This plan of mine is going well.</div><div>I've been studying cooking every day, making menu books, improving my cleaning and laundry techniques, and since last year, I've been keeping a household budget.</div><div>I'm confident that even if I have a wife at this moment, I can satisfy her. The only problem is that I haven't met a girlfriend that'll be my wife.</div><div>Well, I don't expect to find one while I'm still in high school, and I plan to start looking for one around the time I graduate from college, when I can meet someone who already has a regular job.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry, but you'll have to put up with the retort for white rice. I was actually going to cook it, but I think your stomach has reached its limit, am I right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mmn......Thanks for your concern." (Rei)</div><div>"I mean, you have a manager or something, right? Then why didn't you just ask them for some dinner before you left for home?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I was trying to look good. I'm an idol, you know, I shouldn't be seen as a glutton." (Rei)</div><div>"Can't you at least show it to your people......? Well, I understand that you live your life with obsession." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Shidou-kun, you live a life with obsession too?" (Rei)</div><div>"Well, I am. Here it is." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In the meantime, the Shougayaki is completed. The fragrant smell of soy sauce and ginger tickle my appetite, and I praise myself for my great work.</div><div>I place a bowl of white rice, which has just finished heating, on the table in front of Otosaki, along with my own.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It smells better than any Shougayaki I've ever had......." (Rei)</div><div>"Thank you then. Eat it before it gets cold." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Let's dig in......!" (Rei)</div><div><br />
</div><div>I watch her with some nervousness as Otosaki puts the Shougayaki in her mouth.</div><div>To be honest, I've not been blessed with many opportunities to have my food eaten by others.</div><div>Although Yukio had eaten my food several times, this's the first time I'm cooking for a girl.</div><div>I have seasoned it for a man's taste, but is it too much for her, I'm worried&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, <i>but</i> her words echo as if to dispel my worries.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Delicious.......!" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I feel my body loosen up in an unusual way.</div><div>I can't help but smile at how nervous I seemed to be a while ago.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That so...... I'm relieved." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's the best I've ever tasted. No doubt about it." (Rei)</div><div>"I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, but ...... I don't feel bad about the praise." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I take a bite of it myself, and although it's the same as usual, it's certainly delicious. I've gotten better at cooking. I feel like making a smug face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can I have second." (Rei)</div><div>"Well, that's okay,...... but it's retort anyway." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I take the bowl and heat up another bowl of rice. After receiving it, Otosaki resumes eating at the same pace as before. When I see her like that, I can understand why she's almost collapsed from hunger.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Say, is being an idol fun?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It is. It's been my dream since I was a kid." (Rei)</div><div>"Wow, that's amazing. So you've achieved your dream at this age?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I have worked hard, and I also was lucky. Now I'm working even harder to not let go of the chance I got." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>She's a great girl. She lives in a different world from me, who doesn't want to work.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"Shidou-kun is also working hard for his dream. That's great too." (Rei)</div><div>"......Are you seriously think so?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup......? I really am." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I thought I would be ridiculed for wanting to be a full-time househusband.</div><div>That's why I didn't talk about it with anyone other than Yukio, whom I trusted, but when she unexpectedly complimented me on it, I couldn't help but feel caught off guard.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I knew that no matter what the dream is, everyone who works hard to achieve it is an amazing person. I want to support those people, too." (Rei)</div><div>"......I think I become your fan for the first time today." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You've never been a fan before?" (Rei)</div><div>"To be honest, I wasn't really interested in that stuff....... until I have a talk with you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I've become a fan of Shidou-kun, too. I want to come back and eat your dishes." (Rei)</div><div>"You can't do that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I reject Otosaki's request with no time. She seems to have not expected me to refuse her once and for all, and her eyes widen in an incomprehension.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Why?" (Rei)</div><div>"Why, you ask? You're...... a top idol, you know? If someone sees you along with a man, it will be an instant scandal. You're not just a high school student anymore, am I right?." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That is...... that may be true, but..." (Rei)</div><div>"Your dreams might be shattered because of me. I can't take responsibility for that, and I absolutely don't want to. That's why we must not get involved outside of school as much as possible." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't care if Otosaki gets caught in a scandal, but if it's involving me, I doubt I'll be able to live in peace.</div><div>Even if I'm overly self-conscious, it'll be too late after something happened.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Even today, I brought you here at high risk. I don't want to walk the tightrope any further." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... I understand. Then, I'll put up with it." (Rei)</div><div>"Please do. It's for the sake of your idol career and for my peace of mind." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>She looks quite depressed, but I have to give her a stern talking-to to keep the conversation from going downhill.</div><div>I'm sure Otosaki just likes my food more than she should because she ate it when she was hungry. And surely she'll cool down after some time. A top idol will definitely never have trouble finding good food.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you live around here?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup...... It's about a thirty-minute walk from here." (Rei)</div><div>"That's a bit far....... Then I'll call you a cab, and you can go home by it. I can't take care of the fare, though." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eeh......?" (Rei)</div><div>"Don't <i>'Eeh'</i> me. You've got more money than me, so you don't need me to take care of the fare, right." (Rintaro)</div><div>"No, that's not what I mean." (Rei)</div><div>"No way, you aren't planning on staying, ain't you?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki nodded without saying a word.</div><div>I'm getting a headache. She, her crisis management skills are so lacking.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've just warned you about this! It's a big problem for an idol to stay at a man's house, even if no one finds out! Use your common sense!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ugh, ...... can't argue with that." (Rei)</div><div>"I know you're tired...... but you still have to go home." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm sorry. I'll listen to you." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Why do I have to preach to my classmates?</i></div><div>Tired of wasting more calories, I order the cab on my smartphone.</div><div>After confirming that it'll come to my house in about ten minutes, I tell Otosaki just the same.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Forget about today. I'll forget about it too. We're just classmates who know each other pretty well." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......by all means?" (Rei)</div><div>"By all means." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I understand. I'll try." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>I don't want you to do it as a try,</i> but&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Well, she seems to be feeling sorry for herself, so I won't say anything more strongly.</div><div>When I check outside the window, I see that a cab is just arriving.</div><div>I'll send her until the front door. There's a possibility that other residents will see us if I do beyond that.</div><div><br /></div><div>".......Bye." (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah. I've got a lot more confidence now that......I've had you telling me it tastes delicious. So thank you for that......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm also glad that Shidou-kun was so kind to me. So, although you said earlier that we were a classmate who knew each other well...... can you please at least forgive me if I regard you as my friend." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Is it not good?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki tilts her head somewhat uneasily and asks me this question.</div><div><i>If there's a man who can answer no to this question, I would like you to bring him in front of me.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"......I get it. We're a classmate after all. So it's not that unnatural." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thank goodness. I'm happy." (Rei)</div><div>"I don't know what makes you so happy about being friends with me....... Well, whatever. I'll see you at school." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. See you at school." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>After saying that, Otosaki leaves my room.</div><div>Perhaps because she has gotten in, the cab that has been parked downstairs starts moving.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It has been an exhausting day, including work.</div><div>As I wash the dishes for the two of us, I think again about the events of the day.</div><div>It's not so bad to have someone else eat your food. It's even a good stimulus, but at the same time, I wish it will never happen again.</div><div>However, contrary to my wish, my peaceful life will be shattered the next day&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div>
