<h3>Epilogue &#8211; Peaceful aftermath, or so I thought</h3>

<div>The light coming through the curtains was getting stronger.</div><div>Ten days had passed since the Mille-Feuille Stars' concert, and there were only four days left before the school closing ceremony. It was the middle of July, and the summer heat was gradually rising.</div><div>At this time of year, it's hard to go outside, even in the morning.</div><div>I'm especially averse to the heat rather than the cold. I can manage to endure the cold by wearing layers of clothes, but the heat has a limit in the form of n*kedness. It makes me feel lazy to do anything, and I hate summer, which may sound uncharacteristic of a student.</div><div>Even though other people around me are having a youthful time at the beach, swimming pool, or doing club activities, I've already decided that I'm going to spend my summer break lounging around at home doing nothing.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rintaro. Let's go to the beach on the summer break." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;A devilish whisper was thrown at me, trying to disrupt my schedule.</div><div><br />

</div><div>Rei looked at me expectantly as she gobbled up the breakfast I had made for her.</div><div>I remained silent for a while, but then exhaled in resignation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa~...... Why don't you girls just go?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I want Rintaro to come along." (Rei)</div><div>"Hey hey. You can't disguise yourself at the beach, can you? I can understand if you three of MilleSta are going to go out there and have fun together, but no way I can come along." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't worry. The agency will rent a private beach for the Milfeuille Stars' upcoming swimsuit photoshoot." (Rei)</div><div>"I didn't know that a private beach could be rented." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. To be precise, they rent a hotel with a private beach. Apparently, idols like us, celebrities, and gravure idols, which is their main occupation, often use it for their photo shoots." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see. That way, she won't have to disguise herself and worry about being seen by strangers.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But it's supposed to be work, right? I guess I shouldn't come along." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's okay too. As a reward for the last live performance, they said we could stay another day after the shooting was over, just us. They'll even give us cab fare so we can get home easily." (Rei)</div><div>"Huh, that's very thoughtful of them." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll have Rintaro join us later, this way we can have fun together for the whole day. Also......." (Rei)</div><div>"Also?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I want Rintaro to see my swimsuit before it appears in a magazine......." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>With those words, I couldn't help but have a hard time reacting.</div><div>What a destructive force. That was what I could only say. Rei, whose facial expressions never change, said it in an embarrassed manner, and that gap made me feel as if I had been hit on the head.</div><div>If there is anyone who can refuse this offer with a straight face, please bring that person in front of me. You have my full admiration.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Got it. It's not that I dislike it, it's just that it's unhealthy to just laze around and not go anywhere during summer break, okay. If you're okay with me, then I'll come along with you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thank you. I owe Rintaro a debt of gratitude for convincing my father, and I wanted to pay it back somehow." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei's face flushed.</div><div>Yes, her face.</div><div>She seemed to be smiling more often these days. Her expression was d*nm, extremely attractive, and every time she did it, it shook my heart greatly, so please give me a break.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Well, I'll take what offered to me. I want to ask you, if MilleSta is going to be there, are 'they' going to be there too?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup." (Rei)</div><div>"I think I'd be executed if any of those die-hard fans knew I was spending time with the three MilleSta on a private beach." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been blessed enough to live on the same floor of the same apartment building, and now I get to see their swimsuits up close.</div><div>Apparently, in my previous life, I was immensely virtuous. <b><i>(PTW/N: Or maybe, you were such a Yuusha who was just being used, deceived, then got betrayed, persecuted, tortured, etc. But without simp goddess, tutorial mode, healing ability, philosopher stone, or so.)</i></b></div>

<div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Would you have preferred to be alone with me?" (Rei)</div><div>"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"S-sorry. It's nothing. I'll go first." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei ran out of my house in a hurry.</div><div>There was a lunch box left on the table. Apparently, she was so flustered that she even forgot to put it in her bag.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haha, Rei is such a rash lass....... Haha." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I slapped my cheek with my palms.</div><div>The light sound of skin against skin echoed, and I felt a twinge of pain.</div><div>It was all the fault of this slap. My cheeks were hot and red, all the fault of the slap.</div><div>I'm absolutely not in a crush.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Is it so impossible?</div>

<div><br /></div><div>"Idols are, nuts, yes." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>A sentence that lacked any vocabulary leaked out of my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked away from the small bud of emotion that had sprouted deep inside me.</div><div>I couldn't name this bud right now.</div><div>If I did, I wouldn't be able to ignore it anymore. Then, I would want to nurture this emotion.</div><div>If I let it grow, it'd surely torment me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want my life to be more peaceful.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Now, I have to think about how I'm going to hand this over to her in school." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I talked to myself deliberately and reset my mind.</div><div>I packed my and her lunch boxes in my bag and grabbed a slice of baked bread.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Lately, I've been thinking.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I can keep my relationship with Rei forever, I will be able to achieve my life goal of not working.</div><div>But it's just a convenient fantasy.</div><div>No matter how hard I try, a celebrity like her and an ordinary person like me can't be together.</div><div><br /></div><div>There will come a time when we must part ways.</div><div><br /></div><div>There will come a time when Rei will quit being an idol, and there will come a time when&nbsp; I will have to pursue marriage with my ideal wife.</div><div>The incident with Rei's family had reminded me of that.</div><div>So until then, or at least until then, I will support Rei. In order to protect her peace of mind and her radiance.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Mm?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I put on my shoes and was about to leave the house, I noticed the vibration of my smartphone in my pocket.</div><div>Looked like someone had sent me a message.</div><div>I put in the password and clicked the LINE message notification.</div><div><br /></div><div>The name of the sender was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Nikaido Azusa.</div><div><br /></div><div>And the contents were as follows.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>[Would you like to go out to dinner with me this Saturday? ......I'd like to hear why you were with Otosaki-san at the aquarium.]</b></div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Hey, isn't the air-conditioning working too effective?</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt a chill run down my back that made me think so.</div><div>My body must have gotten cold all at once, but for some reason, my sweat started to flow incessantly.</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems I'm going to have to work for a while longer.</div><div>For the sake of a very popular idol who has taken a liking to this guy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa...... Goddammittt." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>A swear word escaped my lips.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want my life to BE more peaceful.</div>
