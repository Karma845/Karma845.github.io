<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Money = Power</h3>

<div>The next day, Otosaki comes to school and is chatting with her classmates, looking the same as usual.</div><div>Seems she was able to go home safely after that. As long as I can confirm that, I don't need to worry about her anymore. I avert my gaze from her and turn to face Yukio sitting in front of me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... That's unusual. Rintaro is staring at Otosaki-san." (Yukio)</div><div>"Y-you think so? Although I did the same yesterday." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well yeah, but it's not the usual...... kind of gaze." (Yukio)</div><div>"No way.... It's just your imagination." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Well, I guess." (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>No matter how good of a friend he is, isn't he too sharp?</div><div>I'm really glad I reset the relationship with Otosaki yesterday. If I had accepted her request as it was, this guy might have found out about it promptly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;Hmm?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I'm talking with Yukio, my phone suddenly shudders.</div><div>It seems that a Line arrived from Yuzuki-sensei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Emergency. I found a flaw in the manuscript, and I need your help again today." (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>I frown as I read the message.</div><div><br /></div><div>"wasn't the deadline said today......? That person." (Rintaro)</div><div>"From work?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Yeah. She said he found a flaw in the work that was supposed to be done yesterday. She told all her assistants to take a day off, so I guess she could only rely on me, her relative." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That can't be helped, can that." (Yukio)</div><div>"I guess there's not much work left to be done if she's only calling me, so I'll just take it as a bonus and go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Assistant to a famous mangaka....... I'm kinda jealous." (Yukio)</div><div>"You won't be able to say those words anymore if you witness the mass zombification phenomenon there......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I send a message of approval to Yuzuki-sensei and put my phone away in my uniform pocket.</div><div>As soon as the class is over, I leave the school and head to my workplace just like yesterday. I ask Yuzuki-sensei, who apologize to me, about my work and we both get right to it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sowwie~, Rintaro~." (Himiko)</div><div>"I don't mind, I was told that my hourly rate would be increased properly." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Of course! I'll pay you handsomely!" (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>As a person who earns a living, I'm willing to do anything as long as I get paid. It doesn't matter if the workload is as large as today's, "What, I'm going to be the only assistant doing this?", It doesn't matter if I get paid more per hour.</div><div>In fact, my expectation that there wouldn't be much work to be done if I was the only one called is way off. It's a little harder than yesterday, to be honest because I have to work alone.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry......, I'm sorry......." (Himiko)</div><div>"......! AAH ENOUGH! If you have time to apologize, please just move your hands!" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Y-yes, sir!" (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>You are a big named author, so don't show me anything too pathetic. Gosh, I'm sure the reason why she only called me is to keep anyone from seeing her pathetic side, but please don't show me too much either.</div><div>I have a lot of respect for you.</div><div><br /></div><div><br />

</div><div><br /></div><div><i>(M-my fingers are starting to feel numb......)</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I started working on it around 16:00 and struggled for seven hours. Yesterday, she asked me home at 21:00, but today, I went two hours over that time.</div><div>But thanks to my efforts, I think the manuscript itself turned out better than before. Although Yuzuki-sensei is looked exhausted, her expression is one of satisfaction.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Done......, it's done! Rintaro!" (Himiko)</div><div>"That's great....... I'll home then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm really grateful. I'll pay for your cab fare. Get a good rest today." (Himiko)</div><div>"Thank you very much. You too, Sensei, please go to sleep." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Sure. I'll sleep like a dead man." (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>I turn my back on her, who seems reliable but not at all, and leave her workplace.</div><div>I take a cab with the money she gave me and arrive in front of my house much later than usual.</div><div>The entrance to the apartment is locked automatically, so I have to enter the password. As I'm about to enter the password as usual, I notice something.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......What are you doing?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I was waiting for Shidou-kun." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>She's sitting at the end of the entrance. She seems to have tightened up her disguise since yesterday, wearing a mask, lensless glasses, and covering her hair in a hoodie.</div><div>To be honest, it makes her look more suspicious, but unless they get very close, they won't notice that she is Otosaki Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......I told you not to come again, didn't I?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. But I came here because I really wanted to ask you a favor." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>She's a hard woman to understand.</div><div>It may be easy to turn her down here, but if she labels me "Shidou Rintaro as a horrible person", I won't be able to live peacefully anymore.</div><div>GoddÎ±mn idol. She's too high in the hierarchy to be treated so disrespectfully.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa~ I understand. I'll listen to you for now. Come on in." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm, Thank you." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>With a somewhat happy tone of voice, Otosaki gets behind me.</div><div>I let her in and sit her down on the couch as I did yesterday.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"I'll at least make you a cup of coffee, but can you go black coffee?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Preferably sweetened one." (Rei)</div><div>"Sure. One with sugar." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I mix more milk and sugar into the instant coffee and place it in front of her.</div><div>Normally I drink my coffee black, but today I made it sweeter. I do this to recover from my fatigue, and it turns out to be the right decision.</div><div>When I've calmed down from the turmoil caused by her visit, I make eye contact with her and ask,</div><div><br /></div><div>"So, what is it the favor that you want to ask me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I've thought about it all day. And after all, I really want to eat Shidou-kun's dishes again." (Rei)</div><div>"I've turned you down yesterday, haven't I......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. But I just can't forget it. The lunchbox I ate for lunch and the snack I had during the lesson were no match for yours." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;Don't get carried away, me.</div><div><br /></div><div>The fact that she likes my cooking enough to barge in on me naturally made my cheeks loosen up. If I accept her request, immersed in such temporary joy, I will surely regret it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Th-that so...... but it's still impossible. As I've said many times, if by any chance you and I were to be seen together, the name Otosaki Rei would be damaged. I can't take responsibility for that. In the first place, even the cost of food is doubled by a simple calculation. It may sound stingy, but I don't want to have less money to put into savings." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>I try to save as much of my earnings as possible in case I don't end up with anyone in the future.</div><div>It's not only ruining people's lives, but also draining my own savings.</div><div>It doesn't matter how many chances you have to get close to your idol, it's always better to decline.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So just give up. You're a celebrity, after all, and you can easily go to better restaurants. You don't have to come all the way to my pla&#8213;&#8213;." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll pay you 300,000 yen a month, and I'll also pay for food for the two of us. So, please provide me with food every day." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, Otosaki takes out a bunch of money from her bag and places it in front of him.</div><div>It certainly looks like roughly 300,000 yen&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"How about it?" (Rei)</div><div>"Deal. Don't hesitate to come." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......" (Rei)</div><div>"......" (Rintaro)</div><div><span style="color: #800180;"><blockquote>(<b>PTW/N:</b> Umm... Mr. Synopsis, you said that 'Rintaro is wary of such a tempting offer', but... DAHEEEELLLL is thisssss!!1!1?? ðŸ˜…&#65039;ðŸ˜‚&#65039;)</blockquote></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Oh, sh*t. I was tempted by the money.</div><div>I cough and open my mouth again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Y-you may be able to pay me like this today, but can you keep pay me 300,000 every month just because you're an idol? Don't do something you can't do." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I've got five commercials lined up for this year. My songs are selling well, and I have concerts coming up. So I have no problem with that." (Rei)</div><div>"It's too convincing.......!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know how much money she's getting, but I'm sure she's getting a lot of money that common people like me can never get.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Not enough? Then even 500,000 is fine. I don't spend a lot of money to begin with......." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I hurriedly stop her as she tries to take out more money.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... No, I don't even know how much I can actually meet expectations, so there's no need to raise them from the start." (Rintaro)</div><div>"But......" (Rei)</div><div>"...... Okay. I'll take your offer." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Really&#8265;" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki, who her eyes shining, grabs my hand.</div><div>I calm my heart, which is about to explode, and speak the rest of my words.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I was defeated by enthusiasm. I need money to live after all...... Honestly,&nbsp; I'm flattered that you put a value of 300,000 yen on my work" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I really want you to let me pay you more. But if Shidou says I don't have to, I'll put up with it." (Rei)</div><div>"Oh, please do that. When I meet your expectations in the future, at that time you can reconsider about it." (Shido)</div><div>"I understand. I will." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Her hand slips away.</div><div>I've always known that there was something wrong with her, but Otosaki was a weirdo who went even further than that.</div><div>I can only think that she is out of her mind to pay 500,000 yen just to have a classmate cook for her.</div><div>I can't point it out more, because I'm pretty much the same way.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But you have to promise me. When you come to my place, you will make every effort not to reveal yourself. Don't let your guard down, and don't take off your hat and mask. This is also for my sake, but most of all it's for your own sake, you understand?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I know. I still want to continue being an idol." (Rei)</div><div>"Okay, then here's the deal. I'll make you meal, and you'll pay me for it." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup, we have a deal." (Rei)</div><div>"...... Well, it's just a verbal agreement, though. Then I'll make today's meal. What do you want to eat? Depending on what you want, I can't start to cook." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then, I want curry." (Rei)</div><div>"It's going to take some time. Are you will be fine?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm fine. I'm staying the night." (Rei)</div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;What?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki has a very natural look.</div><div>Rei, A top idol and MilleSta's center, is staying at my place......?</div><div>My brain couldn't keep up with the processing, and the confusion spread.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I said you'd make me food every day. I eat breakfast every morning. But if I commute here from my house every morning, I won't be able to get enough sleep. So I'm staying here." (Rei)</div><div>"O-oh......, I see. But it's still a no, understand?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Why not?" (Rei)</div><div>"It's not a good idea for two high schoolers to sleep together alone, no matter how much we don't like each other...... You can't make excuses for sleeping over, even if it's just for eating together." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then I will pay 500,000. And I'll be more careful."&nbsp; (Rei)</div><div>"Mmm already. I can't help it then." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sorry, but I can't win against money.</div>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<div>As I stew the curry, I look at Otosaki, who has her eyes on the TV.</div><div>On the screen, a live performance by MilleSta is playing. The program itself seemed to be a pre-recorded music program, and the live performance itself seemed to have been used to introduce the girls.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I knew it, the arm swing should have been a little wider at this point......." (Rei)</div><div>"That's a lot of detail......, I honestly can't even tell, you know?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I won't be able to tell by just imagining it in the head. But when I look at it, I'll get a different impression." (Rei)</div><div>"Is that how it is?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I usually can't tell what she's thinking, but the very now she's having the face of a professional.</div><div>It's a strange feeling to think that the face I had been looking at through the screen is now right there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Here it is, it's ready. The curry and rice you requested." (Rintaro)</div><div>"!? I've been waiting for!" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I put the curry on the rice that I cooked properly today and serve it to Otosaki.</div><div>The curry I made this time is a mixture of dashi stock and a little bit of soy sauce, giving it a slightly more Japanese-style finish.</div><div>I've tasted it and it's good for my palate, but I wonder how it'll be for hers.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Delicious.......! It's too good that I'm surprised." (Rei)</div><div>"Your reaction is really pleasing to the cook." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>There's no doubt in my mind that I'm being flattered as she gave her impressions with a twinkle in her eyes.</div><div>I then try a mouthful of it myself, along with some rice, and it's indeed good. I've made the same dish once before, but this is tasted even better than I did then.</div><div>I'm really glad about my own growth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'd like to second." (Rei)</div><div>"I knew you'd say that, but where is all this food disappearing into your thin body?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You need more food to endure the rigorous lessons. And just this is not even enough." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee...... looks like it's worthwhile." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I hand her a refill, Otosaki begins to eat happily again.</div><div>Seeing her, I gradually become calm and decide to ask her what I've always wondered.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Say, isn't this a little strange after all?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"What?" (Rei)</div><div>"The fact that you want to eat this common food. I don't mean to be sarcastic or anything, but you can get better food than this, can't you?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>This offer is just too good for me. 500,000 yen a month just for cooking food for an idol and letting her stay at my place. It's almost like a scam.</div><div>In fact, I'm suspecting it now. The money is still on my desk and I haven't even touched it yet.</div><div>Now is the end of such a euphoric mood. We need to talk about the future&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's been a long time since I've eaten something homemade by someone......." (Rei)</div><div>"Eh?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"My family is a little wealthy, but my father and mother were busy and rarely home. That's why the housekeeper always cooked our meals. But for some reason......the meals, which were supposed to be warm, weren't warm at all." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>But&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>Otosaki is silent for a moment, but soon opens her mouth again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou's food was warmer than anything I've ever eaten. It made me very happy, and......I think I will never be able to forget it for sure." (Rei)</div><div>"...... It's not that big of a deal, though." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see, she's <i>"in the same boat"</i> as me, isn't she?</div><div>Anyway, it seems that her words aren't a lie. If it's an idol's acting, I can only praise her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I get it. I'm sorry for doubting you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You doubted me?" (Rei)</div><div>"The offer was too good to be true. A nationally popular idol comes to my place and pays me just to feed her and sleepover, it supposed to be I the one who shall pay." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I pay for things I think are valuable and worthwhile. It's only just natural." (Rei)</div><div>"That may be so, but you have to realize that...... you are worth a h*ll of a lot more than just your appearance." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Is that what it is?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>She looks down at herself with a puzzled expression, as if she can't understand my words.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you like my body too, Shidou?" (Rei)</div><div>"Buuffff&#8213;&#8213;" (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>I hurriedly hold my mouth and try not to spurt out the water I've just taken.</div><div>Instead, the water runs into my trachea and I choked, but that doesn't matter anymore.</div><div><br /></div><div>"W-what are you talking about&#8265;" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Everyone was staring at my body. I really want them to appreciate my singing and dancing. But is it also important to look good?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>&#8213;&#8213;I don't know how to respond.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Well, there's no need to do anything for this person's appearance. So let's just give her my honest opinion.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That's right. If you weren't looking good, you wouldn't have been able to debut as an idol in the first place." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... I see. I heard the obvious. Sorry." (Rei)</div><div>"I don't mind, but......there's a reason for that, isn't there." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm afraid of the way people at school and work are looking at me lately. Maybe it's just my imagination, but......" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's hard to say this directly to her, but I'm sure she's not imagining what she's feeling.</div><div>To be honest, men are definitely er*tically looking at her. Otosaki was a middle school student when she made her debut, but after entering high school, her body suddenly became more feminine. In fact, she has become <i>too</i> feminine.</div><div>I've never been particularly interested in idols, but even I think so, and there's no doubt about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I have a feeling that you lack crisis management skills. Really, you should be really cautious about your life." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Cautious for what?" (Rei)</div><div>"I'm talking about men. Men are beasts, you know? It's too late when you're assaulted." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Shidou, are you a beast?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>How many times does this person have to annoy me before she's satisfied?</div><div>Even so, I can't just nod off here.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm not going to attack you, you're my precious money-mine&#8213;&#8213;no, I mean, my employer, and also I don't want to be a criminal yet." (Rintaro)</div><div>"A money-mine, that's terrible.&nbsp; But I feel safe." (Rei)</div><div>"Money is a source of security. There's nothing wrong with that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>There is nothing scarier than free stuff, and when it comes to things that cost money, that buys a lot of peace of mind.</div><div>As long as I'm receiving money from her, I'm not going to betray her.</div><div>Well, even if I don't receive money from her, I won't do such a thing as a human being.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Otosaki is really a pure girl, isn't she?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You think so?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah. That's probably part of the reason why you're so popular." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The entertainment industry is often said to be a place of deep darkness. I hope she doesn't suffer from that darkness someday&#8213;&#8213;but it's not something I can do anything about, and from her point of view, it's probably none of my business.</div><div>I don't want to interrupt her without knowing her well.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, by the way, what about the toiletry? I only have men's shampoo here, you know?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't worry, I've brought it." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, from her bag, Otosaki takes out a pouch that is written <i>"The Sleepover Sets"</i> there. Inside are single-use shampoo, body wash, a toothbrush, and toothpaste.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You're <i>ready perfectly</i> to stay over, aren't you......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I've intended to do since the beginning." (Rei)</div><div>"Didn't anyone tell you that your action often misleads men?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I've heard that from the other members. How did you know?" (Rei)</div><div>"There's something wrong with you, really." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>I've heard that many geniuses are weirdos, and I'm sure Otosaki is one of them.</div><div>If I'm a girl, I'll refuse to stay at a boy's place who is not my lover. Moreover, alone. Furthermore, we haven't known each other for a long time.</div><div>I'm not complaining, because I get paid for her weirdness, but I'm sure I'll have to worry about her all the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou-kun." (Rei)</div><div>"What is it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"From now on, I'll be in your care." (Rei)</div><div>"......Yeah, I'll be in your care as well. You can call me Rintaro from now on. You're my employer after all, you know." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay. Then you can call me Rei." (Rei)</div><div>"Did you hear what I said......? We're talking about you being my employer and me being your employee." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then...... An order? Call each other by name, get to know each other better." (Rei)</div><div>"What are you, an elementary schooler?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I may have taken it too easy. Now that I have received the money, Otosaki's words are absolute. I can't go against her from now on.</div><div><i>&#8213;&#8213;I have a bad premonition, just a little.</i></div>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<div>It's been a week and a few days since I started my mysterious life together with the top idol, Otosaki Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>One thing that made me feel a little relieved was that Rei did not stay over every day.</div><div>Sometimes her manager would pick her up for work, and on those days, she would come the day before for her lunchbox.</div><div>Every time she did this, she gave me a look of dissatisfaction, but she didn't complain because she understood the difference between work and private life.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro. I've got a brilliant idea." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei suddenly called out to me as I was washing the dishes I had soaked in water after dinner.</div><div>One thing I've learned in the short time we've known each other was that what she referred a "good idea" is a problem for me.</div><div>I put down the dishes and sat down next to her, even though I had a bad feeling about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If you start talking nonsense, I'll mix your dislikes into tomorrow's menu." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Unfortunately, I don't have any dislikes. I'm proud of that." (Rei)</div><div>"Tsk, I see&#8213;&#8213;So, what did you come up with?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll have to come here to eat, which means more trouble. That's why we should just rent a new house and share a room together. A very brilliant idea, right." (Rei)</div><div>"You've come up with a crazy idea, really." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Why? It's very efficient, though." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>...... Sure, it's efficient. But efficiency is not the only thing that can be said about this case.</div><div>In the first place, I had been running out of my private time, but if we start living in the same house, I'll have none at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You live with your parents, right? As long as you can't say you're going to live with me, then it looks like you can start living alone........ But, will the people around you allow you to do that?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm a little&#8213;&#8213;unsure about that." (Rei)</div><div>"So we'll put this on hold. If there are any inconveniences, let's think about it." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... I understand. I will." (Rei)</div><div>"Okay, that's great." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Although it was a bit of disrespect to treat my employer like this, but Rei had ordered me to treat her as a friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's time to go to bed. Tomorrow I have PE in the first period." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm, understood." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei stood up lazily and disappeared towards the bedroom.</div><div>I folded down the back of the sofa in the living room and transformed it into a bed.</div><div>The sofa was originally in the bedroom, but now I forced her to use the bed. At first, Rei tried to make me use the bed, but I refused. There was no way I was going to let her use the sofa. So we had a long argument. We finally came to a compromise: Rei would use the bed, and I would use the sofa bed she bought.</div><div>In short, this sofa was not in my house from the beginning.</div><div>I'm still amazed at the wealth of a successful idol.</div><div>This sofa is also a very high class and quality item, not something that an average high school student can just say "I'll buy it" and buy it easily.</div><div><br /></div><div>(But I don't envy her at all.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked at the bedroom where she was probably sleeping and thought about such things.</div><div>The overcrowded schedule, the environment that doesn't allow for failure, and the mindless slander on social media.</div><div>It was still moderate because MilleSta hadn't caused any problems, but even so, I'd seen people who didn't like them verbally abuse them several times.</div><div>Hopefully my cooking the food would ease Rei's stress a little&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Six o'clock in the morning.</div><div>I woke up refreshed thanks to the good quality of the sofa bed, and started to make breakfast as usual. Although I said I was going to make it, I wasn't going to cook anything that elaborate. I made sure that I had some leftover white rice from yesterday, and cooked a fried egg and bacon with a little extra seasoning so that I could eat it with it. I put a salad next to it, mainly lettuce, which I bought thanks to the fact that I didn't have to worry about food expenses, and brewed coffee. Of course, I used plenty of sugar and milk for her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rei. Breakfast is ready....... Rei?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Haa, not again.</div><div>She's very weak in the morning. She rarely woke up by herself, and I usually had to call out to her to wake her up.</div><div>And when it didn't wake her up, I had no choice but to enter the room and woke her up directly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can't be helped then, I come in." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I gave notice, and opened the bedroom door.</div><div>As expected, Rei was sleeping comfortably on the bed.</div><div>But her appearance was a problem.</div><div>Perhaps because the weather had been a little warmer lately in June, the blanket had been pulled off. That wasn't the only problem, the t-shirt she was wearing as her nightgown, which read "I don't want to work," had been pulled up. This T-shirt is mine, tho&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div>Because the t-shirt was pulled up, the lower part of her chest was visible, it was quite poisonous for eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Huge...... Not it. Is she, sleeping without underwear on?)</div><div><br />

</div><div>An evil thought almost came to mind, but I suppressed it with reason.</div><div>It's very difficult to suppress the man's instincts, no matter how strong I insisted that it was a job.</div><div>I calmed myself down and turned to Rei again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, wake up. Get up and eat." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm......" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei wriggled.</div><div>As she did so, her T-shirt, which had originally been pulled up, almost pulled up further, I hurriedly pulled the blanket back up.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmm, Rintaro, ......?" (Rei)</div><div>"Are you awake. Hurry go wash your face." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Okay." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei sluggishly got up and left the bedroom, heading for the bathroom. Her appearance was so disheveled that it made me wonder if she really is a top idol.</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2KjvWTZ/192935.jpg"></img>

<div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;Well, I guess it would be too much to ask her to stay in shape all the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe she'd woken up a little, when she came back, her expression returned to her usual self. She sat down on the sofa with me, and after saying "Let's dig in", she started to eat her breakfast.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmm, the yolk is half-boiled......." (Rei)</div><div>"You said you liked it that way. The coffee also has more sugar and milk in it. As for the salad, use whatever dressing you like." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's always nice to have something made for you." (Rei)</div><div>"I'm glad I know what you like. So I can adjust it right away." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Thanks to her honest opinions, I don't feel stressed when I cook. In fact, the fact that she seemed to enjoy it so much made it more worthwhile than ever before.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Have you packed the lunchbox yet?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. No problem." (Rei)</div><div>"I'm going to lock the door, so leave first." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay. I'll see you at school." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei changed into her uniform and walked out the door.</div><div>Of course, she and I don't go to school together.</div><div>Usually, five minutes after Rei left, I left and headed for the station. When I arrived at the station, I would sometimes go with her, sometimes not, so as not to look unnatural. It would have been unnatural for us to be classmates if we were standing next to each other and not talking.</div><div><br /></div><div>(I've gotten so used to this life. ......)</div><div><br /></div><div>I locked the door and walked the usual way to the station.</div><div>I walked through the station gates to the platform and casually looked for Rei.</div><div>Just then, I saw her being asked for an autograph by a group of boys and girls who seemed to be middle school students.</div><div>Although most of her face was hidden by her glasses and mask, it seemed that if she was seen every day, the number of people who approached her would increase.</div><div>As soon as they left, a female classmate stood next to Rei.</div><div>As I recall, she was a member of the track and field club, so when she had morning practice, she took the train earlier.</div><div>Today, it seemed she didn't have practice sessions, so she and Rei could go to school together.</div><div>It's a bit of a relief that I don't have to go with her on these occasions.</div>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<div>"Hey, have you changed a bit, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I was changing for my first period PE, Yukio suddenly asked me that question.</div><div>He tilted his head, it seems the look of confusion on my face was a surprise to him.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You do not realize it? It seems like you are more leisure." (Yukio)</div><div>"...... more leisure, huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I wondered if it was because my standard of living had risen significantly. Maybe, It's because that I was living a more relaxed life than before.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Maybe you got a...... girlfriend or something?" (Yukio)</div><div>"No, there's no way it happens. When I get a girlfriend, it will be when I find someone who can provide for me for the rest of my life. Well, I'm not going to be looking for a partner until I graduate from college." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's right......! It's just my misunderstanding then!" (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>Why does this guy seem so happy that I don't have a girlfriend?</div><div>Don't tell me, he's the type of guy who can't tolerate other people's happiness while he himself is popular?</div><div><br /></div><div>"By the way, what happened to the girl who confessed her love to you before. Didn't she say she was a pretty good girl?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well...... But it's different from having a relationship or anything like that. I couldn't bring myself to like her as a person of the opposite sex....... If it was a friendship, it would be no problem at all, in fact, I would welcome her." (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yukio, a handsome guy with a rather cute face, has been relatively popular since he was in middle school.</div><div>With a good face and a good personality, he will inevitably be popular.</div><div>However, there was a downside, as he was once victimized by a stalker-like girl who had been rejected by him. At that time, I went home with him every day to take care of him, and finally, when he entered high school, he moved out with her family and got rid of the problem.</div><div>His father had originally been planning on buying a house, so it was not inconvenient.</div><div><br /></div><div>"There's no obligation to return a favor if someone likes you, and there's no need for you to worry about it. You can just wait until you fall in love with someone yourself." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, ......, that's right. I'll do that!" (Yukio)</div><div><br />

</div><div>For some reason, Yukio's voice suddenly became cheerful, and he looked at me with eyes that seemed to have been blown away.</div><div>It seems that his problem has been solved. Well, it feels good to be able to help my best friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>After we finished changing, we went straight to the gym.</div><div>To be honest, about half of high school PE is just playing, and as long as you don't stray from the designated games, it's rather free time. Especially on volleyball days like today, half of the students always had to rest by the wall due to the number of courts.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oioi, look, look at Otosaki-san."</div><div>"Whoa, she's amazing as ever."</div><div><br /></div><div>While I was waiting in line with Yukio for my turn, the boys nearby were ogling at Rei as she moved about the court.</div><div>Perhaps it was because she was athletic to begin with, but Rei's performance was on par with the volleyball team. The speed of her spikes was such that even the boys weren't sure if they could handle them.</div><div>But when she moves around like that, she naturally attracts the attention of boys.</div><div>In particular, she has&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;a body that, for lack of a better word, does not look like a high school student.</div><div>You can't blame the boys for ogling at her because of the presence of "a certain" part of her body that made me upset this morning.&#12288;</div><div>So I can't blame the boys for having such lecherous sights.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, what's wrong? You suddenly gazing around." (Yukio)</div><div>"No, it's just that I feel more refreshed knowing that there are people who are more vulgar than me." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Really refreshing to you, yes?" (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>For some reason, Yukio is looking at me with pity.</div><div>It feels strange, though I was just speaking about what I really feel.</div><div>&#8213;&#8213;Huh? Then it means I'm not so different from those boys?</div><div><br /></div><div>"......"</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, whatever. I better stop thinking about it before I come to realize that I feel disgusted.</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Yp8t5L7/192936.jpg"></img>

<div><br /></div><div>Time passed and it was lunchtime.</div><div>I was face to face with Yukio, spreading out our lunchboxes.</div><div>Incidentally, the contents of my lunch were half different from Rei's.</div><div>Hers was mostly homemade, while mine was about half of it was frozen foods.</div><div>Of course, the reason for this was to prevent people from getting the wrong idea about the ingredients in our lunches.</div><div><br /></div><div>"There are several things I admire about Rintaro, but one of them is definitely the fact that he makes his lunch every day. I could never do that." (Yukio)</div><div>"It took me a while to get used to it, though. But it's also for the future." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's really like you to be stoic for not wanting to work, yea......" (Yukio)</div><div><br /></div><div>I put the food in my mouth. Mm, it's delicious even when it's cold.</div><div>The majority of the homemade items in my lunchbox are meat and potatoes.</div><div>The carrots and potatoes were well cooked and sweet, probably because they had been boiled yesterday and soaked up the flavor overnight. Needless to say, the meat and onions were also well done.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Whoaa! Otosaki-san's lunchbox is so beautiful!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Such a voice suddenly rose from the girls who surrounded Rei.</div><div>She's usually surrounded by people, but today there were many.</div><div>The reason seems to be the lunchbox I made for her.</div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</i></div><div>"Did your mother prepare this?"</div><div>"Ee....no, she didn't." (Rei)</div><div>"Eh&#8265; Then, maybe you make it...... by yourself&#8265;"</div><div>"Y&#8213;&#8213;yup, I did." (Rei)</div><div>"Wow! It's awesome! Aren't you busy every day&#8265;"</div><div>"I'm, but...... nutrition is important." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei's answer caused the people around her to shout in admiration.</div><div>She seemed somewhat apologetic, probably because she said she made it herself.</div><div>I'd rather praise her for doing so because it was a good job.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hee, being an idol is amazing, but you cook your own meals. That's fantastic."</div><div>"Indeed. I really can't believe you're the same age as me."</div><div>"Hmm? Rintaro, what are you smiling about?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Ah, it's the meat and potatoes I made were just too good." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That much? Can I have some?" (Yukio)</div><div>"Sure. Here, I'll put some on top of the rice." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It felt good to be praised for something I had made, even if it was indirectly.</div><div>I handed the side dish to Yukio in a good mood and felt a little satisfied.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</i></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div>

<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry, Rintaro." (Rei)</div><div>"What? What's up all of a sudden?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>When Rei came back to my house after her idol lesson, she bowed to me as soon as she entered my room.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry, I took the credit...... for the lunch Rintaro made for me." (Rei)</div><div>"Ah, just that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Thinking back, she looked terribly apologetic when she told her classmates that she made her own lunch.</div><div>I was grateful that she respected me, but it seemed like she cared a little too much.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't mind. Rather, you made it look natural because you made it look like you made it. Lowering the risk is a good thing, you know." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... It makes me feel a little better, to hear you say that." (Rei)</div><div>"Anyway! Don't ever talk about me to the outside world. Anything is fine, as long as you keep that to protect yourself." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Understood....... I will do that." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei is a good girl. Although she sometimes goes out of control, but she is straightforward, considerate, and has convictions.</div><div>When she first said she was selfish, I thought she was nuts, but now that impression has disappeared.</div>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<div>"Hey, don't look so grim, eat your food. It's pasta today." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Pasta?" (Rei)</div><div>"With tomato meat sauce. You can put cheese powder on it if you like." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The pasta with the red sauce was placed in front of Rei.</div><div>The sauce itself is simple, just mixing and simmering canned tomatoes and minced meat sauce, but because it's so simple, it has a consistent taste.</div><div>I planned to use the leftover sauce for Doria tomorrow night.</div><div>I'll spread the sauce on a bed of rice, top it with cheese, and bake it in the oven.</div><div>Don't think I'm cutting corners. This kind of ingenuity is the secret of being a full-time househusband.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can I put a lot of sauce on it?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah, you can. The groceries are your money anyway." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That said is true." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, looking convinced, sprinkled a generous amount of cheese powder on top of the pasta.</div><div>When the entire sauce had turned a hazy white, she rolled it from the edge and brought it to her mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"!! Delicious." (Rei)</div><div>"You really do have a reaction that makes it worth making. I've got some more just let me know if you want seconds." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I want second." (Rei)</div><div>"You're really a fast eater, yeess." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>After bringing a second for Rei, I took my own portion.</div><div>I didn't do anything too elaborate, but it was enough for me to make it at home.</div><div>After we had both finished our meals in no time, I turned my attention to the TV, which had been left on.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Really...... very popular idols, aren't they?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I unconsciously muttered to myself as I looked at the three members of MilleSta on the screen.</div><div>Music shows, variety shows, news shows, commercials&#8213;&#8213;there hasn't been a week in a while that I haven't seen them. They're so busy, yet they're still able to keep up with their attendance and attend school.</div><div>Once again, I turned my attention to the extraordinary creature that is Otosaki Rei. And when I saw the trace of meat sauce on the corner of her mouth, I let out a sigh.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Rei, sit still." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Wha? ...... Mmm." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I picked up a wet wipe and wiped her mouth.</div><div>Rei was like my own child as she was at my mercy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you. But it's embarrassing." (Rei)</div><div>"Then be more careful......The Otosaki Rei in front of me looks like a different person than on TV." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm, not a different person. It's just that she has a good on/off switch of personality." (Rei)</div><div>"But her image at school is that of an idol, isn't she? I'm sorry if I'm being overly self-conscious, but I feel like she's only sloppy when she's in this house." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That is, true. I only turn off when I'm here and when I'm with MilleSta. Other than that, I'm always an Idol. When I'm at school, when I'm walking outside, even on holidays, someone is watching me. Image is important." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see, indeed.</div><div>If people see her being disheveled outside, it will directly affect her and MilleSta's image.</div><div>She seemed to be living her life as usual, but in fact, she was always on her toes.</div><div><br />

  </div><div>"......That's awesome. I respect that." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Likewise. I'll never be able to do what Rintaro does." (Rei)</div><div>"It's because you're busy, right? If you had the time, you could do the same." (Rintaro)</div><div>"No. I may be able to cook a meal, but Rintaro does a lot more than that, he pays a lot of attention to the little things." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei picked up the mug of coffee that I had brought her.</div><div>She took a sip and exhaled.</div><div><br /></div><div>"This coffee is just the way I like. You don't even have to ask anything anymore to make it." (Rei)</div><div>"W-well, yeah." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You remember what I like to eat and drink, and prepare them for me. If my uniform was wrinkled, you would iron it before I knew it, and he would make sure I had enough shampoo and body wash for me." (Rei)</div><div>"...... Isn't that obvious?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Absolutely not. At least, I'm not that attentive." (Rei)</div><div>"That' s not how it goes......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was a little embarrassed by the compliment, but also puzzled because she hadn't really thought about what she was doing.</div><div>It's not that I'm trying to be attentive. I just naturally thought that she would be happy if I did this&#8212;&#8212;.</div><div>Ah, so this is what she meant by being attentive.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But it's not that tough or anything......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm sure it's natural. Even for me, being an idol is hard, but it's not that tough either." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee...... I guess that's the way it is." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. That is." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I feel like I can work as much as I want just because Rei looks comfortable.</div><div>Knowing that what I do is beneficial to someone else is what keeps me motivated.</div><div>At first, I took it in stride, but to be honest, I don't even need the money anymore&#8212;&#8212;.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, Rintaro. I have a small favor to ask you tomorrow." (Rei)</div><div>"Hmm? What's that?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"There's no school tomorrow, so I will take a lesson in the morning. I want you to make three portion lunchboxes to take to the lesson." (Rei)</div><div>"Three portions&#8265; How much are you going to eat......" (Rintaro)</div><div>"No, not for me. No matter how much I eat, I'm not that gluttonous, you know." (Rei)</div><div>"That's not very convincing. So why do you want three portions?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I told the two other members of MilleSta about Rintaro. They asked if they could try your cooking." (Rei)</div><div>"Y-you told them about me!? I've already warned you to never mention about me to the outsider, haven't I?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"They're not outsiders to me. And I trust them. It's okay." (Rei)</div><div>"If you say so, then......I'll believe." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

  </div><div>Rei's scandal could affect the other members of MilleSta as well. I'm sure she's not going to tell anyone about this matter, but I still think she needs to work on her crisis management skills in the future.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't mint to cook for three people. Umm, Kanon and Mia tight? I don't know what they like, so it will be the same as Rei's. Is that okay with you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. There are very few things they can't eat, so I'm sure they'll enjoy anything." (Rei)</div><div>"I see. That makes it easier for me then." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It may be a bad thing to say, but for me, it's less troublesome to cook more than less. It's not that it changes the amount of work, of course, but it's just that I feel like I'm getting more satisfaction out of cooking for four people than for two with the same amount of effort.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But hence, I won't be able to make something great....... It's a great opportunity though, then I'll have to make up for it with what I can make in the morning." (Rintaro)</div><div>"In that case, I have a suggestion." (Rei)</div><div>"What is it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It'd be better if Rintaro comes to deliver it by himself&nbsp; around noon. That way, you'll have more time." (Rei)</div><div>"Me? No, I don't know what kind of face to make when I bring it there......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't worry. Tomorrow is a private practice day, so we'll be the only ones in the rented studio. And they both wanted to see Rintaro. Of course, if you don't want to, you don't have to." (Rei)</div><div>"Mmm......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br />
<!-- ADSENSE -->
  </div><div>Should I look at it as a hassle or as an opportunity?</div><div>Aside from Rei, who was in my class, the other two were people I could only meet through the screen. To be asked to meet such people is something that would never happen in normal life.</div><div>In the first place, as Rei's caretaker, it should probably be necessary to greet them first.</div><div>Fortunately, it was after the deadline and Yuuki-sensei was still working at her leisure. So, my part-time job will start next week.</div><div><br /></div><div>"'...... I get it. I can't let Rei's friends eat half-Î±ssed food. Just let me know where the place is. I'll deliver it after twelve o'clock." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thank you. I'm sure they'll be happy." (Rei)</div><div>"I hope so......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm just your average high school student. And In comparison, the opponent is a national idol.</div><div>It's hard for me to believe that such a famous group of people would want to eat my food, as I'm usually a skeptical person. But I don't think Rei is lying&#8213;&#8213;Hmm.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Well, let's not get into the details. All I have to do is cook and deliver food.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Don't expect anything for nothing, just do what you are asked to do.</div><div>......Is it permissible to just ask for a signature?
