<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Housewarming Party</h3>

<div>The move was over.</div><div>It was a bit of a challenge because the rainy season had just started, but the furniture was brought into the new location in good shape and without any damage thanks to the contractors.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Pheewww...... You've moved to a really nice place, Rintaro." (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>The one who was looking around the room was Yuzuki Himiko-sensei, who had hired me as a part-timer.</div><div>I couldn't help but tell her about my move, since she had paid for my rent at my old place.</div><div>In addition, I had also already told her why I decided to move out and how it happened.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Even so, I can't believe he's actually getting paid by an idol...... I knew you were a student at Rintaro's high school, but I never thought you had any connections. When you see her in person, she is really beautiful.&#8213;&#8213;When I see you in the flesh......you are really beautiful, yes." (Himiko)</div><div>"I'm flattered, Yuuzuki-sensei." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, who was standing next to me, bowed her head to Yuzuki-sensei.</div><div>Today was the day for my "employers" to meet each other.</div><div>When I told Rei that I was working part-time for Yuzuki Himiko-sensei, she said she wanted to say hello to her.</div><div>Of course, there was always the risk of leaking our relationship to the public, After all, Yuzuki-sensei was a celebrity in a sense.</div><div>With the added trust of being a relative, we decided to tell her all about our situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a side note, Rei was a fan of Yuzuki Himiko's work, and she forced me to arrange a meeting with her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But I think you've found the right man, Otosaki-san. Rintaro may have a bad mouth sometimes, but he's a caring person from the bottom of his heart, he's perfect at housework, and his face isn't bad either. And he was very popular in elementary school." (Himiko)</div><div>"...... Yuzuki-sensei, that's a little harsh." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The more she flattered me, the more troubled I become, and the more I smile bitterly.</div><div>Of course, I felt embarrassed, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;yep, it's uneasy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"When you were in elementary school...... You were popular?" (Rei)</div><div>"You don't get into that, either. In elementary school, if you were good at sports, you were usually popular, right." (Rintaro)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>When I was in elementary school, I was relatively athletic and certainly had many opportunities to get along with girls.</div><div>However, once I entered middle school and my athletic skills started to fall into the mediocre range, I joined the ranks of the average boys.</div><div>I'd never had a girlfriend until this age.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Fufufu ...... Are you curious, Otosaki-san? About girl situation of Rintaro!" (Himiko)</div><div>"! I'm curious." (Rei)</div><div>"All right! I'll tell you! Then let's start with the story of when he started kindergarten&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>......This is stupid.</div><div>I ignored them as they started to get excited and went to the kitchen to make coffee.</div><div>The kitchen was much bigger than the previous house.</div><div>First of all, the stove had three burners instead of two, and I had to say it's the best.</div><div>The microwave, rice cooker, and oven had been replaced with better ones. I kept the knives and pans that I was familiar with, but renewed the appliances.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Here's, the coffee." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Rintaro, the man who makes women cry." (Rei)</div><div>"I don't know what you've been told, Rei, but most of what you've been told by Yuzuki-sensei is a lie, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't remember ever making a woman cry.</div><div><br />
  
</div><div>"It's not a lie! Rintaro was the only one who supported me when everyone else was against me becoming a manga artist! "If it's Big Sis Himiko, she can definitely be a manga artist!", you said that. That's why I cried, I did!" (Himiko)</div><div>"This is about your story, huh......"</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm pretty sure that happened before.</div><div>I was in second grade at the time, and I encouraged Yuzuki-sensei, who was a high school girl.</div><div>When I think about it now, I don't know what I'm basing this on, but I think I pushed her back just because I liked her drawings.</div><div>If she became a manga artist because of me then, I'm a little proud of that.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Pheew....... But I'm really glad that Rintaro didn't stop working. He's good at his job, he brings me food every time I'm in trouble, he makes me coffee when I want it, and he's become someone I can't let go of." (Himiko)</div><div>"You're exaggerating......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm not! The same is true for all the assistants. I'm not going to let you monopolize him, Otosaki-san." (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>After telling her that, Yuzuki-sensei looked at Rei with a restraining look.</div><div>She then shifted her gaze towards me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, you-re-all-right-now, are-you-not?" (Himiko)</div><div>"......Yeah, I'm all right. Big-Sis-Hi-mi-ko." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yep. Then good." (Himiko)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>Her question was filled with a variety of meanings.</div><div>It was only natural, since we were relatives, that Yuzuki-sensei was well aware of my family situation.</div><div>That was why my cheerful reply seemed to put her mind at ease a little.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So, Otosaki-san, please take care of Rintaro for me. I'm not too worried about him, though. He's a good cousin, after all." (Himiko)</div><div>"Yes, I understand. ......Umm, Yuzuki-sensei." (Rei)</div><div>"Hmm? What is it?" (Himiko)</div><div>"Lastly, Could I have your...... autograph?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei looked nervous as she took out a piece of colored paper and a pen.</div><div>I guess she really is a fan from the bottom of her heart. She looked even more nervous than usual.</div><div><br />
  
</div><div>"Ee, well, I'll give you as much as you want if you want it...... Ah! That's right! Then give me Otosaki-san's autograph too. You can have it in exchange." (Himiko)</div><div>"! I'm so happy......!" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Right in front of my eyes, a rare big star and a super successful manga artist are exchanging autographs is taking place&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was so used to them that I sometimes forgot that these two people are not the kind of people that an average person could get close to.</div><div>For some reason, I realized how lucky I am in this situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Fufufu, I'm going to display it at my workplace. Then, Rintaro, Otosaki-san. See you again." (Himiko)</div><div>"Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule. I'll see you again when I'm working." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I'm counting on you, okay? My dear cousin." (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>With an exquisitely un-cute wink, Yuzuki-sensei leaves my room.</div><div>The only ones left were me, the owner of the house, and Rei, who was holding the autograph with great care.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You really like Yuzuki-sensei's work, don't you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. It's a shonen manga, but it depicts the emotions very beautifully, and it's very delicate and passionate at the same time....... I often read it on the way or during breaks. I bought it both in paper and digital." (Rei)</div><div>"......I see." (Rintaro)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I'm just a helper, I didn't think up the story or create the characters, but for some reason, I feel happy when Yuzuki-sensei's work was praised as if it was my own.</div><div>She is like a sister to me, even though she is my employer.</div><div>It's not my fault that I see a lot of sloppiness in her, but there's no doubt that she's someone I respect.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But, Rei reads shonen manga, too, huh. To be honest, I didn't have an image of you as such." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I like manga itself, not just shonen manga. It's something that moves people's hearts. I think that part of it is no different from music or dance. I sometimes get an idea for a song after seeing a creative work." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee, so that's how it is......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If you ask me, Yuzuki-sensei also read a lot of works in her spare time.</div><div><i>This is for research purposes!</i> She often said that. <b><i>(PTW/N: The bois often said that as well.)</i></b></div><div>Maybe that was why she wanted me to at least keep up with what's trending and popular.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Does Rintaro not read many mangas?" (Rei)</div><div>"I do...... but only the ones that are really popular. Whenever I have a little extra money, I put it into savings." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then, I'd like to lend you some of my recommendations later. I'm sure you'll find a few you like." (Rei)</div><div>"I'm grateful for that. If I like it, I'll buy it myself." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div>

<div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;In the meantime, the time was approaching evening.</div><div>The temperature was still quite high in this near-summer season, but that didn't change the fact that dinner time was approaching.</div><div><br /></div><div>"We should get ready." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Do you need any help?" (Rei)</div><div>"Nope, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to let me handle the cooking this time. It's a bigger kitchen than my previous house and I'm really excited about it." (Rintaro)</div><div>"All right, then. I'll leave everything to you." (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah, leave it to me." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I put on the apron that was hanging on the couch and headed for the kitchen.</div><div>Today was the day of the housewarming party planned by the three members of the Millefeuille Stars.</div><div>They had originally planned to have a delivery service, but now that I've joined them, I'm in charge of cooking.</div><div>I have prepared a lot of ingredients for this day.</div><div>I was uncharacteristically excited about my first day in the kitchen of my new house.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>I held the knife and cut the ingredients on the cutting board.</div><div>I had gotten carried away and bought meat and seafood today.</div><div>I also bought some vegetables that I didn't usually buy, so from the supermarket staff's point of view, it would have been obvious that I was about to cook a feast.</div><div><br /></div><div>Humming to myself, I put the salmon fillets, scallops, thinly sliced carrots, onions, and shimeji mushrooms on a sheet of aluminum foil, topped it with more butter, and poured soy sauce over it. After wrapping them in aluminum foil and baking them into the oven.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next, fry the seafood and vegetables such as finely chopped onions and garlic on a pan.</div><div>When the squid, which is a type of seafood, was slightly browned and the onions start to become transparent, I added the crushed tomatoes and cook them down as if they were draining off the water.</div><div>Then I added shrimps and scallions, water, salt, and saffron to make the soup.</div><div>As the flavor of the seafood began to seep out, I removed the larger pieces of seafood and soaked the uncooked rice in the soup.</div><div>After the soup was gone, the paella was ready.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the time it took for the paella to be ready, I prepared a salad of mainly lettuce.</div><div>Then I started to grill the spare ribs that I had marinated before Yuzuki-sensei's arrival on a separate stove. I soaked the marinade with a little water, and finally cooked them lightly before placing them on a plate.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's the four dishes.</div><div>I decided to make one more soup, so I cut the bacon and onions into bite-sized pieces, boiled them, and added the consommé base.</div><div>The consommé soup was now complete.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was quite pleased with the results of these dishes.</div><div>I may have cooked a little too much, but Rei's stomach should be able to handle it to some extent.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mmm, did you just think of something a little rude?" (Rei)</div><div>"Haha, what are you talking about, Rei? Of course not, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mmm...... that so?" (Rei)</div><div><br />

<br />
</div><div>What's with this lass? Is she an esper?</div><div>I finished the dishes with a nonchalant attitude.</div><div>I garnished the paella with lemon, and seasoned the soup and spare ribs with salt and pepper.</div><div>I checked the heat of the baked foil, made sure the salmon meat was tender, and put it on the plate.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Alright......, this is about right, I guess." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I finished tasting it and confirmed that there was no need for any touch.</div><div>And just at that moment, the intercom rang.</div><div>It seemed that the two had arrived.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei, let them in." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Leaving Rei to deal with the two, I laid out the finished dishes on the table in front of the sofa.</div><div>I set out plates and glasses for the four of us.</div><div>I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had done a good job.</div><div>Just as I was about to make a gut-punch, I heard the sound of slippers coming from the entrance.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, I'm here." (Kanon)</div><div>"Sorry for the intrusion." (Mia)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I gulped when I saw Kanon and Mia appear in the living room.</div><div>Kanon was wearing a t-shirt that showed her shoulders and ripped jeans. She had her hair tied up in a knot before, but now it was down, making her look more mature.</div><div>Mia wore a thin hoodie over a sleeveless top and hot pants. She wore a light hoodie over her sleeveless top and hot pants, which made her well-fleshed thighs visible up to the base of her thighs, causing me to have some trouble looking at her.</div><div>It was the same kind of shock I had when I first saw Rei's casual clothes or her lesson clothes.</div><div>Come to think of it&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;it must be rare to have a chance to see idols in their normal clothes, right?</div><div><br /></div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div>"Why are you staring at me like that? You're smitten on me in my casual clothes?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Just until a second ago." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eh!? Why? Why aren't you smitten right now?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>That's the point&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I swallowed the words</div><div>It won't help.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It smells delicious. Did you make all those dishes on the desk?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Yeah. I got excited about the new kitchen. I might have cooked a little too much." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't have a problem with it. Today is a day off, so I didn't have a lesson today, but I have been exercising more than normally I do. I'm confident that I can eat more than the average athlete." (Kanon)</div><div>"If that' s the case, no problem. Then wash your hands and get on the couch. Before the dishes get cold." (Rintaro)</div><div><br />

<br />
</div><div>The girls, including Rei, washed their hands and sat down on the couch.</div><div>I put the chair I had for my study desk in front of them and sat down on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Since you said you'd cook for us, I brought some snacks that I could pick up at random. Here are the macaroons that are popular in front of the station." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Then Kanon put a paper bag with a cute wrapping on the table.</div><div>At least from my point of view, macarons are not a snack that can be picked up at random. Aren't they supposed to be some kind of sweets or chocolates?</div><div><br /></div><div>"I guess we're on the same page. I've also brought an assortment of cream puffs. I was wondering if you could keep them chilled for me." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Another stylish box was placed in front of me.</div><div>Both of them bought something that looked expensive...... and the fact that they called this something that could be picked at random was unthinkable for the average person.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've prepared a drink. 100% tangerine juice from Wakayama Prefecture." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei brought out two bottles of tangerine juice from my refrigerator and laid them out on the table, just like the ones the two of us had brought.</div><div>I just checked the price of this juice, and it's more expensive than I expected.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, since it's a party, let's have a toast with Rei's juices. I'll pour." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia poured the juice into our glasses, making sure it was evenly distributed.</div><div>We each took a glass and clinked together.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Cheers."</div><div>"Cheeeeers!"</div><div>"Mm, Cheers."</div><div>"......Cheers."</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>The sound of clinking glasses echoed through the room.</div><div>The tangerine juice was much richer than I had imagined, and it had a sweet and sour taste that made me wonder what I had been drinking all those years.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... So, Rintaro made this paella too?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Ah? Well, yes." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I feel like I've lost so much." (Kanon)</div><div>"You can't cook, Kanon?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's not that I can't cook. I have a younger brother and sister, so I used to help my parents cook simple things. But since I became an idol, I've been too busy to cook anything." (Kanon)</div><div>"If you can, isn't it good already?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"But I can't make it up to the quality they serve in restaurants like these! These are really delicious!" (Kanon)</div><div>"Thank you. It was worth making when you said that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was grateful for her honest feedback as always, and I took another bite of my cook.</div><div>The paella was so good that I really wanted to praise myself.</div><div>The rice in the paella was soaked in the flavor of the seafood, and I couldn't stop my chopsticks once I had a piece of the grilled salmon.</div><div>The spareribs unraveled in my mouth and disappeared as if they were melting.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mmm...... I can't help but be jealous of Rei. You get to eat Rintaro-kun's cook every day, right?" (Mia)</div><div>"Yup. That's the contract." (Rei)</div><div>"I envy you. Can I borrow him for a while?" (Mia)</div><div>"No. Rintaro is mine." (Rei)</div><div>"You stingy." (Mia)</div><div>"I'm not." (Rei)</div><div><br />

<br />
</div><div>What are these girls talking about&#8212;&#8212;</div><div><br /></div><div>More importantly, I don't even remember being Rei's.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Well, I'll give up for now. But before that, I'd like to ask Rintaro-kun's opinion. Why don't you come to my place instead of Rei's?" (Mia)</div><div>"Sorry, but I don't want to. I have a bad feeling about you, even worse than Rei." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eee, I'm not going to do anything, though." (Mia)</div><div>"If you say so, stop that smirk on your face......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If you showed me that you were obviously planning something, I would be wary even if I didn't want to.</div><div>It's not that I don't like Mia, but unlike Rei, it's hard to read her mind.</div><div>I don't know how to put it, but I have a feeling that&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;if I get involved with this lass, I will get into a lot of trouble.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>"But you know, if we're living in the same place anyway, why do we have to eat separately? That doesn't necessarily mean that Rintaro made the food." (Kanon)</div><div>"...... Indeed." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei nodded at Kanon's words.</div><div>What she said was certainly not wrong.</div><div>Even though we live on the same floor, it would be a bit tasteless to come home together, go to separate houses, and eat alone.</div><div>If they were a stranger, I wouldn't mind, but the three of them are good friends even in private.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's not too hard to prepare for two more. However, since I am being paid to cook for Rei, it would be unfair to her if I unconditionally prepared for you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well, that's true......." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>The only hassle that comes with preparing more food is the number of dishes to wash.</div><div>In fact, I'm thankful that I don't have to worry about cooking too much.</div><div>However, Rei is paying me a total of about 150,000 yen for my work, including rent, utilities, and materials.</div><div>I don't want to provide services to others without the same amount of compensation.</div><div>Of course, if it's just an occasional treat like today, I have no objection whatsoever&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I think Rintaro has a good point, but what do you think Mia?" (Kanon)</div><div>"......Yes. I also think Rintaro-kun's opinion is correct. I also have a proposal: If I or Kanon want to eat Rintaro-kun's food, why don't we buy the ingredients and bring them to him?" (Mia)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I think that proposal is not so bad&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I give Rei a sideways glance.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yup, that sounds good. I'm fine as long as I can eat Rintaro's food." (Rei)</div><div>"Then how about you, Rintaro-kun?" (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I nodded in response, without much thought.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If Rei is okay, then it won't be much of a hassle for me, so no problem. You can buy whatever you want." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's very generous of you two. Thank you. Then, I'll ask you to do this regularly." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>For whatever it's worth, I don't think either Mia or Kanon would barge in on me every day.</div><div>I don't know if it's an occupational hazard or not, but they have a good sense of moderation and courtesy.</div><div>Also, it's interesting to note that the most observant of them all is actually the youngest, Kanon.</div><div>This may be because she has a lot of siblings, judging from the way she talks.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Even so, It's only a month until the concert. It's gone by so fast."&nbsp;</div><div>"One month from now means...... the beginning of July." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I hope it won't get too hot. I don't want my makeup to run with my sweat." (Kanon)</div><div>"Was the previous concert at the beginning of the year?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, you know a lot about it. ...... You didn't seem interested at all when we first met." (Kanon)</div><div>"After you guys have shown me that lesson up close, I can't help but be interested. I realized once again that it was a really good experience for me." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>MilleSta holds about three big concerts in a year.</div><div>The concerts are held mainly in the summer, fall, and winter,&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;and they perform new songs for each season.</div><div>The venue is always packed. If you don't make it in the first round of the ticket sale, you have no choice but to buy a resale ticket, which is sold at a high price. Recently, however, measures have been taken to prevent this, and a second sale is held as soon as malicious resale is confirmed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, will you come to our next concert?" (Rei)</div><div>"I'd love to, but I'm not sure I can get a ticket." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Don't worry. I've got tickets for the concerned parties." (Rei)</div><div>"Ee......, Is it okay, giving me that?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Rintaro is already a person concerned. If I say so, there will be no problem." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of it, it's indeed that I'm already a person concerned.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"We have a limited number of personal invitations, but as we've only been around for two years, we don't have enough connections in the entertainment industry. So, we always end up having a few leftovers." (Mia)</div><div>"Then why don't you invite your parents or your friends from school?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Of course, I'll invite my parents when they're not busy, but if I invite someone from the school, it'll look like I'm favoring that person. That's how it's perceived." (Mia)</div><div>"Ah......, I think I know what you mean." (Rintaro)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I don't think they have enough room to invite all their friends from school.</div><div>It made sense to me that it would be better not to invite anyone than to invite a specific person and have people around feel antagonistic and jealous.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm in much the same situation as Mia. I do have a few acquaintances who are young actors who have approached me with ulterior motives, but I don't want to invite them and have them misunderstand me." (Kanon)</div><div>"...... Hee." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Wh, what's with that your reaction!?" (Kanon)</div><div>"No, I was just surprised that there actually is a guy who'd approach you, huh." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's rude&#8265; I'm this cute, there's no way a guy won't come approach to me, okay!?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Then Kanon stood in front of me.</div><div>It's true that in terms of cuteness alone, I think she's the best of the MilleSta.</div><div>Both Rei and Mia are more of the beautiful type than the cute type, if I have to classify them.</div><div>However, all that cuteness was ruined by the fact that her face was so desperate.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kanon is cute when she's quiet." (Rei)</div><div>"Huh!? What do you mean, Rei? I'm still cute when I talk!" (Kanon)</div><div>"...... Ye~p." (Rei)</div><div>"Don't "Ye~p" me! If I can't get your approval, what am I supposed to believe?" (Kanon)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>*Gawrrr*. The sound effect suits her well.</div><div>It was really worth messing with.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Ah, by the way, there's a movie I want to see with the four of us." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei suddenly said that, and took out a DVD from her bag.</div><div>Apparently, she took the trouble to rent a DVD in this day and age.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......"The Grudge's Sadako-san"? Rei, what's this?" (Mia)</div><div>"A horror movie." (Rei)</div><div>"That's not what I mean, I know what it is......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I know what you mean, Mia.</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't really find the right words to describe this&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;indescribable B-movie feeling.</div><div>Kanon, Mia, and I sensed this strange atmosphere and looked at each other.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've been curious about this movie since I saw its name on a video distribution site a while ago. I'm not much of a horror fan, so I'd like to watch it together if possible." (Rei)</div><div>"W-well...... it might be fun to watch it with friends...... while enjoying meals, right?" (Kanon)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Kanon agreed with Rei, choosing her words quite carefully.</div><div>Watching anime and movies with friends indeed has a different feel than watching alone.</div><div>It's not like I'm going to turn down something that Rei took the trouble to rent because "it doesn't look interesting".</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro-kun, have you prepare yourself!?" (Mia)</div><div>"...... I'll go make something to eat." (Rintaro)</div><div>"No, you can't. Rei will be scared if you leave her alone." (Mia)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>Mia grabbed my arm with a smile.</div><div>Thus, my escape route was blocked&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I gave up and turned towards Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"All right, the four of us will watch." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Thanks, guys. Then&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei put the DVD in the game console that was set up under the TV in my house.</div><div>Although it's a game console, it also plays a wide range of DVDs, and it begins to show a two-hour video on the TV screen, which will probably be a battle against sleepiness.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Then with the playback, the lights were dimmed for about an hour.</div><div>I kept watching the screen, which was basically a dimly lit image, almost absent-mindedly.</div><div>The movie was about a black-haired female ghost who tried to drag people into a cursed house.</div><div>I think people who like this sh*tty movie ......which has an obvious source material, but not an ounce of respect for the content. will like it? Though, I don't like it.</div><div><br /></div><div>""Zzzz...... Zzzz......""</div><div>"......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked over at the couch and saw Rei and Kanon breathing peacefully in their sleep.</div><div>I'll forgive Kanon. Since she was the one who got involved.</div><div>But Rei, you shouldn't have.</div><div>Why are you the one who requested to watch this movie, falling asleep?</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Haa." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Since the person who started it has already fallen asleep, normally one would think that they should stop it.</div><div>But, the reason why I don't do that is because&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ri-Rintaro-kun...... do-don't leave......." (Mia)</div><div>"......Yeah, I know." (Rintaro)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>Because, Mia who is next to me, clinging to me.</div><div>When I tried to move from my seat, she pulled on my arm to keep me from standing up.</div><div>I feel somehow déjà vu.</div><div>It was almost as if I was being held in place, and now I could feel Mia's bre*sts through my elbows.</div><div>She had a more Japanese figure than Rei, but her bre*sts were large enough that Rei's was out of her league.</div><div>She had more elasticity than softness.</div><div>That's why I've been keeping my mind blank.</div><div>I don't want to become a criminal at my age either.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You, surprisingly are not good with a horror movie, are you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I...... I haven't seen much of this kind of movie until now......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see, she had no tolerance for horror to begin with.</div><div>Instead, I could say that she was lucky to have a movie of this caliber.</div><div>If this was a movie that was highly praised by horror movie lovers, Mia would have fainted.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is Rintaro-kun okay......?" (Mia)</div><div>"Mmm? Yeah, I'm used to watching this kind of stuff." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, one of my best friend, Inaba Yukio's hobbies was watching B-movies.</div><div>He often rented movies that could only be found in rental stores and watched them with me.</div><div>After we finished watching the movie, he would blabber on about his impressions, which I hadn't even asked him about.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;To be frank, I always just listened to him from left to right.</div><div>I thought Yukio was aware of it too, but he's excited to talk about it anyway.</div><div><br /></div><div>"We have one more hour left. Hang in there." (Rintaro)</div><div>"O-okay......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>The force tightening my arms became stronger.</div><div>This inevitably led to a stronger feeling around the elbow, but I decided to endure it with my steel mind.</div><div>In a sense, a rough hour for me and Mia begins&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div>

<div>"Pheew...... I didn't expect a grenade to be dropped into the well at the end to wipe it out at the source. That was surprisingly fun." (Mia)</div><div>"...... Right." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>An hour was shorter than I expected.</div><div>The next thing I knew, the end roll was playing on the screen.</div><div>Surprisingly, Mia seemed to like it a lot.</div><div>I'm sure she'll have a good time drinking with Yukio. She's still underage, though.</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, I was almost completely white.</div><div>I was almost overwhelmed by the demon called sexual desire, which exists at the opposite end of the spectrum from my rational mind, and each time it tried to destroy my mind, but I managed to finally win.</div><div>I think I finally understand what it means to fight against yourself.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The other two are...... still asleep. They look so comfortable."&nbsp; (Rintaro)</div><div>"Seeing them sleeping so peacefully makes me want to do something naughty." (Mia)</div><div>"Indeed...... Well, it's a party this time, so&nbsp; I'll let them off the hook." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I thought about doing the standard prank of writing the word "meat" on the forehead, but I decided to refrain from doing so on the idol's face because it would be too immoral.</div><div>Looking at the time, it was already well past midnight.</div><div>I thought it was time to wake them up or they would end up sick, so I tried to call out to them as they lay there breathing.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;you don't have to wake them up yet, you know?"</div><div><br /></div><div>It was Mia, who was standing next to me, who stopped me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Why not? We can't just let them sleep here, can we?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well then, let's take them to your bed and let them sleep for a while. I'd still like to talk to you....... just you and me." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia's eyes narrowed as she looked at me.</div><div>I have a bad feeling that she is planning something.</div><div>But I feel like I need to get to know this girl better.</div><div>As long as she is in this room, I can't just keep avoiding her.</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/k38gyQX/192939.jpg"></img>

<div><br /></div><div>"......Alright. Let's have a little chat." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's the way it has to be." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a sigh and carried Rei and Kanon to the bedroom bed.</div><div>I used a slightly larger bed to make it more comfortable.</div><div>Even with two girls on it, there was still a little room to spare.</div><div>I put on a blanket to keep their bodies from getting too cold and went back to the living room.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Don't be so cautious, I won't do anything to harm you." (Mia)</div><div>"I wonder about that. That's for me to decide." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, I guess so. But, I really don't want to be malicious to you, okay?" (Mia)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I made eye contact with Mia.</div><div>Her eyes were surprisingly straight, and I was momentarily at a loss for words.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... I understand. I'm sorry for the way I treated you, as if I doubted you. &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;So, is there something you want to talk about?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Actually, I wanted to thank you." (Mia)</div><div>"Thanking me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup, I wanted to thank you for being with Rei." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I tilted my head.</div><div>Noticing my confusion, Mia continued,</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei has always been a very stoic person. She's the type of person who pushes herself to the limit for the sake of being an idol." (Mia)</div><div>"......Ah, I think I understand that." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Right? But since she'd been in this relationship with you, she'd been better. Rintaro-kun, has Rei ever told you about her on/off switch?" (Mia)</div><div>"Just a little bit. She said she's only turned it off when she's with you guys and when she's at my house." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Do you notice anything off?" (Mia)</div><div>"......It doesn't include her own house, or her parents' house, for lack of a better word." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Correct." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Actually, I had heard that her parents were rarely home.</div><div>I had also heard that the Otosaki family was wealthy in its own right, so it must be a very venerable family.</div><div>Before being an idol, Rei might have had to keep her position as the "daughter of the Otosaki family" in the house.</div><div>So, I can't call it being turned off.</div><div><br /></div><div>"The only place she could turn it off until now was when the three of us were together. Now that you're here, there's one more place for her can do so. You probably didn't know this, but after Rei started spending time with you, she began to smile a lot more." (Mia)</div><div>"......That's an honor." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Do you really think so?" (Mia)</div><div>"I do. I have a lot of respect for Rei. I'm glad to become one of those places." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>I'm not going anywhere&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I was reminded that Rei had said that to me.</div><div>As long as she said that, I wouldn't want to leave her either.</div><div>Besides, if I as a man, can't support even one woman, then it's just a far-fetched dream to become a full-time househusband.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Respect, huh. Is that really all?" (Mia)</div><div>"What do you mean?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I mean, are you not in love with her?" (Mia)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>The corners of Mia's mouth lifted slightly.</div><div>Before I knew it, her seriousness had somehow vanished, and now she was just her normal self.</div><div><br />

</div><div>"A love, huh...... I like her, but love is another thing. I've decided that I'm going to love one woman for the rest of my life." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ee...... what, what's that thought? It's so ridiculously manly." (Mia)</div><div>"If I fall in love with her, I'll never look away. That's why I want to choose "that" one person carefully. Also, I can't have such feelings for someone I've only known for a month or so." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't deny the possibility that I will fall in love with her over the next six months or a year.</div><div>The only thing I can say at this point is that I "am not currently" in love.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry if my answer was boring." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yep, I think that answer is great." (Mia)</div><div>"Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Because, I'd still have a chance, wouldn't I?" (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia licked her own lips as she said that.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Kiddin', that's just a joke." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sensing my stunned look, Mia pulled away from me and gave me a mischievous wink.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are you disappointed?" (Mia)</div><div>"Huuh...... I'm rather relieved. I don't think I could just get away with it if you were seriously in love with me." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You know me well, don't you. I'm surprisingly cunning, so I will use every trick I can think of to make it impossible for you to get away." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think that's surprising.</div><div>For the time being, I'm too tired to make a retort, so I'll just ignore it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"In the first place, if we were to get involved in a romantic relationship, we'd be severely criticized by some of our fans. And if we were to have a secret relationship, the risk would be even greater." (Mia)</div><div>"......You and I are a lot alike, aren't we?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Oh, I'm flattered." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I can relate to the way she thinks more about the loss when it is discovered than the benefits of getting close to an idol.</div><div>After all, I'm afraid that the current moment will be destroyed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Then, I guess I should be taking my leave. It is said that staying up late is the natural enemy of your skin." (Mia)</div><div>"I see. Be careful on the way then&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;it's not that far, though." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Fufu, you're right. Do you want me to help you clean up?" (Mia)</div><div>"Don't worry, I'll do everything. I have to do everything related to the kitchen I use." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You're pretty stoic, arent you. Then I'll take your word for it. Thank you for the delicious feast today." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia grabbed her luggage and walked out of the room as she waved her hands.</div><div>Now, before I clean up, I have to wake up those two sleeping girls.</div><div>I went to the bedroom and approached the bed where Rei and Kanon were sleeping.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Kanon...... your sleeping position is just too terrible.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a sigh when I saw Kanon putting her foot on Rei's body.</div><div>I shook both of them by the shoulders to wake them up.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, you two. Get up and go back to your rooms." (Rintaro)</div><div>"M...... mmm ...... what? Is it morning already?" (Kanon)</div><div>"It's midnight. Just go back and you can take another sleep." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yea...... I will." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon got up sluggishly and staggered out of the room.</div><div>I could hear her bumping against the wall in places, but she seemed to have made it to the corridor outside.</div><div>I'm worried, so I'll just check the hallway later. She might have collapsed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You too, Rei." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Mmm." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Unlike Kanon, Rei got up straightforwardly, took one look at me, and then left the room.</div><div>And so I was left alone in my room.</div><div>I took the dishes of paella, soup, and spareribs and headed for the sink.</div><div>I soaked the oily dishes in warm water and scrubbed them with a sponge and dishwashing detergent, starting with the easiest ones.</div><div><br /></div><div>After a few minutes of immersing myself in washing the dishes, I suddenly had a strange feeling.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That Rei...... she went back quite straightforward, didn't she."</div><div><br /></div><div>It was only when I put it into words that I realized what the strange feeling was.</div><div>Right, Rei was not staggering after getting up.</div><div>Normally, she would be as sleepy and terrible as Kanon, but today her steps were steady.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Well, I guess that doesn't really matter, does it?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess she hadn't been down for long, and it wasn't even a proper sleep for her.</div><div>I didn't think much more about it and just finished washing the dishes in silence.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The buzzing of the crowd and the elegant music struck my ears.</div><div>I looked down at my feet and saw a pair of very small shoes.</div><div><br /></div><div>I see, this is a dream huh.</div><div><br /></div><div>This outfit was from my elementary school days. It was not something I could wear now that I'm in high school.</div><div>You know, sometimes you have the kind of dream that you know is a dream.</div><div><br /></div><div>The scenery was blurred and distorted.</div><div>The place where I was standing now was familiar to me.</div><div>It was the venue of a social gathering of a large company.</div><div>As I recall, I had followed my father, who had accepted an invitation from another company.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Oh, is he Shidou-san's son?]</div><div>[Yes, he's smart for his age, and I plan to have him take over our company eventually.]</div><div><br /></div><div>Next to me, my father was talking to a man I didn't know.</div><div>Both of their faces were somewhat hazy, so I couldn't see them clearly.</div><div><br /></div><div>[And is she &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;-san's?]</div><div>[Yes, she's my proud daughter.]</div><div><br /></div><div>Not only the scenery, but even a part of their conversation was blurred.</div><div>Maybe that's because my memories of this event are so vague.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Here, "Rei". Come and say hello.]</div><div><br /></div><div>The girl called "Rei" appeared in front of me and my father.</div><div>She had beautiful blond hair and blue eyes.</div><div>She was probably about the same age as me. And she looked as cute as a doll.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm &#8213;&#8213;"Rei". A pleasure to meet you.]</div><div><br /></div><div>I was vaguely familiar with the face of the girl in front of me.</div><div>But when I tried to correlate my memory with it, the haze thickened and stopped me from thinking any further.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Father, she's very cute."</div><div><br /></div><div>That was what my mouth said, regardless of my intentions.</div><div>I hadn't seen my father in a while, and I was a little excited. The way I said it reminded me of that somehow.</div><div><br /></div><div>[You're right. If she's this cute at her age, I'm sure she'll grow up to be a woman that any man can't even look away in ten years.]</div><div>[Hahaha, how about getting her engaged to Shidou-san's son then?]</div><div>[It's not a bad suggestion. I shall consider it.]</div><div><br /></div><div>He gently pushed my back and brought me closer to "Rei".</div><div><br /></div><div>[I have to talk about business with him for a while. You two can go play together.]</div><div>"Okay!"</div><div><br /></div><div>I approached Rei and took her hand.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Let's go!"</div><div>[...... Y-yesh.]</div><div><br /></div><div>I walked through the venue with her hand in mine, looking somewhat confused.</div><div>As the venue was full of executives from top companies, there was a wide array of high-class buffet-style food.</div><div>I took a plate of food that I thought was good and offered it to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"This cake is really good, do you want to try it?"</div><div>[A......]</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei" took the plate with the cake from me, but she just stared at it and didn't even touch it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you not like it, by any chance?"</div><div>[N-no...... I do not, but my father said I shouldn't eat sweets because they cause cavities.]</div><div>"It's such a waste. Although, there are so many delicious foods to eat......."</div><div>[&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;But.]</div><div>"Do you want to eat it, "Rei"-chan? Or, do you not want to?"</div><div><br /></div><div>In response to my question, "Rei" frowned as if she was troubled.</div><div>After thinking for a while, she finally opened her mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I want...... to.]</div><div>"Then, let's just eat it in secret."</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked around to make sure no one was watching.</div><div>Then I crouched down around the table and turned up the tablecloth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Here, come here."</div><div>[Y-yes.]</div><div><br /></div><div>We both hide under the table.</div><div>It was a children-size space that no adult could enter.</div><div>I was excited to see such a place, and handed her the plate of cake again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"After eating something sweet, brush your teeth properly. If you do so, you won't get cavities."</div><div>[Is that right......?]</div><div>"No worries. Trust me."</div><div><br /></div><div>When "Rei" looked into my eyes, she seemed to have made up her mind and put the cake in her mouth.</div><div>At that moment, her expression became so radiant that I felt dazzled looking at her.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Delicious......!]</div><div>"Right? Wait here, I'll bring you some more."</div><div><br /></div><div>From then on, I brought all kinds of sweets for her until our fathers found out.</div><div>Why did I even do that&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Ah, that's right. It was because I wanted to see more of the smile on "Rei"'s face when she ate something delicious.</div><div>After all, when people eat good food, they have a pretty smile on their faces.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, this was it.</div><div><br /></div><div>This was the first time I learned such an obvious fact.</div><div><b><i><blockquote>PTW/N: I think its too early to this kind of flashback... don't you think so?&nbsp;</blockquote></i></b></div>
