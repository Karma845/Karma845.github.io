<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Those who are Worried</h3>

<div>It's already been a week since my date with Rei.</div><div>The three members of the Millefeuille Stars have been even busier than usual lately, since their live concert is less than three weeks away.</div><div><br /></div><div>I, on the other hand, had one small problem to deal with.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... What should I do?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I sat slack-jawed on the sofa, looking at the printout in front of me.</div><div>The printout from the school read, "Notice of the Tripartite meeting".</div><div>As the name implies, parents, teachers, and students will discuss grades, attitudes at school, and career paths.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Now, there was one problem.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn't have any parents who would come to the meeting.</div><div>I didn't know where my mother is, and my father is busy with work. In the first place, I had run away from my father halfway through the semester, so I didn't feel comfortable asking him to come to the meeting now.</div><div>To be honest, I didn't even want him to come.</div><div>I hated my father more than anything, and he would never forgive me for not taking over the family business.</div><div><br /></div><div>"A~gain, I'm the only one in the class with a bipartite meeting. Oh well." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I folded up the "Notice of Tripartite meeting" and threw it into the trash.</div><div>The students whose parents couldn't make it were supposed to have a one-on-one meeting with the teacher.</div><div>Our school holds a three-way conference every year around the time the first semester is about to end. Last year, of course, I had to go to the meeting by myself. And probably next year, as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>Feeling depressed, I turned on the screen of my phone.</div><div>The time is 23:00. It's almost time to go to bed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei seemed to have had dinner at the launch of the program or something, and I hadn't seen her outside of school today.</div><div>I guess that's the reason why I'm going crazy. I'd been spending a lot of time together with her, so when I'm alone, I suddenly felt drained.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Get a grip, me.......Hmm?)</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as I stood up from the sofa to go to sleep. The phone I was holding vibrated, telling me that a message had arrived on my Line.</div><div>The name on the screen was "Hidori Kanon". <b><i>(PTW/N: [EDIT] I missed it as "Hidori Natsume", I forgot.)</i></b></div><div>I casually unlocked my phone and looked at the message.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Hey, can you come out to the balcony now?] (Kanon)</div><div>[Okay.] (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I wondered what she wanted at this late hour.</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, I forgot to tell you that the order of our rooms in this apartment is "Me", "Kanon", "Rei", and "Mia".</div><div>In other words, when I go out on the balcony&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yo~, you come out!" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>I can directly talk to her on the balcony of the next room.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What's up, all of a sudden? I was just about to go to bed." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Isn't it fine. Besides, You can talk to such a pretty girl late at night." (Kanon)</div><div>"......I'm not interested." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You, are you really a man!?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's not that I don't adore adolescent situations like having a talk to girls alone at night, but I just don't feel comfortable having it with Kanon.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mmm, that's a bit of a misnomer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon is a beautiful girl. She's a transcendental beauty who could stand beside Rei and Mia and yet not be inferior to them.</div><div>But if you ask me if a good look would make me nervous, it doesn't. I'd say no. It's just kind of&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;hard to tell.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mm...... Ah, right. I don't get the boy-girl vibe with you, so I can be comfortable with you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's supposed to be fine, but somehow that's really pis*ing me off!?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sometimes Rei and Mia showed a level of "femininity" that was too much for high school boys to handle. But Kanon seemed to be deliberately keeping it in check, bringing the calmness of a long-time friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, it's fine, isn't it. So, why did you call me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well, it's not really fine, though......, Haa, nothing in particular. I just want to talk with someone." (Kanon)</div><div>"You're deliberately misleading men, aren't you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Isn't it you yourself who got it wrong? Unlike Rei, I don't tempt men." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think Rei meant to do that, and I don't think she's trying to mislead&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"You went on a date with Rei, didn't you?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Hmm? Yeah, I did. An acquaintance of mine gave me tickets to the aquarium and I felt it was a good idea...... to ask her out." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's been a week since then, and she's still talking about it. It seems like she had a lot of fun." (Kanon)</div><div>"...... I see. I'm glad then." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If she said she had a good time even when I wasn't around, it must be a genuine feeling. As the one who dedicated the first date to her, I was relieved.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......So, how far have you guys gotten?"(Kanon)</div><div>"Huuh, what a joke. There's no such a thing." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eeeh, Although I'm pretty sure Rei might have been willing....." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Certainly, I vaguely felt that kind of sign.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, It's just that there is a different kind of feeling than romantic affection.</div><div>No doubt she's got a special feeling for me, but I couldn't think of a reason why she had it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Well, if you're going to go out with her, make sure no one will ever find out, ka~y. I don't want to lose my job because of your involvement." (Kanon)</div><div>"It's not going to happen, so don't worry. I also want to protect you guys' dreams." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've said this to Rei many times before, but if I was to cause any damage to the Milfeuille Stars' career, it would be a regret that would haunt me for the rest of my life.</div><div>That's why, even if Rei likes me and I like her, we're not going to end up in a&nbsp; man-woman relationship.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But what if she's to approach you naked, of course you'll waver, won't you?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Of course I will. I don't know what you think I am, but I'm a normal high school boy." (Rintaro)</div><div>"No, don't waver there." (Kanon)</div><div>"I can't humiliate myself by letting a girl come at me naked go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Maybe Rintaro has a lot of experience?" (Kanon)</div><div>"No, I've never had a girlfriend before, I'm a complete virgin." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What!? Then you were just trying to be cool!?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>The two of us looked at each other and laughed at what we had just said.</div><div>After all, I've become friends with Kanon. Even though the atmosphere is completely different, it somehow reminds me of the time I spent with Yukio.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I'll ask you again. Why did you send me a Line?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I've told you, haven't I. It's just I felt like I want to talk." (Kanon)</div><div>"Then it didn't have to be me, right. As for Rei...... she might have been asleep, but Mia would still be awake." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... You, a type of guy who would find out about an affair in a heartbeat, aren't you." (Kanon)</div><div>"Obviously. I haven't spent my entire life in school looking at others' faces for nothing." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's uncool......." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon looked at me with a wry smile on her face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, mind if I go to your room?" (Kanon)</div><div>"...... Have no choice then. I'll at least serve you a coffee." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I confirmed that Kanon had gone back inside the room, and I went inside once too.</div><div>As I recall, she prefers more milk and less sugar&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Soon after, I opened the front door, sat Kanon on the couch, and placed a cup of freshly brewed coffee in front of her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thanks....... You're really thoughtful, really you are. It's just perfectly fit my taste." (Kanon)</div><div>"I'm longing to be a full-time househusband. If I can't do this much, how can I even declare it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"No, normally people won't go this far, you know......?" (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>I sat down next to her, sipping on the coffee I had made for myself.</div><div><br /></div><div>Looking at her again, I see that she was dressed quite defenselessly.......</div><div>She was wearing a pink t-shirt that was a bit large in size, and the hem of her shorts exposed her bare thighs. Her hair, that always tied up, now was down, making her look even more feminine than usual.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Wha~t's wrong? Did you find me attractive when we were alone?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Well, yeah. Somehow, you're more calm than usual, almost like you're not Kanon." (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... I can also, be like this at times, okay." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon sipped from her mug, trying to hide her embarrassment.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's about the next concert, I'm feeling a little pressured of it." (Kanon)</div><div>"Huh......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You're probably thinking, 'Why it has to be now', right? Yes, it is." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>She didn't make eye contact with me.</div><div>It's not a joke, and that's probably why it's hard for her to talk face-to-face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I haven't told you this, but my family is pretty normal, despite being a real estate agent. Rei's family is rich, and Mia's mother is actually a famous actress. I was born and raised in a completely different environment compared to them." (Kanon)</div><div>"I didn't know that......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"They both have such high specs that it makes no sense. And unfortunately, sometimes I can't keep up with them." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>She said it as if it was nothing, but there was a hint of frustration in every word.</div><div>I'm not in the same position, but even I could understand how Kanon felt. Those two&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;especially Rei who was close to me and I could clearly sense, she was definitely a monster.</div><div>From the mental capacity to the physical construction, it's as if she's not a normal human being.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If that's the case, you're pretty high-spec from my point of view, too." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's of course, I'm a perfect beauty no matter how." (Kanon)</div><div>"Choose either you're confident or you're not......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I am, but am not. I don't wanna detract them, so I try really hard to keep up with them. But sometimes...... I get exhausted." (Kanon) <b><i>(PTW/N: I must suppress the urge of using "well yes but actually no".)</i></b></div><div>"...... I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I finally understood why she came confiding to me.</div><div>There's no way she could tell them about this.</div><div>I'm sure she had been keeping it all to herself, not telling anyone until now.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, can I lean on you?" (Kanon)</div><div>"H*lla no." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's the part where a gentleman says, "Feel free to do", you know!?" (Kanon)</div><div>"The only person I'm letting to lean on is my future wife. You don't wanna be my wife, do you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll consider it, I think?......., I'd say, but I don't wanna go out with a guy who's more feminine than me." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>She giggled, just as she had when we were talking on the balcony.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Strangely, I feel like at home when around you. It's like I can forget that I'm an idol." (Kanon)</div><div>"Aren't you supposed to keep remembering it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's fine. Sometimes.&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Hey, so can I borrow your shoulder...... for five minutes?" (Kanon)</div><div>"......It's expensive, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I leaned my back against the couch in silence.&#12288;</div><div>Then, Kanon put her head on my shoulder.</div><div>Her weight is as light as it was when I carried her from the couch to the bed at the housewarming party.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Your shoulder's pretty stiff......." (Kanon)</div><div>"Sorry for it. I'll put a cushion then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What's the point of borrowing your shoulder then? This is fine. It's the right firmness." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>In this room, quiet time was flowing.</div><div>There were no conversations. This was not what Kanon was looking for.</div><div>As a full-time househusband, I should take what my partner wants and give it to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>The end of this moment came sooner than I expected.</div><div><br /></div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7RVDncz/192941.jpg"></img>

<div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Five minutes is surprisingly short, yes." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon's head moved away.</div><div>I turned my slightly stiffened shoulders and looked at her face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You're looking somewhat better than before." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Do I? Well, I certainly feel better now." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon stood up from the couch, stretching her body.</div><div>The peculiar gloom I had felt when she came to my room had disappeared and there she was, her usual self.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, can I borrow your shoulder like this again?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Next time, I'll charge you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Why you're being stingy?" (Kanon)</div><div>"Just kidding. I'll give you five minutes any time. That's as far as I can go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't even know what your definition of "as far as you can go" is. ...... Well, I'll come back when I feel exhausted. So, that....... Thanks for today." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>After saying that, Kanon headed for the door.</div><div>I was somehow calling out to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kanon...... Do your best." (Rinatro)</div><div>"...... You're an awkward guy as well, aren't you. You don't have to tell me, I'll push myself to the limit." (Kanon)</div><div><br /></div><div>She waved her hand and left the room.</div><div><br /></div><div>After listening to her worries, my worries about the tripartite meeting seemed insignificant.</div><div>I drank the rest of my coffee and twirled the empty mug between my fingers.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Aah~, this is ridiculous. It's not like I'm going to die, right." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Even if the tripartite meeting turned into a bipartite meeting, it wouldn't necessarily be a problem for the rest of my life.</div><div>Let's just take it easy. That's enough of life.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next thing I knew, it was around midnight.</div><div>I grabbed her mug and took it to the sink.</div><div>I guess I should go to bed now.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Later that day, after school.</div><div>The day of the meeting finally arrived.</div><div>I sat down on a chair in the hallway and waited for the previous meeting to end. Since my parents were not around, I had a more flexible schedule than the rest of my classmates, so I was placed relatively later in the order.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Eh, was it Shidou before me, huh?"</div><div><br /></div><div>As I waited for a while, fiddling with my phone, a voice suddenly called out to me.</div><div>I looked up and saw the familiar handsome face standing there as usual.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, Kakihara-kun......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You can call me Yuusuke. We've been classmates for almost three months now, right." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>He said and sat down on the chair next to me.</div><div>I don't remember getting to know him well enough to call him by his given name, but I guess it wouldn't be very nice to turn him down.</div><div>I put on a smile and nodded my head.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You can call me Rintaro then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Really? Then I'll do without reservation...... Do Rintaro's parents can't make it either?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Ah, yes...... Yuusuke-kun also has the meeting at this time, which means&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah. Both of my parents are working overseas, my mom is a designer and my dad runs a venture company. So it's not easy for them to come back to Japan." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;That's one h*ll of a high-spec family.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So, perhaps, are you living alone, Yuusuke-kun?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Hmm? Yes, I am. I've been living alone since I entered high school. My mother was still in Japan when I was in junior high school, though." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"I see. Isn't it hard?" (Rintaro)</div><div>You're the only one who said that to me, Rintaro. Everyone says they envy me living alone. It's not all good, though." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been living alone, so I know what it's like.</div><div>The Me in my head nodded in agreement while crossing his arms.</div><div><br /></div><div>"H-hey...... Rintaro." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, Kakihara began to fidget and let his gaze wander.</div><div>That's the kind of atmosphere where you want to say something but...... are too embarrassed to open your mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What's wrong......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah, that...... I wanted to ask a consultation to you about something." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"A consultation?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's about......&nbsp; a matter of love." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>Why me? I was about to ask, but I closed my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Love? I don't know if I can be a good consultant, though." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You already has a girlfriend, don't you, Rintaro? I beg you, please, just for this waiting time." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Y-yea~h...... Right. That's certainly right." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was about to start talking to him on the assumption that I didn't have a girlfriend.</div><div>I felt guilty for deceiving him, so I decided to just listen to what he was going to say. It's a pain in the a*s, though.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't know if I can be of any help, but at least I can lend you an ear." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I-I see......! Y-you know...... I actually have feelings...... for Azusa!" (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Yep, I knew.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>"We were on the same committee when we were freshmen....... We became friends from there, and I've actually been in love with her ever since." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"...... I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think it's at the level of "actually".</div><div>After all, he was not aware that he was behaving in such an obvious way. And surprisingly, he tended not to self-consider that often, and well, it's not hard to see why.</div><div>It's just a little ridiculous that he believed he could conceal it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But Azusa probably only thinks of me as a good friend. So I was wondering what I should do to be seen as a man......." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Hmmm........." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh come on, that's d*mn hard.</div><div>I don't actually have a girlfriend, so this is too heavy for me to handle.</div><div><br /></div><div>"How about, showing your manly side?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's...... what I'm trying to do." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>That's certainly true. I don't know of any man who was more popular than Kakihara, and there's no way that this guy, who could lead the class at any time, was not attractive as a man.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Then, how about&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;straightforwardly asking her out on a date?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Th-that's...... definitely going to make me nervous." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Until now, I've only ever seen you with the usual four people, including Nikaido-san, so I figured you'd never really gone out alone with her." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......I'm surprised, you're right. I don't think I've ever been alone with a girl before except when Ryuuji and I were out together." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"I think it's a good chance to make her aware of you. If you don't show that you're conscious of her, it won't turn into a romantic situation." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Certainly......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kakihara was listening to my (made-up) advice with a serious expression.</div><div>Incidentally, this strategy can be a bit tricky.</div><div>For example, if she refuses to go out for a date with him, he won't have a chance. Therefore, he can give up at this point. It's not like he has confessed his feelings to her, so the damage should be minimal.</div><div>If she agrees to go on a date, it means that there is some kind of chance. However, there are many cases where this is just a misunderstanding, so don't be in a hurry here.</div><div>The first thing to do is to show that he is aware of the other person as a woman. If the other person feels uncomfortable with this, then it's hopeless to get her as a girlfriend. So he has no choice but to give up.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's the theory I came up with.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'll try to ask her out in private.&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Thanks, Rintaro. I'll give it a shot." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"I'm glad I could be of help. Good luck, Yuusuke." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The two of them were a perfect match from the perspective of an outsider, and I honestly hoped that it'll come to fruition.</div><div>And since I spent a few minutes of my time on this consultation session, I'll feel like I'm losing out if this doesn't come to fruition. Please make it happen, for the sake of my few minutes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Excuse me."</div><div><br /></div><div>I heard the door rattle open and the classmate before my turn walked out of the classroom.</div><div>Just in time.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It looks like it's my turn. Later then, Yuusuke-kun." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, thank you so much, Rintaro." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"It's a friend's problem, so don't mind it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I waved to Kakihara and made my way into the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Haaa~...... what tiresome.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
  <div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"Eee, Shidou Rintaro. It's a bipartite meeting, so just take it easy."</div><div>"Yes. please."</div><div><br /></div><div>I bowed my head to the young woman who was sitting in front of me across the desk&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Harukawa Yuri-sensei.</div><div>She was the homeroom teacher of our class, and a beautiful teacher who is the most popular among boys.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So, about your career path, ...... have you decided on anything?" (Yuri)</div><div>"Ah, yes, I have. I've decided to go to university for the time being. I haven't found what I want to do yet, though." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I can understand it, I can. That's how it is in the sophomore of high school. To be frank, it's actually for senior students, so I think it's enough for now." (Yuri)</div><div><br /></div><div>She was a person who understood.</div><div>She was popular not only because she was beautiful, but also because she understood the feelings of her students better than anyone else.</div><div>But at the same time, she was not too serious and gave off a pleasant atmosphere, which made her quite an ideal teacher.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shidou-kun has good grades and is the type of person who studies hard, right?" (Yuri)</div><div>"Yes, I am. My father told me to keep good grades so I could live on my own." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>This is true.</div><div>Even that father seemed to be worried about his child living alone, and he gave me such a condition when we parted.</div><div>In fact, he might just be uncomfortable if the kid who inherited his excellent genes is getting poor grades.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You are living alone...... It's not easy for a high school student, is it? Are you eating well?" (Yuri)</div><div>"You sound like a mother......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm old enough to be a parent. And I'm tired of my parents calling me once a month asking "Have you gotten married yet?", just for you to know." (Yuri) <b><i>(PTW/N: (Ani/Manga/LN/WN) woman who's self-conscious herself being "old", quite rare, I think.)</i></b></div><div><br /></div><div>Harukawa-sensei is 26 years old this year, I believe. She must be feeling the hardships that only an adult can understand.</div><div>Hmmm......it just doesn't matter to me, does it?</div><div><br /></div><div>"But my skin looks good, and I don't see any problems. I only worry about my blemishes now......" (Yuri)</div><div>"Ahaha." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Yeah, I don't give a sh*t about this story.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Let's see, the rest is ...... Ah, right! Do you have a college you want to go to, Shidou-kun?" (Yuri)</div><div>"Well, ...... I'd like to go to GMARCH if possible." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>GMARCH is an acronym for six universities in Tokyo: Gakushuin University, Meiji University, Aoyama Institute University, Rikkyo University, Chuo University, and Hosei University.</div><div>This school, which has one foot in the higher education field, can realistically aim for GMARCH.</div><div>Incidentally, there are three more universities called Waseda University, Keio University, and Sophia University, but the current amount of my study is not enough to go there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You're right. With your grades, GMARCH is not so hard. You might have to work a lot harder in your senior year, though." (Yuri)</div><div>"I understand that." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's no problem, then. You've been living alone for a while now, so you've got a solid mindset." (Yuri)</div><div><br /></div><div>Harukawa-sensei wrote my information in the file at hand and closed it quickly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"All right, then, this bipartite meeting's over. Have a safe trip home." (Yuri)</div><div>"Thank you very much. I'd take my leave then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah! Please call Kakihara-kun, who's waiting outside, when you leave." (Yuri)</div><div>"I will do." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I left the classroom, grateful that it had gone smoothly.</div><div>When Kakihara noticed me, he looked up and I motioned him to enter the classroom. He became a little nervous and went straight into the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, there's no point in me staying at school any longer, since I'm not even in a club. I put my bag back on my back and start walking towards the school gate.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;On the way home.</div><div><br /></div><div>From the other side of the corridor, I saw a familiar blonde walking towards me. It was our idol, Otosaki Rei.</div><div>Next to her walked a tall, dark-haired man in a well-tailored suit.</div><div>A pain shot through my head, suddenly bringing back memories of my childhood that I had been 'trying to forget'.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, that man over there, somewhere, I feel like I had&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah...... Rintaro." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, who noticed me, murmured so.</div><div>The man next to her's eyebrows twitched, and he looked at me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, Otosaki-san...... was your tripartite meeting today?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eh? Ah, yes, that's right. After Kakihara-kun." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei flinched for a moment as I went into innocent mode.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are you Rei's classmate?"</div><div>"Yes, my name is Shidou Rintaro." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Shidou?"</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as the man heard my name, he put his hand on his chin and looked thoughtful.</div><div>Then, he was interrupted in his thoughts by Rei, who was standing next to him.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Dad, we have to get to the front of the classroom quickly." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Dad&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I see, so this man is Rei's father.</div><div>His hair color was different, but his neat face seemed to have been somehow inherited to her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Okay, I was a little late leaving the office. I'm sorry, Shidou-kun. I'm sorry I could not greet you properly."</div><div>"No, please had no worry about it." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I see, I'll take my leave then."</div><div><br /></div><div>He seemed to be a busy man.</div><div>Rei and her father walked past me and headed for the classroom where Harukawa-sensei was waiting for them.</div><div>There was no point in watching them any longer.</div><div>I turned my back on them and proceeded</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Say, Shidou-kun."</div><div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, he called me over and so I turned around.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Have we, met before, Shidou-kun?"</div><div>"......It was probably just your imagination, wasn't it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"......I see. I'm sorry, I ask you a weird question."</div><div><br /></div><div>With that last remark, they turned and disappeared down the hallway.</div><div><br /></div><div>My heart was beating fast.</div><div>Cold sweat broke out as void, unpleasant feelings rushed through my head.</div><div>Eventually, the faces of my mother and father came to mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>"D*mn......, I feel terrible as h*ll." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a curse in the empty hallway and walked out to shake off the bad feelings.</div>

<div>I was standing in the middle of a crowded and noisy party hall.&#12288;</div><div><br /></div><div>AAH, it's that dream again, huh&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br />
</div><div>Thinking that, I just look at the same scene as before.</div><div>The conversation between fathers.</div><div>A small misdeed by mine and the girl.</div><div>And when it was over, the dream was also over.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;ro&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Rintaro!" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt my name being called, and I slowly opened my eyes.</div><div>The first thing I saw was a golden curtain. Then I quickly realize that it was her hair.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm back. Are you okay?" (Rei)</div><div>"Ee, Y-yeah......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Apparently, I had fallen asleep on the sofa as soon as I got home.</div><div>Because I slept in my uniform, it got a little wrinkled.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'll have to iron it later....... Sorry, what time is it now?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's about 19:00." (Rei)</div><div>"Ah......, sorry, I couldn't get food ready. Can you wait for a while? I can make udon or pasta if you want." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Udon is good then. To be honest...... I'm not that hungry today either." (Rei)</div><div>"......I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei's expression was somewhat lackluster.</div><div>Maybe something happened during the tripartite meeting.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Wait here for a moment. it'll be ready in about fifteen minutes." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Got it, and thanks as always." (Rei)</div><div>"That's the deal. So, don't worry about it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I got up and headed for the kitchen.</div><div>I took out two frozen udon noodles, defrosted and then boiled them, and made a noodle soup base.</div><div>I put little grilled scallions and fried tofu on top, and it was ready.</div><div>I placed the bowl in front of Rei who was sitting on the couch and put her chopsticks on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's ready." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It smells so good." (Rei)</div><div>"If you want a second, just let me know. The udon is still ready." (Rintaro)</div><div>"All right. Then, I'll dig in." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>I sat down next to her, took the bowl my share, and sipped the udon.</div><div>Yup, it tastes soothing.</div><div>The scallions were fragrant and the fried tofu oozed with juice on each bite.</div><div>It wasn't as delicious as I had hoped, but the gentle taste gradually soothed my mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>After we finished our dinner, we lined up on the couch and started watching TV.</div><div>It wasn't that there was anything we wanted to watch.</div><div>We just turned it on randomly to give ourselves some breaks.</div><div>On the screen, there was a young comedian who was wowing the studio. I've been seeing this guy a lot lately&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I thought, and glancing sideways at Rei's face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is your lack of appetite related to...... that problem you were mentioning earlier." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm...... How did you know?" (Rei)</div><div>"It's just a hunch, that's all. But I've rarely seen you so brooded over, so I figured you might be." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......was right." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>A sigh leaked out.</div><div>If that's the case, there's nothing I can do about it.</div><div>The date had made it clear that there was nothing I could do to help.</div><div><br /></div><div>"My father is coming to see the next live concert." (Rei)</div><div>"...... huh." (Rintaro)</div><div>"My father has always been opposed to my idol activities. He's always wanted me to quit." (Rei)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Rei kept her face downcasted and crossed her fingers on her thighs.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If I fail and embarrass myself at the upcoming concert, he will probably not allow me to be an idol anymore. I'll go back to being a normal girl, and someday I'll be forced to marry someone who will benefit the family. That's what...... scares me so much." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei seemed to be under a different kind of pressure than Kanon.</div><div>I can understand why her father was against her becoming an idol.</div><div>Idols are likely to be involved in hazardous situations, and moreover in this day and age, their lives could be ruined by the flames of an untrue rumor. How can he not worry about his daughter who goes through life in such a world?</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've felt a lot of pressure in the past. But this time it's different. The thought of my father seeing me right before his eyes...... makes me nervous, even though I still have almost two weeks to go." (Rei)</div><div>"You can't...... afford to fail, yes?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei nodded helplessly at my words.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is true that there is nothing I can do about this problem.</div><div>The only way to solve this problem is for Rei to overcome this pressure and make the concert a success.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't really understand those situations where you'd feel that kind of pressure, but...... I don't think Rei, in her usual self, will ever fail." (Rintaro)</div><div>"My usual, self......." (Rei)</div><div>"I know it's a difficult thing to overcome. The only thing I can help you is to keep your daily life as usual at least." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>The food I cook, the way we interact with each other. I don't think they all have any special meaning. But at the very least, I'm going to make sure that you don't feel any pressure in your life.</div><div>No matter how hard I try, that's all I can do.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Mmm. That's enough. I know better than anyone that in the end, I have to take care of myself. But I'm very happy that you care about me so much like that." (Rei)</div><div>"...... I see." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I couldn't think of anything thoughtful to say.</div><div>Only two weeks left until the concert.</div><div>I could only pray for the success of Rei and the others in the upcoming concert.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div>

<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>When Rei returned to her room, the time was 23:30.</div><div>Tomorrow is a Saturday holiday, so I was not in a hurry to go to bed early.</div><div>But in the afternoon, I'll be working on another short story for Yuzuki-sensei that will be included in a special issue&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"I can only do, huh." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I muttered to myself as I ironed my uniform.</div><div>When I was little, I used to feel like I could do anything, just like the heroes on the TV. It's called a sense of versatility.</div><div>But now, I've lost that feeling.</div><div>I have learned the reality and the limits.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon's problems, Kakihara's problems, and Rei's problems were all beyond my capabilities.</div><div><br /></div><div>And my worries must also be something they couldn't do anything about.</div><div>In such cases, it was no longer justifiable to intervene.</div><div>If you couldn't solve the problem as a result of poking your head into it, it'd probably only going to cause more pain for both sides.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Haaa~." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>One big sigh leaked from my mouth.</div><div>At the same time, a LINE notification arrived on the screen of my smartphone.</div><div>I felt a sense of déjà vu as I checked it out and saw the name "Ugawa Mia" shown on it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>[Can I bother to come over to your place now? I need to talk to you for a minute.] (Mia)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>It was déjà vu all over again&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>I read her LINE and flicked through the letters to reply.</div><div>I couldn't just accept Kanon but then rejected Mia.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>[Okay. I'll leave the door open, then.] (Rintaro)</b></div><div><b>[Thanks. I'll be right there.] (Mia)</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The reply came in less than a few tens of seconds, and our exchanges on LINE were over.</div><div>I went to the front door and unlocked it.</div><div>I walked back to the kitchen and started to brew some coffee, just like I did with Kanon.</div><div><br /></div><div>I knew she liked it black, just exactly like me.</div><div>After all, I somehow feel a strong affinity to Mia.......</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Before long, I heard the door open with a clang and Mia appeared in the living room.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, sorry to call you so late, yes?" (Mia)</div><div>"It's okay, I've got the day off tomorrow. The coffee is a black one, right?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I like it best as it is." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I urged her to sit on the couch and placed the coffee in front of her.</div><div>She took a sip from the mug as she said, "Let's sippin'.".</div><div><br /></div><div>"You brewed a really good cup of coffee, didn't you?" (Mia)</div><div>"I've always liked coffee, so I brewed it myself every day and now I'm as confident about it as I am about cooking." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You know what they say, continuity is the key. I think I'll try to learn to make my own coffee......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia sipped her coffee happily.</div><div>It's an honor to be appreciated, but I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss coffee, right.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So, what's going on? What's so important that you have to visit a boy's room so late?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yeah, mmm...... I don't know if this's important or not, though." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>She set her mug back down on the table, her eyes glancing around a bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you notice anything strange about Rei and Kanon lately?" (Mia)</div><div>"......What do you mean?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mmmwell, it's a little difficult to say. But, do you find anything unusual in their demeanor or so anything like that?" (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see. So this lass was curious about the two of them being troubled, so she came here to ask about them.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I won't go into details for privacy reasons, but it seems that both of them have a lot in their minds. Kanon even contacted me the other day saying she wanted to talk about it at such this time." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's right. Rintaro-kun is very popular, isn't he." (Mia)</div><div>"Thanks then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Muuu, your reaction is not worth teasing. I was expecting a more enthusiastic reaction." (Mia)</div><div>"If that's what you're looking for, go to Kanon and just listen to her worries then." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't have to listen. I'm sure it's about she feels inferior to me and Rei or something like that, isn't it?" (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>I couldn't help but stop my hand from sipping my coffee.</div><div>By the time I realized that this was proof that she hit the nail on my head, it was too late.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I knew it........ Don't worry. It's not that you're easy to read or anything, it's just that I've been sensing these signs for about a year now." (Mia)</div><div>"So you've been noticing it all along." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Well, it's a teammate thing, after all, and I'm sure Rei is aware of it somehow." (Mia)</div><div>"So what do you think about Kanon's worries?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I don't particularly care, though, because it's just terribly silly." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia, in no uncertain terms, dismissed Kanon's worries as trivial.</div><div>I was at a loss for words, but she continued.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You know, Kanon is a lot more talented than you think. She may feel that she can barely keep up with us, but that's true from my point of view as well. There's not a day that goes by that I don't try to keep up with Rei and Kanon, or I'll detract them.&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I believe we all have the same worries, without exception." (Mia)</div><div>"......I see. So that's what you mean by silly." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kanon's worries were kind of unfounded.</div><div>They really were a great group.</div><div>Each member wasn't looking down on each other, and there was no disparity between them from the outside.</div><div>The three of them were just fit perfectly. And it must have to be no other than the three of them. Their balance was such that it made people believe so.</div><div>Their individual charms and talents overlap like a mille-feuille. That's why they are "Mille-feuille Stars".</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rei is the one who I don't understand. It's true that even we sometimes get a little nervous before a live performance, but lately, she's been more on edge than usual......." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>She seemed to have not heard about the situation of the person in question.</div><div>Rei did not seem to be particularly secretive about this matter. I can't do anything about it, but if it's Mia, she might be able to close by to support her&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"I just heard a little bit about it. She said her father is coming to the next concert." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Aah, I see. Rei's father is against her idol activities...... so it's no wonder she feels so pressured." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia halted and took a sip or two of her already slightly lukewarm coffee. She then let out a breath of air, somewhat relieved.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thanks, Rintaro-kun. I've been able to get some relief from what was bothering me." (Mia)</div><div>"You're welcome. You've got a lot of compassion for your fellas, haven't you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Of course I've. The three of us are one. If any one of us is missing, we're no longer Mille-Feuille Stars&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;. We're working with that kind of mindset." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia's words were jokingly cheerful, but I felt that she meant them.</div><div>Maybe she was the one who was thinking about the Mille-Feuille Stars the most.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rintaro-kun, why are you doing so much for us?" (Mia)</div><div>"Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You know, you don't have to be like this to listen to someone's problems in a friendly way. I can understand if we've been friends for a long time, but we've known each other for less than two months, right? So I was wondering if you find it annoying to have to listen to me." (Mia)</div><div>"......There is no such thing as an annoyance." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I took a sip of my coffee to summarize my thoughts.</div><div>Then I put down my mug and opened my mouth again.</div><div><br /></div><div>"When I was little, I wanted to be something that made people smile." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Something?" (Mia)</div><div>"Like a hero who saves people and protects their smiles, or a doctor, or a...... comedian who makes people laugh. I had this embarrassing dream that I wanted to see a lot of people smile." (Rintaro) <b><i>(PTW/N: Well, you've already become a hero for a certain maiden.)</i></b></div><div><br /></div><div>The setback came when my mother abandoned me and left.</div><div>It was on that day that I began to think about things in a very pragmatic way.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But before I graduated from elementary school, I realized that it was impossible. I didn't have the power to make a lot of people smile. At best, as a weak person, I could only manage to make one person in front of me smile." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......" (Mia)</div><div>"So I kind of admire you girls standing on stage and wowing the crowd. I guess you could say I'm dreaming of the old days. Anyway, I admire you girls for doing what I can't do." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>So I wanted to help.</div><div>That's what I decided.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Of course, that's assuming I have the contract with Rei. If it weren't for Rei's contract, I wouldn't have known much about you two, and I probably wouldn't have had as much respect for you girls." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Fufu, you weren't even a fan at first." (Mia)</div><div>"Haha, I was." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It seemed like only yesterday that Rei had taken me to the Fantasista Entertainment studio.</div><div>The relationship I had with Mia and Kanon started that day.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If my support can help Rei&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I mean, Mille-Feuille Stars, then maybe the old me can get some relief. That's what I thought." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......I see. I understand exactly what you mean." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mia drank the rest of her coffee and got up.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry for keeping you so long until the coffee was cold. I'll take my leave then." (Mia)</div><div>"I see. I'm glad to hear that you got some relief from your troubles." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe it was because it's the rainy season, but I got the impression that more and more people were having problems. <b><i>(PTW/N: I didn't find much about this rainy season stuff, but here: <a href="https://www.tsunagujapan.com/5-awful-things-about-japans-rainy-season/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tsunagujapan.com/5-awful-things-about-japans-rainy-season/</a>)</i></b></div><div>I wish I could be the first to help Rei with her problems, but life didn't seem to be going that well.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, right. I want to tell you something before I go." (Mia)</div><div>"Hmm.......?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You've made enough people smile, they're Rei, Kanon...... and even me." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>She smiled mischievously and turned her back on me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"See you tomorrow, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</div><div>"......! Mia! Umm....... Thank you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Fufu, you're welcome." (Mia)</div><div><br /></div><div>Good night&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>After saying that, Mia left my room.</div><div>I was left alone, and I looked up at the ceiling, weakly.</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt as if my heart had been rewarded, as if I had been saved. But the only thing that was bothering me was Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is there nothing I can do to help.......?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I knew it well. It was not the kind of relationship where I could get involved in her family's affairs. If an outsider tried to complain about something, the other side had no obligation to listen.</div><div><br /></div><div>But even if that was the case.</div><div><br /></div><div>A vague thought began to swirl inside me, wondering if that was really the right thing to do.</div><div>I felt like there was still something I could do.</div>
