<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; The Aquarium Date</h3>

<div>I was having a strange dream.</div><div>I think it was a dream about a party I went to some time ago, but after a while, I forgot most of the details.</div><div>But it seemed to be a very important memory.</div><div><br /></div><div>I got up from the bed and walked towards the washer.</div><div>I put all the clothes I had accumulated into the washer and let it run for about an hour.</div><div>I killed time with my morning coffee, and when the laundry was done, I hung them out on the balcony.</div><div>This was the first time I had done laundry since I came to this house, but I had been repeating this for many years now.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today was Sunday, but Rei and the others were not at home.</div><div>Apparently, they had to record a program to announce a live concert, and they wouldn't be home until the evening.</div><div>I was told that lunch would be served backstage, so there was no work for me until she came back.</div><div>But that's only in here in this place.</div><div>I have a job as an assistant for Yuzuki-sensei, which I got on a whim.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Phewwwh......" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I hung up my last T-shirt and left the house.</div><div>I got on my bicycle, which I hadn't had much chance to use before, and headed for Yuzuki-sensei's workplace.</div><div>After all, one of the most convenient things about moving to a new place is that I don't have to take the train to get to her place.</div><div>I parked my bike at the bottom of the apartment building and went into the workplace.</div><div>There were only Yuzuki-sensei's shoes at the entrance, so it seemed that the other assistants hadn't arrived yet.</div><div><br /></div><div>I forgot to mention that Yuzuki-sensei does not live in this room.</div><div>She rented an apartment as her workplace within walking distance from her house in order to get her daily exercise.</div><div>To add to that, she neglected her household chores so much that I sometimes took charge of cleaning up her room.</div><div>I think it's about once a month.</div><div>Let's just say that the level of messiness of her room is such that I'm amazed that she can make such a mess every time.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Good morning, Yuzuki-sensei." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah, Rintaro! I'm sorry, although it's a precious holiday for a high school student." (Himiko)</div><div>"Rei was also at work, so I was free today, which was perfectly fine. What should I do first?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'd like you to do some beta-coloring for me. I'm working on a comic this month, and I'm going to draw a limited edition short story for it." (Himiko)</div><div>"Aah, that's a lot of work for your schedule." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You're totally right...... I've been told that I can keep the page count low, but even so, I'll have to pick up the pace pretty fast to make it." (Himiko)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"Hello~ I am pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>In the first place, she hasn't even finished the manuscript for this month.</div><div>If she has to start another story while she's working on that one, she might have to prepare herself for the same level of hardship as she did in May.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Let's do our best. I'm going to do my best to help." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Uuuu...... Rintaro is such a kind boy...... I'll give you lots of extra money for your part-time job." (Himiko)</div><div>"I'm looking forward to it." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was still before nine o'clock.</div><div>By nine o'clock, the other assistants would be here.</div><div>I'm a slow worker, so I need to get some work done before then.</div><div>Unlike me, the assistants are all trying to make a living from manga, so there's no way I can keep up with them in terms of technique.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, that's right. Rintaro, why don't you go to this place?" (Himiko)</div><div>"Eh?" (Rintaro)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"Hello~ I am pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>Suddenly, Yuzuki-sensei placed two tickets on my desk.</div><div>They seemed to be free tickets to the aquarium.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Why did Sensei give me tickets to the aquarium?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Apparently, one of my assistants got dumped by his girlfriend....... They were actually planning to go there together, but he gave these to me because it was too hard for him to go alone. I've never had anyone to go with me, so I've had a lot on my plate. But if it's Rintaro, you can go with Otosaki-san, right?" (Himiko)</div><div>"Well, it might be true, but...... Unlike me, she is a busy person. So, it's probably a waste of time." (Rintaro)</div><div>"You can at least ask her about it. If she can't, you can give it to someone at school." (Himiko)</div><div>"Ah, in that case..." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>At any rate, I put the ticket away in my wallet.</div><div>I'll try to ask Rei out first as she said, but if she can't, I'll just give these tickets to Yukio.</div><div>Some might think that I should just ask Yukio out myself, but&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;personally, I don't like the idea of asking someone out because the first person couldn't make it.</div><div>It made me feel as if I'm telling the other person that he/she is the second-best.</div><div>I'd rather not ask him out than feel that way.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's your first date, isn't it, Rintaro? Ufufufufu. Let me know the outcome of the date, okay?" (Himiko)</div><div>"It's somewhat lame of you to try to make fun of others when you've never done it yourself, isn't it, Yuzuki-sensei?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"You just said something you shouldn't have to!" (Himiko)</div><div><br /></div><div>The cry of the manga artist, who had never had a boyfriend in her life, echoed through the room.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>On the evening of the day I finished my work as a temporary assistant, I was stirring my Japanese-style curry so it wouldn't burn, and thinking about the aquarium tickets Yuzuki-sensei had given me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmmm...... no matter how I put it, it just looks exactly like an invitation for a date, doesn't it?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>A man invites a woman to go to the aquarium. And it's just the two of them.</div><div>I was strangely conscious of it because Mia had asked me something weird yesterday.</div><div>I don't mean to be like this, but...... I've been feeling some kind of uncomfortable tension for a while now.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm home." (Rei)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>The front door opened and Rei walked into the living room.</div><div>I have gotten so used to this relationship of she's saying "I'm home" and I greet her "Welcome home" that I cannot take it as discomfort anymore.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oh, welcome home." (Rintaro)</div><div>"! Is today a Curry?" (Rei)</div><div>"Yeah. I made a Japanese-style curry with soup stock. I've changed the ingredients a little, so let me know what you think." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei, who sounded a little excited, washed her hands and came back.</div><div>In the meantime, I placed the white rice in a bowl, poured the roux over it, and placed it on the table. The aroma of spices and soup stock mingled together, filling the room with an appetizing smell different from the usual curry.</div><div><br /></div><div>""Let's dig in!"" (Rintaro, Rei)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>I took a spoonful of the curry and put it in my mouth.</div><div>The aroma was even stronger than the smell that filled the room.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yup,&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;this is good.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think part of it is that I was hungry from hard work, but even without that, it's pretty good.</div><div>I think this is going to be my favorite menu item.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yummy......! This tastes different from the usual curry." (Rei)</div><div>"Thank goodness. I did a little research on the Internet before I made it, but I had a general idea." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In the end, Rei ended up having two refills, reducing the curry she had made to just one plate, and the dinner was over.</div><div>And as usually we had done, Rei and I sipped our after-dinner coffee and watched TV leisurely.</div><div><br /></div><div>"When's the show you guys recorded today going to air?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's about two weeks later." (Rei)</div><div>"Hee......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>While having an idle conversation, I glanced at the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;It's about the time, I guess.</div><div><br />

</div><div>I took out the tickets I had in my pocket and placed one in front of Rei.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, what's this?" (Rei)</div><div>"Aquarium tickets. Yuzuki-sensei gave it to me. She wanted me and Rei to go there together." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei looked at the ticket and at me with a dumbfounded expression.</div><div>I'm not sure what to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Well, It's pretty dangerous for an idol to be in an aquarium together with a guy. It's a bad idea no matter what, so you can just say no if it is impossible." (Rintaro)</div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;go." (Rei)</div><div>"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I wanna go......! I'll definitely go with you!" (Rei)</div>
<i style="color: white;"><div class="kopireg">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></i>
<div><br /></div><div>Rei suddenly leaned forward and said so in a louder voice than ever before.</div><div>That momentum made me taken aback involuntarily.</div><div><br /></div><div>"O-oh......, I see." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'll be sure to disguise myself so that I won't be recognized. I'm off next Saturday, so that should be fine." (Rei)</div><div>"O-okay, okay! That day is fine!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>And so, our aquarium date was smoothly confirmed.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>Well, that's how I ended up having a date with Rei&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What should I do......"</div><div><br /></div><div>I'd never been out with a girl before, to the point where I found myself mumbling to myself in my room.</div><div>It was only an hour before the appointment.</div><div>I hadn't decided what to wear yet, so I was just standing there in front of my closet clutching my head.</div><div><br /></div><div>As long as we were going out together, I didn't want to embarrass Rei too much.</div><div>In other words, dressing in a tacky way is no good, I guess that's within the realm of common sense.</div><div>On the other hand, flashy clothes are no good.</div><div>If Rei goes to the trouble of disguising herself and I dress conspicuously, I'll attract unwanted attention.</div><div>No matter how much she disguises herself, the more eyes are showered on her, the higher the probability of her identity being discovered.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Even if it's a little plain, I should go with something safe." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In the end, I put on a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt, put on a cheap necklace, and left the house.</div><div>I checked in the mirror to make sure that my appearance was safe.</div><div>I went to the square in front of the station.</div><div>Since we live in the same apartment building, you would think that we could just go there together without arranging a rendezvous.</div><div>However, if we by any chance were to be caught by a weekly magazine leaving the apartment together, it would be a waste of their efforts to rent the entire floor to avoid scandal.</div><div>Even if they were taking extra precautions, it would be too late after something had happened.</div><div><br /></div><div>The temperature outside had already reached the point where it felt as if we had one foot into summer.</div><div>I arrive in front of the station feeling like I'm slowly sweating.</div><div>There was a strange-looking object in front of the station that was often used as a rendezvous.</div><div>We're going to have rendezvous there too, though&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div>

<div>"Hmm, is that......?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>A girl wearing a large hat and sunglasses is standing in front of the object.</div><div>Her effort in disguise was so meticulous that even if I knew it was Rei, I could barely recognize her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yo, thanks for waiting." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm. It's just been less than five minutes since we got here." (Rei)</div><div>"I see. It's not like we don't have much time, but shall we go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yep. I'm looking forward to it." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>We didn't enter the station&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;but instead, we got into a taxi that was waiting for a customer.</div><div>The reason we didn't take a commuter was, of course, that we would be more likely to be seen by random people.</div><div><br /></div><div>The taxi ride took less than an hour.</div><div>We arrived at a famous aquarium in the vicinity.</div><div>As it was a holiday, I had the impression that there were many parents and their children there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I know it's a little late, but I've never been to the aquarium much." (Rei)</div><div>"You haven't? ......well, I'm kind of the same way." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Both my mother and father are busy. That's why I've never been with them. The first and last time was on a field trip when I was in elementary school." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Me too, it was exactly the same.</div><div><br /></div><div>The only difference was that my mother took me with her once.</div><div>In hindsight, it was probably just an act of guilt over the decision to abandon me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That's why I was looking forward to today even more. Rintaro, thank you for inviting me." (Rei)</div><div>"...... You're welcome." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've never had such good memories of the aquarium, but I think I might enjoy it now being with Rei.*</div><div><br /></div><div>After showing our tickets at the entrance, we walked into the building.</div><div>The passageway was dark, and the lights were set up to emphasize the tanks on either side.</div><div>The inside of the tank looked fantastic, with many fish swimming comfortably in it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, there's a really cute fish." (Rei)</div><div>"It says "Clownfish" on it....... I think I had seen a movie with a clownfish as the main character before." (Rintaro)</div><div>"What about this one?" (Rei)</div><div>"It's a seahorse." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei's eyes sparkle at everything she sees, and she moves her gaze around impatiently.</div><div>She seems to be enjoying it a lot.</div><div>I'll have to thank Yuzuki-sensei again later for the opportunity to invite her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, there's a dolphin show." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei pulled me by the hand, her voice more boisterous than usual.</div><div>The signboard at the end of the path showed the time schedule for the dolphin show.</div><div><br /></div>

<div>"Just in time, it said, ten minutes from now." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I really want to see it." (Rei)</div><div>"Okay okay. It's going to be a little out of order, but let's go." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>We deviated from the path and went outdoors.</div><div>The dolphin show seemed to be quite popular, so we got in line for admission.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you like dolphins?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I like them because they're cute. Or rather, I like all cute animals." (Rei)</div><div>"Heeh......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei is the type of person that it's hard to tell what she's thinking at any given time, but it seems that she's still a girl at heart.</div><div>It's a bit of a relief to know that she's still a human being.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, it looks like the venue is open." (Rei)</div><div>"Hmm, shall we go then." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Following the line, we entered the dolphin show venue.</div><div>The venue wasn't fully packed&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;but there were still quite a few seats available.</div><div>We were ushered to the second row from the front and sat there.</div><div>I think we got a pretty good seat, very close to the dolphin pool.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the dolphin show! During this show, there is a possibility of water splashing when the dolphins jump, so your clothes may get wet. If you are uncomfortable with the show, we suggest you move to the back seat!"</div><div><br /></div><div>The official informed us of the warning.</div><div>Then a few people in the front row started to move back.</div><div>Two of them were couples, and the woman was wearing perfect makeup. I guess they didn't want the make-up to be ruined by any chance. From a man's point of view, it was a wise decision.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, the front is free." (Rei)</div><div>"Hey......, are you trying to coerce me?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"I want to get a closer look." (Rei)</div><div>"Didn't you hear the warning about the splash in the front row&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;you didn't hear." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei looked excited and moved to the first seat available.</div><div>I thought about it for a while and realized that it would be strange to leave my companion alone, so I took the seat next to her.</div><div>What do I have to do if she gets wet?</div><div><br /></div><div>"Now! Please watch the splendid show of Mii-chan and Kaa-kun, the dolphins!"</div><div><br /></div><div>The woman attendant, dressed in a wetsuit, started swimming with the two dolphins.</div><div>She and the dolphins were swimming without a single slip-up, as if they were communicating perfectly.</div><div>Eventually, the two dolphins leap from the water.</div><div>Their movements were so beautiful that I almost shouted with joy.</div><div><br /></div><div>But then tragedy struck.</div><div><br /></div><div>Because the dolphins landed very close to the audience, a lot of water splashing.</div><div>As I watched in a daze as the water splashed towards me, I lamented in my head.</div><div>"I've predicted it," I thought.</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt a slight shock on my chest, and my clothes started to get wet.</div><div>Looking next to me, I saw that Rei's clothes were also wet with more than a small amount of water.</div><div>This was where the problem started.</div><div>Because Rei was originally wearing light clothes, the cloth on her chest area was sticking to her.</div><div>Because of this, the underwear used to support her bre*sts was showing through. In other words, yes, it was a bra.</div><div>Fortunately, this was the front row. No one would be able to see her from the front.</div><div>I don't anticipate anything embarrassing to happen here and now&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;.</div><div><br /></div><div>(I mean, does this girl even notice......?)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei is watching the dolphins swimming around with a twinkle in her eye.</div><div>Seeing such an expression, I lost.</div><div>Well, there's no problem now, and I'll leave her alone for now until the show is over. It would be a shame to take her out of the venue.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;In the meantime, the show began to heat up towards the finale.</div><div><br /></div><div>The two dolphins that were added in the middle of the show, and the dolphins that were there from the beginning called Mii-chan and Kaa-kun.</div><div>Each of the four dolphins moved to a corner of the pool and swam towards the center at once.</div><div>In a moment of intersection, each of the four dolphins jumped up from the surface of the water at a perfect interval and drew four arcs in the air.</div><div><br /></div><div>With this great performance, the dolphin show reaches its finale.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>"Alright, let's get out of here." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Ah, I want to greet the keeper sister......." (Rei)</div><div>"We need to do something about that outfit as soon as possible!" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I pulled Rei's hand and we left the venue.</div><div>I draped my hand towel over her chest, just in case someone might take a look.</div><div>We rushed into the souvenir shop of the aquarium.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Look, you can't walk around with this appearance, can you? It might be a waste of money, but you can buy some clothes here." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Mm...... You're indeed right." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Looking down at her chest, Rei seemed to finally realize that she was soaking wet.</div><div>The items lined up in front of her were T-shirts with pictures of fish printed on them.</div><div>It's not that I don't like it, but I think it's better than having her underwear showing through.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, let's pair up then." (Rei)</div><div>"What?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Since we're here, I want us to wear the matching clothes." (Rei)</div><div>"That's embarrassing! We're not even a couple......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Today is a date. Is it no good......?" (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>It completely makes no sense&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>However, the upturned eyes of a very popular idol have extraordinary destructive power, and I flinched involuntarily.</div><div>I've taken all the effort to invite her, so I don't want to make her feel disappointed by refusing it.</div><div><br /></div><div>(It can't be helped, right......)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a big sigh and picked up a light blue dolphin T-shirt.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Okay. But I don't want to pick anything but this dolphin T-shirt." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yup. I also thought that design was good." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei picked up the pink dolphin t-shirt that was the counterpart to the one I had chosen.</div><div>I rejected Rei's offer that she would pay for both t-shirts and just purchased my own.</div><div>As a man, it might not be cool not to pay for Rei's t-shirt as well, but I couldn't say that I would since I had refused her offer.</div><div><br /></div><div>So we bought matching dolphin T-shirts.</div><div>Of course, there were no changing rooms at the souvenir shop, so we headed to the restroom to change.</div><div>On the way, I was struck by the sight of her happily hugging her own T-shirt.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...... Am I seriously going to walk around in this?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>In front of the restroom room mirror, I checked my outfit again.</div><div>In the center of my white T-shirt, a light blue dolphin picture leaped majestically.</div><div>It was adorable. It's definitely adorable, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well, whatever." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>No more sweating the details. The most important thing is that Rei is having fun.</div><div>Today, I'm going to do everything I can to meet her expectation, even if it's not housework.</div><div><br /></div><div>I walked out of the restroom and thought of waiting for Rei in front of the photo stand-in panel that was set up nearby, but she came out of the restroom too, just a few seconds apart.</div><div>She was wearing the same design t-shirt, just a different color, but somehow when she wore it, it looked more picturesque. Once again, I realized the magnificence of her unparalleled beauty.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Did you wait?" (Rei)</div><div>"Just about five seconds." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I wish you would have told me you had just arrived. I've always longed for it." (Rei)</div><div>"You know, that event had happened very recently, when we met at the station....... Come on, let's go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>We went back to the path on foot.</div><div>In the beginning, I was embarrassed to go as a pair, but I gradually forgot as I watched the brightly colored fish swimming in the tank.</div><div>When I saw Rei's happy face reflected in the tank, I was glad that I had invited her.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, time flies when you're having fun.</div><div>After looking around until the end path, we returned to the entrance.</div><div>The time was a little after 13:00. It was a delicate time, which was either lunchtime or not lunchtime.</div><div>Anyway, I was feeling very hungry, and I wanted to eat somewhere.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm a little thirsty, so I'm going to buy a drink." (Rei)</div><div>"Okay, I also want to go get something to drink." (Rintaro)</div><div>"It's fine. I'll get one for Rintaro, too. You've given me a ticket, so let me at least do this in return?" (Rei)</div><div>"...... I'm weak when you say it like that." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei made me sit down on a nearby bench and walked quickly in the direction of the vending machine.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm, I'm bored.</div><div><br /></div><div>To pass the time, I take out my phone and try to kill some time by opening manga apps.</div><div>Lately, I've been adding a few titles recommended by Rei to my favorites, and using the lives and tickets that are recovered by time, I've been reading them little by little.</div><div>I really appreciate this system.</div><div>If I'm interested in the rest of the story after reading a few chapters, I just need to purchase the book.</div><div>This way, I rarely make wasteful spending, and I can fully enjoy the manga while saving money.</div><div><br /></div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7pbpNsB/192940.jpg"></img>

<div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Huh? Shidou-kun?"</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm about to open the first chapter of a new manga when I hear a familiar female voice.</div><div>When I looked up, I saw Nikaido Azusa, the class-rep of our class, standing in front of me.</div><div>She was dressed in a short-sleeved, long skirt that showed a little of her shoulders, a little more mature than her casual clothes, and she was looking at me with surprised eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Isn't this Nikaido-san! What a coincidence, to meet at this place." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Because I was completely out of it, I was a moment too late to switch into feigned naivete mode, but I managed to make up for it with tension.</div><div>I instantly felt a sense of shame at the fact that I was wearing an aquarium T-shirt. It didn't bother me anymore when I was side by side with Rei, but it was much more embarrassing when I was alone. I'm going to be identified as those crazy merry guys.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey Azusa, what's wrong?"</div><div><br /></div><div>From the other side of Nikaido, I heard another familiar voice.</div><div>The people who showed up were Doumoto Ryuuji, Nogi Honoka, and Kakihara Yuusuke, a group of good friends.</div><div>Apparently, they had also come to visit this aquarium.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, it's Shidou. I didn't know you were here too!" (Ryuuji)</div><div>"I was, Doumoto-kun......, you guys seem to be getting along well as usual, don't you." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Come on, it's kind of embarrassing." (Ryuuji)</div><div><br /></div><div>Laughing cheerfully, Domoto scratched his head, looking as if he wasn't completely embarrassed.</div><div>Nogi and Kakihara, who subsequently approached me, also looked surprised at me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"My God! Isn't this Shidou! What a coincidence." (Honoka)</div><div>"I never thought I'd see you here, coincidences are sure scary." (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>I waved hello to Nogi and Kakihara.</div><div>In the meantime, I glanced towards the vending machine that Rei was headed for.</div><div>She was still in front of the vending machine. She's probably wondering what to buy, since she's pacing back and forth in front of several vending machines.</div><div>Nice, keep going. Please don't come back for a while.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But it's fine. I thought Shidou was someone who never bought such goods." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"A-hahaha...... That's not true, I buy kinds of goods, you know? I'm the type of person who buys an Alice band or something when I go to an amusement park." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Heeh? Then maybe we'll hit it off!" (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>We don't have to be. Originally, I'm exactly who you thought I was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;I thought, but I couldn't say it out loud.</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems that they have just arrived at the aquarium, and in a little while they will probably move on.</div><div>I'd like to get through this while trying not to give out any unnecessary information.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Shidou-kun. Since we're here, why don't we take a look around together?" (Azusa)</div><div>"......Huh?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I was muddling through with a proficient smile, Nikaido suddenly made a suggestion that I couldn't believe.</div>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<div>"W-we met here by chance, so I thought why not?" (Azusa)</div><div>"...... Uh." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps sensing that I was stalling in my reply, Kakihara immediately stepped forward.</div><div>He put his hand on Nikaido's shoulder and looked at her and me in turn.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Azusa, Shidou is probably on his way home right now, no?" (Yuusuke)</div><div>"Eh&#8265; Ah, I'm sorry! I mistakenly thought......" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>I smiled at Nikaido, whose face was red, and told her not to worry about it.</div><div>Phew, that's nice, Kakihara.</div><div>As can be expected of the leader of the Normies Army (according to me), you can read the situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry about the invitation. The timing was a little wrong. Besides, if I was to join the four of you, I think I'd get in the way."</div><div>"Tha&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;that's not true! I'd gladly welcome you, Shidou-kun!" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>......What's with this girl?</div><div><br /></div><div>For some reason, she was surprised by her own statement and fiddled with her hair impatiently.</div><div>I don't understand this girl.</div><div><br /></div><div>""...... Azusa, don't be too selfish. I'm sure Shidou is in trouble, right?" (Yuusuke)</div><div><br /></div><div>Once again, Kakihara comes to the rescue.</div><div>But is it just my imagination, or does his expression look somewhat gloomy?</div><div><br /></div><div>(No, it's not my imagination.......)</div><div><br /></div><div>I know what Kakihara's eyes look like.</div><div>It's called jealousy.</div><div>I've had a few experiences with this when I was in elementary school, but this is the first time I've had it directed at me at my age.</div><div>I'm sure Kakihara likes Nikaido.</div><div>So he was jealous of the fact that she had asked me, a man, to go around.</div><div>I was relieved to see his human side, but the situation was not so good.</div><div>If I don't fundamentally make him believe that it's impossible for Nikaido to like me, it could be a problem for the rest of my school life.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;it's unavoidable, then.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry. "She" will be back soon, so I have to go." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eh......?" (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>Nikaido's expression hardened.</div><div>Hey hey, wasn't Kakihara's jealousy just a misunderstanding?</div><div>Why would she do something that smacks of favoritism like this?</div><div><br /></div><div>"Eh&#8265; Shidou, you have a girlfriend&#8265; That's so cool!" (Honoka)</div><div>"Ahaha, I got one pretty recently......." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Do you have a photo of her!? Ah! But I can meet her if I wait here!" (Honoka)</div><div>"No, no! She's a very shy girl, so I think she'd rather not do it......? And, I'd like to have a little longer with her." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Eeh...... Well, if that's the case, I guess it can't be helped." (Honoka)</div><div><br /></div><div>There's no way I can show her to you. The one who was in the position of my girlfriend in this situation is that Otosaki Rei.</div><div>For the time being, Nogi's pursuit had stopped, so I could assume that this was enough to cover.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oh, I see. If that's the case, then I guess we have no choice, Azusa. Let us go quickly." (Yuusuke)</div><div>"......Okay. Shidou-kun, see you later." (Azusa)</div><div><br /></div><div>See you at the school.</div><div>I waved my hand while returning those words.</div><div><br /></div><div>(...... Did I get through it?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I let out a sigh of relief as I watched them go through the route.</div><div>The negativity in Kakihara's eyes had disappeared, and it looks like I made a pretty good choice.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I wonder if Nikaido's attitude was really a sign of affection.</div><div>If so, where did she get her feelings for me?</div><div>The only contact I've had with her was during the cooking class&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, now that I have a girlfriend, there's no need to worry about it.</div><div>I'm sure they wouldn't have made such a big deal about me if they could read the situation, so I can say that my school life has remained peaceful for the time being.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Phew......, by the way, isn't she late?)</div><div><br /></div><div>I think I was talking to them for a while, but Rei hadn't come back yet.</div><div>As soon as I thought so, a sign suddenly appeared right behind me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, is the "girlfriend"...... referring to me by any chance?" (Rei)</div><div>"......You were listening, huh." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Just from the middle. I didn't want to risk getting too close, so I kept a reasonable distance." (Rei)</div><div>"That's a wise decision. Thank you." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I stood up from the bench and Rei, who was standing behind me, made her way around to stand next to me.</div><div>She looked somewhat nervous and peered into my face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry, I took the liberty of pretending you were my girlfriend. I took advantage of you to avoid trouble." (Rintaro)</div><div>"That's okay. I don't mind." (Rei)</div><div>"Haha, I'm glad you didn't laugh at me for being so paranoid....... I'll tell you more about it when we get out of here. I don't want any trouble if they come back at any moment." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Okay. Let's go get some food then." (Rei)</div><div>"Good idea. I'll go with whatever you want to eat." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Then, I want Ramen." (Rei)</div><div>"That's a choice that would make a boy mad......." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I had no reason to refuse, so I accepted, but I had this complicated feeling that I couldn't really describe.</div><div>It's okay. I have decided to go along with Rei all the way today.</div><div>I'm going to ignore all the normal date sense and just go with whatever she wants to eat.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Isn't that...... Otosaki, san?"</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>We went back in front of the station, then we entered a famous ramen chain.</div><div>It is a restaurant that mainly serves pork bone soup, and the noodles are not very plentiful and it seems to be made on the premise of having refills.</div><div>Of course, there is enough flavor to satisfy without having to refill.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Please give me a refill." (Rei)</div><div>"Sure!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Right "next to me", the third refill for the day was taking place.</div><div>I looked at her bowl and saw that there was only the broth without any single trace of noodle.</div><div>The third refill meant that she already had three bowls of ramen in her stomach, but her body was still in perfect shape.</div><div>What the h*ll is wrong with her stomach?</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, are you not going to eat?" (Rei)</div><div>".......I'm going." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>Feeling somewhat defeated, I too sipped my ramen.</div><div>In the end, Rei had four serves and I just had two, and we finished our lunch.</div><div><br /></div><div>The time was 14:30.</div><div>It was still too early to go home.</div><div>However, as a total novice at dating, I can't make any sophisticated suggestions, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, there is a place I want to go." (Rei)</div><div>"Do you?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"Yes. I want you to accompany me." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>If she has somewhere she wants to go, that's great.</div><div>I followed Rei's lead and got into the taxi.</div><div>The trip took over an hour, as we seemed to be going to a very distant place.</div><div>Eventually, we reached the destination she had set, and we got out of the taxi.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm sorry for making you go along with my request, but I really needed to see this place together." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>In front of us was a huge structure.</div><div>I believe it was&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;, yes, the Nippon Budoukan. <b><i>(PTW/N: Budoukan [武道館]: martial arts stadium.)</i></b></div><div>As the name implies, it is a venue used for martial arts tournaments, but it is also a famous venue for live performances by artists.</div><div>"Aim for the Nippon Budoukan".</div><div>Some even work with such words, it indicates how great this facility is.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Why, did you want to see it?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"It is my next goal as an idol to hold a live concert here. And that dream is almost within my reach." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei took a step or two closer to the Budoukan.</div><div><br /></div><div>"People around me have been telling me a lot lately that my expression has become brighter. I'm sure it's all thanks to Rintaro." (Rei)</div><div>"That's not true. I haven't done much." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I knew you would say that. But it's true that it's because of Rintaro. I became unwavering." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>[She's actually smiling a lot more recently, you know?]</b></div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Mia's words pass through my mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>And Rei herself was aware of this.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......It's not that you need to feel indebted to me.&nbsp; I've been having a good time, and if anything...... I've been having a lot of fun lately." (Rintaro)</div><div>"I'm glad. I was a little worried that I was causing too much trouble for Rintaro." (Rei)</div><div>"If I had felt so, I would have cut ties with you long ago. I'm not a very nice person, okay." (Rintaro)</div><div>"Rintaro is kind enough........ Thank you." (Rei)</div><div>"Come on. It's embarrassing." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>No matter what, I'm completely a selfish person.</div><div>Although I admire people who can go out of their way to help others, I don't think I can be that kind of person.</div><div>It is because Rei has paid me well that I am able to go.</div><div>That's why I feel embarrassed when she...... thanks me again.</div><div><br /></div><div>I shook my head and refreshed my emotions.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......Is something, bothering you?" (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>I look up at the Budokan and ask her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Why do you think so?" (Rei)</div><div>"Somehow. It's just that your expression is a bit different than usual." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>After standing here, Rei's expression seemed to be somewhat pensive.</div><div>It wasn't just my imagination.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is there anything I can do to help?" (Rintaro)</div><div>"...... Mm. Maybe, there isn't." (Rei)</div><div>"I see. Well, then I won't enquire thoughtlessly." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>If it's something I can't handle, it's probably better if I don't know about it.</div><div>I can foresee a future where we will both get into trouble.</div><div>It's not a good idea to get involved in everything in this world.</div><div>I only have to do what I can do.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rintaro, will you continue to accompany me?" (Rei)</div><div>"As long as you don't abandon me, I'll always accompany Otosaki Rei. And now, having you eat my food is one of the things I look forward to." (Rintaro)</div><div>"......Mmm." (Rei)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rei looked up with a slightly clearer expression on her face.</div><div>If my words had helped in any way, I was honestly pleased.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Yep..... I'm satisfied. Rintaro, let's go home." (Rei)</div><div>"Is that so. Alright, then, let's go home." (Rintaro)</div><div><br /></div><div>We got into the taxi again and headed back the way we came.</div><div><br /></div><div>Continue to accompany&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;huh.</div><div>I wonder how long I'll be able to stay by Rei's side.</div><div>Until she retires as an idol.</div><div>Until she gets a boyfriend, or.</div><div>Until her relationship with me is discovered.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is no eternity in this world.</div><div><br /></div><div>Having been abandoned by even my own blood family, I knew this fact to the point of disgust.</div>
