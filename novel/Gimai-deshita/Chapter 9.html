Chapter 9: Actually, I Protected My "Stepsister"

One week after the start of the second semester, time progressed into September. It was a few days of slightly cold weather.

I thought I would continue spending lazy days with Akira as usual, but it turned out to be quite fulfilling. We played video games and read manga, but we also studied together.

I felt like this was a remarkable change.

Perhaps it was because school had started, but during our time together, Akira and I began to reveal our respective strengths.

However, Akira, when being lazy, was still the same as always and would come to me to act spoiled.

"Aniki, give me a piggyback ride~"

"Sure. Where does this esteemed guest want to go?"

"Quickly to the bathroom!"

"Understood!"

It was no big deal. I had gotten used to her teasing, and recently, I found myself no longer resisting Akira's clinginess.

"Arrived at the destination."

"Thank you, Aniki. Now, can you help me wash my back?"

"...Let's not talk about that. Consider it a favor from me."

"Ahahaha, I'll call for you once I'm done washing, okay~"

Initially, I did hope that Akira would let her guard down more, but recently, it was actually me who needed to be on guard.

Even so, Akira frequently crossed my defenses and found opportunities to stick to me. It was like playing a video game, employing hit-and-run tactics. Although she actively clung to me, she never went beyond what I could tolerate.

She knew her limits... Although I dare not say it, she maintained a delicate balance.

But habits are truly terrifying. Every time I came back to my senses, Akira was already clinging to me. She was more like a pet dog than a younger sister, but of course, I had no interest in raising a sister.

In any case, I can't let my guard down now and I can't let her discover any vulnerabilities.

I need to be prepared in case she ambushes me at any moment.

I swear in my heart that as her brother, I need to become more proactive.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

However, things always have a turning point.

It was on a Sunday afternoon.

"Ryota, can you come downstairs for a moment~?"

As I was in my room reading a light novel, Aunt Miyuki called me over.

I went downstairs, and to my surprise, Aunt Miyuki... she was with a beautiful girl who looked like an idol.

"How do you like it? This is a friend of mine who works as a fashion stylist. She gave me this outfit..."

"Huh? You're... Akira...?"

"Mmm..."

The true identity of the idol was Akira.

She was wearing a white women's blouse with a wide collar that exposed her collarbone, and a black suspender skirt that reached above her knees.

And although it wasn't very noticeable, she even had light makeup on.

What on earth is this...

"Hehehe, how do I look? Cute, right? I also put on some makeup."

"Huh... Ah... Yes..."

I couldn't help but be dumbfounded. I couldn't find the words to say.

Akira seemed to be feeling the same way. It was probably her first time dressing up like this, and she was just shyly waiting for me to speak.

Um... It's really...

"Well... it's... very..."

"Hmm... It doesn't... suit me, right...?"

"No, I think... it looks really good..."

It took all my strength just to squeeze out that thought.

Cute, beautiful, pitiful, pure... These words were no longer enough to describe her... If I were to say it felt like being struck by an arrow through the heart, would you all understand?

Even I knew it.

My face was already red to the tips of my ears.

"I-I see..."

"Y-Yeah..."

"Oh my, oh my, you two look like a couple going out on their first date."

"Umm...!"

Because Aunt Miyuki said something incredible, both Akira and I almost choked.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

"...."

"...."

We were taking a walk.

Akira and I didn't say a word, just walking along the road.

It was a rare opportunity for us to go out together, thanks to Aunt Miyuki's suggestion. But I was so nervous that I didn't even know where to go.

Akira had a flushed face and walked quietly beside me.

Unintentionally, she kept a greater distance from me than usual. It felt like she was in "good girl mode," but there was something subtle about it, as if it was slightly different.

As her brother, I should be the one to initiate a conversation now, but I couldn't find a topic.

At that moment, Akira grabbed onto my clothes.

"Where should we go...?"

"I haven't decided yet."

"Well, I want to go there..."

"Huh?"

Akira pointed to a trendy-looking café.

There were already a few young couples sitting in the open terrace area.

"Y-yeah, we can go..."

Just in case, I did bring my wallet with me, but I didn't expect to visit a café, so my clothes were practically loungewear.

I regretted not wearing something more appropriate for going out.

"I've wanted to go to that shop before."

"I see. Let's go then."

We entered the café and looked at the menu at the counter.

I felt very uneasy.

I could feel the gaze of others on Akira from behind. Maybe I had become overly sensitive, but the voices saying, "That girl is so cute," "She's so beautiful," echoed in my ears. It made me feel uncomfortable.

I ordered an iced coffee, and Akira ordered a coffee au lait.

Like trying to escape the gaze of others, we moved to a seat in the corner. The inner seats were sofas, while the outer seats were wooden chairs. Naturally, I chose to sit on the outer seat.

But when I was about to sit facing Akira...

"Aniki, over here. Sit here..."

Akira patted the sofa.

She signaled for me to sit next to her, but I hesitated.

But in the end, I followed her suggestion and sat next to her, becoming a pair observing the entire café together.

Then I sipped the cool iced coffee to soothe my throat and told myself to calm down.

At that moment, Akira quietly spoke:

"Aniki, It feels like we're on a date..."

The word "date" that I had been avoiding mentioning made my heart skip a beat.

"W-We're siblings, so it doesn't count as a date, right?"

"That's true, but it just doesn't feel that way..."

...This really won't do.

Every time I feel like I need to maintain my role as her older brother, Akira tries to cross the boundary of siblinghood.

Akira, who is sitting next to me now, and the usual messy Akira at home.

I have witnessed these two sides of her, but I still don't know how to treat her. My mind feels chaotic.

From the time I met Akira until today, this is what I know:

I have come to realize that I am a slow, indecisive, and unreliable man.

Just thinking about it fills me with a vague uneasiness.

"Sigh..."

"Aniki, do you have any worries?"

"I'm thinking that I should pull myself together..."

"What do you mean?"

"I feel like I should become a brother who can protect you properly."

Even now, my heart won't calm down.

Seeing Akira's appearance and her every move severely shakes my heart.

This proves that I still lack the awareness of being a brother.

Do I want to value her and protect her because she is my sister? Or is it because she is a girl...

Even if I ask myself these questions, I won't have an answer.

"You... You don't have to be so troubled to protect me. I may rely on you occasionally, but I can't rely on you forever..."

As a result, Akira developed unnecessary concerns. She's the one I want to protect...

In any case, I can't continue being a slow, indecisive, and unreliable brother. But what should I do?

I hope for a chance for change.

Anything will do. I need a chance.

* * *

And soon, the event that would become the turning point came.

It happened a few days after Akira and I went out together. Kousei was called to the faculty office, so I suddenly had to go home by myself.

Lately, Akira and Hinata often go home together.

I'm afraid of disturbing them, so recently I've been walking home with Kousei. But now that Kousei is not here, I can only go home by myself.

Under this gloomy weather, I walk alone on the way back home.

As I walk, I ponder about Akira.

Recently, she seems to be getting used to school life, so I rarely see her nervous anymore.

Akira mentioned before that thanks to Hinata's help, she feels much better in class now.

As for the rumors about a "beautiful girl transferring to the first grade," they are no longer as hot as before. And I heard that no one has approached Akira since Kousei glared at them the last time.

Overall, considering the current situation, it should be fine for Akira to navigate on her own.

And so, I became completely careless.

When I passed through the ticket gate, the sky was already dark enough to start a rain.

I looked up at the sky next to the roundabout and realized that the weather was not looking good. According to the weather forecast, it seems like it will rain tonight and tomorrow.

Naively, I thought nothing would happen in the evening, so I didn't bring an umbrella. But it's possible that it will start raining soon.

As I gazed at the sky, which seemed like it could burst into tears at any moment, and thought about hurrying back home...

"No! Let go of me!"

"Stop talking and come with me!"

Suddenly, someone ahead shouted loudly.

It was a woman's voice that I recognized and a deep male voice. The urgent voices of both sides intertwined.

"I don't want to! It hurts! Let go of me!"

"Shut up! Get in the car quickly!"

My body instantly started running.

I hurriedly turned a corner.

Soon, I saw Akira and a middle-aged man who didn't seem like a good person over there.

No, they were not just "over there."

The middle-aged man was holding Akira's hand, intending to forcefully pull her into the car parked by the roadside.

The term "suspicious person" quickly flashed through my mind.

And then, my whole body felt as if it was boiling with excitement.

"Akira──────!"

Before I could even think about what I should do, my feet began running.

"Huh? Aniki!"

"Ah? Bro──"

I had lost control of my body.

I felt an intense heat throughout my body, and all the surrounding sounds disappeared.

"Let go of Akira──────!"

Without hesitation, I grabbed the collar of the middle-aged man.

"Who are you...?"

The middle-aged man looked down at me and, at the same time, grabbed my collar with one hand. He was incredibly strong.

His sharp gaze was full of oppression. If we were to fight, I didn't think I could win against him.

But I couldn't back down...

"I am Akira's older brother!"

--Because I am Akira's older brother.

"Aniki...?"

The situation reached a stalemate.

The middle-aged man and I were gripping each other's collars.

"Phew..."

Suddenly, the middle-aged man burst into laughter.

"Dad, Dad! Aniki is also here! Stop it, both of you!"

After Akira spoke, the middle-aged man finally let go of my collar.

"Sorry, sorry. So, you're Akira's brother? I'm Takeishi Ken, Akira's father."

"............Huh?"

I think at that moment, without a doubt, I had the most idiotic expression in the entire universe...

* * *

Takeishi Ken, the non-reputable middle-aged man—correction, Akira's biological father—sat on a park bench with a roof. For some reason, he seemed to be in a good mood.

"But I really didn't expect you to suddenly grab my collar~"

"I'm truly sorry! It was a misunderstanding!"

"I already said it's fine. Because you were just trying to protect Akira."

Even so, I still bowed and apologized. After all, I misunderstood and acted impulsively...

Actually, when I was still on the train...

Akira, who got off the train first, was walking home when she seemed to be approached by a group of thugs.

Their intention was probably to hit on her, but at that moment, Mr. Takeishi appeared.

"Hey, you guys. Do you have any business with my daughter? Huh?"

Mr. Takeishi was originally an actor who specialized in playing gangsters in movies, so he had a completely unfashionable and terrifying gangster style. His gaze was sharp, and he had a strong build. He was so scary that if a child saw him walking down the street, they would cry in fear.

What would happen if someone like him stared at them... Of course, an ordinary person would be scared to death.

As expected, those thugs seemed to have fled with their tails between their legs.

After they left, Akira questioned Mr. Takeishi about why he appeared here, and he explained that he couldn't help but worry about his daughter, so he silently watched over her from a distance.

When he silently looked at Akira and worried about things like "Is the new home okay?" and "Has she been mistreated?", as parents would do, those annoying bugs approached Akira, and that's why he appeared and drove them away.

Then Akira told him, "You don't have to worry about those things" and "I'm fine."

But Mr. Takeishi had already been angered when he saw Akira being harassed by those thugs.

And then he saw Akira's skirt.

"Why is your skirt so short! It's because you're wearing this thing that men approach you!"

He expressed this extreme opinion.

"I'll buy you a new skirt! Get in the car!"

"I don't want to! It hurts! Let go of me!"

"Shut up! Get in the car quickly!"

And then, without thinking, I intervened in their situation, and it seems like that's how things unfolded...

--On second thought, looking at it now, it's really scary. Did I really grab this person's collar...?

Although I was so angry at the time that I lost my senses, now my legs are starting to tremble.

But Akira...

"Father, you're not good! Seriously!"

She mercilessly hit Mr. Takeishi's shoulder with force.

"If you act like that, of course, people will misunderstand, and it could end up badly. Someone might even call the police!"

Mr. Takeishi, upon hearing this, just scratched his head in resignation.

"I also think I made a mistake. Don't blame your dad anymore..."

"In the end, I've always told you, dressing like this easily leads to misunderstandings, right?"

"Ah... Okay, okay, I'm really sorry... It's my fault..."

As his daughter continued to nag without mercy, Mr. Takeishi looked helpless.

"Akira, I'm telling you, it was my fault earlier..."

"Aniki is completely blameless!"

"It's not like that, I intervened without asking first..."

"That's because I didn't stop you..."

"No, you can't blame yourself!"

"And you didn't do anything wrong either!"

As we argued about taking responsibility, a laughter erupted from the scene.

"... Geez, are you two really close?"

"Huh?"

Mr. Takeishi chuckled.

    "Onii-chan, you just did what a brother should do. Don't worry about it."

    "I guess..."

    Although we reconciled, it seemed that Akira had some difficulty accepting it.

    "Don't speak so arrogantly. Dad, you should apologize properly! Otherwise, I won't contact you again!"

    "Ah, alright... Little brother, I'm sorry. I tend to give the wrong impression..."

    Mr. Jian's dejected appearance didn't match his outward demeanor, which was a bit amusing.

    Even though he played a role and had a fierce appearance, in the end, he wasn't a bad person.

    And he wasn't as unbearable as I had imagined. To Akira, he was a good father, or perhaps in front of Akira, he always showed the appearance of a good father.

    "By the way, little brother. You said you're Akira's brother, what's your name?"

    "Ryota Mashima."

    "Ryota Mashima, huh... It's a good name."

    "Huh...? Thank you."

    I didn't know what was good about it, but it felt nice to receive praise.

    "So, you already know that I'm a useless father, just like my appearance, right?"

    "Huh...?"

    "I'm just a third-rate actor, hot-tempered by nature, and in the end, I made Miyuki and Akira sad. I'm so destitute that I shouldn't even have the qualification to continue calling myself her father."

    "But..."

    --That's not true. I couldn't say it firmly.

    The responsibility for tearing the family apart was all on him. It was a self-inflicted wound with no room for sympathy.

    But I always felt that things weren't just like that.

    Although his character wasn't as bad as I had heard, I think this person must be regretting just like Aunt Miyuki, all the way to today. Otherwise, he wouldn't have specially come to check on his daughter's condition.

    Aunt Miyuki said they separated because of different values.

    If that's the case, what are Mr. Jian's values?

    I couldn't find the answer and turned to look at Akira instead.

    I saw Akira staring directly at Mr. Jian, as if she had something to say.

    "Akira, he's a good brother. This guy is undoubtedly a good man. It seems like you have fully integrated into that family, so I can rest assured."
    
    "Yeah, I guess...."
   

    "But this time, it made me reflect on something. That is, I should let the child become independent too."

    Akira let out a puzzled "Huh?".

    "I can't keep interrupting your life. If I'm here, your new dad will also be troubled."

    What is he talking about? What does he want to say?

    "Hey, little brother. Akira might be similar to me, rude and not cute when speaking..."

    That's not true.

    To me, who longed for a brother, having Akira as a brother, he's really a cute guy...

    "--But even so, she is still my precious daughter."

    I know that. After all, I'm the same, whenever it involves Akira, I act impulsively.

    "...So, I entrust her to you in the future, please take care of her..."

    Mr. Jian slowly stood up from the bench, then deeply bowed to me.

    I was momentarily stunned. This might be the first time an adult man has lowered his head to me.

    "So, Akira. If it's with this little brother as her companion, then it's fine."

    "Dad..."

    "Don't let some strange man take her away. Find a good man like this guy. Got it?"

    "Dad...?"

    The words Mr. Jian wanted to express...

    It's as if this lifetime is going to sever ties with Akira.

    "Alright, I'm leaving. You two take care..."

    I can't let him just leave like this. I can't let him leave Akira.

    If I don't say something now, perhaps the rest of my life will be filled with regrets.

    Regrets toward Mr. Jian, regrets toward Akira.

    I have many things I want to say.

    But I don't know where to start.

    Do you know that Akira uses the surname "Himeno" at school?

    Akira still...

    Akira...

    The words I want to say get stuck deep in my throat, making me feel extremely uncomfortable.

    "Dad!"

    Although Akira shouted loudly, Mr. Jian's figure grew smaller and smaller.

    Despite that, Akira and I still couldn't utter a word. We remained frozen in place, without any action. We wanted to chase after him, but we couldn't move.

    Akira and I were aware that we couldn't just watch him leave like this.

    In that case, all I can do is--

    "Huh? Wait... Aniki?"

    --I grabbed Akira's hand and ran to Mr. Jian's side.

    "Mr. Jian!"

    Mr. Jian stopped but didn't say a word, nor did he turn around.

    "I am very happy right now."
    
Standing next to me, Akira let out a surprised "Huh?" but I ignored her and continued speaking:

    "Because of you, Akira was born."

    "Aniki..."

    "The thing I most want to express right now is how happy I am to be able to live with Akira."

    However, this happiness is something only I have obtained.

    "But Akira's happiness, relying solely on me... relying solely on my family, cannot be achieved. No one can replace what she wants..."

    Neither me nor Dad can fulfill Akira's happiness.

    Aunt Miyuki also can't fulfill what Akira wants.

    I believe that without those things, Akira can't truly be happy.

    Actually, I realized this before.

    And today, as an observer, seeing Akira and Mr. Jian, I finally became certain.

    Why Akira keeps her distance from others...

    "You have to continue being Akira's dad for her to be happy!"

    --Because Akira always wanted to be with him.

    More than anyone else, she wanted to stay by Mr. Jian's side...

    "Sorry, I'll be frank. Let's skip the formalities."

    This is what Akira said when I first met her.

    Now that I think about it, she was probably indicating that she couldn't accept anyone other than Mr. Jian.

    "No need. I can read on my own, and I don't want to depend on others."

    I vaguely understand.

    Although she relies on me now, the reason Akira didn't rely on others before must be because she didn't want to cause trouble for them.

    After Mr. Jian left, in order to become independent, she believed she needed to have a strong and stable heart, so she walked this path. But in reality, she's actually quite clingy.

    "At most, I helped Dad wash dishes when I was little..."

    Akira's guard has loosened a lot compared to before.

    But now I know that someone like me can't replace Mr. Jian. I don't think Dad can either.

    "Feels like Dad's back..."

    It's like... in other words, it's ultimately fake. It's not real.

    "--Dad, thank you..."

    Although I'm unwilling, I'm currently so unreliable that I can't provide Akira with what she wants.

    So I don't want her to lose those things.

    "I've always hated my mother for abandoning me. But Akira standing here is different. Even if you live apart, she still really likes you..."

    The things I don't have, the things I long for...

    "You hold such a significant place in Akira's heart. Honestly, I envy that... You have blood ties, family bonds. She relies on you, and from the bottom of my heart..."

    --This is how a family should be.

    So there's only one thing I absolutely have to say--

    "So, Mr. Jian! Please... please don't abandon Akira!"
    
After I finished speaking, Mr. Jian slightly shook his shoulders.

But he remained silent, didn't turn back, and continued walking slowly.

Finally, the rain started to fall, drop by drop, staining the ground.

Just when I thought the damp smell of rain had intensified, it suddenly turned into a heavy downpour.

Our uniforms would get completely soaked.

But Akira and I stood there, hand in hand, motionless.

We silently watched Mr. Jian's retreating figure.

* * *

Afterward, without uttering a word, Akira and I returned home.

Dad and Aunt Miyuki were working, both of them not at home.

I asked Akira to take a shower first, while I took off my drenched uniform and dried my body with a towel.

I didn't know what to say to Akira. Perhaps it was best to say nothing at all.

As a result, even after Akira finished her shower, I was still troubled and confused, and I headed to the bathroom in that state. As I showered, I regretted my actions.

I may have said unnecessary things.

Interfering in matters that didn't concern me, seeking self-satisfaction, and then becoming disgusted with myself...

Today, everything I did seemed to hit a wall. I should go to sleep early on a day like this.

While I was thinking this way, I walked out of the bathroom.

Later, when I was alone in the room, Akira came over.

"Aniki, do you have a moment now?"

"Ah, um..."

I had a vague feeling that she would come.

I got up from the bed and sat upright, and Akira came and sat down on my right side.

"Are you hungry?"

"No, I'm not hungry..."

Then, there was a period of silence between us.

The heavy rain pounded against the window. Although it wasn't at the level of issuing a warning, it felt like a severe storm warning could be issued.

As I listened to the sound of rain quietly, Akira suddenly spoke:

"Aniki, about today..."

Akira struggled to speak, lowering her head.

"I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself..."

"It's okay, it's me... but there's something I want to say to you..."

After saying that, Akira leaned her head against my shoulder.

"Aniki, thank you..."

"Huh?"

"Thank you for saying so much for my sake..."

"No, I... it was just..."

It was just meddling. I did a lot of unnecessary things and said a lot of unnecessary words.

Because I'm her brother... no, now there's no need to use that label anymore.

I just took a leap for a girl named Akira and ended up with nothing.

"Aniki, do you think you were too nosy?"

"Indeed. I felt in my heart that it was for you, but in the end, it was just self-satisfaction."

"That's not true. I've witnessed your kindness."

"I wish it were really like that..."

"And you looked really cool today. I'm glad that you spoke to Dad on my behalf..."

Even those words made me feel pathetic and embarrassed.

In the end, although I had many things I wanted to tell Mr. Jian, the words that came out were only my own thoughts, gratitude, and meddling.

I wasn't speaking on behalf of Akira, I just instinctively said what I wanted to say.

I can imagine that hearing those words would only make things more difficult.

"I'm sorry, there's actually something else I wanted to say, but..."

"I was deeply moved by what you said. You mentioned that you're happy..."

"Mm... let's not talk about it anymore..."

"I feel the same way. I feel fortunate to have you as my brother."

"Mm...! Let's not bring up this matter again, okay?"

"I haven't finished yet. Let me finish."

I couldn't help but feel embarrassed. If there were a hole, I would really want to crawl into it. I knew it myself—I blushed to the point where I wanted to bury myself.

Shame and regret—these two always come together in my situation.

"Aniki, so you knew that I liked Dad?"

"Yeah, I could sense it to some extent..."

"When I thought I was going to be abandoned by Dad again, I felt so lonely, so lonely. At a loss for words, not knowing what to do, you spoke up for me."

"I see..."

"And then, Dad just sent me a message."

"Huh?"

"He said the agency contacted him. He passed the audition from before, and next time, he'll be playing a supporting role in a TV drama."

"Oh, that's impressive. That's great."

"Yeah. He also said that after finishing filming, he wants to have a meal together."

"Huh? You mean..."

"Because you told Dad everything I felt inside, I think he also wants to see me again."

"I see..."

As I let out a sigh and said this, I felt a great sense of relief throughout my body.

What I did wasn't in vain. I let out a deep breath and genuinely felt that everything was going to be fine.

"And then, Aniki. Close your eyes."

"Huh? Why?"

"Don't ask questions."

I closed my eyes. As everything turned black before me, the sound of rain became louder. I could clearly sense the fragrance from Akira, who had just showered, becoming more pronounced.

I could feel Akira's weight shifting towards me.

The bed moved slightly, making a creaking sound, and then Akira's warmth gradually approached.

I hope she won't start rubbing my face randomly again, will she?

Just as I was thinking that, Akira placed her hand on my shoulder, and then--

    "Mmm..."

    I felt a warm, soft sensation near my lips.

    Immediately, I understood that it was Akira's lips.

    I widened my eyes and looked at Akira.

    I saw Akira blushing, pressing her own mouth.

    "Akira, you wouldn't..."

    "Mmm... I kissed you..."

    "Don't say it so casually! What are you doing?"

    "Um... Because I'm happy today, but also a bit angry. And it's just to show something?"

    "What? Angry? Show what?"

    "...I never thought of you as a substitute for Dad, you know."

    "Huh?"

    "You're just my brother. Don't misunderstand that."

    "Got it... Then what was the reason for kissing me just now?"

    "It's... a way to express gratitude?"

    "...Which country's way of expressing is that?"

    Afterward, I chatted with Akira for a while. After she said "goodbye," she walked out of my room with a smile.

    After Akira left, I collapsed onto the bed, staring at the pure white ceiling.

    I am not Mr. Jian's substitute.

    A brother is just a brother... right...
?
    In that case, I must become a brother that Akira can rely on even more...

    The feeling of Akira's lips remained beside mine. My overheated head couldn't cool down.

    It's so warm that I feel like I caught a cold because of the rain.
