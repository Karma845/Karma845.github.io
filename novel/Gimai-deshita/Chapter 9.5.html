<h2>Chapter 9.5: September 8th (Wednesday)</h2>

<p> What should I write?</p>

<p> There are many things I want to write, but I hesitate whether I should write them down,</p>

<p> As a result, I'm just holding the pen, watching time pass bit by bit.</p>

<p> It's already past midnight now, turning into September 9th.</p>

<p> But there are three things that I must write down.</p>

<p> First, I saw Dad today after a long time.</p>

<p> Seeing him unchanged, I felt relieved. He also received a notification for a TV drama, and I'm happy for him.</p>

<p> Second, my Aniki is super cool.</p>

<p> Although he misunderstands and gets angry easily, the problem lies with me and Dad, so there's nothing I can do.</p>

<p> Later, Aniki conveyed my feelings to Dad, and I felt happy about that.</p>

<p> Third, I couldn't help but kiss Aniki...</p>

<p> His entire face turned red, as if he was startled, but his looked cute.</p>

<p> Actually, I originally wanted to kiss him on the lips. But I thought even if Aniki is a good person, he probably wouldn't like it,</p>

<p> So I gave up.</p>

<p> Fourth... I just said three things, but I don't know why, a fourth thing came out.</p>

<p> But this is the most important thing and also the continuation of the third thing.</p>

<p> Living together with Aniki like this, we understand each other a lot, and every day is filled with happiness...</p>

<p> In short, I've fallen in love with my step brother. I see now him as opposite sex.</p>

<p> If someone were to see this, it would probably be troublesome...</p>

<p> (Note)</p>

<p> I have one thing that puzzles me. Why is he so devoted to his family?</p>

<p> If I ask him, will he tell me?</p>

<p> And what is the true meaning of &quot;Mendel's law has no regard for family ties&quot;?</p>

<p> Whenever I occasionally see my Aniki's lonely expression, my chest feels very uncomfortable.</p>

<p> If my Aniki feels lonely, I want to help him.</p>
