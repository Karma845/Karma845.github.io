Chapter 9.5: September 8th (Wednesday)

    What should I write?

    There are many things I want to write, but I hesitate whether I should write them down,

    As a result, I'm just holding the pen, watching time pass bit by bit.

    It's already past midnight now, turning into September 9th.

    But there are three things that I must write down.

    First, I saw Dad today after a long time.

    Seeing him unchanged, I felt relieved. He also received a notification for a TV drama, and I'm happy for him.

    Second, my Aniki is super cool.

    Although he misunderstands and gets angry easily, the problem lies with me and Dad, so there's nothing I can do.

    Later, Aniki conveyed my feelings to Dad, and I felt happy about that.

    Third, I couldn't help but kiss Aniki...

    His entire face turned red, as if he was startled, but his looked cute.

    Actually, I originally wanted to kiss him on the lips. But I thought even if Aniki is a good person, he probably wouldn't like it,

    So I gave up.

    Fourth... I just said three things, but I don't know why, a fourth thing came out.

    But this is the most important thing and also the continuation of the third thing.

    Living together with Aniki like this, we understand each other a lot, and every day is filled with happiness...

    In short, I've fallen in love with my step brother. I see now him as opposite sex.

    If someone were to see this, it would probably be troublesome...

    (Note)

    I have one thing that puzzles me. Why is he so devoted to his family?

    If I ask him, will he tell me?

    And what is the true meaning of "Mendel's law has no regard for family ties"?

    Whenever I occasionally see my Aniki's lonely expression, my chest feels very uncomfortable.

    If my Aniki feels lonely, I want to help him.
