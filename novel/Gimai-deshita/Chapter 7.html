<h2>Chapter 7: Actually, My &quot;Stepsister&quot; Came Home Wearing a Uniform...</h2>

<p>It has been a week since I found out that Akira is my sister.</p>

<p>During this period, I couldn't sleep, and I continued to live a life where I would only fall asleep shortly before sunrise.</p>

<p>And the reason for all this is Akira.</p>

<p>For example, when I'm lying alone in bed reading manga...</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, can I also read manga here?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira would come to my room.</p>

<p>I have no reason to refuse, and besides, this is clearly my room, so it would be strange for me to leave.</p>

<p>So we stay in the room together, but when I lie on the bed...</p>

<p>&quot;Pounce!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! My spine...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira often does things like that, directly leaping onto me.</p>

<p>And then she sticks tightly to my back, which is really awkward.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha, You're so careless, Aniki! By the way, what are you reading~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, can you get down?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah~... the firmness and size are just right... perfect for me~...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? If you're done confirming, can you get down?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huuuh... it's so warm, I feel so sleepy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No sleeping, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It feels like Dad's back...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who do you think is Dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Snore... snore...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't fall asleep...&quot;</p>

<p>If it were my little brother, this innocent feeling would be acceptable, but if it's a sister... if it's a girl, that's a different story. Soft all over, with a pleasant smell, it leaves me at a loss.</p>

<p>In short, the room becomes a space for just the two of us, and now I know it's very dangerous.</p>

<p>So I started spending time in the living room...</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, let's play 'End of the Warrior 2'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright...&quot;</p>

<p>What the heck, playing video games? Just when I started to relax because of that...</p>

<p>&quot;I won again! My winning streak continues!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...!&quot;</p>

<p>--She suddenly hugs me.</p>

<p>I completely don't understand why she would hug the person who lost.</p>

<p>&quot;--I won't marry someone weaker than myself. If you want me, come defeat me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmph...&quot;</p>

<p>Now even Nakazawa's classic line makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;Darn it... let's play again, one more time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, I'll win the next round~&quot;</p>

<p>This feeling has been going on for a week. Akira always finds a chance to cling to me. And she even has physical contact with me. It's not about being close or not anymore.</p>

<p>Although I act the same as usual, I'm always feeling restless inside.</p>

<p>As for the aunt Miyuki who witnessed this scene in the living room--</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my, oh my, your relationship is so good~&quot;</p>

<p>She simplifies things too much.</p>

<p>Come on, it's not just a matter of having a good relationship.</p>

<p>It used to be possible indeed. Because I thought Akira was my little brother, I didn't think too much about it.</p>

<p>But after knowing that she's my sister, I can no longer see her as just a sibling. I'm really troubled about how to handle this sensitive issue.</p>

<p>Aunt Miyuki has that kind of attitude. Even if I go talk to Dad about it, I don't think he'll give me a serious answer.</p>

<p>So I called my senior who has a sister for help--</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Mitsuru. My little brother is actually my sister...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That makes no sense. If your eyes are not working well, go see a doctor. If your head is not working well, go to school. I'm busy, I won't talk to you anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>He hung up on me in an instant.</p>

<p>Lately, Mitsuru has been busy with his part-time job, and I haven't been able to reach him for days. When I finally managed to reach him, this was his attitude. I don't even understand myself, how did we become so close?</p>

<p>I could send a message to Lime, but he would definitely just tell me to talk to Yoko as usual, and then he wouldn't care anymore.</p>

<p>I can't possibly discuss such a sensitive matter with Yoko.</p>

<p>If I were to say to Yoko, &quot;Actually, our stepmother's child is not my little brother but my sister,&quot; how would she react...? She'd probably be dumbfounded.</p>

<p>In short.</p>

<p>As they say, if you care, you lose. I can only try my best not to care.</p>

<p>By the way, will this &quot;training,&quot; as Akira said, continue until I get used to it?</p>

<p>Once I start worrying about this, I can't even sleep at night.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>August 20th.</p>

<p>I woke up around noon this day and came to the living room, but Akira and Aunt Miyuki were not there.</p>

<p>There was a note on the table saying, &quot;We went out for a bit, just the two of us.&quot;</p>

<p>Dad was also not at home in the morning due to work.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm the only one at home now. It's been a while since I had some alone time, and it feels so relaxing.</p>

<p>I'm eating snacks and watching recorded anime, enjoying some brief moments by myself. Around three o'clock, Akira and Aunt Miyuki came back.</p>

<p>&quot;We're back~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome back. Where did you guys go... huh?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I said that, I knew.</p>

<p>I saw Akira standing behind Aunt Miyuki.</p>

<p>Akira was wearing a school uniform. It was the uniform of J&#333;y&#363;ki Academy.</p>

<p>Our school uniform was designed through collaboration between a costume production company responsible for a certain idol group's stage outfits and a long-established uniform manufacturer.</p>

<p>It's considered cute both inside and outside the academy, and some girls even apply for admission just because of the uniform.</p>

<p>How would Akira look in such clothes?</p>

<p>Of course, she would become even cuter.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehehehe. Um, what do you think... Aniki?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... what else can I say... It looks really good, um...&quot;</p>

<p>As I said that, Akira's face turned bright red. Even I started feeling embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;The second semester is about to start, so we went to pick up the uniforms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, um, isn't the skirt too short?&quot;</p>

<p>After Aunt Miyuki said that, Akira had an expression like &quot;here we go again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, this is normal!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But didn't your previous school have skirts below the knees?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's because they had strict regulations. I've always wanted to wear a skirt this short.&quot;</p>

<p>After Aunt Miyuki said that, I also felt that the skirt was a bit short.</p>

<p>In reality, it's about the same length as Yoko's, but maybe because I'm not used to seeing Akira in a skirt, it looks even shorter.</p>

<p>&quot;But with such a short skirt, won't it easily expose too much if the wind blows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It won't just easily expose everything... Aniki, don't you like this length?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! Me?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm telling you, please don't throw this topic at me.</p>

<p>Besides, can we now determine the length of the skirt based on my preferences?</p>

<p>And when did I ever say that I like short skirts? Assuming things from the start isn't really good, although I don't dislike them.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, most students at our school have skirts this short. Even if they're slightly longer, they won't go beyond the knees.&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to support her, but Aunt Miyuki still seemed reluctant to accept it.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>After a while, Akira said she was going to change clothes and went upstairs, so it was just me and Aunt Miyuki in the living room.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, I didn't expect Akira to come back wearing our school uniform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After trying it on, she seemed to really like it and said it's cute, so she decided to wear it back...&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe because I'm already used to the usual Akira, hearing her show interest in cute things surprised me.</p>

<p>&quot;But our school uniform is indeed considered cute by many people. Akira seems to have fallen for it too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... you know...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the way back home just now, the gazes of men around made me uncomfortable...&quot;</p>

<p>It can't be helped because Akira is very cute. Once she wears the uniform, she'll definitely attract more attention.</p>

<p>But Aunt Miyuki, you're also partly responsible for that&mdash;I wanted to say that from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>Today, Aunt Miyuki was dressed entirely for going out, wearing a body-hugging dress that emphasized her curves. She's naturally beautiful, and her figure is beyond words. Wearing such clothes, her impact is extraordinary.</p>

<p>I wonder how many men's hearts she stirred up along the way with her seductive appearance.</p>

<p>And she doesn't even seem aware of it, which is really tactless.</p>

<p>What will happen when this mother with maximum destructive power and the super beautiful girl in a school uniform walk down the street?</p>

<p>I imagine they'll naturally attract the attention of men passing by.</p>

<p>&quot;Will that child be approached by weirdos? It happened several times during junior high.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be accompanying her to and from school during this time, so don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With you around, I feel much more relieved. I've also heard that there have been suspicious individuals lurking around this neighborhood lately...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If there are any suspicious people, I'll scare them off. But considering Akira's personality, even if she doesn't walk with me, she should be fine, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, not necessarily...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be fooled by her appearance; she's actually quite shy. When she's at school, she becomes well-behaved. She's very cautious, and her attitude becomes poor when strangers talk to her...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>The first day I met Akira, she did indeed show a disgusted attitude when I called her.</p>

<p>But what surprised me was Akira's behavior at school.</p>

<p>I thought that even at school, she would be the same as usual, living carefree. But it seems that's not the case.</p>

<p>&quot;The homeroom teacher in junior high was also worried about her. They said she's not sociable, always concerned about her surroundings, and doesn't initiate conversations. So I was really worried when she transferred in the second semester...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true...&quot;</p>

<p>Just as Aunt Miyuki and I were troubled, Akira came downstairs after changing her clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were talking about how the second semester is starting soon.&quot;</p>

<p>I managed to get by with a response that wasn't a lie.</p>

<p>Sensitive topics like this shouldn't be told directly to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhh, Mom, can you teach me how to wear a bra?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Splooosh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're such a child... Aren't you embarrassed to say something like that in front of Ryota?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter to Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>But it matters to me. By the way, Akira. You haven't been wearing them all this time, have you&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, sorry, it's not what Aniki was expecting. I usually wear sports bras. They don't have underwire, and they're very comfortable~&quot;</p>

<p>I see, sports bras. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you don't need to report this kind of thing to me, and I wasn't expecting anything!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha, don't be shy~ Okay, Mom, I'll wait for you upstairs~&quot;</p>

<p>Then there was the sound of footsteps going up the stairs, and I let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&quot;Ryota, I'm sorry, that child is really...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... It's okay... If she doesn't mind, then it's fine...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That child only started thinking about wearing a bra when she entered high school, so after we picked up the uniforms, we also went to a lingerie store.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A... lingerie store...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because she said the ones I bought for her before don't fit anymore. In the end, I only saw her wear her first bra once... I even bought a really cute style for her...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... oh...&quot;</p>

<p>I'm telling you, there's no need to tell this kind of stuff to me.</p>

<p>And I never expected that one day I would hear the term &quot;first bra and lingerie store&quot; from the mouth of an older woman. It's giving me different kind of feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;On another note, I never thought she would want to wear a bra. What kind of change has occurred in her mindset?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... um... I'm not sure either...&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it's not because of me... right?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Evening comes...</p>

<p>I had to start tackling the pile of summer homework I had accumulated, so I stayed in my room diligently writing with my pen.</p>

<p>Summer vacation goes until the 24th of August. Today is the 20th, which means there are only a few days left of summer vacation.</p>

<p>When I think about it, this summer vacation has gone by in an instant.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter moving into this house, spending lazy days with Akira, finding out Akira is my little sister... Well, I shouldn't think about these things while I'm trying to study. They would occupy most of my thoughts.</p>

<p>At that moment, Akira entered the room with the sound of knocking.</p>

<p>&quot;Brother, are you studying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What's up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I brought some snacks and drinks for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. Thank you. Just put them over there.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira placed the tray on the coffee table and took out a manga from the bookshelf, happily munching on the snacks.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Akira?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crunch, crunch... What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you start eating and drinking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I brought them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they're not for you to eat...&quot;</p>

<p>I was completely dumbfounded. I thought she brought them to reward my hard work, but it turns out she wanted to eat them herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I was just teasing you. These are for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then don't start eating them yourself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha, I couldn't resist!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean you couldn't resist, you...&quot;</p>

<p>I temporarily stopped writing and reached out for the snacks.</p>

<p>It had been some time since evening, and I was feeling a little hungry.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Akira, have you finished all your summer homework?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I finished it a long time ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tsk... You're such a diligent person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's your fault for not doing a little bit every day.&quot;</p>

<p>We exchanged smiles.</p>

<p>As we got closer, no matter what, I couldn't help but care about her, so the distance between us right now was just right.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, I'm wearing a bra now. How about that?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira said, placing her right hand on her head and her left hand on her waist, striking a pose.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you ask me how I feel about it, Akira...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you can't see anything like this...&quot;</p>

<p>As she said that, Akira suddenly pulled down the neckline of her T-shirt, intending to show me what was underneath.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... hold on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha, just kidding.&quot;</p>

<p>She might have been serious about it, but it wasn't kind to my heart.</p>

<p>And I really wanted her to stop ambushing me like this... I caught a glimpse... just a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you embarrassed to do something like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well~... I am a little, but just a bit. Because it's for you, big brother, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Does this mean she has already adapted?</p>

<img src="http://pic.wenku8.com/pictures/3/3160/131264/170199.jpg"/>

<p>It seems like she has completely transformed into a little sister, to the point where it doesn't matter if she shows off her body or discusses topics specific to women with me. But I haven't fully adapted yet...</p>

<p>&quot;My friend told me that some people walk around the house wearing their underwear. They say it's because they're family, so they don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's in other people's houses. In our house, it's not allowed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't argue. It's a firm rule.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no idea what kind of emotions I'm holding.</p>

<p>If Akira ever starts walking around in her underwear, I'll seriously scold her.</p>

<p>&quot;The break is over. I'm going to continue doing my homework.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. Then I'll continue reading my manga.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should go back to your own room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. If no one is monitoring you, you might slack off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who do you think I am? I won't slack off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, alright, don't mind me~&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Akira unexpectedly sprawled on my bed and started reading her manga.</p>

<p>I thought she would eventually go back to her own room, so I ignored her. But about an hour later, I heard a comfortable breathing sound behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Akira?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Snore... snore...&quot;</p>

<p>This person really has no idea what kind of emotions I'm holding...</p>

<p>I gently covered Akira with a blanket and dimmed the light.</p>

<p>As I continued working on my homework, relying on the brightness of the desk lamp, I heard a small murmur from behind me:</p>

<p>&quot;...Dad, thank you...&quot;</p>

<p>I pretended not to hear what she said.</p>

<p>To Akira, her father's presence must be so important that he appears in her dreams.</p>

<p>By the time I noticed, it was already morning, and I had fallen asleep leaning on the desk.</p>

<p>When I woke up, Akira was nowhere to be seen, and the blanket I had covered her with was now covering my back.</p>
