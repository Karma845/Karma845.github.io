<h2>Epilogue: Actually, She's my "Step-sister" And the Conclusion that My Brother Came to was...</h2>

<p>  &quot;This is my first time entering Akira's room.</p>

<p>Most of the furniture we moved in with Dad is still in its original place, but there are some girly things and dolls around those furniture.</p>

<p>In my imagination, I thought it would be a messier room, like clothes not put away properly and manga piled up on the table in a disorganized manner.</p>

<p>But it's not like that in reality. The room is very tidy, and you can naturally feel that it's a girl's room.</p>

<p>There is a scent inside. A sweet scent that relaxes people. It's the occasional fragrance that emanates from Akira.</p>

<p>Ironically, the answer has always been next to my room.</p>

<p>If I had seen Akira's room from the beginning, I wouldn't have mistaken her for a younger brother... maybe.</p>

<p>&quot;Although I've already come in, I'm starting to get scared...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? You just came in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I just feel like you're really a girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What did you think I was before?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira complained, &quot;I can't take it anymore,&quot; and jumped into the bed first. Then she slightly lifted the corner of the blanket...</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, come over here quickly...&quot;</p>

<p>She invited me like that. I've been in a nervous state since earlier, and my heart is pounding like a drum.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for intruding...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't an intrusion... it's what you said, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really wished you had told me to 'get lost if you're going to bother me'...&quot;</p>

<p>Sleeping two people in a single bed is really crowded.</p>

<p>We are so close that if either of us moves, we would touch Akira's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'll feel embarrassed. Let's turn off the light...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...When I sleep, I usually turn off the light. I like it completely dark, so be careful not to step on me if you get up to use the bathroom at midnight.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned off the light, and the room instantly became dark.</p>

<p>Once my eyes adjusted, I could see the faint light from the stereo equipment illuminating the room.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, what wind blew today that made you want to sleep with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted to say that if we're going to speak honestly, we should do it under the blanket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like talking about love on a school trip, or that feeling of a pajama party?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... I think I understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I'm an only daughter, I don't have any siblings, right? So, I've always yearned for this kind of thing~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I understand that too. I've also thought about what it would feel like to sleep with a sibling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I wanted to try sleeping with you as brother.&quot;</p>

<p>Although I really wanted to say that I had the same idea, that was referring to the case of a younger brother.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, can I rest my arm on you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? okay...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira grabbed my hand and then snuggled up to me, hugging me like that.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, does this make you nervous?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... so you do get nervous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. That's why you should move away quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Just a little longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to leave in a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know... &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you embarrassed? I mean... holding my hand like this...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I am a little... but I think I can handle it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you're my brother.&quot;</p>

<p>But if I don't say something like this, it feels like my rationality will be blown away...</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, we've pretty much done everything a couple would do, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hugging, kissing, taking a bath together, and now sleeping together like this...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, don't use those misleading words. The hug wasn't initiated by me, the kiss... it wasn't on the lips, and you initiated it. As for the bath... in a certain sense, it was unsuccessful. But now we're really sleeping together...&quot;</p>

<p>I can't imagine any further.</p>

<p>Right now, my rationality is overpowering my instincts. However, if I relax for even a moment, the feeling will completely flip.</p>

<p>&quot;Should we do everything again in order?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I'll stop joking. Let's continue with the previous question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Previous question?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About the person I like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, oh...&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt as if my heart had been squeezed.</p>

<p>&quot;What would you do if I said I liked you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>To be honest, I would be in a difficult situation. This is the only thing... the only boundary that cannot be crossed.</p>

<p>Seeing me genuinely troubled, Akira burst into laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki is really funny!&quot;</p>

<p>Is that a compliment? No, I feel like I'm being teased.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I do like you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you said 'okay,' I already had a hunch. You don't have to say it anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>It's not love-like, but like-like. It means not liking in a romantic way, but liking me as a brother, as family.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, I'm talking about liking between the opposite sexes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm... Akira, you're...&quot;</p>

<p>Easily going against my wishes, my heart started pounding again.</p>

<p>No, actually, it has been pounding since earlier, but now it's even more intense.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't want to make things difficult for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the moment you confessed to me, I was already in a difficult position...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummmm I guess, sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did that on purpose, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Always mischievous. Akira is unmatched in that aspect, especially at times like this.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki values family a lot, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yes. I suppose so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, for now, let me be a sister to you without any blood relation, and in the future, let me be your bride.&quot;</p>

<p>Faced with this sudden proposal, I panicked.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, are you trying to kill me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you just give a death premonition? Like getting into an accident before the wedding, falling seriously ill, or losing your memory.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The last thing you said shouldn't be death... Anyway, forget it.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira couldn't help but giggle and said, &quot;No, really, that's what I want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really... I can't imagine anyone else but my Aniki. If you don't marry me, I might never get married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not possible. Because you... you're beautiful. You're different from me, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would like you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I only have you. Only you know what I'm like at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah... that's true...&quot;</p>

<p>She doesn't talk like a girl, loves snacks and drinks, lazily plays video games and reads manga, and unintentionally falls asleep on the floor with her stomach exposed. She's a sister who has nothing to do with elegance and is more like a younger brother...</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think any man in the world, seeing me at home, would still like me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the world is big...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your words make me sad.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Akira's face was smiling, I genuinely thought that Akira, in that state, was also wonderful.</p>

<p>&quot;What everyone sees is just my surface. Like my appearance...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, appearance is important, but your inner self is not bad...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only you think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...So there must be someone in the world who thinks the same way as I do. Probably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why does it always have to involve the whole world, Aniki? Can't you at least limit it to Japan?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira giggled again.</p>

<p>I know Akira at home and outside.</p>

<p>There may be many things about her that I don't know, but I believe I understand her better than any random person on the street. I value her feelings just as much as anyone else.</p>

<p>&quot;But I feel like you, Aniki, would stop progressing just because we're family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So even if I confess, you wouldn't be able to give me an immediate answer, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Are you saying that you confessed because you think I would hesitate to answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a cunning person. She stirs up other people's hearts like this, while remaining unaffected herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you do this, knowing all that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because if I don't make a mark first, I'm afraid someone else will snatch you away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's impossible. I'm not that popular. Although it's pathetic to say that about myself...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I bet you'll have some absurd misunderstandings in the future and make others misunderstand you. And I think that person would end up falling for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki is really clueless. You make others misunderstand while remaining oblivious and saying things like 'I won't misunderstand anyway,' and then you reject others' feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just a perfect example. You've done so much for me, how could I not fall in love with you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ab-about that...&quot;</p>

<p>-- Right.</p>

<p>Akira's feelings for me started when I misunderstood her as my younger brother.</p>

<p>Akira misunderstood all the actions I took based on that misunderstanding as acts of affection towards her.</p>

<p>As a result, Akira fell in love with me... No, I made her fall in love with me.</p>

<p>Although I misunderstood first and caused others to misunderstand, it can't be resolved with just one misunderstanding.</p>

<p>After all, Akira said she fell in love with me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have truly done something irreversible.</p>

<p>&quot;But if you hadn't misunderstood me as your brother, I wouldn't be the one who likes you the most right now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Meaning, I'm glad you misunderstood, Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Akira...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if we don't have romantic feelings, we're still close family. So I'm happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying this, Akira hugged my hand tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;You say these things without feeling embarrassed... Ah, that's something you said before, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To some extent... Don't you like it this way? Um, then what did you say?&quot;</p>

<p>That was the last part of the conversation we had when we first talked properly on the day we met. Now, we switched positions and continued:</p>

<p>&quot;...I find it difficult...&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, I pondered for a moment, hesitating...</p>

<p>&quot;...When you call me, you don't have to be so formal.&quot;</p>

<p>I spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Then how should I address you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You can call me Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>After a brief silence, our eyes met, and we both burst into laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha! What's with that! You should have said, 'You can call me Ryouta!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki is fine. Don't think you can address me by my name.&quot;</p>

<p>We laughed for a while and then shook hands under the covers.</p>

<p>Akira's hand was still as tender and smooth as before. Like a fragile glassware that might break with a little force.</p>

<p>But unlike before, her hand carried a hint of warmth.</p>

<p>Both of us started feeling embarrassed and involuntarily withdrew our hands, then looked at each other again.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Aniki... Do you really understand my feelings now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since that's the case, it's your turn to talk about your own matters, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My matters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mendel's Law has nothing to do with family relationships... What does that statement actually mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You still remember that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. It left a deep impression on me. The look in your eyes was more desolate than the words you spoke at that time. It was hard to understand whether you were angry, sad, or in pain. It was quite perplexing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>It seems Akira noticed.</p>

<p>But it seems like I still don't know the true meaning of that statement.</p>

<p>...Just say it.</p>

<p>Akira has been honest with me about her thoughts, and I think she has the right to know.</p>

<p>&quot;...I've never told even my dad about this. The only person who knows is Guang Xing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I think my dad should know. He knows, but pretends not to. He probably wants to convince himself that it doesn't matter. After all, my dad has always had the worst luck in his life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by the worst luck...?&quot;</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment whether to put it into words.</p>

<p>Because feelings of disgust would well up alongside the words.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I wished for someone to listen to me. And so, the words seemed to surge from the depths of my heart and spilled out uncontrollably.</p>

<p>&quot;...Because I probably don't share any blood relation with my dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>I came to know about this because of a biology class in middle school. That day, we were being taught about Mendel's Law. If it were an ordinary day, I might have found the class boring, but that day was different...</p>

<p>I gazed at the dim ceiling and slowly recounted what happened to me.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It is said that people with emotional trauma tend to dislike history.</p>

<p>But even though I was abandoned by my mother and had psychological scars, I still loved history class.</p>

<p>If you were to ask me which subject I disliked, I would answer &quot;science.&quot;</p>

<p>How should I put it? Science is not gentle at all. It requires observation, experimentation, and verification. It presents facts mercilessly, without any room for emotional involvement.</p>

<p>That day, too, I was listening to the lecture of the science teacher in boredom.</p>

<p>But one thing caught my interest.</p>

<p>That was blood types.</p>

<p>Before, I simply knew that there were blood types A, B, O, and AB.</p>

<p>But that class taught us that there are actually blood types AO, BO, OO, and AB, and a child's blood type is determined by the blood types of their parents.</p>

<p>As I listened to the teacher, my face turned pale in an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;Teacher, I have a question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Tadaaki, it's rare for you to raise your hand and ask a question. What's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If parents have AB blood types, is it possible for them to have a child with blood type O?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well~... In that case, I can only say the chances are extremely low. There are exceptions, though. After all, the possibility is not zero.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What would that chance be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The teacher doesn't know the exact data.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, it's extremely low?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's very rare.&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, memories from the past suddenly resurfaced...</p>

<p>&quot;That person... said he didn't need a child... so--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ryouta is my child, of course he should be with me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Ryouta--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't give me any excuses! If you want to leave, then leave! And don't ever get close to Ryouta again! Ryouta will be raised by me...&quot;</p>

<p>-- I remembered the conversation between my dad and the person who used to be my mother.</p>

<p>That person, who used to be my mother, was interrupted after saying, &quot;But Ryouta--&quot;. What would have come after that?</p>

<p>I only know one fact: my dad has blood type AB. And I have blood type O. If this were an experiment, then the result... the verification result would be...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, there won't be any exceptions in the test, so you don't need to write it down!&quot;</p>

<p>The teacher told the whole class that they didn't need to remember, but I couldn't forget.</p>

<p>That's why I hated science class. On one hand, they say there might be exceptions, but on the other hand, they don't give you any hope.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>&quot;...That's how it is. The possibility of not sharing any blood relation with my dad is very high. Although it's not zero...&quot;</p>

<p>I said so, forcing a smile, but Akira was speechless. I continued calmly with my &quot;verification.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm probably the child of that person who used to be my mother... the child of her affair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How could that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that man who made my dad wear the cuckold's hat said he didn't want me. The woman I considered my mother listened to him, and as a result, my dad's luck was as bad as drawing the worst fortune...&quot;</p>

<p>I calmly stated my verification, feeling discomfort deep in my throat and heart.</p>

<p>This feeling wasn't hatred or anger. It was regret.</p>

<p>I was deeply dissatisfied. Not being related by blood to my dad made me dissatisfied, and having a blood relation with the person who abandoned me made me dissatisfied...</p>

<p>Mendel's Law had no room for family bonds; it was an irony. Blood relations were utterly boring; it was a rebellion. Having a family bond was what mattered most; it was an ideal.</p>

<p>In the end, I was the one who clung most to the question of blood relation. The parents who gave birth to me knew that we had a blood relation, yet they refused to take me in. The father who raised me knew that we didn't have a blood relation, yet he raised me nonetheless.</p>

<p>...Why did my dad decide to take me in?</p>

<p>I clearly wasn't his biological son, and I was the child of the person he should hate. He could have chosen not to do this...</p>

<p>It was obvious who I should recognize as my father. For me, my father was Taichi Shinzaki... he was my only dad.</p>

<p>&quot;Brother...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You misunderstood... You always misunderstand...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Misunderstood? What did I get wrong...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not the worst luck possible!&quot;</p>

<p>Akira suddenly yelled, startling me.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're really kind, amazing, and handsome. Even though you sometimes say strange things, I like all those qualities about you the most. I also think Uncle raising you like this makes him a really good person! You two are indeed father and son! Otherwise, I wouldn't like you this much!&quot;</p>

<p>Akira seemed to scold me, her tears streaming down in the dim room.</p>

<p>&quot;...Why are you crying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be...because you never cry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I used to cry a lot before...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then cry now! I hate it! Why do I have to... sob...&quot;</p>

<p>Silently, I placed my hand on Akira's head. As I stroked her, she began to sob.</p>

<p>How much time passed after that? Akira suddenly spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I understand why you're so fixated on family...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You long for it, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes. I want to believe that even without a blood relation, we can still be true family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are already a family, so don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Is that so? Then I can rest easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Although I'm not yet...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Haven't we already become a close family? No, you just said we're already close emotionally...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-so let's get married, okay? Let's become a family. I will cherish you forever, and our child too.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira held onto my arm tightly once again.</p>

<p>Her mouth was smiling, but her eyes were serious. I believed she was truly serious.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and then looked into Akira's moist eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;And yet, this still isn't enough. You're really greedy...&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled and caressed Akira's head, bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you scared?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not exactly scared, just unsure of how to explain it to Dad and Aunt Miyuki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as we have a fact, we'll figure out the rest on the spot...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, are you trying to trap me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brother, do you dislike me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you I don't dislike you. That's why I'm troubled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then say it clearly. Say that you like me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I...&quot;</p>

<p>-- Unlike when I thought she was my little brother, it's now about &quot;liking&quot; in a romantic sense.</p>

<p>But if I were to say it now, it feels like something would come to an end. It would be half-hearted to confess with a jumbled thought that I can't even sort out, and it would be disrespectful to Akira, who sincerely faces me...</p>

<p>So I answered her like this:</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean you don't know...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to keep being your brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Then I won't force you anymore. But...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira's face was even closer to mine than before.</p>

<p>Even if I wanted to pull back, her hand held mine tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Since that's the case, what are you going to do next...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... What do you mean...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to do it? Make it a fact...&quot;</p>

<p>She had that mischievous expression, too cunning.</p>

<p>Although she herself was clearly embarrassed, clearly trying to hide her shyness, clearly afraid...</p>

<p>&quot;...Akira, is this really okay? Won't you regret it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmm, I won't regret it. Because it's you...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira still held my hand close to her heart. She pulled my hand towards her.</p>

<p>She had already made up her mind and agreed.</p>

<p>What would come after making up our minds and agreeing? Both Akira and I were well aware.</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p>When I woke up, I noticed that the dark sky outside was starting to thin, and I could hear the chirping of sparrows.</p>

<p>I hadn't slept at all after that.</p>

<p>I looked at Akira sleeping next to me, looking like a child.</p>

<p>Silently, I placed my hand on her head, running my fingers through her hair, gently stroking it. Akira's expression relaxed slightly, looking comfortable.</p>

<p>In the dim morning light, Akira's expression seemed even more radiant and captivating.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira... Actually, I...&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't resist leaning in closer to Akira's ear and telling her what was on my mind at that moment. But she was still in her dream, only showing an expression as if she were itching.</p>

<p>Great. It seems she didn't hear what I said.</p>

<p>She grabbed onto the sleeve of my t-shirt, probably dreaming about something.</p>

<p>I scratched my head, looking at Akira's profile, and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>-- And as a result...</p>

<p>&quot; &quot;We're late, we're late, we're so late&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<p>...It turned out like this.</p>

<p>Akira and I overslept completely and hurriedly left the house.</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p>We finally arrived at school just before being late and then parted ways at the school gate, hastily heading to our respective classrooms.</p>

<p>As I walked into the classroom, the bell rang precisely. Akira must have made it in time too.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morn... good morn...&quot;</p>

<p>Probably because I came running, Hinata, who always wore a sour expression, looked at me with surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Huff... huff... huff... I'm about to vomit...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then go to the bathroom and vomit.&quot;</p>

<p>I also wanted to follow Hinata's suggestion and go to the bathroom, but I managed to suppress the rising feeling in my throat and sat in my seat.</p>

<p>&quot;It's really strange, you almost being late...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I... I'm okay...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... you look pale. What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lack of sleep...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you do to end up sleep-deprived?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I won't tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... well, it doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>After that, the homeroom teacher arrived, and our conversation ended.</p>

<p>Hinata didn't pursue further either.</p>

<p>He remained indifferent as always, and I was somewhat grateful for that.</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p>During lunch break that day.</p>

<p>After finishing my lunch, Hinata, as usual, came to the classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Kouta-senpai, can I bother you for a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually...&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata shook her head from side to side, even her pigtails swayed along.</p>

<p>She seemed a bit nervous and couldn't calm down.</p>

<p>&quot;What's... what's wrong...&quot;</p>

<p>Even when I asked like that, she didn't answer and just kept mumbling.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was something difficult to talk about, but because of her nervousness, her face had been turning red since a while ago. For some reason, I also started feeling nervous.</p>

<p>Anxiety-inducing moments passed, and finally--</p>

<p>&quot;...This is so annoying!&quot;</p>

<p>--Hinata exploded.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hinata! If you have something to say, say it clearly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brother, what do you have to do with this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you come to the second-year classroom every day? What do you want!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to say it now! Look at the situation!&quot;</p>

<p>I never expected that the siblings would erupt into an argument at this moment. I silently looked around.</p>

<p>Everyone, intrigued by this rare quarrel between the handsome brother and beautiful sister, watched eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, both of you calm down a bit...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who do you think caused it!&quot; &quot;Who does Senpai think caused it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! Do you think I caused it!&quot;</p>

<p>I was completely clueless.</p>

<p>My mind spun, and just when I was thinking about joining in the outburst, Hinata glared at me fiercely.</p>

<p>&quot;...Kota, did you forget again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? For-forget what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Food, food! When are you going to treat us!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Right. I completely forgot.</p>

<p>Although things were momentarily settled, I still hadn't thanked them for helping me clean Akira's room.</p>

<p>&quot;Hinata pesters me every day, asking when you'll invite us to eat! You better do something about her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-It's not every day! It's sometimes, sometimes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My point is, you're annoying like that! And you don't have to look for me, just ask him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So-so I came today, didn't I! I said it has nothing to do with my brother, shut up!&quot;</p>

<p>I see. The reason is indeed related to me.</p>

<p>In other words, Hinata kept coming up with excuses to talk to me because she wanted to tell me about that matter.</p>

<p>It seems she couldn't bring herself to say &quot;please treat me&quot; and was waiting for me to remember on my own.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, sorry, there's indeed something like that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm not forcing Senpai! You don't have to treat us, it's fine!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you have to decide on a date right now! Right now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said it has nothing to do with my brother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing you two, it infuriates me! It's so annoying!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hinata, Hinata, calm down... Hinata, calm down too...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who do you think caused it!&quot; &quot;Who does Senpai think caused it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It was my fault. I'm sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>This sibling clash makes me feel like they actually have a good relationship, huh?</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p>After school that day, I went home first, changed clothes, and then went to a casual restaurant with Hinata, Hinata, and Akira, which was a bit far from the school. Of course, this was a token of gratitude and also a way to please the Ueda siblings.</p>

<p>We each ordered our favorite dishes, and soon the table was filled with food. We chatted for a while, enjoying the meal and drinks, and the Ueda siblings' mood completely improved.</p>

<p>As for Akira, she seemed even closer to the two of them than before. However, she still couldn't interact with them in the same way she did at home.</p>

<p>Even so, she still wore a pleasant smile, listening to everyone's conversations.</p>

<p>Take it slow, I hope she can be open-minded like this towards everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;Kota, help me get a drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure. What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can choose for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't regret it afterward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Then, Coke.&quot;</p>

<p>I took Hinata's cup and went to the self-serve beverage area, and Hinata ended up following me.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Senpai Kota. Suddenly asking you to treat us...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no worries. It's my fault anyway, I completely forgot...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Senpai Kota.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah? What's up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you feel like you've changed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? H-Have I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Should I say you've become more mature? It's like... a very composed feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? Although I don't really think so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also think Akira has become more beautiful than before, so I thought something happened at home...&quot;</p>

<p>She's truly Ueda Hinata. Quite perceptive.</p>

<p>&quot;It's unlikely, right? If I had to say, it's just that the distance between her and me has shortened...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! Senpai, are you implying...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah~ No, it's probably not what you're thinking. It's more like we can speak honestly with each other? We're both just burdens to our parents, so we talked about a lot of things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-Is that so...&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata let out a relieved expression, then she transformed into a slightly spoiled look.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Senpai...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to say, it would be nice if we could go out to eat together again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, anytime is fine. Hinata might find it troublesome, but Akira would definitely be happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I didn't mean that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata's face turned as red as fire.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean... how about the two of us going out to eat alone next time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!&quot;</p>

<p>Now even my face is on fire.</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p>I parted ways with the Ueda siblings at the front station of J&#333;y&#363;ki Academy, and Akira and I walked home together.</p>

<p>We passed through the ticket gate at Kasumi Minami Station, walking side by side under the starry sky illuminated by streetlights and moonlight.</p>

<p>At that moment, the back of my hand was pinched. It was Akira, who was walking beside me, doing mischievous things.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, it hurts...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is punishment for leering at Hinata.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What can I do? She invited me to eat...&quot;</p>

<p>At that time, it seemed like Akira saw everything from a distance, and when we boarded the tram, she interrogated me for information.</p>

<p>We considered each other and the people around us and chose to maintain the status quo, being a harmonious brother and sister rather than romantic partners or spouses.</p>

<p>But today, I've been really concerned and don't know if Akira can truly accept it.</p>

<p>&quot;It feels strange to have an ambiguous relationship, but I feel like Brother will ultimately come back to me... Is that just my wish?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you worry about being seen as a convenient woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it's convenient for Brother, then I don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Although it's tempting, it's not enough... By the way, you absolutely can't tell anyone about what you just said, okay? It makes me sound bad...&quot;</p>

<p>After I finished speaking, Akira seemed to think of something and kept giggling.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you laughing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brother, let me ask you. Am I a little brother to you or a little sister? I really hope that you can occasionally remember that I'm actually your little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No need to think about it. I've always seen you as a little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Do you see me as a girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course...&quot;</p>

<p>But on the other hand, Akira still felt like a little brother to me.</p>

<p>Completely defenseless, with a closeness between us like that of a brother and sister...</p>

<p>Sometimes I don't know how to treat her, but we would read manga together, play video games together, and chat about anything and everything...</p>

<p>As long as I'm with her, I feel happy, and my heart gradually fills up.</p>

<p>So I decided not to view this situation with any romantic intentions and not to think in terms of &quot;if Akira were my little brother&quot; or &quot;because Akira is my little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira is just Akira.</p>

<p>She's my one and only precious little sister.</p>

<p>It may sound strange to say such things, but I want to continue cherishing the relationship between me and Akira in the future.</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;Whether you're a little brother or a little sister, I've decided to continue cherishing you. If anything happens, you can always rely on your brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your words make me curious... But let's forget about it &#9472; anyway, what you said this morning made me happy. I'll be satisfied with that for now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did I say this morning on the train?... Did I say anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Don't you remember?&quot;</p>

<p>I thought I had no clue, but...</p>

<p>&quot;You whispered in my ear, 'Actually, I...'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............ Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>My face instantly turned pale.</p>

<p>&quot;You actually said that while I was sleeping. You're so sneaky. Those kinds of things should be said when I'm awake.&quot;</p>

<p>While Akira had a big smile on her face, I was completely flustered.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait... Akira, hold on. Are you saying...&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>It's impossible. Akira shouldn't have been awake at that time. Though she was still asleep, she heard...</p>

<p>In other words...</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I pretended to be asleep at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More precisely, I woke up when you touched my head, and then your face slowly approached, and you said, 'Actually, I...' Brother, can you say what you said at that time again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I really wanted to hug you tightly and shout with excitement... Huh? Brother, what's wrong with you? Don't leave first! Don't abandon me, Brother&#9472;&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<img src="http://pic.wenku8.com/pictures/3/3160/131264/170203.jpg"/>

<p>I'm such an idiot.</p>

<p>Why did I add another embarrassing moment to my history?</p>

<p>I was just playing along with movie and drama scenes, that's all.</p>

<p>...No, no, no, it's outrageous. Too outrageous.</p>

<p>Even if I was feeling hyped after staying up late, doing something like that is way too much.</p>

<p>Of course, it was my honest feelings, but if she woke up, I should've just said it.</p>

<p>And since she heard everything...&#9472;&#9472;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Brother! If you're feeling shy, should I say it all out loud? What you said at that time&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No need to say it! Just forget about it&#9472;&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;Anyway, Akira.</p>

<p>You're not just a non-blood-related little brother.</p>

<p>You're a younger sister.</p>

<p>A girl.</p>

<p>You're just too cute.</p>

<p>You're causing me so much trouble...</p>

<p><p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p></p>

<p> September 17th (Friday)</p>

<p>There are too many things I want to write about these days, and I can't organize my thoughts.</p>

<p>I'll write about them when I remember later.</p>

<p>For now, I'll write down one thing, and that is the sweet words Brother said to me.</p>

<p>...Although I really want to write about it, I actually didn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Because I had just woken up at that time and only felt my ears tickling.</p>

<p>So I didn't hear what came after &quot;Actually, I...&quot;. Such a shame...</p>

<p>But when I set a trap to trick him, he blushed and left me behind.</p>

<p>Hehehe. In other words, it was something embarrassing to say?</p>

<p>I wonder what came after &quot;Actually, I...?&quot; I can't help but fantasize and giggle foolishly!</p>

<p>I'll definitely make Brother say it again!</p>

<p>Be ready, Aniki!</p>
