<h2>Chapter 8: Actually, My &quot;Stepsister&quot; will be Attending the Same High School as me...&quot;</h2>

<p>Summer vacation is over, and today is the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>I hurriedly stuffed the homework I finished last night into my backpack and changed into my uniform.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I wore my uniform, thanks to Aunt Miyuki's help in taking it for dry cleaning. There's not a single wrinkle. My shirt, which was already worn out from washing, now seems to have been ironed with a hot iron and looks as clean as new clothes. It feels very comfortable to wear.</p>

<p>It's just past seven o'clock now.</p>

<p>I went downstairs and saw Akira already sitting at the dining table, watching the news on TV and eating breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Akira. What time did you wake up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Around five o'clock, I was too nervous, so I woke up...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. It's your first day going to school. Are you all prepared?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm... yeah, Aniki, you should have breakfast too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right. By the way, where's Aunt Miyuki?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mom said she had a photo shoot early in the morning, so she left first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Then we should lock the door properly.&quot;</p>

<p>I sat across from Akira.</p>

<p>There was salad, scrambled eggs, and fried sausages on the table. Aunt Miyuki must have prepared them for us before she left.</p>

<p>While the toast was toasting, I boiled water in the electric kettle and poured hot water into a bowl of instant soup and a cup of instant coffee. Soon, the toasted bread turned golden brown and popped out of the toaster.</p>

<p>&quot;Itadakimasu.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't used to say this before meals, but after this past month, it has become a habit.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... I feel so nervous...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're already nervous even before reaching the school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because it's my first time transferring schools. I have to introduce myself in front of everyone at the beginning...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha, that's just a tradition. Well, remember to practice smiling, at least during self-introductions and greetings.&quot;</p>

<p>I emphasized the part about &quot;smiling.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira is shy by nature, so Aunt Miyuki was worried that she wouldn't be able to smoothly integrate into the new school after transferring.</p>

<p>Akira seemed to be worried too. She has been restless and unable to calm down since the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>I already practiced how to greet people on her first day of transferring yesterday, so it's up to her now.</p>

<p>I told her, &quot;Good luck,&quot; but all I got in return was a somewhat unreliable &quot;Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>As her older brother, I'm a little worried.</p>

<p>If something happens... No, I hope nothing happens. Let's pray that everything goes well.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After finishing breakfast, Akira and I closed the windows, locked the door, and left home together.</p>

<p>We chatted about unrelated topics as we headed towards the train station.</p>

<p>It takes about five minutes to walk from home to the Arisuminami Station. After taking the train for about ten minutes, we would arrive at the Jochi Gakuen-mae Station. From there, it's another five-minute walk to Jochi Gakuen.</p>

<p>From the moment we arrived at the platform of Arisuminami Station, Akira suddenly became quiet.</p>

<p>I observed her with confusion and realized that it was because she saw people wearing the same uniform. She became restless and kept stealing glances at those people.</p>

<p>It seems she has entered the &quot;well-behaved&quot; mode.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to nervousness and anxiety, Akira has been clinging to my sleeve since a while ago.</p>

<p>She is no longer the lively younger sister who would casually call me &quot;Aniki&quot; while playing video games. Now she appears pure, dignified, and shy.</p>

<p>I may be too reckless, but seeing her like this, I feel my heart beating faster.</p>

<p>I stepped into the train that arrived and stood next to Akira.</p>

<p>When the train passed one station, Akira's head gently bumped against my chest. And then...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... it's okay, just follow the practice, just like in the practice...&quot;</p>

<p>I heard Akira murmuring softly.</p>

<p>She rested her head on my chest like that, relieving her tension.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm, I'm fine. As long as I keep doing this...&quot;</p>

<p>Whenever the train swayed, Akira's head would lightly bump against my chest. It tickled my chest a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm. So, just maintain this for a little while longer... I'm recharging...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I your charger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm... because as long as I'm with Aniki, I'll have full energy...&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of relationship must we appear to others?</p>

<p>Feeling shy, I shifted my gaze to the advertisements inside the train car.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but worry if she could hear my heartbeat.</p>

<p>When we reached the ticket gate at Jochi Gakuen-mae Station, Akira finally let go.</p>

<p>As we got closer to the school, more and more students were heading there.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, you're walking too fast...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira was wearing loafers instead of her usual sneakers. She and Aunt Miyuki bought them two days ago at the shopping mall.</p>

<p>&quot;These loafers are so hard to walk in...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get used to them gradually. It might be a headache at first, but once you get used to it, it'll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like how I stick to you and make you get used to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't bring up that topic once we step out of the house...&quot;</p>

<p>Besides, I haven't gotten used to it yet.</p>

<p>&quot;My ankle is starting to hurt a bit...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're almost there, endure a little longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm, I'll do my best...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, why are you wearing loafers? It wouldn't make a difference if you wore sneakers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because loafers look absolutely great with this uniform...&quot;</p>

<p>After she said that, I noticed that there were indeed very few girls around wearing sneakers.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah... you look really nice in them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if I look at her again, I still think Akira looks great in this uniform.</p>

<p>Just by changing clothes, she transforms so much. It's surprising, but walking alongside such an adorable sister, I'm also amazed at myself.</p>

<p>Is it the same feeling I have when walking with Kousei and Hinata?</p>

<p>Just as I was thinking that, I saw a familiar blond guy and a girl with a ponytail walking a little distance ahead on the road.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see someone I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's the people I mentioned before, the ones who helped you clean your room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Shall we go say hello?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>However, she still clung tightly to my back. She must be very nervous.</p>

<p>&quot;Kousei, Hinata, good morning.&quot;</p>

<p>I quietly greeted them from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Ry... Ta--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ryuta-gaku... cho--&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as the Ueda siblings turned around and saw me, they both froze in place.</p>

<p>To be precise, they froze upon seeing Akira hiding behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha... it feels like it's been a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, uh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>It feels really awkward.</p>

<p>Hinata's expression seems a bit gloomy, and Kousei also acts strangely, displaying an unprecedented awkwardness.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right, let me introduce her. Come, Akira.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Hino Akira...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira lowered her head and bowed.</p>

<p>--Let me add a little explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Hino&quot; is Akira's surname on her official registration.</p>

<p>As for Aunt Miyuki, after marrying my dad, she moved into his family register. In other words, she is now &quot;Majima Miyuki.&quot;</p>

<p>But only Akira remains under her biological father's family register.</p>

<p>I always thought that after remarriage, the child's registration would change along with the parents, but it seems things are not that simple. I found out about this a few days ago but didn't inquire about the details.</p>

<p>It's just that I heard Akira decided to introduce herself with her original surname &quot;Hino&quot; when she heard that her surname might change to &quot;Majima.&quot;</p>

<p>Dad and the others didn't hear the reason behind it, they only heard Akira say, &quot;I want to maintain the status quo.&quot; I think it must be related to her fondness for her biological father.</p>

<p>I didn't delve into the details of that matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, &quot;Hino Akira&quot;...</p>

<p>Maybe it's because her surname contains the character &quot;&#23020;&quot; that instantly adds a feminine touch to the girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh~... So this is Hino-san.&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei awkwardly looked at me and Akira in turns.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Ueda Kousei. He looks handsome, but he's actually a really sorry guy--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;--And this is Hinata. She's Kousei's sister, also a first-year like you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira greeted with embarrassment, bowing her head.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what's the relationship between Hino-san and Ryouta-senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right! She's my little sister. She's the child of my dad's remarriage partner, whom I mentioned before.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, the Ueda siblings couldn't help but exchange puzzled glances.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Isn't she your younger brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahahaha... Actually, she's not a brother, but a sister...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei and Hinata were so astonished that their eyes narrowed into small dots.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I kept the bath incident a secret and roughly explained the situation to the Ueda siblings in front of the school gate at Yuuki Academy.</p>

<p>&quot;I see... You really are an idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei scolded me like that in the end.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh well, so she's your sister after all!&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata quickly accepted it... thankfully she wasn't dumbfounded.</p>

<p>During the explanation, Akira never spoke up. She just kept looking at us in turns, appearing quite uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;You're pretty unlucky too, huh? Having to live with this idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you have no right to say that about me. You useless brother.&quot;</p>

<p>Although I lightly complained about Kousei, his impression hit the mark, leaving me feeling frustrated.</p>

<p>Akira, on the other hand, had a complex expression on her face. It seemed like she had something she wanted to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, the time...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? We still have some time before the ceremony starts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not that, I have to go to the faculty office, so...&quot;</p>

<p>I see. Did she mention going to the faculty office before?</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, in that case, I can take you to the office.&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata said with a smile, but Akira seemed a bit unsure.</p>

<p>This might be an opportunity for her to make friends with girls in the same grade.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, why don't you go with Hinata?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hinata, can I ask you a favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure... Um, can I call you 'Akira-chan'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just Akira is fine... Adding 'Chan' feels uncomfortable to me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great! Nice to meet you, Akira.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>The two beautiful girls took a step towards a friendly first encounter.</p>

<img src="http://pic.wenku8.com/pictures/3/3160/131264/170200.jpg"/>

<p>But when the two beautiful girls walked together, they became even more eye-catching, and the surrounding students looked at them as if saying something. The boys had lecherous expressions on their faces, while the girls who saw Akira, who could be described as a beautiful boy, excitedly asked, &quot;Who is she?&quot;</p>

<p>I watched as they headed towards the shoe lockers in Kawadou, with Kousei and me following slowly from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, did you really think that girl was your younger brother and let it go for three weeks?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I always thought you were a slow guy, but I didn't expect you to be this slow...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So how did you realize she was your sister?&quot;</p>

<p>Even though it was Kousei asking, I still couldn't bring myself to mention the bathing incident.</p>

<p>&quot;It... It just happened by chance. That's why I called you, asking how to treat my sister...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So that phone call meant that? I thought the heat fried your brain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't stand you. You're not worth being friends with...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But regardless, I plan to leave it to Hinata to handle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just like you. No wonder I'm afraid to consult with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei had a thoroughly fed-up expression, but quickly returned to his usual grumpy face.</p>

<p>&quot;So, your sister... is her name Akira? Is she the same at home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, surprisingly she's...&quot;</p>

<p>After briefly explaining to Kousei what Akira is like at home, he sighed and said with deep emotion, &quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, with Hinata by her side, it should be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really thankful for her... I'm glad I met you guys this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>As we were talking, Kousei, who was walking beside me, stopped before entering Kawadou.</p>

<p>&quot;But your sister is really cute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You never praise people, so I didn't expect you to praise Akira now. You wouldn't happen to...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that. I was just thinking, do you have feelings for her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Don't talk nonsense. Akira is just my sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's good. But Ryouta, you haven't forgotten about 'Mendel's Law,' have you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't forgotten...&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei and I have been friends since middle school, and he's the only person who knows my secret.</p>

<p>There's no sense of kinship in Mendel's Law... He knows the true meaning behind that statement.</p>

<p>So I understand what Kousei wants to say. He wants to say that if something were to happen between me and Akira, it would hurt our dad and the others.</p>

<p>But he's worrying too much.</p>

<p>I'm different from &quot;that woman.&quot;</p>

<p>An individual's nature isn't determined by genetics, so I will never let my family be unhappy.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's my fault. I shouldn't have brought up this topic. Don't make such a scary expression.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't. Are you worried about me? Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>After I finished speaking, Kousei extended his arm and placed it on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;But let's not talk about that now. Did you forget something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What did I forget?&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei stared at me after hearing my response.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's time for lunch. When we were helping you clean your room, didn't you say you'd treat us next time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, I completely forgot...&quot;</p>

<p>I completely disregarded it, but Kousei remembered, which surprised me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be busy with my part-time job for a while, so why don't you treat Hinata? Invite her for a meal next time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not a good idea...&quot;</p>

<p>It would be too awkward to have a meal alone with Hinata.</p>

<p>&quot;She's been waiting for you to contact her throughout the whole summer vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're talking about Hinata? Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... So don't just focus on your sister all the time. Pay attention to my sister too.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Kousei left me behind and walked ahead.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Kousei isn't usually talkative. It feels like he's in a chatty mood today.</p>

<p>Pay attention to my sister too... Is that so?</p>

<p>I don't have much confidence in taking care of such a clever girl.</p>

<p>But maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go out for a meal with Akira and Hinata next time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The topic of the transfer student, a beautiful girl, quickly spread.</p>

<p>During lunch break, while Kousei and I were eating our boxed lunches, we overheard some boys in our class talking: &quot;Her last name seems to be Hino.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your sister is quite popular.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, because she's my sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your arrogant face is so annoying... Although I don't really care, shouldn't you do something about it? The guys might have already surrounded her, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sigh, I do care, actually...&quot;</p>

<p>Since the news reached the second grade, perhaps not only the first grade but also the third grade already knew... I heard that some senpai in the third grade are hard to deal with...</p>

<p>&quot;If you care, go check it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to go alone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a girl, it's such a hassle...&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly stuffed the lunch into my mouth and forcibly dragged Kousei, who didn't want to go, up one floor.</p>

<p>After going upstairs, we turned right and looked at the corridor ahead. We could see people coming and going only in front of a certain classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;That seems to be the place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And unfortunately, it's Hinata's class...&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that Akira and Hinata are in the same class.</p>

<p>The boys were all eager to catch a glimpse of the transfer student. Kousei and I squeezed through the crowd and arrived in front of the classroom.</p>

<p>When we looked inside the classroom, a circle of girls had formed around a certain spot, while boys sporadically sat around, staring at the seat by the window. We couldn't see the center of the circle from here.</p>

<p>&quot;They must be in there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it seems like Hinata got dragged into it too.&quot;</p>

<p>Our expectations were soon realized. One of the taller girls moved a bit, and through the gap in the crowd, we caught a glimpse of Akira and Hinata's faces.</p>

<p>Akira seemed a bit embarrassed, lowering her head. I guess everyone bombarded her with questions, leaving her unsure how to respond.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hinata was helping Akira from the side. She really is a good girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Your sister is popular among girls too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that at her previous school, she was confessed to by girls.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember her complaining before that being liked by girls was even more troublesome than being liked by boys.</p>

<p>&quot;But judging by her appearance, boys probably won't be able to get close to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, anyway, it should be fine. Let's go back to the classroom.&quot;</p>

<p>As we turned around, a girl noticed Kousei.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Hinata, Kousei-senpai is here! Oh my, he's so handsome!&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, the human wall parted, and both Hinata and Akira looked in our direction.</p>

<p>Then, in the next second, Akira suddenly rushed out from the crowd.</p>

<p>She walked straight towards me and grabbed my left hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Akira?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um...!&quot;</p>

<p>Akira looked up at me with teary eyes.</p>

<p>I quickly looked around. The classroom and corridor, which had been filled with noise just a moment ago, suddenly fell silent. Everyone was looking at me standing in front of Akira.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was extremely awkward.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, everyone. I'm Akira's older brother...&quot;</p>

<p>I forced a smile and scratched my head, but everyone's faces displayed question marks.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I brought Akira to the deserted area behind the school building, and then I heard a loud sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Aniki. I...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira seemed to be very concerned about the unnecessary attention I received.</p>

<p>It's true that attracting attention is not pleasant.</p>

<p>But when I thought about how Akira had been enduring such gazes all along, I couldn't blame her.</p>

<p>Right now, Ueda siblings should be in the classroom helping with the aftermath. It should be fine to leave it unattended for a short time.</p>

<p>&quot;But it turned out just as I expected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew that a beautiful transfer student like you wouldn't go unnoticed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't tease me...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira made a truly disgusted expression and frequently rubbed her left arm.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, the news spread to our class. I guessed that you must be troubled by it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you here to save me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? W-well, sort of...&quot;</p>

<p>The way she said it feels a bit strange.</p>

<p>In terms of the result, I did save her, but if I had to put it into words, &quot;concerned&quot; would be more accurate.</p>

<p>However, to put it differently, the situation at that time had become so urgent for Akira that she hoped someone would come to her rescue.</p>

<p>A beautiful girl with a shy personality... It doesn't seem like a very good combination.</p>

<p>If I were to say to her now, &quot;You're a heartthrob on your first day of transfer, that's amazing,&quot; it would only sound like I'm mocking her.</p>

<p>So I choose to say this:</p>

<p>&quot;After some time, things should settle down. But when you feel troubled, you can rely on me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, because I'm your big brother.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, although hesitating a bit, I finally placed my hand on Akira's head.</p>

<p>In the past, when I was sad or upset, Dad would pat my head like this. As he patted me, the uneasiness and anguish would inexplicably fade away. For me, Dad's hand was a magical hand.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether Dad had the ability to perform magic on me, I stroked Akira's head. Though she complained, &quot;It's so embarrassing,&quot; she gradually showed a smile.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, her hair is fluffy and nice to touch. It makes me want to keep stroking it.</p>

<p>Even though I feel like it's a bit childish, Akira silently allowed me to stroke her head until my hand withdrew.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehehe, Aniki, thank you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Feeling better?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mhmm!&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, the preparatory bell rang, and we returned to the school building.</p>

<p>As I watched Akira's figure, I still felt a bit worried, but she should be fine based on her appearance.</p>

<p>However, this state might continue for some time.</p>

<p>Although I don't want her to rely on me in this manner, I'll ask Hinata to take care of Akira a bit more later.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>When I returned to the classroom, Kousei sat in his seat with his usual gloomy face.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you and your sister run off to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you phrase it differently...&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei seemed a bit displeased.</p>

<p>&quot;After you guys left, Hinata had a hard time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't it your fault?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I found it troublesome, so I came back to the classroom... And just now, Hinata sent me a LIME message, saying that everyone kept asking about your relationship with your sister, wanting to get to the bottom of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, I feel sorry for her...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She already told everyone that you're siblings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm truly grateful... I'll thank her later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter, leave your sister to Hinata.&quot;</p>

<p>I thought he would just push everything onto Hinata as usual, but it doesn't seem to be entirely the case.</p>

<p>I can vaguely sense from Kousei's words that he trusts Hinata.</p>

<p>Although he's a guy who often wears a gloomy face and acts carefree, he actually has a gentle personality and values his relationships. He won't look down on or despise others without reason. That's why our relationship has lasted until now.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Kousei. Are you angry or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're annoying.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though we have a long-standing friendship, I still can't quite understand this guy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;There have been suspicious individuals around the school recently. Girls, in particular, should be careful about their safety and try to travel in groups when going to and from school.&quot;</p>

<p>The class meeting, mixed with lengthy lectures, seemed to stretch on indefinitely even after the bell rang, but it finally came to an end, and we were finally released.</p>

<p>Kousei and I left the classroom together.</p>

<p>Our route home was the same until halfway, so today we had planned to walk together with Akira and Hinata.</p>

<p>Akira and Hinata should already be waiting for us in front of the agreed-upon school gate.</p>

<p>The school gate was visible from the Kawadoh.</p>

<p>However, as we approached the gate, we saw a group of people gathered there, and a sense of foreboding arose in our hearts, so we hurried over.</p>

<p>As expected, Akira and Hinata were surrounded by male third-year students. They were probably the troublesome senpai that the rumors were about.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell us your names. Ah, should we exchange contact information?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, do you have a boyfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this girl here is so cute!&quot;</p>

<p>Hinata and Akira wore expressions of distress, leaning against the pillar of the gate without saying a word.</p>

<p>I spoke up from behind the third-year students:</p>

<p>&quot;Um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What's a second-year doing?,&quot; one of the seniors asked.</p>

<p>&quot;These two are with me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh~... So what?&quot;</p>

<p>The senpai retorted, and I didn't know how to respond. I wanted to go home with the two of them, so I asked, &quot;Can you let them go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand what you're mumbling about~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While we're talking to them, can you not interfere?&quot;</p>

<p>I instantly felt the anger rushing to my head, but in front of Akira and Hinata, I managed to calm myself down.</p>

<p>Just as I was contemplating what to do...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, third-years. Move aside.&quot;</p>

<p>Kousei caught up to me and said in a low voice, glaring angrily at the third-year students.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... this guy is Ueda from the second-year...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, let's go...&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Kousei, the third-year students trembled in fear and ran away like they were being chased.</p>

<p>&quot;...Seriously, Hinata. Haven't I told you before? If those kinds of guys come to bother you, just drive them away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... but they are senpai, and they're scary...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't need to be afraid of that kind of trash.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira seemed frightened too, her eyes welling up with tears as she came to my side and grabbed the left sleeve of my uniform.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you scared?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mhmm...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right now.&quot;</p>

<p>I placed my hand on Akira's head like earlier at noon.</p>

<p>She seemed to let out a sigh of relief and showed a dependent expression. I felt like she would hug me in the next second, but no matter how bold she was, she didn't seem to have the courage to hug someone in public.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, let's go home now...&quot;</p>

<p>I said, looking at the Ueda siblings. Kousei frowned, and Hinata tightly pursed her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong with you guys?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing...&quot;</p>

<p>Their voices overlapped, perfectly timed to be frightening.</p>

<p>Should I say, as expected? The bond between these siblings might be strong.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we chatted casually as we walked on the way home.</p>

<p>Akira didn't say a word, she just held onto my sleeve and walked.</p>

<p>Kousei still had that sour expression, and even Hinata wasn't as talkative as usual, which worried me.</p>
