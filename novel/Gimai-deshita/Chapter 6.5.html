<h2>Stage-Sub: The Glorious Path of My Master</h2>
<p>I never believed in gods until I met my master.</p>
<p>Ouga Vellett-sama.</p>
<p>He embodies &#8220;justice&#8221; as if it were his very essence, rescuing me from the depths of despair.</p>
<p>His character is vast, with the dignity of a strong individual and an unwavering desire for improvement, making him an exceptional and deserving master.</p>
<p>But what I admire most is his strong and resilient spirit.</p>
<p>Lord Ouga carries a huge burden â€“ the lack of magical aptitude.</p>
<p>For a young boy, it would be a despair too immense to bear.</p>
<p>However, Lord Ouga didn&#8217;t break; instead, he rose to the challenge. He ran fearlessly towards an endless goal, carving out his own future.</p>
<p>Now I understand the reason Lord Ouga chose me.</p>

<p>Because he himself has experienced the depths of despair, he extends his hand to fallen individuals like me and Aliban.</p>
<p>He can surely empathize, for he possesses a kind heart that cannot turn a blind eye to those who have lost their way.</p>
<p>Thanks to Lord Ouga, I now lead a meaningful life every day.</p>
<p>Just being called &#8220;my knight&#8221; and &#8220;my sword&#8221; by Lord Ouga fills my heart with joy.</p>
<p>Lord Ouga will undoubtedly continue his splendid path as a true king.</p>
<p>So, I shall stand as your sword, cutting down all obstacles that come your way.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord Ouga, thank you.</p>
<p>It is thanks to you that my life has been revived.</p>
<p>I swear, until this flame extinguishes, I shall serve you, Lord Ouga.</p>
<p>Now then, it&#8217;s about time I go to Mio&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Together with her and the orphaned children, we will offer our prayers to Lord Ouga today.</p>
