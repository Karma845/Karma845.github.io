Chapter 6.5: August 12th (Thursday)

Today, I talked to him.

Aniki does seem to mind.

He thinks that since I'm not a little brother but a little sister, it's hard to be the same as before.

I feel like Aniki has started to keep his distance from me. It makes me a little sad...

If possible, I want him to treat me the way he used to, like a little brother.

But I also want him to see me as a girl...

What should I do to make it right?

Aniki cares a lot that I'm a girl.

I also see him as a boy.

I hate it. You're so cunning.

You clearly said that you were happy that I opened up to you.

You clearly said that you wanted to shorten the distance between us, but now you suddenly have this attitude. It's too cunning...

Aniki, don't hide from me...

You're the first person who has made me feel this way...
