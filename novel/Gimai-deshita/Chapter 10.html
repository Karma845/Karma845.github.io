Chapter 10: Actually, My "Step-sister's" Appearance Has Been a Bit Strange Lately...

    As September reached its halfway point and the temperature difference between day and night widened, I began to worry about what to wear.

    It's still a while before the change of seasons, but our school doesn't fuss too much about the uniform. If it feels cold, wear a blazer, and if it feels hot, take it off.

    Starting from the second semester, both Akira and I have been wearing blazers to school. But now, on the way from the station to the school, there isn't a single student wearing the summer uniform anymore.

    "We've completely entered autumn, huh?"

    "Y-Yeah... you're right."

    "Everyone is wearing blazers just like us."

    "I guess it's because it's getting cold... right?"

    "Umm, Akira... can I ask you something?"

    "What is it?"

    "Why are you acting so strange early in the morning?"

    "Huh? What are you talking about?"

    "I mean, your way of speaking..."

    "Um... I don't understand what you're talking about."

    Akira has been acting strange lately. Maybe not just recently, but overall, something is off. And it's an oddness that doesn't make me laugh.

    It's the same now. Her way of speaking is driving me crazy.

    "What's wrong? Onii... Onii-chan? I'm the same as usual."

    "...Stop talking nonsense. Why are you forcefully changing your way of speaking? And your tone is higher than usual."

    After I finished speaking, Akira let out a big sigh and said, "Ahh~."

    "Lately, you seem to get along well with Hinata, right? You talk more with her than when you're with me."

    Suddenly, she returned to her normal self.

    "...Go on."

    "Onii-chan, do you secretly wish you could date a girl like Hinata? That would be nice, right?"

    "Oh? Why would you think that?"

    "Because... she has a girlish charm, and her actions are cute, right?"

    "What does that have to do with you changing your way of speaking?"

    "Because I realized that Onii-chan completely ignores me. As your sister, I feel lonely..."

    "I see..."

    I was originally worried that her behavior was due to stress or other factors, but now that I hear it's not the case, I feel relieved.

    However, I can't deny that she got it completely wrong.

    Date Hinata? Even if the heavens and earth were reversed, that kind of thing wouldn't happen.

    "Akira, let me tell you, you completely misunderstood."

    "What did I misunderstand?"

    "I've always talked to Hinata a lot. She is Kousei's sister, and I've known her for four years now."

    "So you're not interested in her?"

    "............Yeah."

    "What was with that pause!"
    
    "It's not like that. I do think she's cute, but lately..."

    "Lately, how?"

    "Um... actually──"

    ──First, it was Monday of this week.

    "Good morning, Ryouta-senpai."

    "Oh, Hinata. Good morning."

    That morning, on my way to the second-year classroom, Hinata called out to me.

    I heard that she's been leaving home early lately and only meets up with Kousei halfway, but it's been a while since I've seen Hinata.

    "I'm wearing a new hairband, does it look good?"

    Hinata said and tilted her head, showing me the hairband tied in her hair.

    "It looks good. It suits you."

    "Really? Thank you, senpai!"

    "Um... Y-Hinata──"

    She climbed up the stairs like that. What is she up to...

    "What's wrong with Hinata?"

    "Who knows. That idiot is always like that."

    Although Kousei said that, I couldn't help but be concerned and wonder what Hinata's actions meant.

    The next day, during lunch break on Tuesday.

    "Ryouta-senpai."

    This time, Hinata came to the second-year classroom.

    "Hey, Hinata. Why are you here in the second-year classroom?"

    "I want to give this to my brother."

    "Huh? This is Kousei's sports uniform?"

    "I picked up the wrong one. I realized the size was wrong when we were changing clothes for PE class earlier."

    "I see. Did you hear that, Kousei?"

    "Oh, yeah... I don't mind."

    After Hinata finished speaking, she handed the sports uniform to Kousei and waved gently at me before leaving.

    "Well then, Ryouta-senpai, see you next time──"

    "Y-Yeah, see you next time..."

    It seemed like she just came to give Kousei the sports uniform, but something still felt off.

    "Even though you were right here, Hinata barely paid attention to you."

    "Isn't that how she usually is?"

    "But we didn't have PE class today. She didn't have to specifically bring it back to you..."

    "I told you, that idiot is clueless."

    I personally think Kousei's conclusion of labeling her as an idiot with just one word isn't fair, but even so... even so, it's still strange.

    But it's also possible that I'm just overthinking...

    ──This is the kind of feeling Hinata's puzzling actions continue to evoke.

    After I told Akira about all this, her expression darkened slightly.

    "With her acting like that... Onii-chan, haven't you noticed anything?"

    "Notice what?"

    "I mean, Hinata's feelings for you... I mean..."

    "What are you saying?"

    "Um... I mean, Hinata likes you!"
    
    "What? Why would you bring that up after hearing about Hinata's actions?" 

"Of course, it's because... she wants to be with the person she likes as much as possible."

Akira blushed and squirmed.

"So, she probably... likes you, Onii-chan."

I knew what Akira was trying to say. But I still had to say this...

"There's no way Hinata could like me!"

I reflexively strongly denied it, but then felt a bit saddened.

"Why are you suddenly belittling yourself like this... Why are you so confident that someone wouldn't like you?"

"Well, I don't have any qualities that someone would like."

"Onii-chan, be a little kinder to yourself..."

Akira had a deeply disappointed expression.

"Regardless of whether someone likes you or not, you have many good qualities."

"Such as?"

"For example... you're very gentle?"

"Great, we have a winner! Topping the meaningless 'what I like about the other person' list!"

"Huh?"

"Akira, let me tell you. Most men in the world are gentle towards girls."

"What about Kousei-senpai?"

"That guy is a jerk, so he doesn't count. I'm talking about the general consensus. Most people are gentle towards the person they like."

"Poor Kousei-senpai..."

People who casually say they find a girl who likes them "annoying" don't deserve any sympathy.

"Among the boys who have approached you from before until now, were there any who were not gentle?"

"Let me think... it seems like there weren't any..."

"See? In other words, everyone is gentle when it comes to someone they like. On the flip side, those who claim to only be gentle to themselves are at most 'possibly liking' someone."

"What...?"

"But I already know that. In other words, this way of praising someone is just a way to show their gentle side after already liking them."

"...Are you saying that it's not because they like the person's gentleness that they like them, but rather they already like them, so they also like their gentleness?"

"That's exactly it. Gentleness is just an added reason. Liking is liking. There's no reason. The reasons for liking come later."

After I finished speaking like a love commentator, Akira was... well, she seemed very taken aback.

"...I understand now. I now realize why you've been desperately searching the internet for articles about love..."

"What? Did I give myself away?"

"Also, I'm a bit dumbfounded that you're so worked up discussing love views with me..."

"Well... alright, maybe I'm just saying these things on the spot, but I do think that way. Because I'm somewhat interested in love too."

"Huh? You're interested!"

Akira widened her eyes.

"Why are you surprised? I think everyone has searched the internet for articles about love, right?"

"Is that so..."

"That's how it is... So getting back to the main point, Hinata doesn't have any elements that would make her like me."

"You're still so certain about that?"

"That's why I'm thinking about her recent actions from a perspective other than romance. And my conclusion is..."

"...What is it?"

"...I have absolutely no idea."

"Oh, no hope left..."

Akira said dejectedly.

"I know what you're saying, Onii-chan. But I still feel that I like gentle people."

"Is that so?"

"Of course, it's not just anyone. Sometimes there are situations where you think you don't like a person, but suddenly you find them attractive..."

"R-right... For example, what kind of person?"

"Like... someone like you, Onii-chan."

"Me?"

"I-I mean, that's just the general consensus... because you're so nice towards me, right?"

"D-do I? Am I nice?"

"Yeah, you're very nice... Even if Hinata doesn't like you, if you treat her the way you treat me, she should like you too, right?"

"That won't happen!"

"Huh? Why not?"

"Because I'm gentle to you because you're you."

"Huh..."

Of course, that's how it is. Among us family members, the only person I can be so casual with is Akira.

I can't even imagine treating Hinata or anyone other than Akira the same way.

"So, Akira. Even though I see Hinata as an ideal little sister, you're you, and you don't have to change the way you speak. Just stay the way you are now. I like you just the way you are."

"O-Okay....."

"On a side note, why are you blushing?"

"It's all because of you!"

We said these things and happily went to school together today.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

However, during the lunch break, Hinata came to the second-grade classroom again.

"Ryouta-senpai, I want to talk to you about something..."

"Talk to me?"

"Yes..."

"What is it?"

"Um... I can't say it here..."

Hinata blushed and nervously played with her hands placed on her stomach.

"Is it finally a confession?"

Akira chimed in.

"It's not! And what do you mean by 'finally'! just shut up, Aniki!"

Because Akira said that in the morning, for a moment, I thought she was going to confess to me and tensed up. But it seems that's not the case. I don't know why, but while I breathed a sigh of relief, I also felt a bit disappointed.

"Then let's go somewhere else to talk."

"O-Okay..."

The place Hinata and I went to was the first-floor staircase where spare desks and chairs were stored.

During lunch break, only a few scattered students would pass by here, so we didn't have to pay much attention to people around us.

"Okay, what do you want to talk about?"

"Well... It's about Akira..."

"Akira? What's wrong with her?"

"Senpai, let me tell you, Akira has been acting really strange lately!"

"What...?"

Just when I thought Hinata was acting strange, she turned around and consulted me about Akira.

Everyone around me has been acting weird lately. As for Akira... he's no different from usual today. Probably.

"Specifically, what's strange about her?"

"She often spaces out in the classroom."

"Oh... I see."

She's also lethargic at home, so it doesn't sound like something I need to be particularly concerned about, right?

"Well... Ryouta-senpai. Did you listen carefully?"

"Yes, I listened carefully."

"That's good... Anyway, she seems unable to focus on her studies. I don't know if you have any ideas..."

At this moment, I suddenly remembered our conversation from this morning...

"...It's not just anyone. Sometimes there are situations where you think you don't like a person, but suddenly you find them attractive..."

Could it be...

"Let me ask... Have you ever heard her mention the name of a specific guy or talk about romance?"

"Huh? No, not at all..."

"Think carefully."

"Well... Is this considered a specific guy? She often mentions you, senpai."

If that's the case, then she's not spacing out because of lovesickness.

"Could it be that she's having troubles in the romance department?"

"I don't think that's a possibility."

"Why? How can you be so sure, senpai?"

"Because she usually spends her time playing video games, studying, and reading manga at home. She rarely goes out on holidays and spends them lazily."

She only uses her smartphone to play games and doesn't have frequent contact with any particular person. She never stares at her smartphone screen with a silly smile. Even if she does, it's only when she gets good things from gacha games.

"So what you're saying is that there are no male figures around her?"

Not just none, but absolutely none. Occasionally, she seems to contact her ex-husband, but other than that... there's nothing, absolutely nothing. It's impossible.

"Is it really okay to conclude like that...?"

She spaces out... Well, maybe it's because autumn is here? They say the autumn sky is high, right?

"What...?"

"So you probably don't need to worry too much, right?"

"I hope that's the case..."

"Well then, if there's anything strange about her at home, I'll let you know. Ryouta, thank you for always taking care of her on my behalf."

"No, no. Well then, I'll take my leave..."

After Hinata gave me a slight bow, she went up the stairs and left.

I remained alone in the same spot, contemplating about Akira.

...Does Akira like someone?

I almost couldn't help but scoff at the thought, but the possibility is not entirely nonexistent.

If that's the case, then who could be the person?

Someone related to Akira. A man whom Akira finds irresistibly attractive...

Akira... It's probably impossible. Besides, they hardly have any interaction, and it's clear that there's no chance. Akira seems a bit unsure how to get along with Akira. Could that be the opposite of liking? No, no, that can't be it.

She doesn't seem to have much interaction with male students from her previous school either. If it's someone she met online, then it's possible...

No, maybe I just don't know, and there's actually a guy with whom Akira has a great connection.

In any case, I'm extremely curious about who Akira likes. I'm overly concerned about it.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

That evening,

I was alone in my room, but I couldn't calm down no matter what.

It was all because of what happened at noon. The fact that "Akira might like someone."

I've thought about it carefully, but still don't know the answer.

At this point, all I can do is ask casually and see what happens.

Coincidentally, there was a knock on the door, and Akira came into my room.

"Aniki, I've brought back the manga I borrowed from you."

"Akira, do you want to have a chat with me?"

"What's wrong?"

"Akira, do you like someone?"

"Huh...? Huh, huh!"

Forget about asking casually, I couldn't deny that I went straight to the point.

Well, asking in a roundabout way might lead to various misunderstandings. For Akira, being direct might be just right.

"Why are you suddenly asking this...?"

Naturally, Akira blushed intensely.

I knew it. Akira... No, it's too early to jump to conclusions now. Let's gather more information.

"If you were to answer with 'yes' or 'no,' what would your answer be?"

"Umm..."

I see, judging by her reaction, it seems like the answer is yes.

"What kind of person is the other party? How do they look? What's their personality like? How much do they earn per year?"

"He doesn't have any income..."

So, he's either an unemployed person, a NEET, or a student who's not working... It's impossible to narrow down the possibilities.

So, there's no doubt that she has someone she likes?

"Um..."

Akira's eyes frantically darted around, neither denying nor confirming. From her hesitant attitude, it's safe to say that it's someone around me.

"By the way, Aniki, why are you suddenly asking this?"

"Because I'm concerned."

"Come on, you can't ask sensitive questions just out of curiosity..."

"It's not out of curiosity, it's because it involves you."

"Me? Wh-why...?"

"Why? Well, of course, it's because..."

...Because why?

Why is it that when it comes to Akira, I'm so concerned?

After she said that, I realized that I'm not particularly interested in other people's romantic problems.

But because Akira is family, my sister, a girl I'm close to...

I really can't understand it. Yet, at times like this, my mind doesn't come up with good answer.

"...Because I'm your brother."

"That can't be a reason."

Akira was already dumbfounded.

Indeed, even though I'm her brother, maybe it's going too far to interfere in her love life.

"...Then let's just pretend I didn't ask."

"What! You're the one who brought it up!"

"Sorry about that. Anyway, I'm going to bed. You should go to sleep too."

"Um... Aniki, about this matter..."

"What is it?"

Akira's face was completely flushed.

Because she was covering her nose with the collar of her t-shirt, I could faintly see her fair stomach just above her shorts.

"Do you really want to know who I like no matter what...?"

"Y-yeah... Are you willing to tell me?"

"Yes. But I have one condition..."

"A condition?"

"Or rather, it's more like a request..."

After saying that, Akira's face turned even redder than before, and she looked at me with pleading eyes.

"Aniki, I want you to... tonight, sleep with me..."

I couldn't help but doubt if I misheard her.

But I heard it clearly.

"...Sleep with me."

...Sleep with Akira... together?
