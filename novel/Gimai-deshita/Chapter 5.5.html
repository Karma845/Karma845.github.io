<h2>Stage-Sub: My Precious Friends’ Diary</h2>
<p>It’s been one week since I enrolled at Lischburg Magic Academy.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll ever forget these seven days.</p>
<p>The fear of being tormented by others. The guilt of hurting someone. The anguish of having my human dignity trampled.</p>
<p>And the warmth of that person who overwrote it all.</p>
<p>Ouga Velett.</p>
<p>My lifesaver, incredibly kind and strong…the type of prince charming girls might dream of once.</p>
<p>Yet I insulted such a wonderful person who had saved me, calling him an incompetent “deadbeat” without magic aptitude.</p>


<p>Though I knew words can be sharper than knives…I undoubtedly wounded his heart.</p>
<p>But Ouga kun  understood it all and still told me to stay by his side. He accepted everything – my guilt, my mistakes, all of it.</p>
<p>In that moment, a warm light shone into my daily life that had sunk into darkness.</p>
<p>“I still have Ouga kun ‘s handkerchief…..”</p>
<p>When I see the handkerchief from Ouga kun  I still have, with his scent faintly remaining, I can’t help but loosen my cheeks.</p>
<p>I impulsively embraced him then but…looking back I get embarrassed, often restless kicking my legs in bed.</p>
<p>My life now belongs to Ouga kun .</p>
<p>I decided to devote my life to him.</p>
<p>I will try even harder than before.</p>
<p>To gain the ability to stand side by side with Ouga kun , not behind him.</p>
<p>And someday…stand by Ouga kun side as equal</p>
