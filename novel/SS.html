<h3> Side &#8211; The Maids' Chats.</h3>
 
 <p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the fairy maid's room in Naraku basement, four fairy maids are gathering.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Basically,
one room is for four people, and each room has its own work rotation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Today
is their day off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maids' level is 500, which is almost the weakest level in this
"Naraku." Still, it is much higher than ordinary adventurers on the
surface world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
they are hardly ever feeling tired. They really want to work hard for Raito's
sake, the infinite gacha cards summoner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
regular off days are a must, and disobeying the Lord's orders goes against
their life purpose.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
why they're sitting around the table chatting in the middle of the day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
table was lined with N-card foods from "Infinite Gacha". They had set
up a system where even the girls could buy the low-rarity N-card foods in the
store.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, the topic of conversation is about Raito, their Lord, their life
purpose, their God.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
heard that Master will be returning to the abyss tomorrow."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Unlike
in Naraku, we can use "Transfer" card in the surface world,
regardless we're outside or inside the dungeon. If from the beginning the
"Transfer" card could be used inside "Naraku", the Lord
wouldn't have so much trouble."</span></span><span class="calibre13"> <span>[Glasses]</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
serious-looking fairy maid with glasses unconsciously pushed up her glasses frame
and let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The gal
fairy maid sitting next to her agreed and nodded repeatedly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
get it, I get it. I've heard that dungeons have different characteristics, but
'Naraku' has the worst characteristics of them all! That's the</span><span class="calibre13"> world's largest, hardest, and most
punitive dungeon, 'Naraku'. </span><span class="calibre13">Raito-sama, who conquered it, is really
a God~." [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
last one, she also has a beautiful face, but her bangs are long, and her vibe
is somewhat dark. But on the contrary, she had an aura that made the weak and
timid boys like her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
jealous of Nemumu-sama, who is always with my Lord like that. I'm too jealous.
I'm so jealous I want to punch the wall with my fist." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
get it, I get it. I know that feeling very well. If I could, I'd like to take Nemumu-sama's
place and support Raito-sama's side." [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But
our level is 500, so we'll only be a burden to the Lord if we go above
ground." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ugh,
why is my level only 500? If I had higher levels, I could join my master as an
adventurer on the surface world, and even become my master's shield in a time
of crisis......." [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
most ordinary fairy maid held her head and lay down her face on the table.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
statement was a very dangerous way of thinking. Still, it was a very common way
of thinking for those girls who swore absolute loyalty to Raito, their
summoner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
no one bothered to correct her, but instead, they all agreed that they could
become a shield for their master in a time of crisis.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Basically,
those summoned from gacha cards like these girls cannot increase their level no
matter how many monsters they kill.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
they are level 500, their level is fixed at level 500.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
they have magic items, they can raise their strength even with a fixed level.
...... However, even if fairy maids like them increase their strength, it is still
very difficult to replace Nemumu, the level 5000.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
nerdy fairy maid drop more bombs.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now,
now, now my Lord and the others are in the snowy mountains. They are searching
for the magic stone of a monster called Yeti, and it seems that they have
defeated it. Snowy mountains, two people who're freezing, hugging each other
with their skin to warm each other, a man and a woman. There was no way nothing
would happen... Isn't that the best?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dream of the maid who pushed up her glasses frame is shattered in an instant.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
can't take this anymore!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Maybe
I can hug my master!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Just thinking about it makes
me...!" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Imagining
herself being hugged by Raito, the fairy maid, who laid her face on the table,
now hugging herself, her body shaking with excitement and pleasure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Ignoring
her, the other girls also speak their minds.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course, if it can come true, I want to hug and warm each other with my
Lord!" [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
on the contrary, I want to hug Raito-sama from behind. Holding and warming up
Raito-sama's body and soul. Isn't that the best?" [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I, I want my Lord to strip off my maid clothes, and the two of us stranded in
the snowy mountains." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you a pervert?!" [Glasses] [Gal] [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other three people put together a tsukkomi in response to her statement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
the nerdy fairy maid continues without paying any attention to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But,
but, but for my Lord to forcibly take off this maid clothes and stranded
together in the snowy mountains, that's a reward, right?" [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
understand." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
get it." [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
understand, but your level is too high!" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
everyone had agreed and their tsukkomi ended, the most ordinary fairy maid let
slip a few words.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aaaah...
I can't wait for Master to come back to the "abyss"... I know it's
not possible to hug him, but I'd like to see him, at least for a moment. I
haven't seen him for days...." [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
glasses maid lifts her glasses frame.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Indeed,
I can't hug him, but I'd like to feel his presence, even if it's just a glance
or even a single word from him." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre13">"I
understand. I want to smell Raito-sama's scent." [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I, I'm going to run out of Master's ingredient.......I, I, I just ran out of
Master's ingredient. Without the master ingredient, I will die. A shortage of
master ingredient is a violation of military agreements." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though they didn't know what this military agreement is, the other three nodded
their heads in deep agreement. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
wish that all of Raito-sama's enemies on earth could be eliminated. And if Raito-sama
rules the world, everyone will be happy, happy! I can't wait for such a world
to come~."[Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ho,
ho, ho, that's right!" [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Our
Lord doesn't do so right away because he has a plan. A maid like us should not
say anything. Our life purpose is to fulfill the Lord's wishes." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
glasses maid fairy pushed up her glasses frame and reminds her colleagues.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
I can't wait to see our master..." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other three nodded in agreement at this comment.</span></p>
