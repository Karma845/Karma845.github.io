<h3>Chapter 3 ︎&#8211; A Night of Desire With a Nice Elf Wife </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>And then night.</p>



<p>“Hahm♡ haahm♡ nchu♡.”</p>



<p>Kairi tried having a meal with mouth-to-mouth feeding at Misha’s request.</p>



<p><em>This isn&#8217;t a mistake, is it?</em></p>



<p>And then he regretted it shortly after.</p>



<p>The touching of lips with lips was making his heart race, and the exchange of saliva with saliva was hot; it was arousing, however, “Kairi♡ Kairi♡,” Misha was very quick to kiss him and insert her tongue, so it got the drawback of not being able to make any progress with the meal.</p>



<p>“Nnn.”</p>



<p>Even Kairi wasn’t able to stop it.</p>



<p>As he was complying somewhat, he ended up getting excited.</p>



<p>“Chu, hnnggmm…” And the result, it became difficult to tell whether they were kissing in between eating, or eating in between kissing. “Fufu, meal eaten with you is deslish♡,” Misha said, entranced.</p>



<p>“Y-yeah. It’s delicious for me, too,” Kairi replied with an awkward smile.</p>



<p><em>I guess it’s the correct choice to go with an easy-to-eat sandwich</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>Those two got no skill in cooking and also no time either, so they’d bought it by process of elimination, but it proved to be a blessing.</p>



<p>“Nnnh”</p>



<p>In turn, Kairi also brought the sandwich into Misha’s mouth with mouth-to-mouth feeding.</p>



<p>The act of bringing chewed up food into a girl’s mouth was highly stimulating for him.</p>



<p><em>This is just like, plain hot…</em></p>



<p>The mouth was also a mucous membrane, the same with ‘insertion.’</p>



<p>For Kairi, at least.</p>



<p>“Fufu.”</p>



<p>The exhales spilled by the happy-looking Misha was also bewitching.</p>



<p>She was probably unaware of it.</p>



<p>Despite coming onto Kairi so aggressively without hesitation, Kairi noticed that she got no personality to make use of sex appeal.</p>



<p>“It’s fun to also eat like this, isn’t it?” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“It’s bad manners, and it takes too long to eat, though.” Kairi gave a rational comment, restraining himself from giving a nod.</p>



<p><em>If I don’t firm up, I feel like I’m gonna get depraved to no end</em>, such a sense of crisis was also present a little.</p>



<p>Misha possessed an innocent, assertive, and mysterious charm that seemed like it would leave him submerged in a bottomless swamp without even realizing it.</p>



<p>And for Kairi, that, too, was a happy kind.</p>



<p><em>That’s why I’ve gotta be careful</em>.</p>



<p>He reminded himself he wouldn’t know what would happen if he wouldn’t pull himself together.</p>



<p>“Let’s eat normally for the rest.”</p>



<p>“Ye~es.” Without disobeying, Misha then got down from Kairi’s lap and sat next to him. “Like this is okay, right?”</p>



<p>“Well yeah.” He nodded at Misha’s question.</p>



<p>Eating while sitting next to each other was part of eating ‘normally,’ so there wasn’t a reason to refuse.</p>



<p>“There’s so much delicious food in this world, isn’t it?” suddenly Misha gave her feelings with a serious face.</p>



<p>“Glad to hear that.” Kairi was relieved.</p>



<p>He’d thought that it seemed all right at lunch together with her, but it was a different kind of relief from hearing from the person in question.</p>



<p>“You weren’t worried about having a meal?” he tried to ask.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’d be okay for a while even without eating after all,” Misha replied.</p>



<p>“You said that before, didn’t you?” Kairi fondly recalled it back.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s why I was happy, you know? It was very memorable,” said Misha.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, I see.” Kairi felt as if he’d seen the light.</p>



<p><em>I wonder why this girl got feelings for me</em>.</p>



<p>Despite not really understanding it personally, he understood that it had strung her heart.</p>



<p>“Phew, that filled up the stomach.” Kairi started cleaning up, feeling satisfied.</p>



<p>“Ah, I’ll also.” Misha too stood up right away.</p>



<p>“Then lend a hand please.”</p>



<p>“Okay.”</p>



<p>Misha could usually handle something as much as throwing out the trash or tidying things up.</p>



<p><em>Seems it’ll be safe as long as I don’t let her use tools</em>, such was Kairi’s assessment.</p>



<p>Not being able to use tools would seem to be a disadvantage for doing housework in this day and age, but Misha could use magic to compensate for it.</p>



<p>“It’s probably not truly all-purpose, but still, it sure is pretty convenient,” Kairi muttered.</p>



<p>The mere fact of being able to use magic would probably cause an uproar in Japan, and if people got to know how convenient it was, it could be even more serious.</p>



<p>The fact that there was an elf from another world in the first place was already serious, however.</p>



<p>“Then let’s make a baby♡,” Misha straight up invited him.</p>



<p>“Let’s take a bath first,” replied Kairi immediately.</p>



<p>Not that he meant to tease or delay, it was just his personality to want to take a bath first.</p>



<p>“Ah, that’s right. We can enjoy ourselves even in the bathtub, can’t we?” Misha being Misha; she was quick to make the switch, as well as highly adaptable.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right,” Kairi agreed with a wry smile.</p>



<p>If he could have a bath, there was no reason to refuse as far as he was concerned.</p>



<p><em>I’ve got a feeling it would turn out like this anyway</em>.</p>



<p>It was predictable considering what had happened yesterday.</p>



<p>As for heating the bath, Misha’s magic took care of it.</p>



<p>“With this, we can even save on utility costs, right?” said Misha with a smug look.</p>



<p>“That is correct,” Kairi gave her the yes gratefully, while thinking: <em>Her smug face sure is cute</em>.</p>



<p>It seemed she remembered about utility costs and such being a necessary expense in this world, which he’d taught her during the day while they’d been out shopping.</p>



<p>“Food expenses, too; even though It’d be cheaper if I go bring it from another world,” she said looking dissatisfied.</p>



<p>“If we do that, people will wonder how we are getting food, okay? That’s a no, okay?” Once again, Kairi put on a restrain.</p>



<p>He appreciated the thought of saving money on living expenses, but not on the part that would look suspicious were it to be reduced.</p>



<p>That was the prerequisite for protecting this livelihood, and consequently, Misha.</p>



<p>“I understand,” Misha replied in disappointment.</p>



<p>From today on, he wouldn’t have to worry about Misha’s changes of clothes either.</p>



<p>They went to wash each other’s body in peace, but once it was done, the development Kairi had expected then began.</p>



<p>“Nmu, hahm, hamuu.”</p>



<p>In other words, sexual activity that would begin with kissing.</p>



<p>“Let’s get into the bath,” Kairi said at one moment of gap.</p>



<p>The season was spring, so it was still slightly chilly.</p>



<p>They could catch a cold if they were to stay in the open air for too long.</p>



<p>“You’re right,” Misha accepted the suggestion and went ahead to get into the bath. “Today’s the reverse of yesterday, right?” she said and looked at Kairi to provoke him.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Kairi smiled, going along with her.</p>



<p>That said, it was a small bathtub, so it didn’t mean much.</p>



<p>It was a matter of the mood of the two of them.</p>



<p>“You can get in, too, you know?” Misha whispered in his ear as they were in close contact.</p>



<p>“Nah, I’ll pass.” Kairi shook his head.</p>



<p><em>There’s a romance to bathroom-play, but it’s just so cramped.</em></p>



<p>It didn’t seem like they could do it well.</p>



<p>The sad reality itself was why he was unwilling to.</p>



<p>“Won’t it be better at a place where it’s easy to do it if given the choice?” he said.</p>



<p>“I suppose that’s true, too,” Misha accepted it honestly without seeming fussy about it either. “Then just kissing,” she said.</p>



<p>“Chu. Hnnn.”</p>



<p>She kissed him and stuck her tongue into him.</p>



<p>“Nnnnh.”</p>



<p>After enjoying it for about ten seconds, Kairi gently pulled back.</p>



<p>“Ahn, aww.” Misha looked up at him regretfully.</p>



<p>“‘Cause it seems it’s gonna ignite, alright?” Kairi made a pitiable face, asking her to understand.</p>



<p>There would be no way for him to not feel anything when a girl as attractive as her was coming onto him strongly.</p>



<p>“Fufu, it seems so.” While smiling happily, Misha stroked his nether region. “It’s like saying it can’t take it anymore.”</p>



<p>“Uuwh, yeah that’s right,” Kairi raised a deplorable voice.</p>



<p>He’d been continuously aroused, so naturally his manly sword was in the state of preparing for war.</p>



<p>“Can you understand that I’m also being patient?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Misha nodded while giving it another stroke. “It has amazing persuasiveness. I wonder if this is the one called ‘seeing is believing’,” she said with satisfaction.</p>



<p>“I feel it’s kinda wrong, though?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kairi was puzzled, but he couldn’t concentrate on his thoughts.</p>



<p><em>No good, everything’s starting to just look like whatever</em>.</p>



<p>His head was starting to spin and gave up.</p>



<p>He thought that it was his role to teach her the correct way to use Japanese, but he judged he didn’t have to do it now.</p>



<p>“I-I think I’ll get out now.”</p>



<p>As he was standing up, “my, aren’t you supposed to take a nice long soak?” Misha asked, tilting her head. She was smiling teasingly.</p>



<p>“Please get the hint.” Kairi assumed a pose of surrender.</p>



<p>“Fufufu.” She returned back an impish smile. However, she didn’t pursue it further, seemingly not really meaning to trouble him.</p>



<p>“I’ll get out first then,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>“Ye~es. Later, okay?” replied Misha.</p>



<p><em>You didn’t have to say it</em>, or so he thought, but it would be boorish to say.</p>



<p>It would be more natural to think that she was feeling the time with Kairi to be endearing.</p>



<p>Thinking about it too much was making his cheeks hot even though he’d stepped out of the bath.</p>



<p>“Gotta be careful not to get too cold after bath,” Kairi mumbled to himself, and quickly put on pajamas.</p>



<p>After all, <em>getting nursed by Misha is a bit, yeah</em>, he felt so.</p>



<p>There was a romance to being nursed devotedly by a beautiful elf girl, but it was scary to leave everything to the clumsy Misha.</p>



<p>As for him, it was a development he’d like to avoid as much as possible.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>“Phew.” Drinking a cup of water after getting out of the bath, Kairi felt revived.</p>



<p>He would drink milk if it was in a hot spring or public bath house, but at home he somehow liked water.</p>



<p>“That was a nice hot bath, wasn&#8217;t it?” Misha got out without even covering her body with a towel.</p>



<p>“Yeah, for sure.” No longer surprised nor flustered, Kairi calmly replied and offered her water.</p>



<p>“Thanks!” Misha gulped it down as well.</p>



<p>“We’ve got to stay hydrated,” said Kairi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in response to him, “we’re going to have plenty of physical activities after this, aren’t we♡,” she replied with an enthusiastic face.</p>



<p>“Well yeah,” Kairi confirmed with a smile.</p>



<p><em>Now I’m slowly feeling embarrassed</em>, and he was aware of his own change.</p>



<p>And all that remained after getting out of the bath was to sleep, but would he really be able to sleep?</p>



<p>As soon as they got to the futon, Misha immediately went to kiss him.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ chu♡ chu♡.”</p>



<p>“Say, Misha… chu… you really love kissing, huh,” Kairi said even while still reciprocating her.</p>



<p>“Yeah♡ if I can touch you♡ I love whatever it is♡ but kissing’s special♡,” said Misha, speaking deftly.</p>



<p>“I-I see.” Kairi was embarrassed by her blunt feelings.</p>



<p>Although he was getting used to it, his resistance wasn’t fully developed yet.</p>



<p>“You’re wide open♡.” Misha pushed him down, mounted him, and went to shower him with kisses.</p>



<p>“Nnhhmm.” Kairi felt as if he was being preyed upon, but he resigned himself to her.</p>



<p>It might be already inevitable for him to incline to take a passive attitude against her.</p>



<p>“Nhmng, churp, slurpslurp.” After checking on his response, Misha went to insert her tongue.</p>



<p>She looked more like a tiger feasting on meat than an elf.</p>



<p>“Homnomhomnom.” She was obviously play-biting, and not kissing.</p>



<p>Kairi was lying on his back with his eyes closed, and just leaving it to her.</p>



<p>“Fufufu, you’re getting hard♡.” Misha paused her offensive, and stretched her hand to between his legs.</p>



<p>“Well of course, you’re today so charming and passionate after all,” still feeling slightly embarrassed, Kairi replied.</p>



<p>And why he didn’t say ‘erotic’ was also because of it.</p>



<p>“Ufufu♡.” While smiling happily, Misha slowly got her hand to work. “How is it? It seems there are gentlemen who like this kind of thing, though?” she asked with a seductress-like expression.</p>



<p>“Uuwh, it does feel good,” Kairi conveyed his honest impression, no use either in trying to put on airs.</p>



<p><em>Getting rubbed by a girl’s hand has a different pleasure than with the inside.</em></p>



<p>And of course, it was a fresh pleasure for him.</p>



<p>“Fufu, Kairi, you’re making a cute face♡,” Misha said, her expression turning sadistic. “I’m gonna make you feel even better♡” Then Misha licked his manly sword.</p>



<p>“Whao!?” Kairi jolted at the sudden touch of her tongue.</p>



<p>“Is it like this? Lickylick♡.” Clumsily, Misha was licking with trial and error.</p>



<p id="jump-1">To put it bluntly, she sucked<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>.</p>



<p><em>However, that can be good even</em>, thought Kairi.</p>



<p>Despite her clearly not used to it, the situation of her giving her utmost trying to service him was plenty arousing already.</p>



<p><em>Maybe I’m also just a simple guy, feeling good just from getting licked and all</em>, Kairi suddenly thought such a thing.</p>



<p>Maybe it was going well because they were both inexperienced.</p>



<p>“Homnom♡ chu♡.” Misha was adding more variation to her movements, perhaps slowly getting used to it.</p>



<p>“Whoa, crap,” Kairi raised his voice, unable to hold it.</p>



<p>“Fufu, it’s getting even more energetic♡,” Misha giggled happily.</p>



<p>“Yeah, if something like this is done to me, of course it’s gonna get lively and kicking,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>“My preparation is also all OK♡ wanna see?” Misha asked.</p>



<p>“Eh, you sure?” Kairi opened his eyes wide. “I thought girls would be embarrassed… I’ve got no experience, though.”</p>



<p>“It’s certainly embarrassing I guess. But it’s okay if it’s you, Kairi♡,” Misha replied.</p>



<p>“Is that so? Then can I?” Kairi asked.</p>



<p>“Sure♡” Misha moved to his side, and lay down beside him. “Now, go ahead.” Lying face up, she spread her legs on her own.</p>



<p>“O-okay.”</p>



<p>Kairi was getting nervous at this point in time.</p>



<p>It was the first time in his life to clearly see a girl’s secret place.</p>



<p>“How is it?” spreading it for him to see with her own fingers, Misha asked.</p>



<p>“It’s so erotic.” It was so arousing that Kairi forgot to gloss it over.</p>



<p>That was how enchanting it was.</p>



<p>“Fufufufu.” Far from getting grossed out, Misha shuddered and smiled broadly. “Kairi, your eyes are staring so hard, and your breathing is getting very wild, you know♡?” she pointed out.</p>



<p>Kairi instinctively knew he was being teased, but he felt embarrassed at the same time.</p>



<p>“S-sorry, it’s just so erotic,” Kairi apologized with his eyes looking away.</p>



<p>“It’s fine♡ go ahead, admire me lots♡” Far from getting grossed out, Misha encouraged him to stare more.</p>



<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>Thinking it would be fine since she herself allowed it, Kairi returned his gaze.</p>



<p>As he was staring hard, his nether region was getting painful.</p>



<p>“Oh man…”</p>



<p>He might haven’t realized it, but his desire to insert it must’ve been getting big.</p>



<p>“Now, put it in♡,” Misha whispered with a smile. Although there was a moderate sexual appeal in the ‘seduction,’ it was more than plenty for Kairi.</p>



<p>“Yeah, here I go then.”</p>



<p><em>I managed to insert it better than the first time</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Nnh♡ it’s wonderful♡.”</p>



<p>Could it be an illusion that Misha’s voice sounded sweeter than usual?</p>



<p>“Inside you is also amazing, Misha,” Kairi said with ragged breathing.</p>



<p>After all, she was happy to be told his blunt impression, and seemed to get aroused by it.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ thanks♡.”</p>



<p>After getting connected, they held hands with their fingers interlocked, “chu♡ chu♡,” and were exchanging light kisses.</p>



<p>In the beginning, it’d been all Misha as usual, but Kairi too quickly turned on the offensive.</p>



<p>“Homnom♡ homnom♡ slurpslurp♡.”</p>



<p>In the end, it was Misha who was more aggressive and better at the offensive.</p>



<p>Kairi’s weak counterattack was unable to stop her tongue, which was gradually becoming a one-sided devouring contest.</p>



<p>“Wai, hold o, oh wo—”</p>



<p>As for Kairi, he’d like to fight back at least a little, but he immediately got swept up.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ I’m gonna make you feel so good♡ my darling♡,” said Misha without easing up her offensive.</p>



<p>“Really, you’re making me feel good already.” Kairi was flustered, but it was futile.</p>



<p><em>Wait, hold on?</em></p>



<p>He suddenly remembered that they were currently connected.</p>



<p><em>Then, there’s also things I can do</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi suddenly moved his hips.</p>



<p>“Anh♡ so suddenly♡.”</p>



<p>The effect he’d aimed for was immediately produced.</p>



<p>Misha received a rush of pleasure as well, and her offensive relaxed.</p>



<p>“I just don’t want it, just sitting around getting attacked and made to feel good one-sidedly.” Kairi took a breath, and slowly moved his hips.</p>



<p>One could say that his manly sword was his only weapon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hahh♡ oh no♡ not there♡.”</p>



<p>However, it was effective against Misha.</p>



<p>Just monotonous thrusting, and she was squealing.</p>



<p>“Haahn♡ aaah♡.”</p>



<p>Seeing her expression calmed his anxiety of whether this would do.</p>



<p>She’d lost her composure, and Kairi went to kiss her.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ nmu♡ mnom♡.” Misha immediately began reciprocating him.</p>



<p><em>Th-this is difficult</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi realized that working his hips while kissing was surprisingly tough.</p>



<p>At the very least, for him it wasn’t easy.</p>



<p>Misha was more skilful in that regard, and she came to attack him at two points at the same time, the mouth and the secret place.</p>



<p>“Hahhn♡ aaahn♡ aaaah♡.”</p>



<p>Misha was becoming more disorganized, but the movement was becoming more intense.</p>



<p>No longer in a state of kissing each other, they stopped their lovers’ hold hands and embraced each other tightly.</p>



<p>“Kuh.”</p>



<p>Kairi, too, firmly held her hips, and gradually increased the speed of his movement.</p>



<p>There had been discrepancies in the beginning, but their movements were finally in sync.</p>



<p>Perhaps because of this, Kairi’s manly sword began to pierce deeper.</p>



<p>“Haaahhh♡ ah, aaah♡.” Composure was gone from Misha’s expression.</p>



<p><em>Ooh?</em></p>



<p>Although Kairi sensed this, he got no room to rejoice.</p>



<p>The inside of her was like a living being, coiling and trying to squeeze his manly sword.</p>



<p><em>I feel like I’m just immediately gonna let it out if I relax</em>.</p>



<p><em>I want to avoid just that</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>Right now, Misha was in the middle of savoring pleasure and had not yet reached climax.</p>



<p>It would probably be pathetic to be the only one to reach it first.</p>



<p><em>I don’t wanna be called a quick shot!</em></p>



<p>What little pride he got was giving him persistence.</p>



<p>“Kairi♡ cumming♡ I’m gonna cum♡ let’s, together♡.” Misha was also getting closer there, and went to beg him in an emotion-filled voice.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m also already at my limit…!” Kairi replied in a groan.</p>



<p>“Cumming♡ I’m cumming♡.”</p>



<p>“!!!”</p>



<p>They reached it almost at the same time, and Kairi poured it plenty inside of her.</p>



<p>While still connected, they fell limp.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Phew.”</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/4p3kepe.jpg"></img>


<p>Kairi was attacked by a pleasant sense of lethargy.</p>



<p><em>Yesterday I couldn’t really feel it that much, though</em>.</p>



<p>There was a feeling of happiness, of knowing that it was such a pleasure to climax inside a girl.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ You sure let out a lot♡.” Misha smiled, looking satisfied.</p>



<p>“Is that something you can tell?”</p>



<p>At Kairi’s astonishment, “I’m an elf after all♡,” Misha smiled amorously.</p>



<p>“I-I see.” He had no choice but to accept it if told it was because she was an elf.</p>



<p>“It was wonderful♡.” Misha kissed him on the cheek.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you too.” And Kairi returned a kiss on the cheek.</p>



<p>Fawningly, Misha went to place her head on his chest. “Just being like this is making me happy,” she said ecstatically.</p>



<p>“Me too,” and Kairi responded.</p>



<p>Just being with Misha made him forget about any anxiety and stuff.</p>



<p>She might have some clumsiness, but he believed she was the most wonderful woman.</p>



<p>“I’m so happy♡.” Misha was delighted, and went to kiss him on the lips this time.</p>



<p>“Haha.” And Kairi responded to the kiss.</p>



<p>The passion that had been cooling down once again began to burn.</p>



<p>“Chu chu chu.”</p>



<p>“Hom, homnom, hamnom.”</p>



<p>Misha was once again moving like a predator.</p>



<p>“C-can you give me a little more rest?” Kairi requested of her after having managed to separate his mouth from her.</p>



<p>His recovery was taking time, perhaps due to inexperience, or perhaps due to continuous hard work.</p>



<p>Despite thinking it was pathetic, it would be best to be honest and say when something was just impossible.</p>



<p>“Nnn? In that case, take this.” Misha suddenly held her left hand on his body.</p>



<p>And then in the twinkle of an eye his fatigue disappeared, and his nether region recovered as well.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh?” Kairi was puzzled, not able to understand the situation.</p>



<p>“I might haven’t said it, but recovery magic is my forte♡,” Misha declared with a smile. “That’s why just let me know whenever you need it♡ I will recover you as much as you want♡.”</p>



<p>“Haha, hahahaha…” Having heard her words, a dry voice escaped Kairi’s mouth.</p>



<p><em>It’s amazing, though</em>.</p>



<p>He felt a sense of crisis more strongly than feeling of being impressed.</p>



<p>“Of course, I can also use it on myself♡,” she said, and went to put recovery magic on herself. “That’s why, we can have as much good time as we like♡.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I knew it?” Kairi softly sighed.</p>



<p>And the reason for feeling a sense of crisis, he got no time to think about it.</p>



<p>“Yes♡.” Misha was staring at him with eyes like that of a cat wanting to play endlessly, and possessing boundless stamina.</p>



<p>“&#8230;If it’s just one more time,” Kairi answered.</p>



<p><em>I’ve done and said it!</em> and he regretted it just a little bit.</p>



<p>He felt he&#8217;d been swayed by her passion, and then his own recovered manly sword.</p>



<p>“Yay!” Misha was clapping her hands merrily, and once done, immediately turned into riding him.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“It’s the reverse from earlier, isn’t it♡?” she said, smiling sweetly.</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah.” Kairi obediently went along.</p>



<p>He wasn’t in the mood to be proactive again.</p>



<p><em>I guess I can let Misha do what she wants</em>, and such thought was also in him.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ time to eat! Just kidding♡,” said Misha while connecting with him.</p>



<p>“!?” Kairi was startled.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because her expression and words matched so well.</p>



<p>“Aah, it’s already very energetic♡,” Misha ecstatically moaned immediately after they became one.</p>



<p>“You sure are energetic as well,” Kairi groaned.</p>



<p>Her inside was hot and wriggling like a living thing.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ it’s because you’re here♡.” Her expression looked like that of a predator as usual, but what she said was admirable.</p>



<p>“Misha.” And Kairi was sentimentally moved by her.</p>



<p>“Kairi♡ aah, Kairi♡.” She moved her hips slowly while calling his name ecstatically.</p>



<p>“Ah, aaah, haahh♡.”</p>



<p>Misha’s use of her hips was still clumsy.</p>



<p>Yet greedily, she was trying to indulge Kairi and the pleasure.</p>



<p>“Hahh♡ aaaahh♡ aah♡.”</p>



<p>Kairi had little room to enjoy her breathing and the use of her hips.</p>



<p>“As I thought, you’re amazing…”</p>



<p>However, it immediately disappeared,&nbsp; “aah♡ haaaahhhh♡ aaaahhh♡,” as Misha’s movements became more intense, more greedy.</p>



<p>Kairi was simply enduring the currents of pleasure.</p>



<p><em>Crap… I think I’m gonna cum again.</em></p>



<p>That was how amazing Misha was.</p>



<p>“I guess I should be moving, too,” he said, and tried to move his hips.</p>



<p>“Ahn♡ this time it’s supposed to be my turn♡” Misha said, but she didn’t seem to hate it.</p>



<p>She was even delighted by the stimulation given to her by surprise.</p>



<p>“Oh why not… We can enjoy this together…” Kairi said while stabbing deep into her.</p>



<p>“T-that’s true, but♡.” Misha was puffing, accepting his opinion.</p>



<p>She seemed to be delighted with the ‘together’ part.</p>



<p>“Ah♡ haahh♡ aaaahh♡.” Their movements overlapped, and Misha’s voice let out considerably. “Wow♡ this is amazing♡.” Misha’s eyes began to melt in pleasure.</p>



<p>“Kuh…” Kairi as well, he was desperately enduring the surging pleasure.</p>



<p><em>I know, crazy good</em>.</p>



<p>It felt so good that his meager vocabulary died.</p>



<p>“Aahh♡ haaaahh♡ aahh♡.”</p>



<p>He’d like to soak in the pleasure together with Misha.</p>



<p>“The tightness is crazy… Aren’t you getting better again?”</p>



<p>Her inside felt better than last night, and he felt her dreadfulness.</p>



<p>“Haah♡ aaah♡ you too, Kairi♡ you’re also better than yesterday♡” said Misha with disheveled hair.</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Kairi replied while putting up with the pleasure.</p>



<p><em>Is that even possible?</em> Or so he thought, but there was no way he could know.</p>



<p>“Yup♡ I’m sure you are♡.” Misha smiled while slowing her movement.</p>



<p>The description of ‘naughty angel’ fit her expression well.</p>



<p>“Our affinity is a perfect match, so it’s just gonna get better and better♡,” she said as if in conviction.</p>



<p>“I hope so.” Kairi also smiled.</p>



<p><em>Affinity is definitely important</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>Even if it was bad, the feelings would probably stay the same, but for it to be good would be best.</p>



<p>“Hey♡ let’s feel it together again,” Misha invited with a smile.</p>



<p>Since Kairi managed to get a slight breathing room, “you sure? Didn’t you say it’s your turn?” he asked back teasingly.</p>



<p>“I mean… together is just better after all♡,” Misha replied with a fawning voice.</p>



<p>In the end, the more important thing was feeling good.</p>



<p>“Well, I’m with you there,” Kairi agreed with her.</p>



<p>It was a lovemaking activity, so it was understandable to think that it should feel more pleasant.</p>



<p>“Right?” Misha smiled and hugged him. “Let’s make love a lot♡.”</p>



<p>They gazed at each other at a distance where their noses were almost touching.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>The worry whether he got the stamina crossed Kairi’s mind.</p>



<p>However, he made it the priority to respond to her feelings.</p>



<p>“Aaahh…♡”</p>



<p>The first one to move was Misha.</p>



<p>Kairi responded to her a bit behind.</p>



<p>“You’re just wonderful♡,” she said ecstatically.</p>



<p>Both by her praise or by making her delighted, Kairi’s self-esteem was filled up.</p>



<p><em>It makes me want to please her more</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Here I go.” Kairi put his strength into his lower body.</p>



<p>“Yup, give me♡,” Misha responded, and her inside was squeezing tighter.</p>



<p>“Urgh.” If he didn’t psyche himself up accordingly, he might get swept away in an instant. “Wow,” Kairi purposely voiced it out. It was an attempt to shift his consciousness away from the pleasure.</p>



<p>“Aaahn, haahh, y-your thing is also♡ amazing, Kairi♡,” Misha cried in pleasure.</p>



<p>They were desiring each other, and running towards the climax.</p>



<p>“Your thing is♡ reaching so deep♡ where it feels good♡.”</p>



<p>At the same time as Micha’s voice soared, Kairi arrived at his limit as well.</p>



<p>“I’m close… here it comes,” Kairi gave notice.</p>



<p>“Yup, do it♡ give Misha a lot of it♡,” Misha begged in a sweet voice while swinging her hips. And that fueled his libido.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ haaahhh♡.”</p>



<p>At the same time as Misha reached the climax, Kairi ejaculated a second time.</p>



<p>“Uwh, it’s coming out…”</p>



<p>Kairi let out so much that he couldn’t believe it was the second time.</p>



<p>“Fufu, it’s more than earlier, isn’t it♡ I’m happy♡,” said Misha ecstatically while receiving it.</p>



<p>“Y-you also can tell that, huh.” Kairi was surprised while holding her in his arms.</p>



<p>An elf was truly full of mysteries.</p>



<p><em>She’s good at erotic things, won’t that make her an erofu?</em> Or so he thought in his heart.</p>



<p>“And is well versed in… I guess it’s gonna turn into a bad pun.” He was about to say it, but immediately stopped it.</p>



<p>“Haah… haahh… what’s wrong?” Misha curiously asked while breathing heavily.</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s nothing.” Shaking his head, Karied dodged it.</p>



<p>To teach her about bad pun would be awfully embarrassing.</p>



<p>“What is it~? Come on, tell me♡,” Misha, unable to accept it, pestered him with a sweet voice with her cheek placed on his cheek.</p>



<p>“Uuwh…”</p>



<p>Even though Kairi was in a post-climax clarity from just finishing a second battle, his heart got thumping fast.</p>



<p><em>If it’s not on purpose, isn’t she a femme fatale then?</em> He couldn’t help but think so.</p>



<p>“Do you know about bad pun?” In the end he ended up talking.</p>



<p>“?? I don’t really get it.” Misha looked puzzled.</p>



<p>“I-I see.”</p>



<p><em>If she doesn’t know, I guess the talk stops here</em>, Kairi judged.</p>



<p>“Eh, what? Tell me♡.” Misha was pestering him, probably precisely because she didn’t know anything.</p>



<p><em>I’d say it’s not something to talk about right now</em>.</p>



<p><em>There’s still erotic and romantic mood left in the air</em>, and it made Kairi want to make a bitter smile.</p>



<p>Needless to say it was his responsibility, so he tried to change the topic.</p>



<p>“The second time was also amazing,” he said, gently stroking Misha’s hair.</p>



<p>“Thanks.” Despite seemingly wondering at the sudden development, “you’re also wonderful, Kairi♡,” she took it, and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek.</p>



<p>“Thanks,” Kairi said and returned the kiss.</p>



<p>He was now able to do it naturally.</p>



<p>“Fufu,” Misha let out a giggle in good humor, and went to kiss him more. “Chu♡.”</p>



<p>“Hmmu.” When Kairi responded to it, the interval between kisses was becoming shorter little by little. “Ho-hold on a second,“ Kairi rushed to stop her.</p>



<p>After all, he had a hunch they would enter the third round at this rate.</p>



<p><em>I must say I don’t have the energy for it</em>.</p>



<p>And then immediately after, ”ah, you’re right♡” Misha nodded in understanding.</p>



<p>As Kairi was feeling relieved that it had gotten through her, “recovery magic comes first, right♡?” she said, and ended up using magic.</p>



<p>“Eh? Wai…” Kairi panicked but it was too late.</p>



<p>“The third time please♡,” Misha begged him.</p>



<p>“Uwh…” Kairi was hesitating while wavering at her cuteness.</p>



<p><em>At least tomorrow’s off, though</em>…</p>



<p>He felt like wanting to go to sleep now.</p>



<p>“We can’t?” Misha asked in a fawning voice.</p>



<p>“It’s not that we can’t, but I wonder if it would leave me exhausted” Kairi voiced his doubt.</p>



<p>For example, to what extent would a recovery magic recover him.</p>



<p>“Aah, if you have my magic, you’ll be fine even without sleep, you know♡?” said Misha with a smile.</p>



<p>“Eh, is that so?” Kairi’s eyes opened wide.</p>



<p><em>If you don’t get tired even without sleep, then that sure is amazing.</em></p>



<p><em>An elf’s magic must be amazing</em>, he was amazed.</p>



<p>“It sure is like breaking the rules… In the first place magic itself is breaking the rules, huh,” Kairi said, and smiled bitterly.</p>



<p>“Eeeh? It’s just a skill, you know♡?” Misha said calmly.</p>



<p>“Well I suppose it’s like that for you,” Kairi showed his understanding.</p>



<p>For an elf, magic was something they could use since childhood.</p>



<p>It might be like walking for him.</p>



<p>“Hey, is it fine not using more magic?” asked Misha.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. It’s worse to be conspicuous,” Kairi replied immediately.</p>



<p>Misha was already a beautiful girl who would garner attention, and she was unclear about the common sense over here.</p>



<p><em>To make matters worse, we don&#8217;t know what would happen if she were to use magic</em>, thus he had to be cautious.</p>



<p>“Oka~ay,” Misha replied disappointedly.</p>



<p>There was a hint that she hadn’t been convinced in any way.</p>



<p><em>At this rate, it seems she’ll ask me again sooner or later</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>He was thinking optimistically that he should just say it each time.</p>



<p>“But to be able to recover from exhaustion without sleeping sure is convenient,” he said.</p>



<p>“I know, right!?” Misha got energetic.</p>



<p>“I’m sure I haven&#8217;t been resting much, but my fatigue is gone,” Kairi recognized it.</p>



<p>So far, he had been living a life where he would somehow manage with recovery as the rest day in his company was always all over the place.</p>



<p>“Will this become, fruits of a wife’s labor? I wonder,” Misha asked.</p>



<p>“It will,” Kairi replied immediately, as without needing to go to sleep was reassuring.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m glad♡.” Misha was relieved, and placed her cheek on him.</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Kairi accepted it.</p>



<p><em>I think I can say her wholeheartedness is like a dog, but she sure is like a cat in that I don’t know what she might do</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Just to confirm, it’s time to go to rest for the day, right?” Misha went to ask once again.</p>



<p>“You’re right. I guess I just have this feeling of wanting to sleep,” replied Kairi.</p>



<p>Even though he was told he’d be fine even without sleep, he couldn’t think he would be able to so suddenly.</p>



<p>“Then how about getting used to it little by little?” Misha suggested.</p>



<p>“Hmm? I think that might be okay.” Despite tilting his head, Kairi didn’t refute it.</p>



<p>Even his reluctance was only somewhat.</p>



<p><em>Certainly, it seems I’d be fine once used to it</em>, he himself felt it.</p>



<p>For you see, he got a constitution where he would have to sleep at least seven hours each day or else he would have a tough time.</p>



<p>The loss of that could be said to be a huge advantage.</p>



<p>“You can let me know anytime, okay? I’ll be waiting,” Misha said and kissed him on the cheek.</p>



<p>“Yeah. If there’s one that could make your sleeping time less, I think I don’t mind giving it a try,” Kairi said, suddenly getting the idea.</p>



<p>He believed it was bad to keep dismissing her kindness.</p>



<p>At the same time, he doubted whether there was such a convenient thing.</p>



<p>“There is, you know?” Misha replied immediately.</p>



<p>“So there is.”</p>



<p>When Kairi turned his entire head to look at her, he saw her smiling sweetly.</p>



<p>“Yeah. There are ranks in magic, and the effects just differ. The lightest one would reduce it by about an hour, the next by about two I think,” she explained.</p>



<p>“Ooh, so it can have differences like that. It’s like shifting gears, and sounds convenient,” Kairi was impressed.</p>



<p>“Right? Right?” Misha responded positively.</p>



<p>She seemed pretty happy that he got interested.</p>



<p>“In that case I think it’s gonna make it easy to try it out.” Kairi got totally on board.</p>



<p>Misha’s magic skill was also high in proficiency, and that it was also reliable was big.</p>



<p>“Then let’s give it a try!” said Misha as if begging.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Do you want to use magic that much?”</p>



<p>In response to Kairi tilting his head, “I want to be helpful to you. Geez, you’re so insensitive.” Misha puffed up her cheeks.</p>



<p>“Aah, I see,” Kairi suddenly realized. At the same time, he reflected on how low he looked at her pureness. “Sorry,” Kairi simply apologized.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, but can you tell me what you were thinking?” Misha began asking while smiling. There was a pure curiosity in those eyes.</p>



<p>“Hnnng,” Kairi was troubled.</p>



<p>He got a little embarrassed to have to say it again.</p>



<p>“It’s all right, okay?” Misha urged him with a sweet voice.</p>



<p>She wasn’t using magic, but there was a mysterious power that seemed to dissipate his hesitation.</p>



<p>“Like, I thought for sure you wanted to go for a third round,” still, Kairi spoke with slight reserve.</p>



<p>“I see, I’d be lying if I say I don’t feel that way, you know♡?” Misha quickly admitted.</p>



<p>“I-is that so?”</p>



<p><em>I knew it</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I mean, I want to give birth to your baby after all♡,” Misha said and kissed him again.</p>



<p>“That makes me happy, but I think it’s fine not to rush it,” Kairi ended up talking about a cool-headed thing.</p>



<p>Raising a child would need money.</p>



<p><em>I think it’s fine after having a stable income, though</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“I guess so. For now I also have to make an income♡” Fortunately, Misha was quick to understand.</p>



<p>She was also proactive about making income herself.</p>



<p><em>She really is a good wife</em>, Kairi earnestly thought.</p>



<p>“Since I’m also off tomorrow, how about we jump right to it and start streaming tomorrow?” Kairi proposed to Misha.</p>



<p>If he would be there, it would be possible for him to back her up in case something happening.</p>



<p>“You’re right. It’s reassuring to have you around until I get used to it,” Misha agreed.</p>



<p>“Misha”</p>



<p>She was very cute at a point like this.</p>



<p>When Kairi gazed at Misha, Misha gazed back at him.</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Let’s sleep for today.”</p>



<p>Kairi did his best to avert his eyes.</p>



<p>Had they kept staring at each other, they might have gone into the third round.</p>



<p><em>The mood sure is up in the air</em>. <em>That’s close</em>, he reflected.</p>



<p>“You’re right. Good night,” Misha said and cast magic on him. “As promised, it’s magic to get a good night’s sleep and blow off fatigue, okay?” she said.</p>
