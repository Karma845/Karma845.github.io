<h3>Epilogue &#8211;  The Cute Child of Mine and My Elf Wife </h3>


<p>‘Misa’ had become one of the most popular streamers, easily earning more than ten million yen annually.</p>



<p>Kairi had quit his job, established an office for her, and moved into a 2-bedroom apartment.</p>



<p>And they’d been able to spend a much bigger amount of time together.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ I can’t believe it’s turning out this well♡,” Misha said and kissed Kairi.</p>



<p>“Yeah, really. You sure are a goddess of luck, Misha,” he replied and returned the kiss.</p>



<p>They were spending most of their extra time flirting around.</p>



<p>No different today.</p>



<p>“Fufu, if I was able to give a good result for you, then that’s just excellent.” Misha smiled contentedly.</p>



<p>She was so lovely that Kairi hugged her.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ chu♡.”</p>



<p>“Nmhnmh.”</p>



<p>They moved into a deep kiss.</p>



<p>“Puhaah.” The first to pull their lips away was Kairi.</p>



<p>“Dear, can you endure it?” Misha asked.</p>



<p>“Yeah. It’s just a bit more, right?” Kairi said, stroking her enlarged belly.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right,” she said and stroked her own big belly.</p>



<p>As a result of the increased time spent together and the increased earning, they’d stopped the contraceptive after discussing. And they’d been blessed with a new family.</p>



<p>“I sure hope it’ll get to be happy,” Kairi said, and stroked her belly once again.</p>



<p>As a streamer, ‘Misa’ was still active.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t get noticed by the viewers if there was a magic to inhibit cognition.</p>



<p>“Nah, I guess I’ll correct that.” Kairi raised his face. “Let’s make it happy with our hands. And let’s all be happy.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s more like it!” Misha accepted the correction with a smile.</p>



<p>“Right? Our new life has only just begun after all.”</p>
