<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; With You (Elf), Tomorrow Will Surely Be Filled Happiness as Well </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>“This sucks,” at night, Kairi muttered while embracing one another with Misha.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” she asked worryingly.</p>



<p>“I gotta go to work tomorrow,” Kairi briefly gave the reason.</p>



<p>“Aah, the job of this world, isn’t it?” Misha understood, “How about quitting?” and said with a serious face.</p>



<p>“Nah, I can’t really just… the salary is low and there&#8217;s a lot of overtime, but I still have to make a living,” Kairi replied seriously.</p>



<p><em>I was thinking she already knew the concepts of salary and money, though</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi reflected that he might’ve hastily jumped into conclusions.</p>



<p>“It will be easier if I make money right, right?” said Misha bluntly.</p>



<p>“That’s true, but live streaming is not easy, you know?” Kairi said, trying to calm her.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know. But, someday, okay?” she said.</p>



<p>“The feelings make me happy,” Kairi answered.</p>



<p>He could understand her feelings, so he thought of respecting it.</p>




<p>“I’m heading off for now.”</p>



<p>Morning, watching Kairi getting ready, Misha called to him as he was about to leave the apartment. “You’re forgetting your charm.”</p>



<p>“Charm?” As Kairi froze at his wife’s words, she kissed him.</p>



<p>“A lucky charm,” she said and then cast magic. “It’s two things: a kiss and magic, so I’m confident of its effect,” she said and smiled.</p>



<p>“It’s your charm so it sure sounds like it’ll work.” Kairi got encouraged and headed to work.</p>




<p>“What happened? Don’t you seem a lot different?” a male colleague at work talked to him.</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Kairi played innocent despite getting startled.</p>



<p>“Yeah. You seem in good shape there. Even though usually you’d look more tired.”</p>



<p>Having it pointed out, “Is that right? I don’t get it,” Kairi glossed it over.</p>



<p><em>This gotta be thanks to Misha</em>, he was sure of it.</p>



<p>He was also aware that he’d gotten completely energetic in the two days of spending time with her.</p>



<p>The miscalculation was only that it turned into a development where his colleagues would question him.</p>



<p><em>It’s also hard to say I got married</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>In any case, the partner was an elf from another world.</p>



<p>There was far too much information that couldn’t be said.</p>



<p>In the first place, even if he were to honestly explain the truth, they definitely wouldn’t believe with words alone.</p>



<p>“Really~?” His colleague doubted him, but immediately let him go while looking unconvinced.</p>



<p>However, Kairi was in a good shape all day that day.</p>



<p><em>For real, Misha’s charm totally got an immediate effect</em>, he was impressed in his mind.</p>



<p>Even though he usually would work overtime because of unfinished tasks, there was none today, so he could go home on time.</p>



<p>“When was the last time we left on time? That’s some pretty unusual stuff,” said a man who had joined the company at the same time.</p>



<p>Kairi left the company walking side by side with him.</p>



<p>“Probably since the first day, or somewhere that long,” Kairi said.</p>



<p>As far as his memory went, he couldn’t remember any other day when he’d been able to go home on time.</p>



<p>“Hahaha, that’s seriously crazy.”</p>



<p>He agreed with his colleague’s opinion.</p>



<p>Unable to return home on time except for the first day; even though it was such a company, he was able to go home on time once he got Misha’s charm.</p>



<p><em>It sure is double crazy</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>In regards to the latter, it was an impression he couldn’t share with his colleague, however.</p>



<p>“What do you wanna do? Now that we finally got to go home early, wanna go have a drink somewhere?” his colleague proposed.</p>



<p>“Eeh, I don’t think I,” Kairi reflexively rejected the idea.</p>



<p>Of course it was because there was Misha.</p>



<p><em>Now that I finally got to leave early, I wanna go back to my apartment</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>Now they would be able to have dinner together.</p>



<p>“C’mon man, that’s cold,” his colleague responded discontedly, but didn’t force it.</p>



<p>For better or worse, maybe it was because they’d been too busy with work to become that close with one another.</p>



<p><em>Normally I ought to be saddened about this, though</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi felt grateful for his current self.</p>



<p>Frankly, he didn’t like to go out drinking with people to begin with.</p>



<p>When Kairi returned to his apartment with an unusually light gait, Misha immediately went to greet him.</p>



<p>“Welcome home! You’re back early!”</p>



<p>Kairi was a bit moved by her radiant smile.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m sure it’s all thanks to your charm.”</p>



<p>To his words, “Really? I’m glad!” Misha delightfully laughed and went to hug him.</p>



<p>“Thank you,” catching her in his arms, Kairi thanked her.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I also wanted you to come home quickly, so I don’t need any thanks.” Misha fawned on him with upturned eyes.</p>



<p>“I see.” Kairi entered the apartment and put his bag down, “What are we gonna do for dinner?” and asked.</p>



<p>“I tried to make it,” replied Misha immediately.</p>



<p>“Eh, you’ve already made it?” Kairi opened his eyes wide at the unexpected development.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I couldn’t?”</p>



<p>Since Misha looked anxious, “That’s not the case at all. Thanks,” Kairi hurriedly thanked her.</p>



<p>“I see, thank goodness.” Misha made a relieved smile, “I used magic upfront so don’t worry,” and reported to him.</p>



<p>“I-I see.” Kairi too was relieved.</p>



<p>It seemed she was aware of her own clumsiness.</p>



<p><em>I’m sure it’s gonna be fine if she uses magic</em>, Kairi was also confident.</p>



<p>It was hard to discern whether she wasn’t used to this world, or whether she lacked much experience in not using magic, however.</p>



<p>“If it’s at home, it’s fine to use magic, right?” Misha checked with him.</p>



<p>“Yeah, as long as it&#8217;s magic that won’t leak outside, alright?” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>In short, he believed that it would be fine as long as it wouldn’t get exposed when she used it.</p>



<p><em>To say don’t do this or don’t do that is gonna make it uncomfortable anyway</em>, he also got such consideration for her.</p>



<p>“I was careful around that part, so don’t worry. When push comes to shove, there’s also the option to use cognition-inhibiting magic, or memory-alteration magic, though.”</p>



<p>Since Misha was without hesitation with her words, “Whoa there, don’t go saying any frightening things, alright?” Kairi cautioned her.</p>



<p>“Of course it’s a joke♡.” Misha smiled and kissed him.</p>



<p>“Yeah I know, but just to be sure, you know?” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>She got parts where she lacked common sense, but it was seldom of her to do something without his permission.</p>



<p>A relationship of mutual trust was already established.</p>



<p>“Fufu,” Misha laughed happily, perhaps it got through her.</p>



<p>“Do you want to take a bath first? Dinner first? Or maybe – me♡?” she asked sweetly.</p>



<p>Kairi got a chill down his back, though, “Just where did you learn that?” He showed a wry smile as much as possible.</p>



<p>“Fufu, with magic for information gathering,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Magic really is convenient, huh.” It was expected, so Kairi wasn’t surprised. “What’s for dinner? Is it anything that’ll still be good after a while?” Kairi asked.</p>



<p><em>If it’s something that would taste good freshly made, then I guess it’s eating first</em>, because he thought so.</p>



<p>“I made pot-au-feu and hamburger steak. Both are being preserved with magic, so we can enjoy them freshly made at any time,” Misha replied, and then sent him an expectant gaze.</p>



<p>“To be honest, my stomach is empty, though.” Kairi hesitated.</p>



<p>Had he returned home at the usual time, the meal would’ve been the obvious choice, but he got leeway today.</p>



<p>“Besides, I suppose you also wanted to have a go with the romance anyway,” he straightforwardly revealed.</p>



<p>“Oh my, then that means you will eat me first♡.” Misha smiled radiantly.</p>



<p>“You’re right. Since the cooking’s deliciousness won’t run away and all,” Kairi said and softly hugged her.</p>



<p>“I’m happy♡.”</p>



<p>Misha immediately stretched herself up and brought her lips to his.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ chu♡ chu♡.”</p>



<p>Kairi was a little bewildered by her vigor.</p>



<p>“Somehow, it’s the most aggressive you’ve been so far, huh.”</p>



<p>To his words, “You were gone from this morning until now, so I was lonely,” said Misha, sulking.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know.”</p>



<p>Kairi was struck in the chest by her loveliness.</p>



<p><em>To think it’s a reason like that.</em></p>



<p>They were married, living in the same apartment, and could see each other every day.</p>



<p>To think that he’d be told that she felt lonely regardless of that.</p>



<p>“I never would have even dreamed of it.” Kairi reflected. “It seems I still don’t completely understand you yet,” he said, and assertively kissed her as well.</p>



<p>“No, it’s okay,” Misha responded. “After all, now you’re together with me like this.”</p>



<p>Her admirable words fanned Kairi’s excitement.</p>



<p>“I see.” With the intention of not letting her go, Kairi hugged her.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a bit painful,” Misha said, but still accepted it.</p>



<p>Perhaps because she understood that her own words were the trigger.</p>



<p>After some time had passed, “You’re surprisingly someone who easily gets lonely, huh, Misha.” Judging that it would be okay to say it, Kairi teased his wife while unwrapping his arms.</p>



<p>“It was a surprise even to me,” Misha replied and kissed him on the lips. “That’s why fully make up for it, okay?” she begged.</p>



<p>Kairi already knew what she meant.</p>



<p>“Of course,” he replied and went to strip her clothes.</p>



<p>She, too, went to strip his clothes so as not to be outdone.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“Chu♡ chu♡ chu♡.”</p>



<p>This wasn’t the first time they were kissing while undressing each other.</p>



<p>They were getting better little by little.</p>



<p>“Fhuu, why don’t we get to the futon instead of in the kitchen?” Misha stopped her mouth and invited him.</p>



<p>“Hmmm, I think the kitchen’s also not bad once in a while,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>Futon was the traditional approach and the standard.</p>



<p><em>But I feel like it’s a waste to do it only there</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Of course only if you don’t mind it, though,” he added, leaving it to her.</p>



<p>He was thinking of going to the futon if Misha didn’t like it.</p>



<p>Though, since she’d tried to have their first time in the bath, it was also doubtful whether she would hate it in the kitchen, however.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind♡,” Misha replied immediately with a smile.</p>



<p>“I see.” Kairi felt it was coming. “What made you think the futon is better?” he asked out of curiosity.</p>



<p>“I mean, weren’t you not liking it in the bath? I was just thinking that you don’t like it on anything but the futon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Misha’s explanation made sense to him. “Because the bath is just small and all,” Kairi replied with a wry smile. “Also, I’m just kinda not comfortable with cumming in hot water,” Kairi confided to her, thinking that it would be better to talk it out.</p>



<p>“I see, so that’s how it is,” said Misha. It might be a strange pickiness unique to him. “No doing it in the bath then♡,” she said and kissed him again.</p>



<p>“Sorry about that.”</p>



<p>She shook her head at Kairi’s words. “Anywhere is fine as long as it’s with you, so don’t worry about it♡,” Misha said and kissed him further.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Kairi was starting to understand her character, so he decided to shift gear.</p>



<p>“Ah, should I have worn a naked apron?” Misha asked, maybe having shifted gear as well.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s not that I want you to immediately right now,” Kairi answered.</p>



<p>Misha also realized that he didn’t deny he had the desire for it.</p>



<p>“Then let’s leave it for next time♡,” she said.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it,” Kairi said and kissed her.</p>



<p>“Sure.” Misha nodded, put her hands on the sink, and pointed her beautiful butt at him. “Well?” She then provocatively wriggled her butt.</p>



<p>“Oh man.” Kairi’s crotch invigorated instantly. The seduction of the naked elf was immensely effective.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡.” Misha was satisfied seeing his crotch. “Now come♡,” she enticed.</p>



<p>“Well, as expected, it’s too sudden.” Kairi was still calm. He reached out his hand to touch her secret place. “It’s already wet…” He couldn’t hide his surprise at this.</p>



<p>“Because I’ve been kissing you♡” Misha appealed with moist eyes.</p>



<p>“Now I see” Kairi’s excitement was further fueled.</p>



<p>“You too♡” Misha nimbly went to touch his crotch. “It’s already this stiff, right?”</p>



<p>“I can’t deny that.” Touché, Kairi smiled. “Like husband like wife, aren’t we?”</p>



<p>“Yeah♡.”</p>



<p>They overlapped each other’s words, as well as their lips.</p>



<p>When they were done, Misha placed her hands again, and Kairi fit his manly sword on her hole.</p>



<p>“I’m putting in, okay?” He let her know.</p>



<p>“Okay, come♡ Cooome♡,” Misha begged in a sweet voice.</p>



<p><em>It’s the kind of voice that can degrade a man’s reason</em>.</p>



<p><em>I don’t want any other man to hear her voice like this</em>, he felt.</p>



<p>While realizing his possessiveness rising up, he penetrated her.</p>



<p>“AAaaah♡,” Misha’s shout of joy resounded.</p>



<p>“Uh-oh.” Kairi still had leeway, so he thought about being annoying to the neighbor. “Misha, can you use magic to block sound again?”</p>



<p>In response to him, “Yep♡ leave it to me♡.” Misha immediately invoked magic. “Now we don’t have to worry how heated we get♡,” she said, looking up at him.</p>



<p>It was like an expression on a puppy’s face expecting to be praised.</p>



<p>“Thanks. You’re so amazing, Misha,” Kairi answered to her expectation despite feeling it was forced.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡ come on♡ continue♡,” Misha begged him to continue with a happy smile.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know,” Kairi said, hammering hard.</p>



<p>“Aahn♡ so sudden wow♡.” Misha’s body shuddered. “I know it, you’re so wonderful♡,” she said, spilling a sigh.</p>



<p>“So are you,” Kairi replied immediately.</p>



<p>The amount of heat and the entanglements in her inside was the best as always.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know there was such an amazing thing,” he said as he was leaking ragged breath as well.</p>



<p><em>It seems there’s a saying about copulating like monkeys, but I understand well the feelings of wanting to copulate</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>In these few days, he felt he’d found a completely unknown self.</p>



<p>“Me too♡,” Misha said, shouting. “I didn’t know, that sexual act was this amazing♡. I’ve always been wondering why humans wanted to do iiiit♡,” she confessed.</p>



<p>“You too, huh.” He would never have thought that there had been a period when they’d been thinking similarly. “In fact, once experiencing it, we’re getting addicted to it, though, aren’t we?”</p>



<p>Kairi moved his hips while smiling wryly, instantly striking her favorite spot.</p>



<p>“Fuaah♡ aaaahn♡ y-you’re right♡,” getting entranced while panting, Misha acknowledged it.</p>



<p>Kairi slowly changed his thrusting position, and savored her inside.</p>



<p>“Aaaah♡ don’t change♡ the angle like that♡,” or so she said, but she was clearly happy.</p>



<p><em>I sure have heard a girl’s ‘no’ has the meaning ‘yes</em>,’ Kairi suddenly remembered.</p>



<p>It was incomprehensible at that time, but seeing it like this, now he got it; because Misha probably said ‘don’t’ with the meaning ‘more.’</p>



<p>“Experience is the best teacher, huh,” he murmured in whisper and quickened his moving in and out, muffling out his own voice.</p>



<p>“Ah♡ wait♡ so suddenly like that♡ aaaah♡,” Misha leaked out her voice, close to screaming.</p>



<p>She seemed to be bewildered by the sudden top speed.</p>



<p><em>But she doesn’t seem to hate it, huh</em>.</p>



<p>Both her voice and demeanor looked nothing but delightful.</p>



<p>Just to be sure, he tried adding more power without accelerating further.</p>



<p>“Goosh♡ that’s♡ that’s also good♡.” Misha panted.</p>



<p>“You’re pretty sensitive, huh,” Kairi said and smiled wryly.</p>



<p>He felt these were not words for a former virgin who never knew any other girls.</p>



<p>“That’s♡ that’s because you’re good♡ because you’re wonderfuuul♡,” Misha said in shambles.</p>



<p>“You’re totally making me happy there.”</p>



<p>Kairi’s crotch got even more energized.</p>



<p>Being praised by her this far worked to arouse him as well.</p>



<p>“Here!” he said and increased the in &amp; out movement.</p>



<p>“Aaahn♡ haaahn♡ oh♡ gosh♡” Her coquettish voice stimulated his ears.</p>



<p>The fact that he was pleasing his beautiful, erotic wife was filling him with self-esteem.</p>



<p>“You’re just too naughty…” he said in a small voice.</p>



<p>Not that Kairi was trying to speak ill of her, it was just right if anything.</p>



<p>“Is it bad? Is it bad I’m like this♡?” even so, apparently hearing it, Misha asked.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was instinct that was making her move her hips slowly.</p>



<p>“No, not at all!!” reflecting on it, Kairi denied it with all his might. “The naughtiness is mutual after all,” he added.</p>



<p>He himself was happy to be able to get a wife with whom he could have lots of sexual acts.</p>



<p>He didn’t intend to feign innocence.</p>



<p>“Ufufu♡ you’re also an amazing one, Kairi♡ haaah♡,” Misha teased.</p>



<p><em>Surprisingly got leeway there</em>, Kairi had a hunch.</p>



<p>Or perhaps it got nothing to do with whether there was any leeway or not.</p>



<p>“Sure is kinda frustrating,” Kairi muttered, feigning innocence that this time he himself also got a leeway.</p>



<p>If possible, he would like to take the leeway away from Misha first.</p>



<p>Kairi reached for her pearl and nipple.</p>



<p>“Ah♡ oh no♡ wait♡.” Having guessed she would be attacked on two points at the same time, Misha panicked.</p>



<p>He remembered what would happen if she was attacked at her weak points.</p>



<p>“I’m not gonna wait,” Kairi whispered close to her ears, and commenced the attack.</p>



<p>Her pearl was gently flicked, and a bit stronger on her nipple.</p>



<p>“Aaaaaaah♡ three places at the same time is cheating♡ you can’t do this♡.” Misha jerked up her body, surrendering already.</p>



<p>“I want you to make you feel even better after all.” Kairi consciously curbed his sadistic desire, and aimed to behave gentlemanlike.</p>



<p><em>What does a gentleman in sexual act even mean?</em> Such a self-quip was instantly gone.</p>



<p>“Uwh.” Misha’s inside tightened up even more, and the leeway was instantly gone from Kairi, and his hands also stopped for an instant.</p>



<p>“I can’t be the only one feeling good♡ you feel good, too♡,” said Misha while panting.</p>



<p>It appeared to be an intentional counterattack from her.</p>



<p><em>Can girls do this well of their own will?</em> Kairi was amazed.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because she was an elf, but it remained a shocking fact for him.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it feels…crazy good,” Kairi replied as he groaned.</p>



<p>“I’m glad♡.” Misha sounded happy, perhaps having got the message.</p>



<p><em>Alright, counterattack again</em>, Kairi thought and once again moved his hands.</p>



<p>Better to do it slowly on the crotch part until getting used to it, but not so on the hands.</p>



<p>“Aaaah♡ again♡ at the same time♡.” Misha’s back arched up.</p>



<p>The fact that her body was shaking ever so slightly must be because that was just how much better it was getting.</p>



<p>“Y-You keep on attacking♡ only on my weak spots♡.” The tone of Misha’s voice was changing.</p>



<p><em>Alright, it’s looking good</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi was satisfied that she was close to what she looked like when reaching climax.</p>



<p>At the same time, however, his thing was also being squeezed up.</p>



<p>“Kuh, this is bad…”</p>



<p>Still the same scarce-vocabulary-killing tightness.</p>



<p>The pleasure seemed to fry his brain up.</p>



<p>“Misha, can we now?” he asked.</p>



<p>“Yeah♡ make me cum just like this♡ come♡” she begged, having guessed it.</p>



<p>“Yeah, together,” Kairi said and started the last push.</p>



<p>“Aaah♡ haaaah♡ it became amazing again♡.” Misha’s moans are getting higher as well.</p>



<p><em>There sure’s a feeling of climaxing together</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“I’m cumming♡ cumming♡.”</p>



<p>“Coming out…!”</p>



<p>They reached climax at the same time.</p>



<p>Kairi pumped it firmly deep into her.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ lots are coming out♡ wonderful♡,” Misha said happily with an ecstatic expression.</p>



<p>“Phew.” Kairi exhaled deeply.</p>



<p>He, too, was lingering in the afterglow.</p>



<p>Despite the many times he’d experienced it, the pleasure didn’t change, not even one bit.</p>



<p><em>No, it might be getting amazing instead</em>, he sensed.</p>



<p>He didn’t voice it out because he wondered if there was such a thing.</p>



<p>“Haah♡ haah♡.” Limply, Misha was begging him for a kiss.</p>



<p><em>Sure looks like a spoiled puppy</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi took it adoringly.</p>



<p>Next she reached her hand between her legs and scooped the overflowing white stuff with her fingers.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡ seeing it like this really does make it feel more real♡ wonderful♡,” she said happily.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/q2cdt24.jpg"></img>


<p>They cleaned up the mess and went for dinner.</p>



<p>“For dinner is pot-au-feu and hamburger steak♡” Misha showed herself using magic to take out the cooking.</p>



<p>“Ooh!” Kairi’s eyes shone as both the appearance and smell were good. “Those sure look tasty!”</p>



<p>Misha smiled seeing him delighted and said, “I’m glad there are similar cuisines in this world.”</p>



<p>“So there’s one in your hometown, huh.” Kairi’s eyes opened wide.</p>



<p>“Yeah. The ingredients are different, though,” replied Misha.</p>



<p>“Is there surprisingly no difference in cuisines across worlds?” Kairi tilted his head.</p>



<p>“It might be just a coincidence. And it’s not like I know everything either.”</p>



<p>He thought that Misha’s reply was fair.</p>



<p>“Now, go eat up.” Kairi picked up the chopsticks as she urged him. “So skillful. I practiced chopsticks, but it’s hard.” Misha was impressed.</p>



<p>She could use spoons, knives, and forks well.</p>



<p>“And aren’t you good with other tableware?” Kairi pointed</p>



<p>“These types of things are no different from back home after all.” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p><em>Other world sure is mysterious</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>“There’s something I want to discuss after dinner, can we?” Misha asked him.</p>



<p>“Sure. What is it about?”</p>



<p>Kairi tried to make his own prediction.</p>



<p>The most probable one should be about daily life.</p>



<p><em>She must have nothing to do when I’m not around after all.</em></p>



<p>Working also got the purpose to avoid that.</p>



<p>“Yep, it’s about streaming,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“All right,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>It was as predicted, but he got no slightest clue of the content.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p><em>It won’t change much in just a day after all</em>, Kairi thought at heart.</p>



<p>Unless something extraordinary happened, he intended to acknowledge and support it if she were to say that she’d found something she wanted to try.</p>



<p>They both washed the dishes after finishing dinner, and then turned to each other again.</p>



<p>“Look.” Misha showed the phone to Kairi.</p>



<p>“Nn? The subscriber count is 80,000…?” Kairi doubted his eyes for an instant.</p>



<p>At most there should&#8217;ve been about 5,000 when he’d seen it the last time yesterday.</p>



<p>“It’s gotten like this when I noticed it, and I was told in the comments I also can apply for monetization, but what do you think?”</p>



<p>“For real!?” Kairi was shocked, “Is it really that easy to get monetized?” and mildly confused. “If you can do it, then why not?” Kairi said.</p>



<p>“All right,” Misha replied immediately. She seemed to intend to follow his decision.</p>



<p>“What kind of stream did you do?”</p>



<p>At his question, “I thought I had a normal stream, but the reaction was great, huh,” Misha spoke wonderingly.</p>



<p>“Let’s check it; there could be some clues,” Kairi said and watched the stream, “Ah…” and guessed it somewhat.</p>



<p>&gt;Clumsy girl cute.</p>



<p>&gt;So a clumsy girl this cute does exist irl, huh.</p>



<p>The answer was in the comment.</p>



<p>“I guess the fact that a ridiculously beautiful girl was a clumsy one just created a feeling of closeness. Just maybe, though,” he guessed.</p>



<p>“Is that how it is?” Mishas tilted her head wonderingly.</p>



<p>It seemed to be difficult for her to understand.</p>



<p>“It’s safe to assume so,” Kairi said. “Either way, it’s a happy miscalculation, huh.”</p>



<p>He’d thought it would take a few months at the earliest for her stream to take off.</p>



<p>“We did it!” Misha seemed to have been delighted by the time difference and clapped her hands merrily.</p>



<p>“Yeah, we have done it!” Kairi responded by giving a high-five. “We still need to be on guard, but it’s a big step forward, huh.”</p>



<p>She nodded at his words. “Yeah. Then I’ll go ahead and apply for monetization right away.”</p>



<p>“Sure.” Watching over his wife from close by, Kairi gently embraced her from behind.</p>



<p>“Oh my, what’s wrong?” Misha narrowed her eyes ticklishly.</p>



<p>“I was just thinking ‘how amazing’,” Kairi said, enduring the embarrassment.</p>



<p>“Eh? We still don’t know yet, right?” Misha replied with surprise.</p>



<p>“Well yeah.” Kairi smiled wryly as he was aware that what he was saying was befuddled. ”But I just don’t feel it’s right to not feel happy at all,” Kairi revealed his true feelings. “It doesn’t mean I don’t recognize your hard work.”</p>



<p>“I know and I don’t mind, you know? And your cautious side is also wonderful♡.” Telling him to not worry, Misha snatched a kiss from him.</p>



<p>“Nn.”</p>



<p>Kairi relaxed his shoulders in relief.</p>



<p>“Puhah.” After their lips parted, Misha smiled bewitchingly, “Wanna do a second one?” and directly invited him.</p>



<p>“Sounds good,” Kairi replied immediately, though, “I have work tomorrow, so gotta keep that in mind,” he didn’t forget to remind her.</p>



<p>“Then it’s time for recovery magic♡ there’s even more amazing magic, you know?”</p>



<p>Kairi was at a loss at Misha’s comeback. “My defeat there; not that it’s a match or anything, though,” he admitted with a smile.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡” Misha laughed and went to embrace him. “Then how about we work hard at making a baby?” she told him.</p>



<p>“Nah, I think we should be a bit more well-planned about making a baby,” Kairi voiced his hesitation. “It&#8217;s late for that, though; I’ve always finished inside.”</p>



<p>“Well, I can use magic for contraception, so it doesn’t matter either way to me,” Misha said casually.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know that.” Kairi’s eyes opened wide.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I forgot to tell you.” Misha got dejected.</p>



<p>“I certainly would’ve loved to know about it a little sooner,” Kairi admitted.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“Oh well. I already know how careless you can be.” He accepted her apology.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay,” said Misha. It seemed to be giving her mixed feelings to be seen as clumsy. “Hey, how about buying something once it gets monetized?” having pulled herself together, she proposed.</p>



<p>“Nah, I’d say it’s better to save it.” Kairi chose a pragmatic reply. “We’re probably gonna need a lot of money in the future… Oh right, I guess we&#8217;ll have to set up a bank account for you.” He made a face as if to say: <em>Oh shoot!</em></p>



<p>He wouldn’t be able to accompany her since he got only the weekend off.</p>



<p>“Aah, I went there today,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Eh? Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, while asking people in the comments. I managed somehow.”</p>



<p>A bankbook belonging to her was held out in front of the wide-eyed Kairi.</p>



<p>“You really did.” Kairi was half surprised and half relieved. “Do you know how to use the bank?”</p>



<p>She nodded to his question. “I’ve tried it after all.”</p>



<p>“I see.” Kairi swallowed everything despite having many things he’d like to say. “I’m glad you could manage it,” he said and hugged her once again.</p>



<p>“I have to become not helpless when you’re not around, or there will be no meaning in getting married.” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“I won’t say that’s wrong…” Kairi was amazed at her boldness and adaptability.</p>



<p>“I mean you’re working hard too, right? Even I want to work hard for you,” said Misha, staring at him straight.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Happy with her feelings, Kairi was unable to say anything.</p>



<p>“Also, I got myself this♡,” said Misha, taking out a wedding veil next.</p>



<p>“So, what’s the matter with this?” Kairi was surprised.</p>



<p>It shouldn’t have been something she could’ve bought so quickly.</p>



<p>“Actually you see, I brought it with me from my hometown; because I wanted to immediately put it on. One way or another it ended up getting put off, though,” she said and quickly went to change. “Well? How’s my wedding dress?” she asked while flaunting the snow shite dress at him.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Very beautiful,” Kairi replied while in daze at its excellence.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hey, Kairi?” Misha spoke while being hugged.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Wanna do it?” she bluntly invited him.</p>



<p>“You’re just spoiling the mood. Fufufu,” Kairi bursted into laughter.</p>



<p>It sounded very Misha-like to say something that disregarded the mood.</p>



<p>“Ufufu♡,” Misha laughed along, “Hey, is that a no?” and asked him in a sweet voice.</p>



<p>“It’s not a no,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>The stream seemed to be taking off, and the issue regarding contraception was also resolved.</p>



<p>And no need to worry about tomorrow’s physical concerns as long as there was magic.</p>



<p><em>…It sure is frightening if everything was calculated</em>, he suddenly thought such a thing.</p>



<p>“Say, Misha.” He pulled himself away from Misha and gazed into her eyes.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>Reflected in his eyes was his wife’s beautiful face he’d gotten completely used to seeing.</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s nothing.”</p>



<p>Before that beauty of hers, any questions he got ended up becoming inconsequential.</p>



<p>“You’re weird Kairi.” Knowingly or unknowingly, Misha giggled.</p>



<p>“Can we do the second one after taking a bath?” Kairi asked in a somewhat louder voice to play it off.</p>



<p>“Sure♡,” Misha replied immediately.</p>



<p>“All right, then it’s decided.”</p>



<p>But then, “But, I’d love to take a bath together♡,” Misha made a request.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Do you like taking a bath together?” Kairi tilted his head.</p>



<p>It appeared as though she got some obsession with it.</p>



<p>“Yeah. Isn’t it fun taking a bath together?” she easily admitted as well as revealing the reason.</p>



<p>“All right.” Kairi approved.</p>



<p>Setting aside if it was for a second round, there would be no reason to refuse if it was a genuine reason.</p>



<p>“Yay♡.” Misha clapped her hands in joy.</p>



<p>“It sure is somewhat embarrassing to have you so happy with it.” Kairi scratched his right cheek with his finger.</p>



<p>It was strange even for himself that the embarrassment surpassed the happiness.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡.”</p>



<p>Misha went to prepare for the bath while humming a song in a good mood.</p>



<p>The bath water would get hot in no time when left to her.</p>



<p>“I guess it would save time and utility costs.”</p>



<p>It would be for two people, so probably the water bill ought to go up.</p>



<p>“I’m happy if I can be of help.” Misha sweetly smiled while holding out a bath towel and a change of clothes to him.</p>



<p>“You definitely have been super helpful,” he replied.</p>



<p>Misha was helping him in every way possible.</p>



<p><em>At first I wasn’t sure what to do as she’s a clumsy girl, but that seems like a lie</em>.</p>



<p>While feeling nostalgic already, Kairi looked back.</p>



<p>“I’m glad,” said Misha, as he wrapped his arm around Misha’s shoulder, entering the bath together.</p>



<p>There was nothing happening in the bath as expected, but once they got out and put on their sleepwear, “Chu♡ chu♡,” Misha went to kiss him as though she couldn’t hold it anymore.</p>



<p>“Nmh, hmmh.” Kairi had also expected this so he took it without restraint.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kairi? Can I use magic?” Misha asked.</p>



<p>“Right,” Kairi replied, hesitating just for a moment. “Please do.” Despite his crotch already getting energetic, it would be necessary in consideration of tomorrow.</p>



<p>“Oka~ay♡.” Misha used magic.</p>



<p>“It sure is amazing how it instantly gives me energy.” Kairi felt it was amazing no matter how many times he’d experienced it.</p>



<p>“Fufu, my magic is top class even for elves after all!” Misha proudly puffed out her chest.</p>



<p>“You’re so amazing,” Kairi said.</p>



<p>He couldn’t imagine the particulars, but he could only guess that it was amazing.</p>



<p>“Thanks♡” Misha kissed him on the lips, “If you’ve gotten energetic then, you know?” and begged him with moist eyes.</p>



<p>“No need to mention it.” Kairi smiled, returned the kiss, and carried her in a princess carry.</p>



<p>“Kya!”</p>



<p>“Do you know this?”</p>



<p>At his question, “Eh, what?” Misha was puzzled, not knowing anything.</p>



<p>“It’s the so-called princess carry,” he said and kissed her once again.</p>



<p>“I see.” Misha made a face as if to say: <em>Ooh.</em></p>



<p><em>Doesn’t look so interested in it</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi felt he made a mistake.</p>



<p>“Humans sure do think of curious things, don’t they.” Misha was impressed.</p>



<p>“Ah, cultural differences, huh.” Kairi was undressing her while guessing the reason for the mistake.</p>



<p>“I wonder if I shouldn’t have worn it since it&#8217;ll be taken off immediately,” said Misha.</p>



<p>Though, he shook his head, “Nah, it takes the fun out of undressing,” replied and smiled.</p>



<p>At that, “Oh my♡,” Misha smiled back.</p>



<p>Even Kairi’s perverse-like answer seemed to be accepted by her. “How about this then?” she said and changed into a wedding dress with magic.</p>



<p>“Whoa.” Kairi was overwhelmed, but it quickly changed into excitement, “It sure feels like it’ll be a waste to strip this off…” and honestly told her.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I don’t mind; even with it on,” Misha said. “I think I’ll have my fun, too♡,” and she went to strip his clothes.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is it fun stripping a man’s clothes?” Kairi asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s fun stripping yours♡,” Misha replied with a smile.</p>



<p>“I see.” Kairi was getting undressed without saying anything. “Should we buy a futon when we get money?” he asked as he laid Misha on her back.</p>



<p>After all, what they got currently was a futon with thin bedding.</p>



<p>“Nnn. I think I want it if it’s something for two people,” replied Misha.</p>



<p>So it meant she wouldn’t need it if they would sleep separately.</p>



<p>“I got it.” Kairi also got a strong desire to sleep together.</p>



<p>As he gave a reply and kissed her, “Nnmh, nnnh,” Misha put her tongue in without delay.</p>



<p>Kairi reached his hand for her secret place.</p>



<p>Nectar was already overflowing, making wet noises.</p>



<p>“You’re so naughty,” he said, having interrupted the kiss.</p>



<p>“Geez, you meany♡.” Misha turned red in embarrassment.</p>



<p><em>Being assertive but still bashful, that really is just foul play</em>, Kairi thought without stopping his hand.</p>



<p>“Haah♡ noo♡.” Misha writhed at the feeling of Kairi’s finger.</p>



<p>Since it would be easy to get deprived of leeway when becoming one, he chose the strategy of thoroughly attacking her beforehand.</p>



<p>As he was thinking things were going as planned, her hand reached between his legs.</p>



<p>“I don’t want it, just me,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right.”</p>



<p>Kairi and Misha went to stimulate each other’s important bit.</p>



<p>“Aah, haah♡ aaaah♡.” Misha also thoroughly rubbed his crotch as she panted.</p>



<p>Nectar was pouring out of her secret place more and more.</p>



<p>“Want to cum just like this?” he asked.</p>



<p>At his question, “Eh, wait♡ put it in,” Misha begged for insertion. “Let’s become one♡.”</p>



<p>“All right, I heard you.” Kairi listened to her request.</p>



<p>He felt it was somewhat different from being mean.</p>



<p>He’d gotten used to it completely, so he penetrated her easily.</p>



<p>“Aaaaaah♡ it really is wonderful♡,” Misha squealed in joy, and her body lightly shuddered.</p>



<p>“You are the best, too,” Kairi said as he took a breath.</p>



<p>There was a different kind of excitement to become one with her in her wedding dress.</p>



<p>“I’m so happy♡ let’s feel good a lot♡ let’s both feel good♡.” Misha squeezed his manly sword.</p>



<p>“Yeah…” Kairi agreed, and stimulated her nipples and pearl at the same time.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ no♡ don’t do that♡.” Misha’s body trembled, and her sweet voice echoed.</p>



<p>Kairi went to move slowly while satisfied with her lasciviousness.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ I am♡ weak there♡.”</p>



<p>Hearing Misha’s voice gave rise to mischievousness in him.</p>



<p>“Can I have you beg for more?” he asked, having judged that it would be more like him to straight out request it than being mean.</p>



<p>“More♡ Kairi, more♡,” Misha immediately responded.</p>



<p>“All right.” Filled with a desire for domination of being begged by her, Kairi moved enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Aaaaaaaah♡ aaah♡ haaaaaahn♡.” Her voice got especially louder, and they were reaching climax together.</p>



<p>“Here it comes again,” Kairi called to her.</p>



<p>“Yeah, come♡ let it out inside♡ let it out a lot♡,” Misha begged hard in a sweet voice, perhaps in consideration to his earlier request.</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vdotks7.jpg"></img>


<p>Kairi reached climax at her deepest part while happy about her feelings.</p>



<p>“Haaah…♡ haaah…♡.”</p>



<p>Their ragged breath overlapped, and they went to kiss one another.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kairi.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>While wrapping her hands behind his back, Misha said, “I’m so happy”.</p>



<p>“Me too,” Kairi replied and kissed her again.</p>
