<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; The First Night with an Elf Wife </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“How was it? My first kiss,” Misha asked after she was done with the rain of kisses.</p>



<p>“A-amazing.” Kairi could give only nothing but a childlike impression.</p>



<p>“I’m glad. It was worth all the mental rehearsal.” She was satisfied.</p>



<p>“You’ve been doing mental rehearsal?” Kairi asked while still in a daze.</p>



<p>“I mean, I don’t wanna kiss any other man. I belong to you♡.” She did say a loveable thing, but that expression of hers was still that of a hunter.</p>



<p>“&#8230;!” Nevertheless, it had sufficient destructive power for Kairi. “Tha-thanks,” he thanked her.</p>



<p><em>To think that it would turn out this way</em>, he thought, and immediately after, Misha began to undress.</p>



<p>“Eh, hey.” The words came out reflexively.</p>



<p>“Hm? You saw it earlier, right?” Misha said wonderingly without stopping her hands.</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah, you’re right.”</p>



<p>Kairi ended up thinking, <em>too late for that, huh</em>.</p>



<p>Moreover, he felt like he couldn’t go against Misha’s momentum anymore.</p>



<p>“Hey, how am I?” now naked, she asked with a revised look.</p>



<p>“Beautiful, immensely so,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>In fact, she was so beautiful it was mystical.</p>



<p>The only flaw would probably be the breast size, but he wasn’t one for big breasts, so it didn’t bother him.</p>



<p>“Thanks,” Misha replied with the cutest, angelic smile.</p>



<p id="jump-1"><em>So not an elf but an erofu</em><sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, Kairi thought, but such a thought ended up getting blown away.</p>



<p>“I’ll undress you too, okay?” Without reservation, Misha stripped off his top.</p>



<p>The awkwardness in the way she was moving her hands spoke of her lack of experience.</p>



<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>After having her pants taken off, he was kissed by her again.</p>



<p>“Nnnnn.”</p>



<p>Kairi was gradually becoming accustomed to the feel of her lips, but feeling the sweetness and eroticism instead, he couldn’t get any strength in his body.</p>



<p>“Hnmmmmm… slurp slurp♡.” Misha brought her tongue in next.</p>



<p>“!?!?!?” Kairi was confused at the not yet known experience.</p>



<p><em>Eh what, is this?</em></p>



<p>He pretty much got the knowledge, but his emotion didn’t follow.</p>



<p>“Slurp slurp slurp.” Misha’s tongue moved around inside his mouth, and it felt good.</p>



<p><em>Crap</em>…</p>



<p>He couldn’t think of anything anymore.</p>



<p>The feeling of miserableness as a man from being unilaterally preyed on by Misha went off somewhere.</p>



<p>“Slurp slurp♡ I’m going to make you feel good♡.”</p>



<p>Even Misha’s voice resounded sweetly, making it seem as though as long as it felt good, that was all that mattered.</p>



<p>“Nnn.”</p>



<p>“Slurp slurp♡ puha~h♡.”</p>



<p>Finally, Kairi parted his lips from Misha, but immediately the kisses came raining down on his cheeks and throat.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡ Kairi♡ the Kairi I dreamed of♡.” A great joy was escaping Misha’s mouth.</p>



<p>“The things you’re saying are so cute,” Kairi muttered.</p>



<p>“My, only what I say?” stopping what she was doing, Misha asked slightly in complaint.</p>



<p>“Nah, everything is cute,” Kairi hurriedly corrected it.</p>



<p><em>I’d have to be careful in how I compliment a girl</em>, he presumed so instinctively.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ it’s like I forced you to say it, sorry♡,” Misha said, and kissed him again.</p>



<p>“Nah, no need to-nnnhm.”</p>



<p><em>Apologize for that</em>, was the rest of what Kairi wanted to say, but it was blocked by her kiss.</p>



<p><em>It’s just kissing, but it’s making my head spin</em>.</p>



<p>And then his nether region was getting hot.</p>



<p>“Fufu, how amazing♡.” Misha gently touched his nether region.</p>



<p>“Uwh.”</p>



<p>Becoming much more sensitive, he ended up feeling it just by being touched.</p>



<p>“Woo~ow♡.”</p>



<p>“Uh-uhuh.” Being stroked by Misha, Kairi’s voice sounded shrill.</p>



<p>Of course, he had no experience of being touched by a girl at all.</p>



<p>“I’ll undress the bottom too, okay?” After giving a heads up, she took off his pants. “Wah♡.” Misha’s eyes sparkled at the sight of his penis.</p>



<p>Kairi thought, <em>somehow it’s different from what I expected</em>, but he dismissed the thought as it was too late for it.</p>



<p>“Then I’m going to immediately get to it~.”</p>



<p>And then Misha’s easy-goingness was far more lighter than imagined.</p>



<p>“Wait, are you sure about it?” Kairi got the leeway to ask as a slight gap was opened in Misha’s attack.</p>



<p>“I mean we’re husband and wife now, so the difference is whether it’s sooner or later, right?”</p>



<p>“What an amazing outlook.” Kairi was impressed, all things considered.</p>



<p>The time for their mutual first time experience finally came.</p>



<p>“Nnn,” Misha moaned with a pained expression indeed.</p>



<p>“I-incredible…” Kairi muttered after the sensation of penetrating through a resistance.</p>



<p>“I think this might be tough,” said Misha; nevertheless, she was bravely smiling.</p>



<p>“D-don’t push yourself, okay?” Kairi reflexively voiced out his concern.</p>



<p>He could tell somehow that she was being rash.</p>



<p>He was being swept away, but nonetheless, it didn’t mean he didn’t think of anything.</p>



<p>“I-I’m fine…” Misha said, and used magic after. “See, this way I can make the pain go away.”</p>



<p>“You’re strong.” Kairi was dumbfounded at her returning to her usual smiling face.</p>



<p>“Nnnh… It’s so burly♡,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Is, that so?” Kairi had never made any comparison whether his own was big or not, so he didn’t know.</p>



<p>“Yes. It’s the ideal for me♡,” Misha commended.</p>



<p>“I-I see, then that’s great.”</p>



<p>Even Kairi got the feeling of wanting to satisfy a girl.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ It looks like our chemistry is spot on,” Misha said and kissed him again.</p>



<p>“It might be,” Kairi agreed.</p>



<p>The words ‘it’s only just started, though’ didn’t come to his mind.</p>



<p>He was already completely affected by her passion and sweetness.</p>



<p>“Then maybe I’ll try moving♡,” Misha stated.</p>



<p>The pain from the first time experience was all gone, it seemed.</p>



<p>As she was slowly moving her hips, “uwah, your inside is, incredible,” Kairi reflexively muttered as it was clamping up, squeezing him.</p>



<p>If there was ever a pleasure that words couldn’t describe, it was one he was savoring right now.</p>



<p><em>I never knew there was such a pleasure!</em> Kairi was emotionally moved.</p>



<p><em>Welp, no wonder there are people who are addicted to sex in this world</em>.</p>



<p><em>I was clueless, so I wasn’t able to understand it</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“So? How is it? Inside me♡,” Misha asked while moving slowly and awkwardly.</p>



<p>“Insane, it feels so good it’s insane,” Kairi gave an immediate reply.</p>



<p>She was greatly gratified by the words that came out following his instinct.</p>



<p>“I’m glad♡ it’s also making me feel good♡ your manly sword,” she marveled.</p>



<p>“Manly sword…” Kairi felt somehow embarrassed.</p>



<p>He also had never imagined that it’d be more embarrassing and such as opposed to having it said bluntly.</p>



<p>“My, isn’t that splendid?” Misha confidently complimented.</p>



<p>“Yeah, thanks. And you’re beautiful, too,” Kairi bashfully returned a compliment.</p>



<p>“Fufufu♡ I’m so happy♡.” Embarrassed, Misha resumed moving. “Hey, are you feeling good?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, so much so I’m at a loss for words,” Kairi immediately replied.</p>



<p>In fact, it took him a considerable effort to avoid all of his consciousness being taken away.</p>



<p><em>So much that I’d want to indulge in it forever</em>.</p>



<p><em>Maybe I won&#8217;t be able to go back</em>, so much so that such fear was born in him.</p>



<p>“It’s wonderful♡.” Misha kissed him once again.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s the best,” and Kairi returned it.</p>



<p>“Then, will you also do the moving?” Misha coaxed him.</p>



<p>“Eh, me also?” Kairi was bewildered at the unexpected words.</p>



<p>“I mean, it’s somehow embarrassing, that it’s just me one-sidedly wanting,” she said fawningly.</p>



<p>“Is-is that so?”</p>



<p>Kairi was puzzled on the inside.</p>



<p><em>She’s feeling embarrassed after coming this far?</em></p>



<p><em>I don’t know anything about this living being called elf, </em>he had thought, but he got a feeling that that emotion amplified it even more.</p>



<p>“T-that’s right. Also doesn’t it make you anxious? If you think, ’I think I’m the only one who&#8217;s so into it’.” Misha’s expression turned cloudy.</p>



<p><em>Cu-cute</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi almost couldn’t handle it.</p>



<p>His heart was shaken by the sudden gap shown by the girl of the beautiful-looking elves, who had been passionate as well as seductive until a moment ago.</p>



<p>“Of course I also want you, Misha,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>There was no lie in this feeling.</p>



<p>“Really?” It appeared Misha’s anxiousness was still there.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Kairi gave a strong nod.</p>



<p>It might not be a thing to say while two people were connected, but they were both serious.</p>



<p>“Then, will you do the moving?” Misha requested again.</p>



<p>“Me doing it?” Kairi made sure.</p>



<p>“Yes.” Misha nodded while staring fixedly at him with moist eyes.</p>



<p>It was a very arousing spectacle and it was keeping his nether region hot.</p>



<p>“I don’t know how I should do it, so I’m not sure if I can do it well, though.”</p>



<p>Hearing what Kairi said, “it’s also my first time, so I don’t know,” Misha said, letting out a chuckle.</p>



<p>“Now that you mentioned it.”</p>



<p>He’d started to forget it since he’d been continuously pressed on by her activeness and sexiness, but she had also been a virgin.</p>



<p>There would be no such thing as her knowing the way of doing it even if a little.</p>



<p>“Fufufu,” they laughed at the same time.</p>



<p>At least the tension was coming out of Kairi.</p>



<p>“Th-then, heee I go,” Kairi tried to voice it, but he got nervous and fumbled.</p>



<p>He cleared his throat, and tried to slowly move.</p>



<p>“Fwa–aah,” Misha let out a sweet moan.</p>



<p>He only moved just enough, but she was clearly delighted.</p>



<p>“Is-is like this okay?”</p>



<p>Kairi moved his hips half in doubt and pushed up into her.</p>


<p>“Nn♡ like that♡ it’s so good!” Composure disappeared from Misha’s expression, and the tone of her voice also changed.</p>



<p>The movements of the two that had been awkward at first gradually came into unison.</p>



<p>“Damn…” Kairi could only come up with a dim-witted vocabulary.</p>



<p>“Aahn, wow♡ Kairi so amazing♡.” Misha being Misha, she was completely entranced.</p>



<p>Not even they themselves could believe that this was each other’s first time.</p>



<p>“I’m cumming! For the first time! I’m cumming with Kairi!”</p>



<p>“M-me, too!”</p>



<p>They climaxed around the same time.</p>



<p>Kairi’s sperm was, of course, being pumped into Misha’s.</p>



<p>“Nnn♡ wow♡.” Misha accepted it with an ecstatic look on her face.</p>



<p>“Haahh, haahh, haahh…” Kairi was breathing heavily.</p>



<p>He had originally been exhausted from work, so the exhaustion was all the more greater.</p>



<p>“Ah, oh shi.” Having his head cooled down together with the exhaustion, Kairi realized that he had let it out to his heart’s content inside Misha.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” Misha asked wonderingly as she was touching her hair with her left hand while they were still connected.</p>



<p>“No I mean, I did it inside you,” Kairi pointed out while his heart was pounding.</p>



<p>“Aah, that.” Misha smiled as if to say it was not a big deal. “We’re husband and wife, so it’s fine. If anything, make me bear one♡,” she said composedly.</p>



<p>“Ah, okay, but, we have to plan ahead when trying to have a baby.”</p>



<p>Despite feeling relieved for being forgiven for letting it out inside, Kairi thought, <em>I suppose Misha doesn’t know anything about childcare in this world.</em></p>



<p>“Is that how it is?” Misha was puzzled.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Kairi nodded his head and was struck by a bad feeling.</p>



<p><em>Don’t tell me she doesn’t know anything</em>…</p>



<p>Then he immediately shook his head.</p>



<p><em>That shouldn’t be the case in any way</em>, he was telling himself.</p>



<p>They separated for now and tried to do the clean up, but, “fufu, I see that you let out a lot♡ I’m so happy,” Misha said contentedly, making Kairi’s hands stop.</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah, it’s kinda embarrassing.” Even though he had let it out a lot inside a beautiful elf, he was more embarrassed than excited.</p>



<p><em>I wonder if it’ll be any different once I get used to it</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“So cute♡,” Misha said while putting on her clothes.</p>



<p>“Uwh, this feels complicated.”</p>



<p>As for Kairi, he would be happier to be told ‘so cool.’</p>



<p>Of course he knew that she was saying it out of affection, but he couldn’t help the feeling of wanting to refute it.</p>



<p>After putting on clothes, they wrapped themselves in the futon, turned off the light, and gazed at each other.</p>



<p>Despite the darkness making it hard to see, Kairi’s heart was beating fast for some reason.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m so happy, Kairi,” Misha said unexpectedly, and then went to genty hold Kairi’s hand.</p>



<p>“What is it? It’s so sudden,” Kairi asked while squeezing back that hand.</p>



<p>“I mean, I was able to meet you again, and tied together like this after all,” she replied.</p>



<p><em>Those are words filled with honest feelings</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>“Yeah… I’m happy.” It was impossible to not feel happy to be thought of wholeheartedly.</p>



<p>Kairi regretted himself for not being able to find any tasteful words to say.</p>



<p>“Really?” Misha stared fixedly at him.</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad.” Misha let out a chuckle in relief.</p>



<p><em>I’ve got a feeling that something is wrong, though.</em></p>



<p><em>This must also be our relationship</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>The other party was an otherworlder, moreover an elf.</p>



<p>Even fellow Earthlings got different senses of values, making adjusting between one another necessary, so it was also obvious that she would be different.</p>



<p><em>I suppose it’ll be another tough one from tomorrow</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>However, the current him had no more energy to think about anything any more.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I’m awfully sleepy,” Kairi apologized.</p>



<p>He had heard that leaving a girl right after the fact wasn’t good.</p>



<p>Even so, the oncoming sleepiness seemed to be winning.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. Thank you for your hard work. Take a good night’s rest,” without getting angry, Misha replied with a smile like that of a holy mother.</p>



<p>“Let’s sleep for today, and have a talk again tomorrow,” Kairi suggested.</p>



<p><em>My head isn’t working so I don’t see it, but I’m sure there must be things I’m overlooking</em>.</p>



<p>In a negative sense, he was having faith in himself.</p>



<p>“You’re right.” Even Misha didn’t seem to have any objection about getting some sleep for the time being.</p>



<p>She went to set up a hammock near Kairi.</p>



<p>“So elves in a hammock…”</p>



<p><em>Maybe it isn’t strange since they probably sleep in the forest.</em></p>



<p>Trying to understand it, Kairi tucked himself under the futon.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>“Morning, huh.”</p>



<p>Kairi was woken up by the morning sunlight streaming into the room.</p>



<p>He looked at his phone and it was 8:30 in the morning. “Oh shoo… wait, today’s a day off, huh.” Despite getting into panic for an instant, he immediately regained his calm.</p>



<p>Then he glanced at Misha, who was sleeping right beside him.</p>



<p>“So it wasn’t a dream after all, huh,” he murmured.</p>



<p>The beautiful elf girl he had met and parted with as a child had come barging in, become his wife, and even had her first time with him.</p>



<p>“It’s a very real matter that seems like nothing but a dream, isn’t it,” he said to himself.</p>



<p>“Nnh.” Misha stirred, and raised her body up while rubbing her eyes.</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry. Did I wake you?” said Kairi to her, but she slowly shook her head.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Kairi,” said Misha with a smile.</p>



<p>“Yeah, good morning,” Kairi replied as he thought: <em>this is nice.</em></p>



<p><em>It sure has been a long time since I’ve woken up early in the morning and immediately greeted someone.</em></p>



<p>He had always been living alone ever since entering college.</p>



<p>He had never felt lonely, but thanks to Misha, he might have discovered a new self.</p>



<p>“So, what to do with breakfast?” Kairi asked her as she had woken up.</p>



<p>There was nothing in the refrigerator.</p>



<p><em>I suppose we can both go out to eat</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>“Nnn, should I cook again? I’m your wife after all,” Misha said, “ehehe,” and laughed.</p>



<p>It seemed she was embarrassed herself from calling herself a wife.</p>



<p>“So cute,” words of compliment came out naturally out of Kairi’s mouth.</p>



<p>He had given up on his lack of vocabulary.</p>



<p>“Thanks. You too, Kairi. You’re so cool♡,” as though returning a favor, Misha, too, complimented him.</p>



<p>“Self-esteem sure is rising up first thing in the morning.” Kairi smiled.</p>



<p><em>A cute girl really is justice, and being complimented by a cute girl is also justice</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“I mean Kairi, it’s just wonderful. I feel so happy to be able to talk to you first thing in the morning like this, you know?” Misha said while smiling.</p>



<p>“You sure are good at giving compliments, Misha.” Kairi was awed.</p>



<p>Even anyone would be happy to be complemented with a smile like her.</p>



<p><em>That’s gotta be her charm</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>“Is that so?” With a smile, Misha came lying down towards him and snuggled close.</p>



<p>“Yes it is.” On the spur of the moment, Kairi stroked her hair, “ah, sorry,” and then stopped his hand, and apologized for touching without permission.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. It’s a special right only for you♡,” Misha said with a sweet voice, and placed her face up on his chest.</p>



<p>“I’m so happy,” Kairi felt from the bottom of his heart; only he himself was allowed to touch such a wonderful, cute, and charming elf.</p>



<p>“And Kairi, don’t look at other girls besides me, okay?” Misha cutely reminded him.</p>



<p>“That’s of course,” Kairi immediately replied without any hesitation.</p>



<p>His life originally had never been one with a woman, so there was no reason for her to worry.</p>



<p><em>But, saying it clearly is kinda, hmmm yeah.</em></p>



<p>Even he had a little bit of a male pride.</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s good, then. Chu♡.” Misha kissed him on the cheek.</p>



<p>It seemed she was reassured.</p>



<p>“Alright, it’s time for food now. But now I want to stay like this forever, though,” Kairi made up his mind and stood up.</p>



<p>The time spent lying down together with Misha was just so sweet that it made him think he’d like to stay that way forever.</p>



<p>“You’re right. It’s regrettable, though,” Misha agreed and stood up.</p>



<p>“I also find it regrettable, but today is, yeah.” Kairi smiled.</p>



<p>There would be things needed to be done now that he’d started living together with Misha.</p>



<p>First should be to come at the prospect of a solution.</p>



<p>Kairi was the type who’d like to get issues done early.</p>



<p>“Speaking of food, I feel bad having you cook again.” Kairi shook his head.</p>



<p>“But, there’s nothing in the thing called refrigerator, right?” Misha unreservedly pointed out.</p>



<p>“Urgh…” Kairi was at a loss for a reply.</p>



<p>He was lacking the cooking-related know-how to make a quick come back.</p>



<p>“And I still have the ingredients I’ve brought. Don’t you think it’s fine if I just cook?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I guess so.”</p>



<p>Overcome by Misha in the end, Kairi was treated to breakfast.</p>



<p>“You’re so good at cooking, Misha,” Kairi praised her without saying a word about the use of magic.</p>



<p>“Fufu, thanks. I’ve practiced after all.” Misha puffed up her not-so-great chest proudly.</p>



<p>Kairi breathed a sigh of relief while having water since there was no tea for after meals.</p>



<p>“I’m getting married, but what should I do?” Kairi said in a small voice so she didn’t hear it.</p>



<p><em>Isn’t it impossible to have an officially recognized marriage with an elf from another world who has no family register in the first place?</em></p>



<p>Only now did Kairi finally notice it.</p>



<p>The reason that it hadn’t come up in his mind before was probably because his head hadn&#8217;t been working properly due to fatigue and confusion.</p>



<p>“&#8230;No need to register for marriage, huh,” Kairi muttered.</p>



<p>Things should work out in the form of de facto marriage.</p>



<p><em>Rather, I can’t think of any other way</em>, he reached to a conclusion in his mind.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Kairi?” Misha suddenly apologized.</p>



<p>“That’s so sudden, what’s up?” Kairi was confused by the suddenness.</p>



<p><em>Don’t tell me, did she hear me talking to myself?</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve done it</em>, he thought, but it was probably too late.</p>



<p>“I mean, I was just thinking only about my feelings, and never gave a thought about your feelings and situation.” Dropping her shoulders, Misha was looking remorseful.</p>



<p>“Ah, well…” As for Kairi, who was good-natured and simple, simply that alone made any dissatisfaction and confusion towards her go away somewhere.</p>



<p><em>Speaking of elves, I thought that they were more prim and proper, and modest, but it seems it was just mere fantasy</em>.</p>



<p>An erofu rather than an elf, or maybe it’d be more fitting to be called a succubus.</p>



<p>Of course, the women weren’t obligated to be according to Kairi’s self-created image, however.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it.” Kairi smiled.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was only his imagination, but the sight of Misha looked so fragile.</p>



<p>She was an otherworlder (?) who had come here with only Kairi to rely on.</p>



<p>“I’m so confused, but it’s not like I hate it, okay?” said Kairi as he wondered whether this could comfort her.</p>



<p>“Is that so? Then I guess it’s fine.” Misha was relieved, and the cheerfulness returned to her expression.</p>



<p><em>What a quick recovery</em>, Kairi was awed.</p>



<p>But were she not of this level of mentality, she might not have come barging into the place of an otherworlder to become a wife.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” Misha asked blankly.</p>



<p>“It’s nothing. Wanna go out shopping or something?”</p>



<p>Kairi was unable to say: <em>I don’t have much surplus, though</em>.</p>



<p>“Okay. Besides, I also have to find a job over here!” Misha spoke while rolling up her sleeves.</p>



<p>“Ah, you’re right,” Kairi agreed.</p>



<p><em>So she understands that part</em>.</p>



<p><em>It saved me the trouble of explaining</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>At the same time, he questioned if there would be any difference between knowing it and not knowing it.<em> </em>“What can you do?” he tried to ask.</p>



<p>And then, “I suppose I can do something,” she replied as though this had nothing to do with her at all.</p>



<p>“What an amazing optimism.” And that too at a paper-thin level difference with being thoughtless.</p>



<p>Kairi was almost shocked.</p>



<p>“I’ll say this just in case, don’t use magic in front of other people as much as possible, okay?” he warned.</p>



<p>If it were discovered that an elf who could use magic appeared in Japan, no one would know what might happen.</p>



<p>“Yes. That seems to be the better way to go. I’m also planning to hide the fact that I’m an elf,” Misha replied perceptively.</p>



<p>“&#8230;If you understand that part, then we might be able to manage somehow.” Kairi was relieved a little. “Speaking of, how would you hide the fact you’re an elf?” however a next question arose.</p>



<p>“With concealment magic. I was waiting outside until I met you, but it didn&#8217;t cause a commotion, right?”</p>



<p>“Now that you mentioned it.” Kairi came to an understanding from Misha’s words.</p>



<p>If an elf was crouching outside of the building, there would be no way it wouldn’t cause any commotion.</p>



<p>The fact that there hadn’t been any meant that Misha got the means to avoid it.</p>



<p>“A job Misha can do, huh.”</p>



<p><em>I wonder what she could do without magic</em>. <em>Precisely because she’s optimistic, I’d have to be realistic</em>, Kairi ended up thinking in earnest.</p>



<p>“Her face sure is overwhelming just for being an elf.” So much so that everyone would believe it if she said she was a thousand years old angel.</p>



<p>Although her breasts were small, her waist and four limbs were slender, making her seem like she could work as a model.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I guess show business is too risky for her.”</p>



<p>Misha didn’t seem to have the skills to make it through the show business.</p>



<p>Even if the base material alone was second to none, there was nothing but worry.</p>



<p>“Sho… bis… niz?” Misha was puzzled, perhaps not having been able to gather the information beforehand. “Isn’t it pointless just sitting around thinking about it?” Then said Misha. “I think a place where they’d let me work for a trial would be nice.”</p>



<p>Her request was innocent, but at the same time Kairi thought it was absurd.</p>



<p><em>Is there even a workplace that would hire someone without a family register, and without even asking the circumstances?</em></p>



<p>Despite being doubtful, Misha’s cheerfulness and positive thinking won him over, so he first tried to give it a go.</p>



<p>Then he realized the mistake.</p>



<p>When doing a part-time job at a family restaurant, “please don’t blow away the pot!!”</p>



<p>When doing a part-time job at a hardware store, “aaah, that’s an expensive glass!!”</p>



<p>When doing a part-time job at a moving service, “why’s the truck toppled sideways when carrying a load!?”</p>



<p>Maybe it was because Misha was a cute girl, but surprisingly there were places willing to accept a ‘trial,’ but it resulted in a disaster.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Phew, that was rough.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>They were now on a street with not that much pedestrian traffic.</p>



<p>In any case, they’d moved about trying to avoid the public eye.</p>



<p>Granted, there were lines of houses nearby, so it didn’t mean that they’d avoided people in real sense, but it didn’t matter to Kairi at the moment.</p>



<p>“It sure exceeded my imagination. I was naive.”</p>



<p>Next to Kairi, who let out a sigh, Misha splogized dispiritedly.</p>



<p>Despite him not meaning to blame her, neither was she smiling given that it was just right after the things she had done where it was so strange that they hadn’t been demanded to pay for the damages.</p>



<p>“Without magic, you’re more of a clumsy girl than expected, huh,” was Kairi’s honest impression.</p>



<p>Setting aside other matters, would it not be a miracle that there had been no questions about the truck toppling sideways?</p>



<p>“&#8230;On the outside you look like a dainty girl after all. You didn’t seem like you could possibly have the power to topple a truck sideways I suppose.”</p>



<p>Even Kairi was under the assumption that without magic, Misha couldn’t do amazing things.</p>



<p>Even so, in reality it seemed that the physical abilities of elves were exceeding those of Earthlings.</p>



<p>“W-what should we do?” Misha seemed to be thinking that at this rate she wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a job; looking dismayed, she turned imploring eyes at him.</p>



<p>“A way to earn money even without working, huh…” As Kairi thought whether such a thing existed, he threw himself a question, “no, it’s not like there’s none, no?” A certain answer flashed through his somewhat cornered mind. “Hold on, we do have an alternative,” he said, clapping his hands.</p>



<p>“? We do?” Misha tilted her head curiously.</p>



<p>“Yeah, for now let’s return to the apartment. It’ll be faster to just show you,” Kairi said and returned home with her.</p>



<p>After returning home, he opened his phone. “It’s this.” There was a stream that was currently live, so he showed it to her.</p>



<p>“What is this?” Misha took an interest in how a young woman was making an appearance and doing free-talk.</p>



<p>“This is live streaming. Simply put, using this device, you’d have all sorts of people watching what you’re doing,” Kairi explained too simply, as he couldn’t find a better word to put it.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know there’s such a thing.” Apparently indeed not knowing even the internet and video streaming, Misha’s eyes were glued to the video streaming.</p>



<p>“Maybe you can make it work with this. If it&#8217;s an individual one, contacts with others are also few. You might be able to make it work as an ‘eccentric young person’,” said Kairi. Half of it was persuading himself.</p>



<p>At any rate, Misha was a clumsy girl in addition to being unfamiliar with the common sense of this world.</p>



<p>Setting aside if she was just clumsy, being hired would be scary in case of breaking things frequently.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I think I can.” Watching steadily, Misha showed enthusiasm. “And, how should I be doing this? Can I earn money just by talking?” she asked.</p>



<p>“Well, I don’t know the details either, so we’ll have to look it up,” Kairi replied awkwardly.</p>



<p>He had a fair amount of experience as a viewer, but he never once had thought about being a streamer himself.</p>



<p>Thus he had no knowledge needed to be a streamer.</p>



<p>“But it looks like we’re starting to see the light! It’s wonderful!” Misha took Kairi’s hand in high spirits.</p>



<p>“Y-yeah,” Kairi was agreeing with her as he skipped a beat at a girl&#8217;s soft sensation.</p>



<p>“&#8230;By the way, is this the type of woman you like?” Suddenly Misha’s expression and tone of voice changed.</p>



<p>“Eh?” Kairi looked at Misha, and found her sulking.</p>



<p>“Even me, I don’t think I’ll lose in cuteness, though?” she said and went to stroke his nether region.</p>



<p>“That’s of course, but,” in the moment Kairi was surprised at the unexpected development, his nether region’s manly sword was out in the open.</p>



<p>“I’m the one who pleases you most, okay?” she said and licked the tip with her tongue.</p>



<p>“Whoa.” Kairi’s whole body jerked at the sudden stimulation.</p>



<p>“So? What do you think of this?” she said while running her tongue around.</p>



<p>“Good… So good.” Of course Kairi had never had a girl do it for him.</p>



<p>Every one of Misha’s awkward movements was charming.</p>



<p>“Right?” A little satisfied, she took it further into her mouth while stroking it with her hand.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>




<p>“Uwh, gohoh,” then she ended up choking.</p>



<p>Even Kairi could clearly tell that she was inexperienced.</p>



<p>“No need to force yourself, you know?”</p>



<p>As Kairi tried to tell her, “I’m not forcing myself,” Misha said stubbornly, and once again held it in her mouth. “Chu♡ chu slrp♡ slrrp♡.” It wasn’t just sheer stubbornness; she was getting better little by little.</p>



<p><em>Even though it was supposed to be just studying about live streaming</em>, Kairi thought in his mind as he resigned himself to this.</p>



<p>“Lickylick♡ licklick♡ chuslrp chuslrp♡.” Misha’s servicing continued.</p>



<p>Position wise, he couldn’t do anything to her; simply resigning himself to her.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ lickylick♡ schloplop♡.”</p>



<p>Sensing the omen of his discharge, Misha stopped her hands and went to appeal to him with upturned eyes. “Go let it out♡ sprinkle it on my face♡” she urged.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I got it!” Kairi decided to live up to her expectations. “It’s coming…” then he shot it right on her face.</p>



<p>“Fufu♡ what a huge amount♡.” Misha took it, looking satisfied.</p>

<p><em>I feel like I’ve messed up, though.</em></p>



<p>Kairi regained his calm from letting it out.</p>



<p>Once she was done cleaning up with magic, she also seemed to have cooled down. “It’s best to watch and learn from all kinds of people’s stream, isn’t it!?” she spoke as if she was going on board with his suggestion.</p>



<p>“Alright, then let’s get right to it.”</p>



<p>When he sat down on the wooden floor, she came to snuggle close to his side.</p>



<p>“Eh, isn’t this too close?” His heart skipped a beat again from her suddenly sticking close to him.</p>



<p>“It’s easier to see like this, and aren’t we husband and wife?”</p>



<p>Kairi reflexively nodded from being stared at up close.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, you’re right.”</p>



<p>Kairi thought: <em>If I’m the husband, let’s get used to it; even to the extreme-close up of Misha’s beautiful face</em>.</p>



<p>When he was staring at her, Misha, who seemed to feel embarrassed, finally looked away with her cheeks flushed red.</p>



<p>“Regardless of you being my husband, I’d get embarrassed if you stared at me so much.”</p>



<p>“Ah, my bad,” Kairi apologized and looked away. “You’re just so overwhelmingly cute.” If she was this cute, she seemed like she could go viral with that alone.</p>



<p>“Thanks. You too, Kairi. You’re so cool, you know?”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>Misha complimented him simply to return it, but it seemed like lip service, so Kairi didn’t get embarrassed.</p>



<p>The two of them went to watch live streaming shoulder-to-shoulder in harmony(?).</p>



<p>“Let’s learn from the popular one,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>It would probably be needed to teach Misha from the beginning what kind of stream was popular.</p>



<p><em>There’s no need to copy them, and I feel like she’s not skillful enough to be able to in the first place, though</em>.</p>



<p><em>It’s better than knowing nothing at all</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Ah, I want to watch that,” perhaps good at learning things, Misha was gradually making requests of him.</p>



<p>“Sure, sure,” Kairi complied with her with a wry smile, which had been just a smile at first.</p>



<p><em>If it’s becoming a hassle, maybe I can just lend her the phone.</em></p>



<p><em>Nah, that’s an absolute no</em>, Kairi denied the spontaneous thought with all his might.</p>



<p>In any case this was Misha, one who would commit the unexpected, for example cutting a chopping board right in half when trying to cut ingredients, or toppling a truck sideways.</p>



<p><em>I have no idea what would happen if I lend her my phone here</em>, was the fear inside Kairi.</p>



<p>It seemed possible the development would be for it to get submerged or pulverized, and then repaired with magic.</p>



<p><em>I also don’t wanna check if it could be properly repaired</em>.</p>



<p>He had no choice but to watch over Misha so she wouldn’t pull it off.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Kairi.” Suddenly Misha looked up and directed her gaze at him.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” Kairi tilted his head, wondering if something was up.</p>



<p>“It’s all girls, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Since her eyes looked somewhat reproachful, “I mean, you’re a girl, right?” Kairi counterattacked with a lamentable face.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m sorry. I wondered if girls like these your preference, and I got jealous,” Misha honestly apologized and revealed the reason.</p>



<p>“Ah, I see. You don’t need to worry, okay?”</p>



<p>Despite Kairi replying with a smile, <em>it’s embarrassing being told it bluntly!!</em> He was flustering on the inside and embarrassed as well.</p>



<p>However, it was just not easy for his emotion to show on his face like it was for her.</p>



<p><em>I never thought it would be this embarrassing and awkward to have a girl get jealous of you</em>.</p>



<p>It was an unknown feeling for Kairi.</p>



<p>“I simply picked girls who are popular, okay?“ Kairi replied as calmly as possible.</p>



<p>Being cute probably wouldn’t be enough, but the reality was a cute girl could become popular more easily.</p>



<p>“Still, going for the popular girls could become a reference, right?” he said.</p>



<p>“I guess so. Thanks,” Misha agreed with him, then kissed him on the cheek.</p>



<p>“Sure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He softly held the kissed cheek.</p>



<p>Even though she would kiss him without reserve, he couldn’t quite get used to being kissed.</p>



<p><em>She sure has always been keeping my heart pounding</em>, or so he was thinking, but that was pleasant even so.</p>



<p>“Hey, since we’ve gone this far, I wanna watch all sorts of stuff,” she begged with upturned eyes while leaning on him.</p>



<p>“Sure. The more data we have the better anyway.”</p>



<p>Kairi gladly complied, and went along with her.</p>



<p>“Nnnn, I’ve gathered all kinds of information. Thanks.” After taking a big stretch, Misha kissed Kairi again.</p>



<p>“Sure thing,” Kairi replied one beat behind. “The next thing’s gonna be the equipment, but I guess we’ll have to fumble our way through for this one,” he said.</p>



<p>He got no acquaintances doing live streaming, so there would inevitably be things they wouldn’t understand.</p>



<p>“And it’s probably not gonna go so smoothly that you’ll suddenly become popular.” Kairi was thinking long-term.</p>



<p>“I guess so. If necessary, I can also use magic stealthily for back up,” said Misha.</p>



<p>She got no hesitation whatsoever in using magic.</p>



<p>“Magic, huh.” For that reason, Kairi himself wanted to be cautious. “How about I see what you’ll be doing, and then think about it after?” Nevertheless, he didn’t want to unsparingly prohibit it.</p>



<p>It should be a reasonable one for him to look at it himself, and give the okay as long as it wasn’t in a form that would cause any discomfort to other viewers.</p>



<p>“You’re right. I also don’t know which magic and how much I can use would be fine in this world. It’s relieving if you would watch over me.”</p>



<p>Kairi’s back itched at being subjected with an innocent trust.</p>



<p><em>Will it be dishonest to use magic?</em></p>



<p>Even he held such feelings.</p>



<p><em>But, it’s the truth that there’s no law in regulating magic, and since it won’t be used for crimes, I’d love them to overlook this</em>, Kairi thought, sounding like an excuse directed to no one in particular.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s important to make sure. And there’s the question whether it’s that easy to do live streaming well, too,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>From time to time, Kairi would hear about people having an accident on their first stream.</p>



<p>On the contrary, despite there being a certain pattern to get popular, it wasn’t a result that could be obtained through calculation.</p>



<p>If you could avoid it, you should.</p>



<p>“Then let’s give it a try. It’s fine to make mistakes at first.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!” Misha smiled and nodded at his words.</p>



<p>Taking action first rather than thinking, it was certainly in her nature.</p>



<p>And then, after all kinds of trial and error, “looks like we’ll manage,” Kairi was relieved.</p>



<p>Since Misha didn’t know of this world’s common sense, he had a big worry just to what extent Misha would make mistakes, but his worry might turn out to be an unfounded one.</p>



<p>“Thanks. It’s all thanks to you, Kairi.” Misha showed a full-faced smile and hugged him.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a bit early to start rejoicing,” Kairi responded calmly. “Right now we’re still just seeing if it could be for live streaming, okay?”</p>



<p>The important thing was whether it would go smoothly or not.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right!” Misha agreed with him still with a smile.</p>



<p>It was a face that wasn’t thinking about failing.</p>



<p><em>On the contrary, it might work out that way</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>That was just how much she was overflowing with bright energy.</p>
