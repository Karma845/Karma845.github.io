<h3>Afterword</h3>


<p>Nice to meet you, I’m Aino Hitoshi.</p>



<p>I am happy to have had the opportunity to get the chance to write the story.</p>



<p>Other authors themselves are the most surprised.</p>



<p>I was anxious about taking on a challenge in an unknown territory, but thanks to the editor in charge M-sama, we were able to publish the book without any problems.</p>



<p>I have gained new knowledge about Bishoujo Bunko… that it also has afterwords.</p>



<p>The content is as the title suggests.</p>



<p>Elves are cute, don’t you think?</p>



<p>Could be a beauty, or a cute one.</p>



<p>People may have different opinions.</p>



<p>What kind of girl do you imagine when you hear the word ‘elf’?</p>



<p>Is it a cool type, cute type, or beauty type?</p>



<p>Perhaps because of their popularity in fantasy, we could see a wide variety of elves created.</p>



<p>As an author, I also tried to portray an elf I like in the best way I can.</p>



<p>There should surely be romance in the newlywed life with a cute girl.</p>



<p>And there should be a dream of living with an elf.</p>



<p>For example, managing the cold with magic.</p>



<p>And using magic again to manage the dryness.</p>



<p>If magic were used to give water and electricity, I was wondering whether it could save on living expenses.</p>



<p>…Let’s get back on track somehow since this has gone from a dreamy talk to a domestic life talk.</p>



<p>Always waking up to a cute girl.</p>



<p>Greeted by a girl when getting home.</p>



<p>I think it’s a very wonderful thing.</p>



<p>I will ask the world to believe that there are gentlemen who understand the idea of wanting to spend a wonderful time with such a girl.</p>
