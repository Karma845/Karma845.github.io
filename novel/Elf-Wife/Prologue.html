<h3>Prologue &#8211; An Elf Girl I Picked Up At The Hill Behind The House</h3>

<p>“A girl collapsed?”</p>



<p>Kairi stopped walking.</p>



<p>It was summer vacation during his first year of middle school; he had been brought by his parents to a relative’s house and had just climbed up a hill behind the house alone.</p>



<p>“I heard no one was here, though…”</p>



<p>The hill was small with nothing but trees, and the only insect to be found was mosquitos.</p>



<p>Although Kairi had come here out of curiosity, he had heard that none of the local children would come to this place.</p>



<p>Remembering what he had heard from a relative’s child who couldn’t find a time, Kairi approached the girl while tilting his head.</p>



<p>“It’s a girl I’ve never seen before.”</p>



<p>Her age was probably no different than his.</p>



<p>Seemingly uncommon beautiful blond hair, fair skin, green coat, and white trousers.</p>



<p>However, the most distinctive of all should be the long, pointy ears.</p>



<p>It was a girl like a fairy in a story.</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” He approached her, bent down, and called to her.</p>



<p>More than the concern about whether his words could be understood, his worry for her was stronger.</p>



<p>“Nn…” A voice came out from the girl’s lips, and her eyes opened slightly.</p>



<p>Her beautiful gem-like blue eyes reflected Kairi.</p>



<p>“●▽◇％＆＃＊＠?” The girl got up, and was rapidly saying something with a vigilant look on her face as she backed away from Kairi.</p>



<p>“I got no idea what you’re saying. What country’s language was that?”</p>



<p><em>For now, it’s confirmed she’s not Japanese</em>, as he thought so, Kairi was at a loss.</p>



<p>The girl was clearly being vigilant towards him, and it was so doubtful whether they could have a friendly communication.</p>



<p>“But I guess I got no choice but to do it. I am Kairi, you are? Where did you come from?”</p>



<p>When he tried to talk to her while keeping their distance, the girl’s face turned into a puzzled one.</p>



<p>And then after staring hard at him, she sent her gaze around.</p>



<p>“＠◇▼◎＄￥＃％■?”</p>



<p>And then she rapidly said something.</p>



<p>“Like I said I don’t understand it. Really, what should I do?”</p>



<p>Kairi sighed.</p>



<p>The only thing he knew was that she probably had fallen into an unexpected situation and was troubled.</p>



<p><em>How far can I go with just gestures</em>?</p>



<p>When he started to seriously worry, “<em>how about now? Do you understand what I’m saying?</em>” he suddenly heard the girl speaking in Japanese.</p>



<p>“Eh, I do. What’s happening here?”</p>



<p>When Kairi replied with his eyes open wide, “<em>Phew, I’m glad I learned translation magic just in case,</em>” the girl patted her chest in relief.</p>



<p>“Translation? Magic?”</p>



<p><em>Just what this girl’s saying, I wonder</em>, Kairi was confused.</p>



<p>“Well, whatever.”</p>



<p><em>If she can understand me, let’s first ask her situation</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Are you okay? Does your body feel bad anywhere?” In his own way, Kairi showed his concern for the girl.</p>



<p>“&#8230;<em>I think I’m thirsty,</em>” the girl spoke after thinking for a moment.</p>



<p>“I do have a drink if you want.”</p>



<p>Kairi pulled out a water bottle out of the backpack he was carrying and offered her a cup.</p>



<p>“<em>A</em> <em>drink? Thanks.</em>”</p>



<p>The girl sniffed it with great interest and took a sip.</p>



<p>“<em>Such a strange smell and taste</em>. <em>But I think I like it,</em>” the girl said, smiling slightly.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that you liked it.” Kairi was relieved.</p>



<p>After drinking the tea, the girl directed her blue eyes to Kairi.</p>



<p>“<em>Thank you for your kindness. I’m Misha</em>.” Placing her right hand on her chest, she gave her name.</p>



<p>“I’m Kairi. Nice to meet you, Misha,”&nbsp; Kairi gave his name in return.</p>



<p>“Why are you at this place?” Kairi ended up asking, not being able to resist it.</p>



<p>Misha slowly looked from side to side, and quietly spoke. “<em>In the first place, where is this?</em>”</p>



<p>This remark was not surprising to Kairi.</p>



<p>He could assume that she didn’t know Japan, as she could not understand the language.</p>



<p>“This is Japan.”</p>



<p><em>She probably wouldn’t know&nbsp; even if I say the area name</em>, Kairi thought, and told only the name of the country.</p>



<p>“<em>Japan?</em>” Even so, Misha looked puzzled.</p>



<p>“<em>I never heard it before. Is it a country of humans?</em>”</p>



<p id="jump-1">“<em>Humans?</em>”<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup></p>



<p>This time it was Kairi’s turn to tilt his head.</p>



<p><em>“I mean about your race</em>,<em>” </em>Misha pointed out.</p>



<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>



<p id="jump-2">He also had the knowledge that it was used as a way of calling humans<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> in fiction, but he would never have dreamed that it would actually be used.</p>



<p>“You’re right. It’s a country of only <em>humans</em>.”</p>



<p>“<em>So it was true, that there’s such a country.</em>” Misha was surprised that what she had thought of as a fiction was in fact reality.</p>



<p>Even Kairi had never expected to encounter an elf in reality, so perhaps it could be said that it went both ways.</p>



<p>“You’re not <em>human</em>, right?” Kairi asked.</p>



<p>It was obvious even from her outer appearance and the way she spoke, but he wanted confirmation.</p>



<p>“<em>Yes. You don’t know elves?</em>” Misha replied.</p>



<p><em>What am I supposed to say?</em></p>



<p>Kairi was lost for an answer; whether he should say that he didn’t know, or that he should reveal that they were known as fantasy creatures.</p>



<p>“<em>Yeah.</em>”</p>



<p>Just how Kairi’s silence was perceived, but Misha looked confirmingly.</p>



<p>Immediately after Kairi was struck with awkwardness, Misha’s stomach made a sound, making her blush.</p>



<p>“So you’re hungry. I only have some biscuits, though.”</p>



<p>Kairi rummaged through his backpack without laughing and handed the biscuits to Misha.</p>



<p>“<em>What is this, I wonder?</em>” Seeing it for the first time, Misha stared at the pack curiously.</p>



<p>“Ah, right.”</p>



<p>Realizing his own mistake, Kairi opened the seal and took out the content.</p>



<p>“This is a food called biscuit, and I guess it’s a snack. You can eat it if you like,” he said, urging her.</p>



<p>“<em>Thanks.</em>”</p>



<p>Misha nervously reached out her hand to eat it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;<em>Tasty.</em>” Her face broke into a happy smile.</p>



<p>“I’m glad.” And Kairi was relieved.</p>



<p>He’d reflexively urged her to, but there was a possibility that it might not be suitable for an elf’s taste.</p>



<p>Misha seemed to have been starving, so she ended up eating the whole pack.</p>



<p>“<em>I’m sorry</em>,” then she came to herself and apologized to Kairi.</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s fine.”</p>



<p><em>She’s eating so engrossingly there</em>, he thought, but he kept it to his chest.</p>



<p><em>That might not be the best thing to say to an elf</em>, he restrained himself.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you thirsty after eating biscuits?” he asked while smiling.</p>



<p>Misha nodded, averting her eyes bashfully.</p>



<p>As he was feeling warm and fuzzy, he filled another cup of tea for her.</p>



<p>“<em>Thanks</em>,” Misha thanked him again and drank it.</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kairi smiled, <em>maybe this is how having a little sister feels</em>, as he thought so in his mind.</p>



<p>“I hate to ask, but what are you gonna do now?” He put into words the important issue.</p>



<p>Misha was probably not someone from this world.</p>



<p><em>I don’t know how she came here, but can she return home?</em> Such a question was inside Kairi.</p>



<p>“<em>I think it’s not impossible to return</em>,” said Misha. “Because once every few days, the wall between worlds weakens.”</p>



<p>“I totally have no idea what you’re talking about, but I’m glad you can return.”</p>



<p>Kairi couldn’t understand anything except the fact that she could return home.</p>



<p>However, it was great that the most important part was solved.</p>



<p>“<em>Wait a moment</em>,” Misha said and invoked magic. “<em>Looks like I can return after three days.</em>”</p>



<p>“You can tell!?” Kairi shouted in surprise.</p>



<p>He didn’t know what she had done, but he just knew that it was something amazing.</p>



<p>“<em>If only this much</em>. <em>The question is how to make it through the three days, I suppose</em>.” Misha sighed.</p>



<p>Her biggest problem was to secure water and food for three days in a world she wasn’t familiar with.</p>



<p>“I can do something about water, but what should I do about food…” Kairi sounded troubled.</p>



<p><em>I can buy water with my allowance, and I can also get tap water and give it to her</em>.</p>



<p><em>But, I don’t think that’ll be the same with food</em>.</p>



<p>“<em>You’re so kind</em>.” Misha narrowed her eyes a little and spoke in the elf language.</p>



<p>“Eh, what’d you say?” Kairi was confused, unable to understand what was said.</p>



<p><em>She was using translation magic or something just earlier, I wonder what happened</em>.</p>



<p>“A <em>secret.</em>” Misha showed a suggestive smile.</p>



<p>“C-come on, sheesh.” Kairi skipped a beat at the charm that was different from before.</p>



<p>He tried to protest to cover it up.</p>



<p>“<em>Fufufu</em>,” Misha laughed enjoyably, perhaps seeing through his agitation.</p>



<p>“A-anyway, I will do something, so don’t get discouraged,” becoming somewhat embarrassed, Kairi spoke rapidly.</p>



<p>“<em>Yeah, thank you very much</em>,” Misha said. For the time being, he went down the hill.</p>



<p>To conclude, three days had safely passed.</p>



<p>At the noon community association gathering, Kairi had been receiving an assortment of snacks as freebies.</p>



<p>“Sorry it’s just snacks.”</p>



<p>“<em>Any of them is tasty, you knowI?</em>”</p>



<p>Misha was calm in contrast to Kairi who was concerned about nutritional deficiencies.</p>



<p>“<em>And I can go on for about a month without eating as long as there’s water, too</em>,” she revealed a secret on the evening of the third day.</p>



<p>“Even though you were that hungry?”</p>



<p>When the surprised Kairi asked meanly on a subconscious level, “being hungry and dying from not eating are two different things,” Misha counter attacked with a composed look.</p>



<p>Kairi wasn’t fooled; immediately she turned bright red as her stomach growled again, so he ended up laughing.</p>



<p>“<em>Geez…</em>” Misha cutely groaned.</p>



<p><em>We have completely opened up in these three days</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>So much so that it was regrettable to have to part.</p>



<p>“<em>It’s time for me to return</em>,” Misha said with a serious expression as she was being basked with the evening sun.</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Kairi held back his words, knowing that there would be no way he could tell her to not go.</p>



<p>“<em>Don’t look so glum</em>. <em>An elf will always return a favor</em>,” Misha said and gently kissed his right cheek, and disappeared into the blue vortex beyond.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Goodbye, Misha,” Kairi muttered, then heard crows cawing far off in the distance.</p>
