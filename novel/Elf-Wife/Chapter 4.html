<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; New Life Supporting Magic and Live Streaming</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Fuaahh.”</p>



<p>By the time Kairi woke up, it was 6:30 in the morning.</p>



<p>After looking at the clock, he looked at his own hands.</p>



<p>“My fatigue is gone and I’m refreshed for real…” he was amazed.</p>



<p>Usually he would still feel sluggish and sleepy, but none of it today.</p>



<p>“Nnn, good morning.” Misha, who was sleeping next to him, woke up.</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry. Did I wake you?”</p>



<p>Although Kairi apologized, “no, don’t worry about it. An elf will be fine even without sleeping for a week anyway,” replied Misha with a smile.</p>



<p>“What an… outrageous piece of info that is.” Kairi’s cheeks cramped up a little.</p>



<p>He couldn’t help but think that an elf was truly a fantasy race.</p>



<p>“I suppose there’s so much more I haven’t told you. I also don’t know anything about you, Kairi,” Misha said while smiling.</p>



<p>“You’re right, we’re only just getting started.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>They simply reaffirmed the obvious, but they were aiming to understand each other.</p>



<p>“By the way, how was it? My magic,” asked Misha.</p>



<p>“It’s so awesome! Both my head and body are crazy light!” Kairi straightforwardly shared his thoughts. “I can even say I haven’t felt this light in so many years.”</p>



<p>Probably since student days, and maybe high school or middle school.</p>



<p>Thinking about it deeply seemed saddening, so he interrupted the thought.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that it worked.” Misha smiled happily.</p>



<p>“Then I’ll count on you for the next rank magic as well,” said Kairi.</p>



<p><em>It’s self-interested if I say so myself, though</em>.</p>



<p>He smiled wryly in his heart, but it seemed to be what Misha hoped for.</p>



<p>“Yeah, of course.” She gently took Kairi’s hands.</p>



<p>“Thanks.” Kairi let out a breath, and said “let’s get a meal, and then think about streaming.”</p>



<p>“Okay. Then I’ll go get it ready,” Misha replied.</p>



<p>Though, “let’s go out to eat today,” he made a proposal.</p>



<p>“It’s not that we can’t, but why?” Misha tilted her head wonderingly. “It’s cheaper to eat at home, right?”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.” Kairi realized the cause of the mismatch between his and her thoughts. “You’re thinking about money, and want to have it at home, right?”</p>



<p>Hearing what he said, “yeah, until I earn my own, I’ll have to depend on you after all,” Misha explained. “In that case it’s better to have less expenses, right?”</p>



<p><em>So she won’t make me spend my money, but she’s okay if it’s her own?</em></p>



<p>Such a thought suddenly came into his mind, but it wasn&#8217;t a topic at hand, so he would leave it for later.</p>



<p>“That’s true but, I guess I want to show you around the city a little more, and then, I’m also feeling like going out to eat with you,” Kairi revealed his true feelings while feeling slightly embarrassed.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is that so?” Misha widened her eyes in surprise, and then immediately lowered her head. “I’m sorry I didn’t realize how you felt.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine,” said Kairi in a hurry. ”I didn’t realize what you were thinking either, so that’s the two of us. That’s why you don’t have to apologize.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay.” Misha made eye contact with him and smiled. “Right, then can I have you to show me around today?” she said.</p>



<p>“Oh, you sure?”</p>



<p><em>She backed down surprisingly easily</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>“I mean, if you say you’re doing it for me, I just can’t refuse,” Misha answered with a troubled look. “And one meal shouldn’t cost that much money either. It won’t, right?” she tried to confirm it.</p>



<p>“You’re right. For one meal, the difference should only be in the several hundred yen,” he answered.</p>



<p>The fact was that the difference would become several thousand yen, or even several ten thousand yen the more the frequency increased, however.</p>



<p>“If only that much, it’s just like a calculation error, isn’t it?” Misha was relieved.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’m also aware I don’t have the luxury, so I won’t be rash,” Kairi said and smiled.</p>



<p>He knew well of his own low earnings.</p>



<p>He didn’t voice it out, however.</p>



<p>“Okay, then let’s go out. It’s gonna be a date!” Misha said, seemingly to have immediately made the switch.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right,” Kairi agreed.</p>



<p><em>She sure is exaggerating simply from going out to eat</em>, or so Kairi thought, but he didn’t say it.</p>



<p>This was the valuable occasion of Misha enjoying life after all, so he wouldn’t throw the cold water on her.</p>



<p>“Where are we going?” Misha asked while taking his arm.</p>



<p>“I haven’t decided yet.” Kairi smiled. After all, he was thinking of deciding it after discussing it with her. “Do you have some place you want to go, or something you want to eat?” he asked her back.</p>



<p>“Hmmm, I wonder what would be good.” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>She was against eating out, and was not familiar with the restaurants in the area either.</p>



<p><em>I guess it’s understandable she can’t decide right away</em>, Kairi realized his own mistake.</p>



<p>“Then let’s think about it as we walk. It’s probably better to see it directly,” he suggested to her.</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s do that!” Misha agreed with a smile, and the conversation was settled.</p>



<p>They left the apartment arm in arm, and happened to be seen by someone in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230;!?”</p>



<p>That man was first glued to Misha’s beauty.</p>



<p>And then looked at Kairi beside her next.</p>



<p>“Eh, is this a joke?”</p>



<p>The look on his face said, ‘they’re not evenly matched.’</p>



<p>He eventually got back to his senses, and quickly left while confused.</p>



<p>“Wow how rude,” said Misha, filled with resentment.</p>



<p>It was brief, but she seemed to have guessed the leaving man’s heart.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, really.” Kairi smiled.</p>



<p>Had the position been different, he probably would’ve been making the same reaction as well.</p>



<p><em>I’ve finally experienced it personally after all</em>.</p>



<p>If anything, he thought it was Misha who wasn’t self-aware enough.</p>



<p>“Geez.” And she irritatedly became sullen; apparently dissatisfied that he didn’t take offense.</p>



<p>“It’s because it’s the truth that you’re just that charming. That makes me a lucky guy.”</p>



<p>And hearing what Kairi said, “g-geez,” Misha got embarrassed, turning bright red.</p>



<p>Apparently, she was weak with straightforward remarks.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s look for a place to eat,” Kairi urged her over the sound of an empty stomach.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right,” Misha pulled herself together and nodded.</p>



<p>They went to look around at several cafes and restaurant chains.</p>



<p>“There’s surprisingly many, right?” said Kairi.</p>



<p>“You’re right. It really is nice to be able to have the pleasure of choosing.” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“I’d say this is one of the advantages of living around this area. It’s a bit far from the station, though,” Kairi was talking while feeling glad to get her agreement.</p>



<p>“Train, huh… Now that I’m here, I’d love to ride it someday,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you don’t need it after all,” Kairi nodded.</p>



<p>She could use magic to move around unseen.</p>



<p>There wouldn’t be no need to use transportation, and not just limited to trains.</p>



<p><em>I thought for sure she didn’t have any interest, but I guess that’s not the case.</em></p>



<p>And then immediately after, “well yeah. Someday is okay,” Misha told him, reminding him.</p>



<p><em>Probably because it costs money</em>, Kairi interpreted.</p>



<p>He appreciated her for having a solid financial sense.</p>



<p>“By the way, was there a place that caught your eye?” Kairi asked Misha.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I liked the cute cafe,” Misha replied immediately.</p>



<p>“Let’s go there then,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>“Is that okay? Even though we haven’t seen the food?” Misha tilted her head.</p>



<p>“It’s fine if it’s once in a while,” Kairi said and smiled.</p>



<p><em>It’s okay to have days when you don’t decide based on what you wanna eat</em>, he thought.</p>



<p><em>It’s troubling if it’s everyday, though</em>.</p>



<p>Even without saying it, she seemed to have the same opinion as well.</p>



<p>When they entered the cafe, there were three groups of customers already there, and their gazes concentrated on Misha.</p>



<p>“We really are standing out,” Kairi said in a whisper.</p>



<p>Misha’s beauty was on the level where she wouldn’t be outdone by any celebrities even.</p>



<p>And there should be many people who would be surprised were they to encounter her on the street.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” Misha apologized in a whisper.</p>



<p>She must be thinking it was her fault.</p>



<p>“I just have to get used to it.” Kairi hugged her around her shoulders, telling her not to worry.</p>



<p>He’d been prepared for this the moment he had decided to marry her.</p>



<p><em>It’s not something to get all flustered now</em>, he reminded himself.</p>



<p>When they sat down on one of the available seats, “this is a nice place,” Misha gave her impressions.</p>



<p>It seemed she liked the ambiance.</p>



<p>“Looks that way,” Kairi responded in a whisper.</p>



<p>As for him, he was satisfied with just her liking it.</p>



<p>Since the menu was just the typical cafe’s stuff, “a breakfast set. And a coffee,” was what Kairi ordered.</p>



<p>Misha imitated him, and they enjoyed their morning set together.</p>



<p>“That was delicious, wasn’t it?” Misha was satisfied.</p>



<p>“You’re right,” Kairi agreed while looking at her profile.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” noticing his gaze, Misha asked.</p>



<p>“Well,” Kairi fumbled.</p>



<p><em>This sure is embarrassing.</em></p>



<p>He was hesitating to put it into words, and blushed a little.</p>



<p>“What now?” Misha protested, poking at the tip of his nose. “Can’t you just tell me?”</p>



<p>“Hmmm.”</p>



<p>Despite hesitating, Kairi decided to say it.</p>



<p>After all, <em>getting into a quarrel over something like this is just idiotic</em>, such a feeling prevailed.</p>



<p>“I just thought that the food tasted delicious when I ate outside together with you,” Kairi said while averting his eyes because it was embarrassing.</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.” Misha’s cheeks got redder than his. “T-this is embarrassing,” she said fidgetingly.</p>



<p>“Right?” Kairi was a little happy he wasn’t the only one.</p>



<p>“Surprisingly you do say lady-killer stuff, Kairi,” Misha said in surprise, still blushing.</p>



<p>“Do I?” He tilted his head.</p>



<p>“So you’re not self-aware.” Her eyes turned reproachful. “Do you really not have any lover?”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t!”</p>



<p>That Misha was having suspicions was unexpected for Kairi.</p>



<p>After denying it with all his might, “I see, I’ll believe you.” Misha sweetly smiled.</p>



<p>“Thank god.” Kairi was relieved.</p>



<p>“What are we gonna do after this?” she asked.</p>



<p>“I don’t exactly have any plan in mind, though.” Kairi tilted his head, not understanding her intentions. “Is there anywhere you wanna go to?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, wanna go for a little walk?” Misha proposed.</p>



<p>“Sounds good,” Kairi agreed.</p>



<p>“Yay! An after-meal date!” Misha clapped her hands in delight.</p>



<p>Seeing her smiling face, Kairi thought, <em>I’m glad</em>.</p>



<p>When the two were walking aimlessly, they were still catching attention.</p>



<p>“It sure is nice having a wife I can be proud of” Kairi whispered to Misha since she seemed to be minding it.</p>



<p>“Oh my!”</p>



<p>She first opened her eyes wide, and turned bright red next.</p>



<p>Her sorry feelings towards him seemed to have turned to happiness in an instant.</p>



<p><em>I’m glad</em>, Kairi felt.</p>



<p>To have the cheerfulness and liveliness disappear from Misha because of rude gazes from other people would be a total waste.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Me too, I’m also proud of my husband, you know?”</p>



<p>Raising her face up, Misha went to link arms with him.</p>



<p>The soft sensation was making Kairi happy.</p>



<p><em>This sure is a wonder.</em></p>



<p>At the same time, he was surprised by his own emotion.</p>



<p>Even after that much physical intimacy last night, the joy of having her body touching his didn’t change one bit.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” Misha asked.</p>



<p>“Nah, I’m just thinking it’s fun to go out like this,” Kairi said while rubbing his nose.</p>



<p>“You’re right. I’m having fun as well,” she agreed with a huge nod.</p>



<p>Suddenly Kairi became curious. “How have you been doing ‘over there’?” There were more people around, so he paid attention to his words.</p>



<p>“Over there I was either by myself, or with female friends,” Misha replied. It seemed she also guessed his intentions. “Are you curious about me?” She showed a slightly playful smile.</p>



<p>“About as much as you are about me,” Kairi replied back with a smile.</p>



<p>“Looks like I lost.” Misha stuck out her tongue and hugged him.</p>



<p>“Whoah.” Kairi hugged back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t get to flirting outside in public, moreover so early in the morning, man.” And they heard a man’s voice. It was more of a lament than protest towards them.</p>



<p>“We can’t?” Misha asked in a whisper.</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh?” Kairi denied it and smiled wryly at the same time. “But I guess I understand the feeling.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Hearing his answer, she stared at him.</p>



<p>“You know, I never had any luck with women either, until you came along,” Kairi confessed, enduring the embarrassment.</p>



<p>“That’s so unexpected.” Misha&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>



<p>“Maybe our senses differ,” Kairi drew a safe conclusion.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p><em>I don’t know if an elf is like that, or it’s just Misha, though</em>.</p>



<p>He believed that to be a boorish thought, so he didn’t voice it out.</p>



<p>There would be no point even if he were to hear about an elf’s sense.</p>



<p>“I sure hope you would tell me I have a good taste,” Misha spoke sweetly.</p>



<p>“Haha, let’s just put it that way.” Kairi laughed.</p>



<p><em>I’ve totally never got that idea.</em></p>



<p>He felt that her senses were sometimes lacking common senses, but it was fresh and fun for him.</p>



<p>“You too, Kairi. You have a good taste, you know?” said Misha.</p>



<p>“I wonder about that.” Kairi tilted his head.</p>



<p>Everyone would probably acknowledge Misha to be attractive, so could you call that having a good taste?</p>



<p>“I can say that I’m certainly lucky, though,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>“Don’t you think that goes for the both of us?” Misha smiled. “I was also lucky to be able to meet you. It’s the <em>best </em>of all,” she emphasized ‘best.’</p>



<p>“Ye-Yeah.” Kairi got embarrassed by the direct feelings of love.</p>



<p>He thought he’d gotten used to it to some extent, but Misha would occasionally hit him with something beyond his tolerance.</p>



<p><em>Nah, I can’t just keep getting all embarrassed</em>, he reassessed his mind.</p>



<p>“I also think it’s the best, you know?” He conveyed his feelings to her.</p>



<p>“Th-Thanks.” Misha became bashful even though she’d said it herself.</p>



<p>This gap was also her charm.</p>



<p>While flirting out, they enjoyed their after meal strolling date, and finally returned to the apartment.</p>



<p>“Haahh, that was fun.” Kairi was satisfied.</p>



<p>“That’s good to hear.” Misha smiled, making a tea for two.</p>



<p>Kairi noticed and admired that naturalness.</p>



<p>It had only been a few days since she’d come here, but she was already starting to develop the behavior of a new wife.</p>



<p>“Thanks for the tea.”</p>



<p>Following Kairi’s thanks, “You’re welcome,” Misha replied, showing a smile.</p>



<p>Perhaps such a casual exchange was happiness.</p>



<p>Kairi absentmindedly thought.</p>



<p><em>It sure is just like an old tale; like, when you notice it, it has become happiness</em>, he thought and made a wry smile.</p>



<p>But the fact that the girl he’d saved in the past had come to return the favor was like an episode of an old tale, though.</p>



<p>“Are you absorbed in your thoughts again?” Misha looked into him with a sulky look.</p>



<p>“Nah, I was just thinking this is really happiness.” Kairi smiled.</p>



<p>“Is that so? It’s the same for me,” Misha said without bashfulness and went to cling to him. “That I wanted to meet you, wanted to marry you if possible; both have come true after all. To the point that I don’t need anything else anymore,” Misha told him.</p>



<p>“That sure sounds like the ending of a story, huh.” Kairi got embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I guess so.” Misha chuckled.</p>



<p>Of course, their story wouldn’t end here.</p>



<p>In fact, this would be the beginning of Misha’s career as a live streamer.</p>



<p>“There are a lot of people doing live streaming this morning, aren’t there?” said Misha.</p>



<p>“It’s also a day you can expect that much viewers after all,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>Probably everyone was thinking the same.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m looking forward to it!” Misha said, smiling challengingly.</p>



<p><em>She sure doesn’t look like she has the word anxious in her dictionary</em>, Kairi thought again.</p>



<p>It didn’t seem to be that way in fact, but she must be being positive essentially.</p>



<p>“I’m also looking forward to it,” Kairi said, cheering her on at the same time.</p>



<p><em>I don’t think we’ll see results all of sudden, though</em>.</p>



<p>There ought to be a possibility it would go well.</p>



<p>“I’ll be starting now, so stay back okay?”</p>



<p>“Roger.” Kairi distanced himself, responding to Misha’s request.</p>



<p>It would be outrageous to have a roommate (the opposite sex) suddenly showing up on the first stream.</p>



<p>“<strong>Okaaay, I’ll be starting my first streeeeam!</strong>” Misha cheerfully gave a greeting.</p>



<p>There was also already an SNS account made.</p>



<p>&gt;I got curious so I came.</p>



<p>&gt;Looked crazy beautiful in the selfies, but is this genuine?</p>



<p>&gt;There’s gotta be a limit to how much you can enhance on a normal stream.</p>



<p>&gt;Easily super beautiful face.</p>



<p>&gt;Why a girl like this couldn’t be found till now?</p>



<p>The comments were picking up fast.</p>



<p><em>It was right to put out a selfie</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>With someone as beautiful as Misha, even women would probably be interested.</p>



<p>There should be people who came to check if it was genuine or not.</p>



<p>“<strong>It is genuine. I’m Misa, nice to meet you,</strong>” Misha responded to the comments.</p>



<p>As to be expected, he was reluctant for her to use her real name, so he had her use an altered name.</p>



<p>If it was Misa, it would sound Japanese-ish; it would also be believable if she said she was a half.</p>



<p>The subscriber’s number was also rising steadily.</p>



<p><em>This is looking good</em>, with Kairi feeling good from the result, the first stream ended.</p>



<p>“Phew.” He brought Misha a tea as she exhaled.</p>



<p>“Good work. It was looking good, wasn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Thanks. I’d be happy if it was a success, though.” Misha gave a cautious response.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Certainly, it’s too early to be happy,” Kairi agreed.</p>



<p>In order to make a living as a live streamer, there were still many hurdles they’d want to overcome.</p>



<p>She was simply at the stage where she’d succeeded in the first step.</p>



<p>The fight would be from now on.</p>



<p>“Well, I’m also gonna support you. I don’t know how far I can do it, though,” said Kairi.</p>



<p><em>I won’t leave Misha alone, but then I think I can do it</em>.</p>



<p>“I believe you,” Misha said and clung to him.</p>



<p><em>Does she miss body warmth? Is it just a habit?</em></p>



<p>Given her character, he felt it was the latter, however.</p>



<p>“I still haven’t thought about how I’m gonna support you, but wanna work on a strategy today?” Kairi asked.</p>



<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” Misha said, staring at him, “but I want to cherish the time I spend with you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>



<p>It was like a confession of love.</p>



<p>Not only the one who said it, but the one who heard it, Kairi, also blushed.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I also want to cherish it, of course,” he responded after a few moments.</p>



<p>“Fufu,” Misha laughed happily, and kissed the tip of his nose. “Chu.”</p>



<p>“Whoah.” Kairi, despite having his eyes wide open in surprise, “Chu,” returned it back to the tip of her nose.</p>



<p>And then they stared at each other.</p>



<p>“Pfft.”</p>



<p>“Fufufu.”</p>



<p>Becoming funny somehow, they bursted into laughter at the same time.</p>



<p>Once the laughter stopped, they went to put their lips on one another.</p>



<p>“The sun sure is still high.” Kairi looked out at the window after they finished kissing.</p>



<p>It was still before noon.</p>



<p>“It hasn’t been that long since we had breakfast after all,” Misha said. And then, “Wanna do some exercise at home to help with digestion?” she asked with an amorous expression.</p>



<p>“Even though it’s still bright outside?” Kairi asked back with a teasing look.</p>



<p>“~~~~!!!” Misha’s face turned red to the ears in a flash. “It-It’s like I’m going into a rut,” she said, mumblingly in a small voice.</p>



<p><em>So she wasn’t aware, huh.</em></p>



<p>Kairi was genuinely surprised.</p>



<p>He had been sure that it was a conscious act.</p>



<p>“Eh, is it a surprise to you?” Misha was staring at him worryingly.</p>



<p>Sensing that he couldn’t hide it, Kairi nodded honestly.</p>



<p>“Oh gosh, have I been looking like that!?”</p>



<p>Misha seemed to be starting to mind it now.</p>



<p>She was all flustered up with both hands on her cheeks.</p>



<p>“I was happy, so you don’t really have to mind it,” said Kairi, finally snapping back to himself.</p>



<p>“Re-Really?” Misha peered into his face with upturned eyes.</p>



<p>“Yeah. To be honest, if you hadn’t come on to me to that degree, I don’t think I would’ve been able to immediately make the decision to get married, you know?” Kairi confessed.</p>



<p>He was somewhat aware of his indecisive nature.</p>



<p>Precisely because she had forced her way through that it also had turned into a good outcome.</p>



<p>“Then it’s fine, I guess.” Misha was finally reassured.</p>



<p>“Yeah. So, shall we get on with it?” Kairi said and looked at the futon.</p>



<p>“Eh? Eeeh!?” Misha finally realized that she was being teased. “Geez, geez, geez.” Puffing her cheeks, she hit his chest repeatedly.</p>



<p>“Haha, sorry.” While laughing, Kairi gently stroked her hair.</p>



<p>“Muu.” Although she stopped her hands, she turned a complaining eyes at him. “I’m not gonna forgive you if you don’t give me lots of love,” Misha made a sulking appeal.</p>



<p><em>She’s sooo cute.</em></p>



<p>Kairi was surging with affection and hugged her tightly.</p>



<p>“Kya!” Misha raised a brief scream at the suddenness, but immediately resigned herself to him. “It’s so warm.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re warm too, Misha.”</p>



<p>The two sounded like a couple who got into an accident on a snowy mountain.</p>



<p>In any case, Kairi had no intention at all to do such a thing to Misha, however.</p>



<p>“Fufu,” Kairi laughed, and the caught Misha also laughed.</p>



<p>It was still Misha who initiated the kiss first.</p>



<p>“Hnnm.”</p>



<p>Kairi also imagined it would turn like this, so he easily embraced her slender body.</p>



<p>“Chu, chu, slrrp.”</p>



<p>Not long after, she went to insert her tongue.</p>



<p>He wondered what it was with her going shy from looking like going into a rut.</p>



<p><em>Not gonna say it, though</em>.</p>



<p>Kairi was also already completely on board.</p>



<p>He didn’t want to break the momentum from making a trivial interruption.</p>



<p>“Slrrpslrrp♡.”</p>



<p>“Chuchumu.”</p>



<p>Their tongues intertwined, occasionally stimulating the inside of each other’s mouths.</p>



<p><em>Man, it feels good just kissing</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>He thought his past self was foolish for wondering whether there was such a thing as feeling it just from kissing.</p>



<p>At least with Misha as the partner, it seemed he could feel good in all aspects.</p>



<p>“Ahn, Kairi, you’re also passionate♡,” Misha said happily, because he was starting to take off her clothes.</p>



<p>“You too, Misha,” Kairi retorted, because she was also doing the same thing.</p>



<p>While using a bit of time, they went to undress each other.</p>



<p>“Chu, chu♡.”</p>



<p>“This sure is hard.”</p>



<p>Taking off clothes while kissing was increasing the difficulty.</p>



<p>Despite Kairi having experienced personally, Misha was more skillful.</p>



<p>“Wanna use magic?” she asked him, having stopped her hands and pulling away her lips.</p>



<p>“Somehow that’s just not the same.” Kairi shook his head and stopped.</p>



<p>He thought that it was nice because they were undressing themselves.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Using magic would dampen the mood, wouldn’t it?”</p>



<p>To his words, “&#8230;I think you’re right,” Misha said and clapped her hands.</p>



<p>By the time the two came to the same opinion, they got naked and moved to the futon.</p>



<p>“I sure wish I’d bought a futon,” Kairi said.</p>



<p>It was cheap-ish for making love to one another.</p>



<p>“Oh my, I like it, you know?” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>Kairi felt that she was trying to be nice about it, but she was serious.</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t supporting one another and gradually getting things better as a husband and wife also be a true charm?” She revealed her thoughts.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I won’t deny it,” Kairi admitted.</p>



<p>He was also a man, so he thought ‘with my own hands,’ but a wife probably also got a different opinion.</p>



<p><em>And it’s obviously better to support one another anyway</em>.</p>



<p>He wasn’t an obstinate one, so he got no qualms about getting her support.</p>



<p>“Fufuh♡.” Misha laughed as though seeing through Kairi’s complicated state of mind, and gently kissed his right cheek. “Now, come♡.” Misha lay down on the futon on her back, and spread her legs in an M-shape.</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Like a bug heading towards a light trap, Kairi fitted his rising sword. “Here I go,” he briefly spoke, and inserted himself into her.</p>



<p>“Nnh♡ wonderful♡,” exclaiming, Misha’s eyes moistened.</p>



<p>“You too, Misha. It’s awesome,” said Kairi.</p>



<p>He’d noticed that exchanging words with one another lifted up the mood.</p>



<p>“Really? I’m happy♡,” Misha said and went to kiss him again.</p>



<p>“Nn.” While responding to her, Kairi tried to slowly move his hips.</p>



<p>“Nnnnh♡,” a voice of great joy came out of Misha in an instant.</p>



<p>“Crap…” As usual, Kairi’s vocabulary remained utterly wrecked. “Your inside, really is the best, Misha.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To his direct words, “Fufuh♡ I’m happy♡.” Misha laughed and went to kiss him again.</p>



<p>Kairi took it, and gently pinned her down.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Come to think of it, we’ve never turned off the light, huh.” Kairi noticed now after all this time.</p>



<p>“I don’t really mind, you know? I want you♡ to see me lots instead♡,” replied Misha with a smile.</p>



<p>“I-I see.” Kairi flinched just for a little, but he immediately bounced back.</p>



<p>It was already too late in the game for her to take him by surprise now.</p>



<p>“I’m a little embarrassed, though.” He got embarrassed.</p>



<p>His body was not trained, and not one that women would be impressed with.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, isn’t it? I love you always, no matter what kind of body you have.” Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>If it was her, she probably would really accept it.</p>



<p>He believed it, and for this reason, he kissed her so naturally.</p>



<p>“Chu♡ fufu.” Even after it was done already, Misha laughed happily. “I love kissing you♡.”</p>



<p>“Me either.” Responding to her words, Kairi slowly moved.</p>



<p>“Aahh♡ aaaahn♡,” Misha immediately moaned.</p>



<p>She seemed to be already in high gear on her own.</p>



<p>“I think it was right here.”</p>



<p>Since Kairi still got room to spare, he put into practice her preferred way of offense.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ I’m weak♡ there♡.” Misha acknowledged it.</p>



<p>Though, even without getting told, he might’ve figured it out just from her voice.</p>



<p>After all, she was squeezing and clamping down, not letting him away.</p>



<p>“Urgh.”</p>



<p>Because of that, he quickly ran out of slack.</p>



<p><em>Here I thought I’d get used to it, train for it</em>.</p>



<p>He felt there was still a long way to go.</p>



<p>Or maybe Misha’s inside was just too good.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m so happy♡ that I can feel your manly sword♡,” said Misha.</p>



<p>Hearts were floating in her eyes.</p>



<p>“I’m happy, too,” Kairi replied.</p>



<p>Only he was allowed to see the hot, melted expression of such a cute elf wife.</p>



<p><em>The feeling of superiority is crazy</em>.</p>



<p>It was the source driving his excitement.</p>



<p>He quickened his movement little by little, giving the rise to the sound of: Pang pang.</p>



<p>“Aaah♡ haahh♡ aaaahh♡.”</p>



<p>Just as Misha’s voice was becoming more intense, and her hips were beginning to move, <em>wait hold on, it’s daytime now, right?</em> It finally hit Kairi.</p>



<p><em>I wouldn’t have cared if it was night, but</em>.</p>



<p>He could occasionally hear voices from the neighborhood, so he figured it went both ways.</p>



<p>However, it was currently broad daylight.</p>



<p>Kairi’s hesitation grew bigger, and he ended up stopping his movement.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ …What’s wrong?” Misha asked curiously, having noticed it.</p>



<p>Her impatient expression was so hot.</p>



<p>Despite being charmed by it, Kairi put reasons first.</p>



<p>“It’s still noon and all, so we might be noisy,” he pointed.</p>



<p>He indeed wanted to avoid using direct expression.</p>



<p>“Is that how it is?” Despite Misha having a wondering look on her face for an instant, “Then soundproof magic♡,” she pointed her right hand towards the ceiling and invoked magic. “Now we don’t have to worry about sound leaking♡. So, you know?” Next, she begged with moist eyes.</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Kairi nodded.</p>



<p>There was no room to doubt the usefulness of her magic.</p>



<p>And if there was no reason to worry about making noises anymore, there seemed to be no reason to stop.</p>



<p>“Haaaahh♡ aaah♡ aaaaaahn♡.” Misha tangled her slender legs around Kairi’s hips and moaned unreservedly.</p>



<p>Kairi, too, hammered his hips, trying not to be outdone.</p>



<p>“A-Amazing♡ aaaah♡ I’m happy♡,” Misha squealed with delight.</p>



<p>Her hands were also wrapped around his back, and held tightly.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m…the same,” Kairi squeezed out the words while enduring the pleasure reaching his brain.</p>



<p>He wondered why he felt like just putting it into words was increasing the good feeling.</p>



<p>“Haahh♡ aaahh♡ aaaaahn♡.”</p>



<p>He didn’t have the luxury to think. “Amazing… it’s crazy…” He was immersing himself in the act with Misha.</p>



<p>She got small breasts, and her butt wasn&#8217;t big either.</p>



<p>However, that was good for Kairi.</p>



<p><em>I won’t deny that big is hot, but</em>.</p>



<p><em>It’s not everything</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>“Kairi♡ Kairi♡.”</p>



<p>Also, simply a cute girl getting disordered, and calling his own name longingly.</p>



<p><em>This one got more destructive power</em>, Kairi sensed.</p>



<p>Thinking that it wouldn’t be good to be monotonous, he added some variation.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ …Fueh?” He suddenly slowed down his pace, so Misha let out a puzzled voice.</p>



<p>Not just stabbing deep, he tried to move in a circle.</p>



<p>“Fuah♡” aaahh♡ what’s this♡.” The effect was immediate, and Misha immediately squealed with delight.</p>



<p><em>That’s great</em>, Kairi was relieved seeing her reaction.<em> I guess I just want to please a girl</em>. He believed that that was a man’s long-cherished desire.</p>



<p>It might be an old-fashioned thought, however.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ this is also good♡ more♡,” Misha begged coquettishly.</p>



<p>“Saying you want more totally just makes me want to work harder…!”</p>



<p>While thinking he was so simple, Kairi moved powerfully.</p>



<p>“Aaah♡ this is good♡ aaaahh♡ haaaaahhh♡.” Misha shut her eyes tight, and resigned herself to him.</p>



<p><em>Even though it would be much more if we moved together</em>.</p>



<p><em>Oh?</em> Kairi thought.</p>



<p>However, he immediately interpreted this as her being engrossed in it.</p>



<p><em>Then let’s step up the gear</em>, or so he decided, but he also didn&#8217;t have much room to spare.</p>



<p>“Uuh… I think I’m getting close,” he confessed.</p>



<p>He would like to cum together if possible.</p>



<p>“I think♡ it’s a bit more for me♡,” Misha responded, feeling the same way.</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Feeling he was still the quicker one, he reached his hand to her secret place.</p>



<p>“Aahn♡.” He stimulated her pearl with his fingers.</p>



<p>He planned to drive her to the edge by giving her even more stimulations while moving and out slowly.</p>



<p><em>While at it anyway</em>, he thought, and tried to attack her nipple with his other hand.</p>



<p>“Aaah♡ three places at once♡,” Misha’s voice heightened, producing a definite result.</p>



<p>“Alright.” In a good mood, Kairi put his mouth on the other nipple.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ s-sucking my boobs♡?”</p>



<p>In fact, it was the first time he’d ever sucked on her nipple.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s so tasty,” Kairi muttered.</p>



<p>Of course it shouldn&#8217;t be possible for milk to come out of Misha, but this was an issue of mood.</p>



<p>A beautiful new elf wife moaning from being plunged by his own manly sword.</p>



<p>“Aaaahn♡ you’re sucking it♡ haaah♡ like a baby♡.”</p>



<p>Licking and sucking on that nipple was the best spice of all.</p>



<p>“‘Cause it’s tasty, you know?” he said as he sucked her nipple harder.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ haah♡.”</p>



<p>Misha was clearly on her wits’ ends, perhaps her nipples were weak.</p>



<p><em>Looks like I’ve found her weak point with this</em>, Kairi smiled to himself.</p>



<p>Maybe because of lack of experience, but she seemed to be more dominant in bed.</p>



<p><em>I wanna satisfy her after all</em>.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be good to get satisfied only with himself.</p>



<p><em>Also, I want to take the initiative if there’s a chance, too</em>, or so he felt as well.</p>



<p>“Should I stop?”</p>



<p>When he asked, “Don’t stop♡ don’t be mean♡,” Misha immediately begged.</p>



<p><em>How should I say, this is so nice</em>, he felt.</p>



<p>When taking the initiative against a beautiful elf like her, and got begged even, there was a considerable sense of conquest.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/zvhlsq5.jpg"></img>


<p>“Yeah, I got it,” replied Kairi.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like he meant to tease Misha.</p>



<p>He simply wanted them both to come to climax.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ it’s going deep, again♡,” she immediately raised a coquettish voice right after Kairi plunged her deep again.</p>



<p>“Didn’t you want it?” Kairi asked, not meaning to be mean, but as part of the play.</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah♡ I wanted it♡ I wanted this♡ I did want yoooours♡,” Misha yelled in a sweet voice.</p>



<p><em>I didn’t mean to make her say this much, though.</em></p>



<p>It was making Kairi happy that it got things fired up this way.</p>



<p>“That’s great to hear,” he said, putting in strength and going in and out.</p>



<p>“Aah♡ haaahh♡ aaaah♡.” Being able to get what she’d been impatiently waiting for, Misha was greatly pleased.</p>



<p>“Haahhh…” Kairi gathered his breath, and gave the last throttle.</p>



<p>Pang pang—clashes of flesh echoed, “I’m cumming♡ cumming, cummiiiing!!” and Misha reached ecstasy first.</p>



<p>“Kuh…” One moment later, Kairi also finished inside her.</p>



<p>“Nn♡ Lot of it is coming out♡.” Misha accepted his seed in ecstasy.</p>



<p>“Phew,” Kairi let out a breath, and then, “I see? I wonder if I recovered overnight.” He tilted his head.</p>



<p>Before sleeping and after waking up, he hadn’t had her use magic on him.</p>



<p>It was hard to believe that he’d gotten completely energetic.</p>



<p>“Yeah. Looks like you’re getting resilience, probably from the magic used,” Misha said and kissed him.</p>



<p>“Eh, is that so?” Kairi opened his eyes wide because it was the first time he heard it. “Does magic have that kind of effect?”</p>



<p>Hearing his question, “Yeah. I didn’t want you to have any weird preconceptions since it differs greatly from person to person, so I didn’t explain it to you,” Misha answered, and then her face turned meek. “I’m sorry. I should’ve told you in advance, didn’t I?”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to worry about it.” Kairi accepted her apology with a smile. “It’s not like there’s any troubling side effects, right?” he checked it with her, nevertheless.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I just think you’re more energetic than usual,” Misha replied, relieved.</p>



<p>“Then that just means there’s an advantage but no disadvantage.” Even Kairi thought he’d gotten an advantage from it.</p>



<p>“You really are so brave and kind, huh,” Misha was impressed.</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Kairi tilted his head.</p>



<p><em>To get a body that can easily recover is probably something that people today want</em>, he felt.</p>



<p>Of course, his way of thinking was probably different from Misha’s.</p>



<p><em>Then not denying it might turn advantageous here</em>, he calculated.</p>



<p>He was also a human, and got the feelings to want to be admired and respected by his beloved wife.</p>



<p>Nothing would break even when that was fulfilled.</p>



<p>“You too. You’re really a lovely wife,” he said and kissed her on the cheek.</p>



<p>“I’m happy.” Without a moment’s delay, he returned a kiss.</p>



<p>It was the cheek at first, but immediately moved to the lips.</p>



<p>“Don’t you wanna go again?” Misha, although having parted their lips, asked him while still connected.</p>



<p>“I want to, but I’m thinking it’s time to check out the response to the stream,” Kairi said while feeling reluctant.</p>



<p>And they were just done with the first round.</p>



<p>Still the first one had just been done.</p>



<p>It would be too soon to be satisfied that they’d followed through it all.</p>



<p>“You’re right. I might even be able to find upcoming topics.” Misha looked regretful, but she seemed to have shifted her mood for now.</p>



<p>They separated, cleaned up the mess, and got dressed.</p>



<p>“Now let’s see how it goes,” Kairi said to shift his own focus as well.</p>



<p>“Half anxious, half anticipating, isn’t it?” Misha said and looked into the screen from the side.</p>



<p>He went to gather up online reactions about a streamer named Misa.</p>



<p>“This is the so-called ‘ego searching,’ alright?” Kairi told her.</p>



<p>He was the one doing it, but he was acting on behalf of Misha who was still unfamiliar with the systems of this world, so it should be fine to call it ego searching.</p>



<p>“I sure have heard about it,” said Misha.</p>



<p>“Really, where do you get your information from?”</p>



<p><em>The biggest mystery</em>, Kairi thought.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like she was wrong, and the time to teach from scratch could be significantly omitted, so he was grateful, however.</p>



<p>“Fufu, a secret♡.” Putting on airs, Misha smiled.</p>



<p>“Eeh,” or so Kairi reacted, but he actually was able to guess it.</p>



<p><em>I suppose it’s one of those magic things</em>, he thought.</p>



<p>Rather, it was hard to imagine any other way other than magic for Misha to gather information without making a blunder and being noticed by him.</p>



<p>“Tell me about it sometime.” What he said was meant to be playing around, a kind of communication.</p>



<p>“When I feel like it♡,” Misha replied smilingly, perhaps also feeling the same way.</p>



<p>“Haha.”</p>



<p>“Fufu.”</p>



<p>They both stared at each other and bursted into laughter.</p>



<p>After a short while, Kairi was the first to come back to his senses. “Oops, gotta go back to ego searching.”</p>



<p>“You’re right.”</p>



<p>Compared to him, Misha seemed slightly more regretful.</p>



<p><em>Does she just want to flirt with me?</em> Kairi held a question.</p>



<p>He was happy, but they couldn’t keep on living with that alone.</p>



<p>“Ooh? I see that both the subscriber numbers and SNS followers are increasing.” Kairi was hopeful.</p>



<p>“Oh my, is that so?” Misha couldn’t quite understand it.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I think it was a great success for the first stream, you know?” he told her.</p>



<p>Suddenly becoming a buzz and reaching tens of thousands… was a pipe dream now.</p>



<p>“I suppose in the early days we should stream daily as much as possible, and gradually gain recognition.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I will.” Misha obediently nodded.</p>



<p>Seeing her state, Kairi began to feel slightly guilty.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry that I couldn’t think of a decent strategy,” he apologized.</p>



<p>“? Why are you apologizing?” Misha tilted her head. “You’re staying with me, and supporting me, right? That’s plenty, you know?”</p>



<p>“Misha.” At her words, Kairi felt a little apologetic, but at the same time his chest became warm.</p>



<p>“We both just have to support each other, and help each other,” Misha said, and softly hugged him.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right.”</p>



<p>Kairi returned the hug.</p>
