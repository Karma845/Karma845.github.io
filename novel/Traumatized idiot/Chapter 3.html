<h2>Chapter 3: SNS Syndrome</h2>

<p>I am a worthless being. My name is Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hot&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I mutter words that have no meaning, but it&#8217;s unavoidable. It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>



<p>Today, the temperature exceeded 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) . As early summer arrives, the scorching sunlight is unbearable. With the cicadas&#8217; chirping as background music, I realized something that was perfectly natural.</p>



<p>I was heading towards the shopping mall. I&#8217;m still growing, so my height has increased. The swimsuit I used in middle school had become too small. I rarely wear it except for swimming lessons, but if an adult woman invites me, I can&#8217;t refuse.</p>



<p>Mio-san and Tristy-san invited me to choose a swimsuit, but I decisively declined. It&#8217;s an impossible task for me, who has never had a girlfriend before. Both of them have excellent figures. Especially Tristy-san, who is half-Japanese, I won&#8217;t go into details, but she&#8217;s well-endowed and impressive. It&#8217;s like having airbags!</p>



<p>As I exit the station, I spot a familiar figure from afar. The airbags are bouncing.</p>



<p>Tristy-san, the person in question, stands out with her dazzling hair color.</p>


<p>I hesitate whether to call out to her but decide against it. My relationship with Tristy-san is quite strange.</p>



<p>I am the victim, and she is the perpetrator. We only met by chance due to an accident.</p>



<p>And yet, it&#8217;s strange to be invited to hang out by such a person.</p>



<p>Tristy-san and Mio-san invited me to go to the pool.</p>



<p>They say it&#8217;s to apologize, but now I regret agreeing to it.</p>



<p>Tristy-san seems to feel guilty, and she has been quite considerate towards me, but it&#8217;s not good for either of us to settle for that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s so beautiful, she must have a boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>The person next to her must be her boyfriend. A handsome couple. Whether they had a meeting arrangement or not, Tristy-san runs towards her boyfriend with a radiant smile, and they embrace each other tightly.</p>



<p>The two of them make a perfect match. They embody the ideal couple.</p>


<p>I wonder if it was really a good idea for me to accept the invitation. From Tristy-san&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s perspective, I&#8217;m just an intruder. The apologies and compensation for the accident are already settled. Our relationship ends there.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no reason for Tristy-san to be involved with me anymore.</p>



<p>Even though we won&#8217;t be alone, going to the pool with a guy is probably not a pleasant feeling for her boyfriend. What should I do? This is troublesome&#8230;</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the heat, I decide to take a break and enter a nearby cafe. Wiping off sweat with a handkerchief, I order iced coffee and start thinking about what happened yesterday.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Shiori apparently received a confession from Suzuki, a second-year senior who is said to be the next ace of the baseball club. She came to me specifically to say, &#8220;I turned him down properly, Yuki!&#8221; with her usual cheerful smile. It&#8217;s thoughtful of her, but Shiori is popular. I can vouch for that.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I felt a sense of discomfort even back then. Shiori expressed her feelings for me, and so did Hinagi. But I haven&#8217;t given them an answer.</p>



<p>Am I just a piece of garbage?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m nothing but a benchwarmer. In fact, I should be benched myself!</p>



<p>Now that I think about it, I haven&#8217;t given any response to the &#8220;love&#8221; directed towards me by these girls. I&#8217;m a damn scumbag. I deserve a thousand deaths.</p>



<p>Seriously, this is the worst&#8230; I&#8217;ve never paid attention to others before. I thought I was being rejected. My world revolved around me alone.</p>



<p>But now I&#8217;ve realized that&#8217;s not the case. I grabbed onto the extended hand.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know who Suzuki-senpai is. But if he truly likes Shiori and confessed with sincerity, then Suzuki-senpai is far more earnestly looking at Shiori than I am.</p>



<p>Within the rejected confessions of Shiori, there might have been someone who could genuinely make her happy, someone who could reciprocate the affection she holds for them.</p>



<p>I am different from someone who is always searching for &#8220;affection.&#8221;</p>



<p>Was it good for Shiori to turn down the confession? Such a self-righteous thought.</p>



<p>Since she made her own decision to decline, I have no right to say anything.</p>



<p>However, if I had given an answer earlier, for example, if I had clearly responded that I couldn&#8217;t reciprocate Shiori&#8217;s feelings, she might have had new options.</p>



<p>There might have been a chance for the sincere confession of someone to be rewarded.</p>


<p>&#8212;-I am being cruel.</p>



<p>Will I be able to fall in love with someone again? Will there ever be a day when that happens? And above all, is it fair to keep dragging these girls along, unsure of my own feelings?</p>



<p>By keeping the answer on hold, avoiding their &#8220;love,&#8221; and remaining stagnant in the same place, I may be robbing them of their future and possibilities.</p>



<p>Is it okay for me to be near these girls?</p>






<p>&#8220;Leon, long time no see! Are you going to be in Japan from now on?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I finally managed to come over here.&#8221;</p>



<p>It had been three years since Tristy had seen her brother Leon. While Tristy and their family moved to Japan, Leon was the only one who stayed abroad for work.</p>



<p>Finally, after finishing his work handover, Leon had decided to live in Japan starting this summer.</p>



<p>However, it seemed that he wasn&#8217;t accustomed to the Japanese summer yet, as he wiped off copious amounts of sweat in the sweltering heat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go inside the store quickly. I miss the air conditioning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Japanese summers are hot, right? But you&#8217;ll get used to it soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite saying that, they headed towards the mall, seeking refuge from the harsh sunlight.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Leon&#8217;s place far from here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a 20-minute walk from the station, so I can visit anytime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great. Mom and Dad will be happy too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, it must have been tough for you. You caused an accident, right? Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. The other person involved was really nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was surprised when Mom told me. I&#8217;m just glad that nothing happened to you, Tristy.&#8221;</p>


<p>Engaging in casual sibling banter, they strolled through the mall together.</p>



<p>Tristy had met up with Leon here to help him gather the things he needed for his new place. Leon was going to live alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I think I&#8217;ve got most of the things I need now. What about you, Tristy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s my turn next. Follow me!&#8221;</p>



<p>After finishing Leon&#8217;s shopping, Tristy headed towards her intended destination.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, are you buying a swimsuit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You should pick one too, Leon. Don&#8217;t you have one?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re choosing quite a flashy swimsuit. Did you get a boyfriend or something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s not like that! He&#8217;s not&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Oh, I hit the mark, huh? Introduce him to me sometime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that! Yukito is the person involved in the accident—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Accident? What&#8217;s that about? Is he your destined partner or something? It&#8217;s Japanese culture, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy hurriedly denied, but she could feel her face turning red.</p>



<p>Leon smiled warmly as he observed his sister earnestly choosing a swimsuit.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>&#8220;So this is what &#8216;away&#8217; feels like&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As we approach summer, the sun sets much later in the day.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s transitioning from dusk to the darkness of the night. When I look up at the sky, it&#8217;s dyed in a vibrant azure color, reminiscent of glazed pottery.</p>



<p>I find myself in a very out-of-place situation. Just being here challenges my identity as an introverted. Who am I? Yukito Kokonoe. Is that really who I am?</p>



<p>Amidst the cheerful commotion around me, my heart feels cloudy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, sorry to keep you waiting!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, you don&#8217;t have to rush like that; he won&#8217;t run away, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For me, I&#8217;d run away as much as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, I&#8217;ve been cornered! Two people come out of the changing room, and everything suddenly becomes more dazzling.</p>



<p>Mio-san and Tristy-san invited me to the night pool.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a spell that deals significant damage to an introvert. I&#8217;m already feeling blue.</p>



<p>When it comes to summer, the only thing I would usually do is watch B-movie shark films. It&#8217;s not a place I would naturally find myself in. It has low priority for me.</p>


<p>Of all places, I ended up here. It turns out that I, Yukito Kokonoe, am a man who cannot even hold a candle to the winds of the introvert world.</p>



<p>As I catch a glimpse of Mio-san and Tristy-san, an inadvertent comment escapes my lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;EEEEEHHHHH!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t that a little too straightforward!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing to be seen like this&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s not enough fabric?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit flashy, isn&#8217;t it? I put in all my effort!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa. Having a good figure really makes a difference. I&#8217;m so envious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think both are great.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Which swimsuit do you prefer?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Which one do you like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you please stop presenting me with choices that only create dissonance?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s definitely a situation where cracks in friendship can appear. No one benefits from it.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you choose me, I&#8217;ll provide some service, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t accept service overtime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, even if you don&#8217;t choose, I&#8217;ll still provide the service!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you overtime for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I received some (?) service from Tristy-san. It made me happy.</p>


<p>I was invited to hang out as an apology, but I never expected it to be at a night pool. It might be more comfortable than during the day, but I&#8217;m more inclined toward dark and damp caves rather than brightly lit holes. However, I don&#8217;t have anyone who would invite me to such a place.</p>



<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have many acquaintances to begin with!</p>



<p>As I indulged in self-deprecating thoughts, I was immediately flanked on both sides, with my escape route cut off.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a great time today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, how do I look?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s like the Rococo style.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I take your praise as a compliment?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked for my opinion on their swimsuits, I answered honestly.</p>


<p>In this situation, there&#8217;s no way I could express a negative opinion.</p>



<p>Mio-san is wearing an off-shoulder bikini, while Tristy-san is also in a bikini, but with her incredible figure, she looks like a model.</p>



<p>They have already caught the attention of those around us. Despite that, they stick close, but now we&#8217;re all in swimwear. When they come into contact with me, our skin directly touches.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have two flowers in your hand, Yukito-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a burden.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a selfie, a group photo!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that really okay? I don&#8217;t want any social media scandals later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine! Only my friends will see it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t want to be identified&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png?fit=612%2C864&amp;ssl=1"/>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been through this already, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When did my rights become a free pass?&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this the dark side of social media?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey. Yukito, what do you usually do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do I usually do? Well, I guess I often get involved in troubles and such.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Coming from someone who got involved last time, try not to say scary things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry&#8230; It must have hurt!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t worry about it. It&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mio-san and Tristy-san looked a bit down.</p>


<p>Oh no, they invited me to hang out like this. I should have a good time or it&#8217;ll be a waste.</p>



<p>Besides, even though I have some inherent issues, troubles don&#8217;t happen all the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Big sister, why don&#8217;t you play with us? Is that kid over there someone&#8217;s brother or&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I twisted his arm and threw it into the empty pool. Splashes of water flew up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kou-niiiiii!&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing all of a sudden—&#8221;</p>



<p>I twisted his arm and threw it into the empty pool. Splashes of water flew up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shin-niiiiii! Wait, wait! I&#8217;m sorry! We&#8217;re not forcing you to come along—&#8221;</p>



<p>I twisted his arm and threw it into the empty pool. Splashes of water flew up.</p>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Yuu-niiiiiiiiiiii!&#8217;</p>



<p>I sighed in relief as the self-introductions faded away.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s peaceful today.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are days without troubles. If there were constant incidents happening every single day in this safe Japan, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to handle it. I want these peaceful days to continue.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really something, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Which one?</p>



<p>&#8220;Being near Yukito feels like the safest option! Let&#8217;s play, let&#8217;s play!&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh boy. I instinctively shrugged my shoulders. I tried to act like one of those laid-back protagonists, but honestly, I ended up playing a lot. It seems the laid-back type doesn&#8217;t suit me.</p>



<p>But then again, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been to a pool or something.</p>



<p>&#8220;But really, did something happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have no self-awareness, do you?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been getting approached by outgoing older sisters and brothers quite a lot lately.</p>



<p>While eating the frankfurt that the laughing older brother treated us to, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got so much&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Mio-san and Tristy-san also seemed bewildered by the meals and drinks they were treated to.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, the trio I threw into the pool earlier, the 3G, seemed to be getting attention from the nearby older sisters. It was quite a heartwarming sight.</p>



<p>As a self-proclaimed introverted loner, I had been irrationally hostile towards extroverts and party people, but it turns out they&#8217;re all nice people! It was just my vision that was clouded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mio-san, is there a rule for this night pool that only good people can enter?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;How can you see reality with such clouded eyes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun is interesting, that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s getting attention!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like you could do well anywhere in the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hmm, did I have any elements that would attract attention?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh right, speaking of the future, Yukito-kun, have you decided on your career path?&#8221;</p>



<p>I pondered Mio-san&#8217;s question. Being a beekeeper on a remote island was rejected. While there&#8217;s also the option of helping my independent mother, even though it was denied by Hinagi, I haven&#8217;t given up yet.</p>



<p>&#8220;The path of a vagabond, perhaps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too scary! It&#8217;s not just about black labor.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, let&#8217;s keep the horror comments for summer only. Anyway, I understand that you&#8217;re not thinking about it. But if we say that, it might apply to us as well.&#8221;</p>




<p>Mio-san chuckled awkwardly, looking troubled.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with your career path?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you know, we have to start thinking about job hunting soon. We can only play like this for now. It&#8217;s going to get busier from here on. Ugh, it&#8217;s depressing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If things don&#8217;t work out, Yukito-kun, you can ask my dad for help. He can do something about it. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m like that, but my dad is pretty impressive.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems Tristy-san&#8217;s father works as an executive in the Japanese branch of a foreign company.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve gained a powerful connection! Sorry, but life is about connections. That&#8217;s the reality.</p>



<p>By the way, once you become a university student, you&#8217;re on the verge of entering society. It&#8217;s the time when you start seriously considering your future life plans.</p>



<p>I can only hope that Mio-san and Tristy-san can follow the path they desire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, would you like something to drink?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a sports drink, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>We changed clothes and took a break after having exhausted ourselves playing. We were enveloped in a pleasant feeling of fatigue.</p>



<p>Swimming is a full-body exercise. It consumes more energy than I thought. I feel like I&#8217;ll fall asleep as soon as I get home. It was already past 20:00. It&#8217;s about time we leave, or else we&#8217;ll be in trouble.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had fun today. What are you going to do after this, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home. Since I&#8217;m underage, I can&#8217;t stay out late at night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, that makes sense. Can I invite you again sometime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I had a great time too.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I told my mother and sister that I would be going out with Mio-san and the others, they were strangely unhappy.</p>



<p>I have no idea what would happen if I came home late at night.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, if it&#8217;s okay, Yukito-kun, would you like to come to my house next time? We&#8217;re having a family BBQ.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To Tristy-san&#8217;s house? That&#8217;s a bit&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it not okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san looked sad and lowered her gaze, but there was something she had been concerned about while we were having fun today.</p>



<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be right to your boyfriend, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Boyfriend? Who?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, Tristy-san, don&#8217;t you have a boyfriend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t! There&#8217;s no such person!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? But I happened to see you hugging each other in front of the mall the other day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does this mean, Tristy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t have one! The mall&#8230; wait, could it be about my brother?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean it was your brother?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. When I went to buy a swimsuit the other day, my brother—Leon—finally managed to come here, so we just met. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re dating or anything!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was worried that you were playing with me even though you had a boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it! I swear, it&#8217;s definitely not like that! In fact, Leon said he wanted to meet you too. Even Mom and Dad want to meet you, so would you come to my house next time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, in that case&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t realize I suddenly had more visitors wanting to meet me, but I see, so his name is Leon.</p>



<p>I thought Tristy-san and him were a handsome couple, but if he&#8217;s Tristy-san&#8217;s brother, it&#8217;s understandable that he&#8217;s also handsome. It seems my needless worry was for nothing.</p>



<p>Looks like the shura was averted. I&#8217;m glad, I&#8217;m glad.</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry. I lied, Shura was not avoided at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as I returned home, I was made to kneel down. My sister, who is beautiful as always, is now piercing me with her sharp gaze. It&#8217;s starting to become pleasurable for me.</p>



<p>On my smartphone, there was a selfie that Tristy-san had sent me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just as it looks&#8230; having a great time, huh? You&#8217;re all lovey-dovey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Han, I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s always been praised for being too serious and scary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate to brag, but it&#8217;s not popular at all, not even a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with your self-awareness? So, what&#8217;s the relationship?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more like a victim and perpetrator&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eek!&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san had previously come to apologize with her family. Thanks to that, my mother knows Tristy-san, but my sister, who wasn&#8217;t present at the time, doesn&#8217;t know her.</p>



<p>When I explained the situation, my sister was dumbfounded, and I felt the same way.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s incomprehensible that a victim and a perpetrator are playing together so harmoniously.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if you have some kind of aura that makes older people like you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? It&#8217;s scary.&#8221;</p>


<p>My sister muttered in exasperation, but for me, who has a reputation for being unlucky with women, it&#8217;s not a laughing matter. For me, women are synonymous with trouble, but even so, I stopped cutting off everything and took a step forward.</p>



<p>In order for me to change, I needed the help of others. I didn&#8217;t want to leave their one-sided feelings as they were.</p>



<p>I realized that it was a cowardly and sinful act. Regardless of the answer, if I don&#8217;t respond, it will end up being unhappy for everyone. Stagnation has gone on for far too long.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t behave with the unconsciousness of a harem protagonist.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess the only option now is for me to wear a micro bikini.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to see it! Haa!? My true thoughts slipped out&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite honest too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it. This is more like a conditioned reflex, like Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s Pavlov, and it&#8217;s definitely not my true feelings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to see it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure about this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Doubts crossed my mind, but since my sister gave the green light, it should be fine. In this chaotic and demon-infested Kokonoe&#8217;s household, worrying about the details would be a lost cause.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, uhm&#8230; Do you have someone you like or anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t siblings normally not talk about that kind of thing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a normal relationship until now. It&#8217;s fine, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not just me. Mom will be part of the family meeting too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At least, at least spare me that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Afterward, I was subjected to intense questioning.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>On Monday morning, a gloomy atmosphere dominated both teachers and students alike.</p>



<p>In a melancholic mood, thoughts like, &#8220;I wish a meteorite would fall and give us a day off from school,&#8221; crossed everyone&#8217;s mind. Amidst such inappropriate musings, a most tactless young man casually appeared in the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yukito!? Your face is pale!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi Suzurikawa rushed over in a panic. Sensing something serious, the other classmates quickly gathered as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, are you feeling unwell? Should we go to the infirmary?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, seriously? Your dark circles are awful. Are you sleep-deprived?&#8221;</p>


<p>Concerned, Kouki Mihou inquired. Yukito, gasping for breath, murmured weakly.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Gambling&#8230; is bad. Absolutely.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a thud, Yukito collapsed right there on the spot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, pull yourself together! Yukito?!&#8221;</p>



<p>To understand why this young man was so exhausted and distressed, we must go back to the events of the previous day.</p>






<p>&#8220;&#8230;Such heavy rain. I was planning to go out wit you.&#8221; </p>



<p>My mother sighed softly while gazing out the window. Curiosity piqued, I looked up at the sky as well.</p>



<p>The rain had been pouring since morning, steadily intensifying. Thick clouds stretched endlessly without a break.</p>



<p>Despite it being daytime, the room felt dim and gloomy. It seemed like the right choice to stay indoors and quietly pass the time at home.</p>




<p>&#8220;I have an idea! How about playing a game for a change?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A Game?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom claps her hands, as if she has just come up with a great idea.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t recall ever playing a game together with my mother before, but with nothing else to do and just idling around in the living room, it might be a good idea. Some quality parent-child time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we play mahjong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just the two of us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri will be here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But that still makes three.&#8221;</p>



<p>While there is a variant of mahjong for three players, the rules are somewhat unconventional, and with three people, there&#8217;s no need to be fixated on playing mahjong. My sister, who had somehow appeared in the room, briskly prepared the mahjong table.</p>




<p>&#8220;Why do we have a mahjong table in our house?&#8221;</p>



<p>Amidst the numerous unsolvable mysteries that arose, the doorbell rang.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan, hello there! I bought lots of snacks. Let&#8217;s eat together!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sekka-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>In a strangely natural flow of events, the four of us gathered together. </p>



<p>I wondered if there was something important happening on such a stormy day, but it seemed they had simply come to hang out without any specific reason. Sekka&#8217;s participation was decided abruptly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, now that the preparations are done, I&#8217;ll go change.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Change clothes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look forward to it, Yuki-chan.&#8221;</p>




<p>Unable to keep up with the rapidly progressing situation, I simply parroted the question.</p>



<p>Left alone and bewildered in the living room, a few minutes later, my mother and the others returned.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-W-What&#8217;s with those outfits!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How do we look?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, the three of them were dressed in Chinese dresses. It was a captivating sight.</p>



<p>They elegantly turned around, exuding a bewitching allure with every move.</p>



<p>Their legs, shamelessly revealed through the slits, captivated the gaze with their slender beauty. And for some reason, they even wore shoes, despite being indoors.</p>


<p>Yuri, in particular, had opted for a mini-length Chinese dresses. It was too provocative. Is this what youth looks like&#8230;?</p>



<p>They ostentatiously crossed their legs and sat on the chairs. Yes, ostentatiously, that&#8217;s the word!</p>




<p>Yuri playfully caressed her chin with a feather fan. She blew a breathy sigh on her neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;With this kind of weather, we have to liven up the mood, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>While my mother was saying something quite reasonable, I felt an intense desire to escape from this situation.</p>



<p>They all looked like villainous female executives. They might say something like &#8220;death to the traitors.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, Yuki-chan. Let&#8217;s get started right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, without my understanding, the &#8220;First Kokonoe Family Mahjong Tournament&#8221; began.</p>






<p>&#8220;Ron!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the first hand of East round, my mother declared a victorious &#8220;Ron&#8221; with excitement as she won on the eight of characters she discarded.</p>



<p>Luck was on her side. While munching on the karinto that Sekka-san brought, I secretly smiled to myself.</p>




<p>I was surprised by the Chinese dresses, but in a mahjong tournament, there must be some kind of reward for the winner. I will be the one to claim victory in this match!</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa&#8230; You really can&#8217;t hold back, can you, Nee-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push yourself too hard, Oba-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be quiet! It&#8217;s embarrassing, but there&#8217;s no helped it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ignoring the exasperated Sekka-san and my sister, my mother&#8217;s cheeks turned cherry blossom pink.</p>



<p>Standing up, my mother boldly slipped her hands into the opened slits on the left and right sides of her dress. Slowly pulling her legs out, she removed the shorts she had been wearing from under her dress and placed them in the nearby basket.</p>



<p>I was captivated by the radiant and graceful thighs, but suddenly snapped out of my daze.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;W-Why are you suddenly undressing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In mahjong, if you lose to your opponent, you have to remove one piece of clothing.&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way such a rule exists!&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother blatantly lied as if it were natural. Even though I may be ignorant and lack common sense, I had never heard of such a rule. To stop this madness, I asked my sister for confirmation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>



<p>EEEEEHHHHHH?! But wait, it&#8217;s likely that my mother and sister are just conspiring together. Please, let it be true! Right, Sekka-san?</p>



<p>&#8220;Really!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that soooooooo!? That&#8217;s amazingggggg!&#8221;</p>



<p>The cry of my soul echoed. Wait, am I the crazy one here? Is there really such a rule in mahjong?</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mainly a local rule that was popular in arcades in the 1990s, but we&#8217;re using it here.&#8221; </p>



<p>Sekka-san kindly explains, but why on earth would such a barbaric rule exist&#8230;?</p>



<p>These days, game centers are dominated by prizes aimed at women, but if you trace back history, there was a time when video games were in their prime.</p>



<p>During that era, the atmosphere was said to be bad, with dimly lit rooms and ashtrays flying around like in a battlefield. Perhaps these mysterious mahjong rules were remnants of that time.</p>



<p>This is bad, really bad! I feel a sense of unease and fear of the unknown creeping over me.</p>



<p>This emotion is called &#8216;fear.&#8217; Could it be that my mother and the others intend to teach me about it&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s continue the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>An unsettling atmosphere gradually enveloped the mahjong tournament.</p>






<p>&#8220;What?! That&#8217;s impossible!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the fourth hand of the East round, my sister discards a Three of Manzu and confidently declares a Ron. I hurriedly check the discard pile, realizing that hardly any Manzu tiles have been discarded so far. Therefore, it&#8217;s highly likely that someone has a concealed hand of Manzu. And based on the discards, the most probable candidate is me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m in a ready hand, waiting for both Three and Six of Manzu, with a Riichi declaration. In this mahjong game with a special rule that requires removing a piece of clothing if you lose, no one wants to go through that. Even my mother and the others must want to avoid it at all costs.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I intentionally formed an obvious ready hand to make it easier for my opponent to read my waiting tiles. Avoiding the Three-Six Manzu tiles should have been an easy task.</p>



<p>But to my surprise, my sister swiftly discards the dangerously powerful Three of Manzu. It&#8217;s a suicidal move.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? You should have Roned the hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-!?&#8221;</p>



<p>My suspicion turns into certainty. She read my waiting tiles perfectly and discarded the winning tile.</p>



<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think of deliberately missing it and winning on a self-drawn tile, would you? I won&#8217;t tolerate such a cheating move in a serious match. It&#8217;s a penalty. Remember that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ron.&#8221;</p>




<p>With no other choice, I reluctantly declare Ron and reveal my hand. The tiles fall weakly onto the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara ara, what a predicament. But it&#8217;s the rule. There&#8217;s nothing we can do about it. It&#8217;s the rule, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri-san reaches around her back. I wonder if she&#8217;s unfastening her bra; it sways gently.</p>



<p>Why? Why would she do such a thing&#8230; Could it be!</p>



<p>&#8220;You planned this!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one calculating.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;ve been calculating Yuri-san&#8217;s moves lately, but this situation is beyond calculation.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t hide my terror at her desperate strategy. Is she really so determined to make herself lose!?</p>



<p>If things continue like this, I will win the game but lose in stripping. Yeah, I don&#8217;t really understand.</p>




<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Yuki-chan. I&#8217;m only wearing this one piece.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sekka, you&#8217;re out of the game!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A sl*tty mother like you, Nee-san, has no right to talk to me like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of both, isn&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll let you win by giving you a Ron.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri-san&#8217;s comforting words sound like devilish whispers to me in my current state.</p>



<p>I finally understand this death game. Come to think of it, there hasn&#8217;t been a single Ron victory among my mother and the others. They&#8217;re in cahoots. They&#8217;re all in on it, using any means necessary to make me lose. Now that I think about it, the timing of Sekka-san coming to our house is too suspicious. Everything was meticulously planned from the beginning.</p>



<p>This is a form of Mahjong where you must not win by Ron.</p>



<p>Only winning by Tsumo is allowed. My mother, sister, and Sekka are all watching me closely, eagerly waiting for a chance to discard winning tiles and give me a chance to lose.</p>



<p>I feel an extreme tension. I quench my thirst with a glass of ice-cold cola. Then, I suddenly realize something.</p>




<p>&#8220;What if, hypothetically, you run out of clothes to discard&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to worry. I&#8217;ll pay with my body, so rest assured. Besides, I&#8217;m like a service character that appears in strip Mahjong games, so Yuki-chan can easily conquer me. Good luck, Yuki-chan♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka said with an innocent smile, without a trace of worry.</p>



<p>&#8220;And if you lose, I&#8217;ll make sure you pay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri-san&#8217;s sharp eyes gleam fiercely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Woof, woof.&#8221;</p>



<p>Like a lonely dog left at home by its owner, a voice filled with loneliness emerges.</p>



<p>Upon careful consideration, I realize that regardless of the outcome, it would be the same for me.</p>



<p>Wait a minute? That&#8217;s when a brilliant idea flashes through my mind. It&#8217;s precisely the kind of move that a strategist would come up with!</p>



<p>This is strip Mahjong. Then, while avoiding Ron, I should cut down my opponent&#8217;s score, aim for Yaku-Man or Doubaman, and then at once tobash the score with a high-scoring Yaku to reduce it to a negative number.</p>



<p>&#8220;Foul and despicable scheme! Fear not, I will chip away at their scores. I will forcefully end the game and make you strip!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a draw, I&#8217;ll take responsibility and strip completely, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Grrr&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no blood or tears. In sports competitions, when Europe can&#8217;t win, they immediately revise the rules to favor themselves. But as someone without power, all I can do is submit.</p>



<p>I analyze the current situation. The East fourth round is over, and only the South round remains. If what was said is true, avoiding even a single discard from the scantily clad Sekka might prevent a major catastrophe.</p>



<p>My victory condition is not based on points. It&#8217;s whether I can hide my waiting hand and avoid opponents&#8217; discards while winning by Tsumo. At worst, a draw would be acceptable.</p>



<p>Suddenly, strong winds start to rage outside. Raindrops carried by the wind strike against the window.</p>



<p>A flash of blue and white light. It seems lightning struck nearby, slicing through the clouds, followed by the roar of thunder.</p>



<p>A momentary power outage. It quickly recovers, and the lights come back on. However, in that instant, I saw it.</p>



<p>Three figures with devilish smiles, resembling a crescent moon!</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;Keep going&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri&#8217;s words were fatal as they escaped her lips. Guh-guh-guh&#8230; I can&#8217;t refuse.</p>



<p>Now, at this point, the greatest crisis of my life has befallen me, where I can&#8217;t defy my family.</p>



<p>I rack my brain for a solution with all my might, using my head more than any test.</p>



<p>Dangerous, how can I escape from this predicament? Tell me, Zero!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ron, ah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaay! Finally, it&#8217;s my turn.&#8221;</p>




<p>Carelessly winning, Sekka eagerly adjusts her Chinese dress.</p>



<p>&#8220;H-Hey. Since you&#8217;ve changed clothes, let me enjoy it more, okay? Sekka looks so lovely in her Chinese dress, I want to keep looking at her forever. That&#8217;s why you know, you know, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Yuki-chan, do you like it that much? I&#8217;ll let you enjoy it as much as you want later.&#8221;</p>



<p>Desperately pleading, but for some reason, at times like this, they never listen.</p>



<p>&#8220;All of you! Fine, if it comes to this, I&#8217;ll strip every last hair from your butts and leave you all bare! Are you prepared?! Please, don&#8217;t say okay! I beg you, please!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s nothing more than the barking of a defeated dog, but I&#8217;ll at least strike a fighting pose.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing to be seen by you in such a state.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I take care of myself unlike your mother, so I&#8217;m not embarrassed at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How rude. I take care of myself properly too. I&#8217;m really looking forward to being stripped down. Please be gentle.&#8221;</p>

    


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll strip you bare as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan stripping my body――Yan♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take this family anymore.&#8221;</p>






<p>And so, the nightmare continues.</p>



<p>The Absolute Rule of Winning by Tsumo and Forbidden Ron Mahjong&#8221; has only just begun.</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&#8220;SNS&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I was invited by a friend from college, but I&#8217;m not familiar with it at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>I casually enjoyed a cup of tea with Sanjoji-sensei in the student guidance room. I was excited to see what kind of guidance it would be today, but surprisingly, Sanjoji-sensei came to me with a personal dilemma.</p>



<p>As a fellow tea-drinking companion, I wanted to be of help.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although I am in a position to instruct students on how to use social media, I have been hesitant because I haven&#8217;t had much experience with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;However, there have been an increasing number of troubles related to social media, particularly concerning you. It&#8217;s not good to remain ignorant and clueless about it forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei is truly dedicated to education and a wonderful teacher. However, there is a generation gap when it comes to social media. I highly doubt that the social media platform Sanjoji-sensei was invited to by a friend is targeted towards teenagers. Nevertheless, it might be interesting to explore various social media platforms together and gradually learn how to use them.</p>




<p>&#8220;In that case, let&#8217;s start together! I&#8217;m also a beginner, so we can learn how to use it step by step. Well, I don&#8217;t think anyone will follow me, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anyone else with as wide of a circle of friends as you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Leaving behind an unsatisfied feeling, as if being toyed with by a fox, I left the student guidance room and returned to the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, you are making an account? Then, I&#8217;ll make one too! Yay! Now we&#8217;re mutual followers. Hehe. I&#8217;ll have to tell Hiori later.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hiori-chan is a true angel. Let&#8217;s give her some candy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll create mine right away, so wait for me, Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been neglecting it for a while, but if Yukito starts, I&#8217;ll resume using it too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seriously, Kokonoe-chan? </p>




<p>&#8220;This is big news, big news!&#8221;</p>



<p>When I mentioned that I would create a social media account, all my classmates followed me. It was only natural to follow each other. Some even went as far as creating an account just to follow me. Everyone in this class is so kind&#8230; <em>sniffle</em></p>



<p>By the way, I was surprised to find out that Shakado had the highest number of followers in the class. It turns out she has a large group of insect friends. The princess of the Reptiles Circle was among them.</p>



<p>Having a distinct hobby might make it easier to connect with others, I guess.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll use it that frequently anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? But why is your opening greeting &#8216;This is me, Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;? It&#8217;s too self-assertive. Which one is that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just something I thought sounded cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cool&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>At that time, I misunderstood it as a trivial matter. However, unbeknownst to me, the situation was about to escalate in an unexpected direction.</p>




<p>Meanwhile, in the other classes</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you heard about it, Yuri?　I heard that your little brother made an SNS account&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?　What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been talked about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..It&#8217;s true. What&#8217;s going on all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I followed him too, but his followers are growing so fast, it&#8217;s scary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let this happen. I have to tell my mom about it right away.……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it really that important?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s important.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;What? Yukito Kokonoe started using SNS?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I heard it earlier, so it&#8217;s definitely true. And look, so many classmates are following him&#8230; wait, what&#8217;s happening with the number of followers!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t leave it like this, Yumi. Let&#8217;s create our accounts right away!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even the lonely goddess&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh, Yukito-kun?!&#8221;</p>



<p>And a certain lovey-dovey couple&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito Kokonoe, huh? Should I inform our club members? By the way, how do you even use it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Toshiro, you should show some interest too&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Even the friendly neighbor&#8230;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun using SNS? Ara, and mutuals with Suzuka Sanjoji? Quite clever.&#8221;</p>



<p>And someone who appears to be a repentant prefectural assembly member&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Father, it seems Kokonoe-san has started using SNS!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-sensei? Erika, we can&#8217;t leave it like this. Let&#8217;s send him flowers right away!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be a nuisance&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Even in university&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Yukito-kun! Is this related to my dad&#8217;s company&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seems like something big is happening, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>???</p>


<p>&#8220;Honho, my honorable Nii-sama is a wonderful person. Gikyou, let&#8217;s meet again. But for now, I will endure just being able to catch a glimpse of my honorable Nii-sama&#8217;s figure.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Kansai,</p>



<p>&#8220;Kaha! Funny. He&#8217;s so funny!　Kazuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Calm down, Casesuke. Is this the rumored Bunnyman? He might be a formidable opponent.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Hokuriku,</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi oi, really? Sending seafood too? Would that be a nuisance?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s not do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the land of the north,</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuku. Is that so? I finally found you!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even on the outskirts of the south,</p>



<p>&#8220;The mainland is a long way away.&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning. What&#8217;s the matter? Why are you so flustered?&#8221;</p>



<p>The next day, as soon as I arrived at school, I was caught by Sanjoji-sensei and taken away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you checked your account?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, we made it together yesterday, but is there something wrong with it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Check it out!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was nothing in particular to post, no typical exaggerated stories or fictional friends that usually appear on social media, and I had no interest in impressions.</p>



<p>Although I created the account, I left it as it was&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;What on earth is thisssssss?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The number of followers exceeded four thousand. And it was still increasing in real-time.</p>



<p>&#8220;What the hell is going on hereeeee? What did you do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t done anything in particular&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I checked the replies that were coming in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, please take care of me from now on!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; isn&#8217;t this Representative Tojo?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;So this is what they call a bullsh*t comment.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was an authenticated account with a blue badge. Given that Papa Tojo, with his long history as a representative, was sending polite greeting replies, he might be an important person, and other representatives had started following him as well. It was a confusing situation.</p>



<p>After all, my account was being followed by Himiyama Office, which has hundreds of thousands of followers! Why?! (perplexed)</p>



<p>Tristy-san was posting a selfie. As expected, I was being easily identified.</p>



<p>There were also numerous romantic consultations like, &#8220;I have a crush on a senior in my third year, and I want to consult with Bunnyman.&#8221; Somehow, it had been revealed that I was Bunnyman.</p>



<p>Dizziness struck me. What was happening behind my back?</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the account for the company where my mother works.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected, or rather, how should I put it&#8230; What&#8217;s happening to your circle of friends?&#8221;</p>



<p>While this was going on, the number of followers was approaching five thousand, and a chaotic mix of followers, including authenticated accounts with official marks, had formed. </p>


<p>It was hard to believe that this was the account of a single high school student.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;ve received some explicit DMs!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall for it, Kokonoe-kun! Those are scams. It&#8217;s not even safe to look at them. Let me borrow it, I&#8217;ll delete them&#8230; Wait, it&#8217;s from Misaki-san!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>So the sender of the DM was Himiyama-san. I&#8217;ll save that.</p>



<p>&#8220;But anyway, comparing to you, I feel a bit insecure. It&#8217;s not just about the numbers, and it&#8217;s not the kind of account to be publicized, but after all, I&#8217;m just an ordinary teacher.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please cheer up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei seemed a bit down. I have to find a way to cheer her up&#8230; Oh, I know!</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, may I do something?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do this. [This is Sanjoji, my skirt shortens by one millimeter for every like].&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, what are you posting?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Like and share.</p>



<p>And in no time, it started growing rapidly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! What should I do with this? Three hundred likes in such a short time?! Does that mean thirty centimeters? It&#8217;s still increasing, but it&#8217;s impossible! I can&#8217;t make it any shorter! I&#8217;ve never worn anything like this even in my twenties!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that the principal&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to file a complaint immediately!&#8221;</p>



<p>The sudden surge of followers for Sanjoji-sensei, but she deleted the post, and in the end, it became a private account with only acquaintances as mutual followers.</p>


<p>We learned the dangers of social media and thus grew one step closer to adulthood.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, let&#8217;s go with forty-eight centimeters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, do not share this, absolutely not. I mean it!&#8221;</p>



<p>(She is really a good person&#8230;)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a secret that later on, I received an image of Sanjoji-sensei with her skirt barely above her knees.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>Though there are various cultural differences, I, Yukito kokonoe, do not deny them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s what we call &#8220;deculture,&#8221; and whether or not this term is understood depends on cultural differences. Diversity is not something to impose on others but something to accept ourselves.</p>



<p>According to my mom, it&#8217;s perfectly normal for parents and children to bathe together. This, too, is a cultural difference.</p>



<p>I never&#8230; even slightly&#8230; doubt it. Diversity, it&#8217;s all about diversity!</p>


<p>What&#8217;s wrong with being a Galapagos? It tends to be used with a negative connotation, but unique evolution is diversity in itself.</p>



<p>If the world were to become uniform, it would quickly meet its demise.</p>



<p>Japan is an island country. It has many advantages, but sometimes it&#8217;s a good experience to go overseas and broaden your horizons. Your values are likely to change significantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Yukito-kun, you&#8217;re here! Come over here! I was just washing Papa&#8217;s car.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it actually exists, a bikini car wash!&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san, wearing a bikini with a hoodie over it, welcomes me with a sponge in her hand.</p>



<p>A bikini car wash is a peculiar culture of overseas partygoers where they wash cars in bikinis to prevent their clothes from getting wet. It&#8217;s often seen in B-horror movies.</p>



<p>Of course, since it&#8217;s a B-horror movie, all the partygoers get killed. But don&#8217;t worry. This is Japan. Tristy-san&#8217;s safety is ensured. Let&#8217;s spare the splatter, shall we?</p>



<p>Tristy-san&#8217;s house is a mansion. It seems she&#8217;s an ojou-sama.</p>


<p>Mio-san and I were invited by Tristy-san to a home party.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re planning to have a BBQ in the garden. It&#8217;s a small delight to experience cultural differences. I&#8217;ve only seen Americanized home parties in movies.</p>



<p>In the Kokonoe household, we once had a pajama party, but I was the only one wearing pajamas. That&#8217;s a serious violation of the rules. I mindlessly kept drinking champagne.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting for you. Come this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san&#8217;s mom greets us with a calm smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting for you, cool guy! Have a great time today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for inviting me. I bought a cake as a souvenir.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; cool guy! You don&#8217;t have to worry, but thanks anyway. Now, let&#8217;s start the BBQ!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m caught by a Texan hat-wearing, broad-shouldered, golden-haired daddy, and he pulls me along forcefully.</p>

<p>Everyone can tell at first glance that he&#8217;s an American dad, with a appearance that screams it. Without any objections, that&#8217;s exactly what he is. He looks like he could be in a Western movie, the kind of American dad that anyone would recognize at a glance.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a cheerful old man, but when he came to apologize to our house after Tristy-san&#8217;s bicycle accident, both she and Tristy-san&#8217;s parents had such pale faces, as if we were about to say, &#8220;Prepare for seppuku!&#8221;</p>



<p>If the settlement hadn&#8217;t been reached, it would have left a big scar on Tristy-san&#8217;s record. It must have been a solemn determination. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries, and I didn&#8217;t take legal action.</p>



<p>Tristy-san and her family repeated their apologies in tears, and afterwards, we became friends with a twist of fate. As a result, I&#8217;m invited to this home party. Life is unpredictable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa, nice to meet you for the first time. Sorry for the trouble my sister caused.&#8221;</p>



<p>An insanely handsome guy, whose facial attractiveness cannot be measured, approaches me and starts talking. He&#8217;s the enemy. I become needlessly rebellious.</p>



<p>&#8220;How are you going to settle this? Aah?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh!? Is this the unique Japanese way of settling things&#8230;? Well, how about I give you my sister then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leon! What are you saying!&#8221;</p>


<p>Tristy-san is indignant at the sudden suggestion of human trafficking. I feel a cultural difference between overseas and Japan. It&#8217;s quite disturbing.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Yukito-kun&#8230; if I remember correctly? Can I talk to you for a moment?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m called by Leon-san and we move to a corner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to say that I&#8217;m grateful. I heard you were feeling down after the accident, just like Tristy. I told her not to worry, that it will be fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t injured, so there&#8217;s no need to worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I still want to apologize again. I&#8217;m really sorry. Thank you for forgiving my sister. I hope you can continue to get along with her. &#8212;I-I&#8217;d also like to talk to you about something else…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Leon-san suddenly becomes hesitant and keeps glancing at Mio-san.</p>



<p>This super handsome guy unexpectedly seems to have a shy side.</p>


<p>&#8220;Can someone tell me who that beautiful and delicate woman with you is?&#8221;</p>



<p>Could it be that he&#8217;s fallen for Mio-san at first sight? Is this really happening?</p>



<p>Ugh, this is what they say about handsome guys!</p>



<p>Once again, I feel the difference in cultures.</p>



<p>The authentic BBQ was amazing. First of all, the meat was different. Instead of cutting the meat into bite-sized pieces like in Korean BBQ, they grilled it vigorously without caring about that. They cut thick steaks dripping with juices and put them in their mouths. The sausages were also unusually big. Cultural differences always feel refreshing.</p>



<p>As we talked about various things, I learned that Tristy&#8217;s dad is an executive at a certain Japanese branch of a major social media company. The previous management team, who had been running the huge social media platform at a loss, was completely replaced through an acquisition. The majority of employees in the Japanese branch were also laid off, and Tristy&#8217;s dad, who had been hoping to transfer to Japan, was dispatched from the headquarters to rebuild the company.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Dad! Yukito-kun also made an account!&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy shows her dad my account, and he opens his eyes wide.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cool guy, are you an influencer!?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;I never intended to be&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, my account had surpassed ten thousand followers.</p>



<p>Not to mention, I started receiving offers for corporate PR campaigns. I&#8217;m just a high school student. It&#8217;s overwhelming.</p>



<p>Helpless and overwhelmed by the growing number of followers, I can only tremble in fear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Urban legends? Mysterious person? From teenagers to corporations and politicians&#8230; These are not bots, but real followers. HAHAHA! Interesting! Who are you? I will verify your account right away! I might even ask Crazy Guy for some work in the future!&#8221;</p>



<p>American Dad was in a good mood and called someplace on his phone, and a few minutes later, my account was verified and my blue badge was shining. It&#8217;s too fast. It&#8217;s a cultural difference.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t bother Yukito-kun! I&#8217;m sorry, it seems like this person is getting carried away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! Crazy Guy is a talent worth grabbing! We must secure him now and&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, alright. Let&#8217;s save the work talk for another time, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether it was due to the alcohol or other reasons, the boisterous American dad who was pestering me was taken away by his reserved wife, who gently pushed him along. It seems that having a strong wife is a universally shared cultural trait.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry for the trouble caused by my dad! Right! Let&#8217;s take a selfie together!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The cause of the explosive increase in followers is right here?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy and I posted a selfie with a heart sign. It immediately sparked controversy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Yukito-kun. Why is this company&#8217;s account following you, Yukito-kun? Is there some connection between the two of you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, this company? My mom works there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mio scrolled through her phone screen and pointed to a company that looked familiar.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way! That company is my dream! It&#8217;s my top choice, and I&#8217;m actually going there for an internship soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? They&#8217;re always complaining about being short-staffed, so if you&#8217;d like, I can pass on the message.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230; is it really okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Not just for Mio, but if I could help my mom too, there was no reason to refuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Modesty is not always a virtue. Listen, young lady. Besides academic achievement, having connections is also a form of power. Do you understand what it takes to succeed? It&#8217;s luck. It&#8217;s about seizing the opportunity at the right moment. Meeting Crazy Guy was also your luck. So don&#8217;t let chances slip away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting involved again so quickly. Honestly. It seems like he&#8217;s taken a liking to Yukito-kun. Look, he&#8217;s strutting around energetically. You should drink some water and sober up a bit, or he might dislike you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That would be terrible!&#8221;</p>



<p>The American dad was once again taken away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, can I ask you a favor?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Mio-san helped me before.”</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a conscientious person. It was just a minor incident, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let that happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mio-san didn&#8217;t just save me. President Kedou and Mikumo-Senpai were also saved.</p>



<p>If the commotion had continued to escalate, they wouldn&#8217;t have been safe either. The relationship between the president and me would have become irreparable and strained.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Tristy-san, have you decided on your job after graduation?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Job&#8230; Well, to be honest, I still can&#8217;t imagine it at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san looked downcast and muttered quietly. Her expression was gloomy.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we were kids, we were always asked about our dream occupation, right? I always struggled with that. I never really had anything I wanted to do. Papa says I should take my time, but while everyone else is preparing and working towards their goals, I feel like I&#8217;m being left behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anxiety about the future, self-questioning, and a lost sense of purpose.</p>



<p>Entering society means embarking on a journey without a clear path.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but admire Tristy-san. I thought she was an admirable person. Doubt could be her nourishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;As for me, I&#8217;ve never really thought about the future. I&#8217;ve been living in the present, just trying to get by. I didn&#8217;t have the luxury to ponder about the future. I even thought I&#8217;d just live a mediocre life and die without achieving anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>A worried expression. Tristy-san&#8217;s future should be bright. She&#8217;s so serious about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to wander. It&#8217;s okay to take detours. Even when you&#8217;re fifty or sixty years old, it&#8217;s not too late to find something you want to do. Life is long. I don&#8217;t think the only correct answer is to reach your goals in the shortest distance possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>I remember my family, childhood friends, and classmates. I took many detours, made many side trips, and once gave up, but still, little by little, I started to understand them and come closer.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as a wasted experience. Not even Tristy-san&#8217;s worries or the time we spend like this.</p>



<p>No one knows the future. How many people graduate from university, find a job, and continue in the same company, doing the same work until retirement? It&#8217;s just a matter of convenience.</p>



<p>We are living in the present, not in a potential future.</p>


<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why&#8230; let&#8217;s enjoy it, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, you&#8217;re like a calming pill or something. Talking to you makes me feel at ease, and you&#8217;re a good listener. I can imagine people coming to you with various problems.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just a hunch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mio-san displayed her exceptional deductive reasoning skills, the American father returned and tried to get Tristy-san to join his company&#8217;s PR department, Leon-san was lightly dealt with, and the lively and fun home party continued until nightfall.</p>



<p>&#8230;I ate too much. I&#8217;ll refrain from meat for a while.</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>The venue was filled with blessings. I joined in, applauding from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>Though invisible, happiness was there, taking shape and existing.</p>



<p>The trust connecting the bride and groom, the feelings they had cherished all along, now seemed tangible.</p>



<p>The bride was in tears. The groom&#8217;s older brother standing beside her had red eyes too.</p>



<p>There were people in the family seats crying. Even my mother wiped away tears.</p>




<p>A mix of emotions. Joy that could be felt. It was beautiful. A beauty overflowing from within.</p>



<p>That was an idea. That&#8217;s why I wanted to offer my congratulations. It was truly a recollection.</p>



<p>Together with my mother, we bid farewell to the couple on their new journey. All that remained was to go home.</p>



<p>My mother and I had attended the wedding. Initially, I was seated with Himiyama-san&#8217;s relatives, but I couldn&#8217;t bear the excessive attention and turned to my mother for help.</p>



<p>Seriously, something was off. I ended up being greeted by Himiyama-san&#8217;s parents, grandparents, and even the groom&#8217;s brother. &#8220;I will leave Misaki to you.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t handle it even if they asked.</p>



<p>To top it off, we were formally invited to the Himiyama-san&#8217;s main family. Even the Himiyama-san&#8217;s house felt daunting, so what did the main family mean? It made me feel like I was being cornered.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I received greetings and about thirty business cards from unfamiliar people. &#8220;One of Rishu-sensei&#8217;s prized son,&#8221; &#8220;Successor,&#8221; &#8220;Looks like a high school student, but eventually…&#8221; I was scared by the snippets of conversation I overheard.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my mother was with me at the same venue, so my anxiety was somewhat alleviated, but the food was delicious.</p>



<p>As it turned out, all the dishes at the venue were supervised by the master chef. No wonder he has been so busy lately.</p>


<p>Leaving the venue, immersed in the afterglow. From now on, it would be the time for the bride and groom, and the time with their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the happiest moment of Megumi&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a thoughtful expression, my mother murmured such words.</p>



<p>&#8220;…That somehow feels unfortunate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If the wedding is the happiest moment, then it feels like everything from now on will be downhill.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Megumi has gone through hardships, I think she understands the value of happiness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope she accumulates happiness and becomes much happier in the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…You&#8217;re a kind child.&#8221;</p>


<p>My head was caressed. My mother had started doing these mom moves without me realizing.</p>



<p>Her maternal instincts, which had been somewhat out of control, were gradually calming down. That&#8217;s good, that&#8217;s good.</p>



<p>The couple looked happy. The fruition of &#8220;affection.&#8221; Something I had lost.</p>



<p>Strangers harboring affection for each other, falling in love, getting married, and becoming a family.</p>



<p>It taught me that it is such a blissful thing.</p>



<p>Will there come a day when I, too, will be blessed like that? Will it allow me to seek happiness? Whenever I look back, my expression is always filled with tears. I have always made everyone, including my mother, my sister, Sekka-san, Himiyama-san, Hinagi, Shiori, the president, and many others, sad.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just happiness, but I have scattered countless misfortunes in the past. Despite being such a person&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you like to wear a wedding dress, Mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me?&#8230; I think I am fine. I&#8217;ve already experienced failure once.&#8221;</p>


<p>She laughs with a self-deprecating tone. But there&#8217;s a hint of envy in my mother&#8217;s gaze, and she said it herself. It&#8217;s the happiest moment. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s okay to have such a moment once again.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve made up my mind. I may be the lowest, most wretched person who only spreads unhappiness, but at least I&#8217;ll strive to bring happiness to those around me. To always have a smile, to avoid causing any more sadness. In return for taking away happiness, for causing unhappiness, I hope that this time, I will be given happiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;You might succeed this time, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Being with you right now is the happiest thing. I can&#8217;t even think of remarriage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lately, my mother has been into cosplay. The other day, she dressed up as a white angel, wearing a nurse uniform.</p>



<p>She was excited about taking care of me, but I have no symptoms. When I told her that, she responded with, &#8220;Then it&#8217;s mental care,&#8221; and strangely enough, my mental state was gradually reduced by ten percent each time.</p>



<p>What exactly is mental care? The laws of the universe are in disarray.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way my mother, who is like that, wouldn&#8217;t want to wear a wedding dress.</p>



<p>Ah, I see. She&#8217;s holding back, isn&#8217;t she?</p>



<p>Come to think of it, it would be difficult to consult with a wedding planner about renting a wedding dress for the sake of her cosplay hobby. Even trying on dresses would require going to a shop, and it would be quite troublesome. It&#8217;s not something that can be done so casually.</p>



<p>Wait a minute? Lately, I&#8217;ve been honing my sewing skills. If that&#8217;s the case, I can just make a wedding dress myself, right? Yeah, that&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s not that difficult! But then, I pause.</p>



<p>Is that all there is to it? Is it enough to just wear a wedding dress?</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tolerate such half measures. If I&#8217;m going to do it, I&#8217;ll do it thoroughly. The word &#8220;compromise&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist in my dictionary. Hairstyling, makeup, jewelry, they&#8217;re all essential. There&#8217;s so much a bride has to do.</p>



<p>I am a devoted filial child, Yukito Kokonoe. Bringing happiness to my family is my mission.</p>



<p>By the way, I have an expensive DSLR camera that I hardly use, so I can also take photographs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll make mom wear a wedding dress.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Dufufufu. Just wait, Mom! I&#8217;ll make you a perfect bride!</p>


<p>I will create New Year&#8217;s greeting cards with bridal photos and spread happiness in all directions.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a new challenge that excites my skills. Arm: &#8220;Gyiiiiiiiiiiin&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen you in a wedding dress, Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8230; You&#8217;ll make me a bride?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leave it to me!&#8221;</p>



<p>I give a thumbs-up. Tears welled up in my mother&#8217;s round eyes and rolled down her cheeks.</p>



<p>Eeh!? I made Mom cry again. It has become a specialty of the Kokonoe family.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah&#8230; Why&#8230; How can I&#8230; Yukito&#8230; Uuuuu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Are you okay!?&#8221;</p>


<p>In a fluster, I hurriedly stroked her back.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible&#8230; anymore. So, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother raised her face and hugged me.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I promise to love you, risking my entire life.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s becoming a familiar development, but once again your face is close&#8230; Mmm&#8230; Mmm&#8230; Mmm!?&#8221;</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Mother PoV]</h4>



<p>My heart raced uncontrollably, pounding like a fast-beating bell. I couldn&#8217;t suppress it, no matter how hard I tried.</p>



<p>It felt like I had gone back in time, reliving the excitement of adolescence, experiencing that fluttering sensation once again.</p>



<p>I pretended not to notice. There was no need to. After all, family and love are the culmination of each other. Love is something that cannot be reversed, like turning back the hands of a clock.</p>

<p>Yet, my son walking beside me, his words spoken while walking beside me, remained etched in my mind and wouldn&#8217;t fade away.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m happy&#8230; I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;m happy!)</p>



<p>Unspoken words. My son, who believes in taking action, always follows through on what he says.</p>



<p>If he said he would dress me in a wedding dress, then I would wear one again. I know that, and yet, I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>



<p>At that moment, standing beside me is Yukito. I inadvertently see his figure as a vision.</p>



<p>Is such happiness allowed? Is such happiness permissible?</p>



<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be allowed, it shouldn&#8217;t be forgiven. Calm down, Ouka.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a line that must never be crossed. Judging from my son&#8217;s demeanor, there should be no ulterior motive.</p>



<p>Kind-hearted Yukito must have made the suggestion because he thought it would bring me joy.</p>


<p>Did I look so envious? Maybe that&#8217;s how I appeared to my son, who is perceptive.</p>



<p>But those words were enough to remind me of the long-discarded feelings of love.</p>



<p>What should I do? I can&#8217;t look my son in the face, I&#8217;m too embarrassed!</p>



<p>Since that day, the world has changed. It might be b****t cancer. When confronted with that possibility, I realized the finite nature of time.</p>



<p>Fear rushed in as I calculated the remaining time. Confronting my own death.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t cherish my son enough. I couldn&#8217;t love him enough. Now, I regret it, only now, when it&#8217;s too late. It&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s too late to reclaim what&#8217;s lost.</p>



<p>Feeling overwhelmed by despair, unable to bear it any longer.</p>



<p>And yet, the one who saved me from the abyss of despair was my son, whom I failed to love enough.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible. I can&#8217;t endure it. I may have taken somewhat forceful measures to improve our relationship, to change the current situation, but even so, without denying it, Yukito&#8217;s kindness enveloped me.</p>

<p>Because he is my son. There is no way I could ever dislike him. And there was never even a hint of rebelliousness.</p>



<p>That worries me in its own way, but I fall in love with him more and more every single day. Today more than yesterday, tomorrow more than today.</p>



<p>What will become of me if things continue like this? Honestly, I&#8217;m terrified.</p>



<p>But even that fear was blown away by the words spoken just now.</p>



<p>He said it&#8217;s okay for me to love him more, to love him freely, and that he will dress me in a wedding dress. I was happy, truly happy from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>Regardless of the intention behind those words, I am already falling for this child.</p>



<p>If there is one concern, it would be…</p>



<p>&#8220;Lately, something seems off about Nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You noticed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah. If mom sleeps in my room seven nights a week, I&#8217;d notice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right. I&#8217;m sorry. You must have disliked it, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I might have acted too childishly, without showing maturity. I need to reflect on this…</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that big of a deal. It used to be about equal between Nee-san and mom before, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>He forgave me. My son, I love you… You&#8217;re so adorable, I could just eat you up.</p>



<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t been coming to my room much lately, hmmm…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito looked troubled with a difficult expression. I know the reason behind it. The career path that Yuri consulted me about.</p>



<p>Studying abroad. If that doesn&#8217;t work out, Yuri hopes to attend a university far away.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an unbearable choice for Yuri. That child is still trapped by guilt.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please. I know I shouldn&#8217;t tell you this kind of thing. But I&#8217;m powerless and can&#8217;t help Yuri. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking you to save her. Your words are the only ones that can reach Yuri. Only you can help her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as I was saved, only Yukito can save Yuri.</p>



<p>Certainly, she committed a crime. She has been forgiven for over ten years. It continued to torment Yuri, as if she were serving a prison sentence. Yet, that child still believes she is lacking, punishing herself. Forever and ever. An endless cycle of atonement and guilt.</p>



<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please protect your sister.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Can I do that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s… okay. You are stronger than anyone else.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the parent&#8217;s role to save their child, yet I&#8217;m entrusting it to my son. I&#8217;m a failure as a mother. I shake my head in my heart. I&#8217;ve long since failed. As someone who is starting over from the position of a fallen mother, I have no right to claim such qualifications.</p>



<p>But I understand. I am Yuri&#8217;s mother. I know what that child needs right now. I have no worries. Yukito will surely make us happy.</p>
