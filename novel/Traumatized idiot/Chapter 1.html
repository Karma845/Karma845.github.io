<h2>Chapter 1: A Moving Monster</h2>

<p>Behold the most popular guy on campus! It&#8217;s me, Yukito Kokonoe, the legendary heartthrob, or so they say. I can&#8217;t help but question it though, because I have no experience with such things. I&#8217;m used to being disliked, but being liked is a whole new experience for me.</p>



<p>Confused by these new developments, I have more than just that on my mind. After returning from my suspension, the atmosphere at school completely changed. It&#8217;s probably thanks to the efforts of Akari, Hinagi, Shiori, my sister, Goddess Senpai and the student council president. I&#8217;m grateful, but sometimes it feels like they&#8217;re going overboard.</p>



<p>As an acknowledged introverted loner, it&#8217;s absurd that I&#8217;ve become some kind of saint while still underage. Unbeknownst to me, the troubadour known as Sato and the scheme of Miyahara resulted in the serialization of the &#8220;Legend of Yukito Kokonoe, the Saint&#8221; in the school newspaper.</p>



<p>The first part was &#8216;Rebellion,&#8217; the second part was &#8216;Resurgence,&#8217; and currently, the third part, &#8216;Dawn,&#8217; is being published. I don&#8217;t really understand what they&#8217;re talking about. Apparently, it&#8217;s a popular article, but who knows? Anyway, I have to properly express my gratitude for being saved.</p>



<p>I gave my sister a wooden carving I made myself—a fierce-looking salmon held in her mouth—to intimidate others. The response was rather ambiguous, and she advised me to improve my sense of style.</p>



<p>Perhaps it is because she is a saint, but for some reason, I have been getting a lot of requests for advice from students, including senior students. Recently, even the teachers have been asking me for advice.</p>



<p>The other day, the math teacher asked me to predict the trifecta in a horse race. I reported it to the principal, but just for fun, I made the prediction and it turned out to be correct. Beginner&#8217;s luck, I guess.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s gathered.&#8221;</p>




<p>In the morning, the tired-looking Sayuri-sensei glanced around the classroom.</p>



<p>The oppressive heat unique to this time of year saps my motivation, but I feel a sense of duty and can&#8217;t help but speak up.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought a beautiful idol had entered the room, but it&#8217;s just Sensei. Good morning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have the intention to give you a score of 5 for no reason.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blatantly flatter her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan scolds me, but she doesn&#8217;t scold me when I flatter her. That&#8217;s not fair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Students like me, who can&#8217;t expect to get any marks on internal examinations, have to earn points like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You, stop dazzling me with just your face. I can&#8217;t stand having a student like you around.&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;They do exist, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Sighs mixed with murmurs can be heard from various directions. This is just&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;We have an important announcement today, so listen carefully.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, it seems there&#8217;s a message from Sayuri-sensei. It&#8217;s rare for her to share unnecessary information.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the frequent incidents of dojo invaders, which is quite an anachronism.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like something out of the Showa era.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi! Don&#8217;t make fun of the Showa era. And be careful not to say disrespectful things like &#8216;I&#8217;ve only seen it in textbooks&#8217; in front of Sanjoji-sensei, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking of Showa, it&#8217;s like a fantasy world for us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhyahyahya. But, dojo invaders&#8230; Fufu&#8230; in this era. Pupupu.&#8221;</p>



<p>The outdated term is so hilarious that it&#8217;s causing an uproar. I&#8217;m banging on the desk while laughing uncontrollably.</p>



<p>An artifact from a lost history. It&#8217;s hilarious that there are people doing such ridiculous things nowadays.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all laugh heartily! What&#8217;s with these dojo invaders! Get with the times!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-oi, Yukito. I have a bad feeling about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, Yuki. Laughing hysterically with a serious face is horrifying!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite absurd to have such an idiot around. I&#8217;d like to see their parents&#8217; faces.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hohou. The dojo invaders are causing havoc under the pretense of martial training, mainly targeting the basketball club within the school grounds.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I suddenly went silent. What&#8217;s happening? I can&#8217;t laugh all of a sudden.</p>




<p>&#8220;I agree that I&#8217;d like to see their parents&#8217; faces, but I just saw them during the open class the other day. I wonder who that person could be. Would you recognize them, Yukito Kokonoe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; um, I&#8217;m not sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>Cold sweat starts trickling down slowly. I glance at the person next to me, and the handsome guy next to me has the same reaction. Shiori turns her face away and gazes outside the window with an innocent expression. Ah, a sparrow!</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem unusually unsure. What&#8217;s wrong, huh? Come on, Yukito Kokonoe, laugh. Do you have any inkling? Based on eyewitness testimonies, we&#8217;ve also identified the characteristics of the group involved. They consist mainly of overly hot-headed person, exceptionally agile person, and unusually tall girl. In addition, there&#8217;s a particularly suspicious individual wearing a mask. What&#8217;s the matter? Do you recognize anyone? Hmm? What&#8217;s your answer, hey!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who on earth are they?!&#8221;</p>



<p>They clearly look like suspicious individuals. Too suspicious. We should call the police.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Yukito Kokonoe, what do you call a match where the winner unmasks their opponent?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate me, sensei. I know that. It&#8217;s called Mascara Contra if both wrestlers wear masks. If one is unmasked, it&#8217;s called Mascara Contra Cabellera, and the loser has to cut their hair. It&#8217;s a traditional showdown where their pride is at stake.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s common sense in Mexico!</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected, you&#8217;ve studied well. You&#8217;re quite knowledgeable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, stop praising me. It&#8217;s making me blush.</p>



<p>&#8220;The group behind these incidents is called &#8216;Snow Rabbits.'&#8221; [TL: 雪兎 is Yukito&#8217;s name but it means snow rabbit]</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re known as &#8216;Snorabi-chan&#8217; for short.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You! It&#8217;s you! What exactly are you plotting!? You&#8217;ve only been here for a few months. This isn&#8217;t anime or manga. Can&#8217;t you be a bit more obedient?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s also the possibility of it being a light novel.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Seriously, you always worry about me. Thanks to you, my position in the staff room keeps rising, which is&#8230; well, I&#8217;m grateful for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sayuri-sensei chuckles. As a respected teacher who manages not only the first-year class but also the most troublesome students in the school, Sayuri&#8217;-senseis teaching ability is highly regarded (according to the Student Council President).</p>




<p>You could say that she&#8217;s been burdened with all the troublesome matters. I&#8217;m sorry, sensei.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mihou and Kamishiro, even you guys are in tog&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8220;Ito as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah, the unnoticeable Ito seems down.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gohon. It&#8217;s an issue outside of school, so I won&#8217;t interfere with your private matters. But be careful not to escalate the situation any further. Got it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>An eerie silence fills the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making me nervous! Answer me!&#8221;</p>



<p>The fresh, handsome man opened his mouth as if troubled.</p>




<p>&#8220;Sensei, it&#8217;s probably impossible.&#8221;</p>



<p>We watched in a daze as Sayuri-sensei, a little teary-eyed, wobbled out of the classroom.</p>



<p>And now, the &#8220;Yukito Kokonoe Appreciation Arc&#8221; begins!</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Yuki, can I touch it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! So fluffy!&#8221;</p>



<p>Pat pat. Shiori relentlessly pets my head without mercy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I never expected my true identity to be exposed to Sayuri-sensei&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather, was there any element in which she wouldn&#8217;t find out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? My disguise is flawless.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too late to ask about your peculiar behavior? Why a mask?&#8221;</p>



<p>The fresh handsome guy asks a question that is really a new one.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just like it! I love Yuki with the bunny mask. It&#8217;s so fluffy and soft.&#8221;</p>



<p>Inspired by Frederick II, I wear a bunny mask, but of course, it&#8217;s not for fashion or being stylish. It&#8217;s purely out of necessity. I prioritize practicality.</p>



<p>&#8220;For some reason, I seem to attract trouble wherever I go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; that&#8217;s true. There&#8217;s no denying that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to live a quiet life without causing any commotion, but I&#8217;m constantly attracting attention at school. I&#8217;ve been a burden to Yuri-san as well, and that&#8217;s when I came up with an idea. How can I make myself less noticeable?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hou? For now, I&#8217;ll listen to the rest without saying anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The solution is quite simple. It&#8217;s the old saying &#8216;The brightest flame casts the darkest shadow.&#8217; In other words, if I wear a mask, no one will recognize me. I&#8217;ll be anonymous. I won&#8217;t cause trouble, and I won&#8217;t stand out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re saying is correct, but what you&#8217;re doing is completely wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The mask was meant to make you less noticeable? Yuki, you&#8217;re incredibly conspicuous!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori, who was petting me, freezes in shock.</p>



<p>Even though I said it was inspired by Frederick II, I want her to be reassured that I didn&#8217;t use real animal skin or anything like that. It&#8217;s made of safe and reliable synthetic leather. I spent nights sewing it with a sewing machine, and it&#8217;s my masterpiece.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve found my stride like this. There&#8217;s not much time left until the tournament. We can&#8217;t afford to miss valuable opportunities for practical combat just because the school found out!&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, our passionate and hot-blooded senpai is fired up. As our passionate senpai says, the third-year students who will graduate this year don&#8217;t have much time. Even if we plan practice matches with other schools, it&#8217;s not something we can do frequently. That&#8217;s why I thought of ways to train outside of club activities in our private time.</p>



<p>&#8220;If we go too far and cause a commotion, it will be disastrous. So, let&#8217;s moderate our actions, Toshirou.&#8221;</p>




<p>Today, both our passionate senpai and Takamiya senpai, who has feelings for him, are here. It&#8217;s clear to anyone that they have a trusting relationship between them.</p>



<p>Confessing would probably lead to an immediate realization, but as an outsider, it&#8217;s rather awkward.</p>



<p>On the weekend, we gathered at the outdoor court. It&#8217;s not mandatory, but the basketball club members without any prior engagements faithfully participate every week. It&#8217;s good that they&#8217;re enthusiastic.</p>



<p>Although Sayuri-sensei called it &#8220;dojo intrusion,&#8221; it&#8217;s certainly not a savage imitation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strictly a straightforward approach. I&#8217;m simply using the charming and handsome man&#8217;s help to write a polite letter, inviting them to play basketball together.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting, Kouki. And today, I&#8217;ll expose your true identity!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You cheeky rabbit. I&#8217;ll defeat you again!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, you know this guy&#8217;s true identity, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gai was complaining about why you didn&#8217;t come to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Has my senpai become more mature? It feels like going back in time, and I&#8217;m happy about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The refreshing handsome man is talking to the towering man in front of him. Kouki Mihou, whom we usually don&#8217;t see at school, is there. The giant named Daigo is apparently his senior from middle school. They had a lot of interactions in the basketball club back then. He&#8217;s a good person who continues to join us for the second week. Kouki has many acquaintances, but I can tell that they&#8217;re comfortable around each other. I know a lot of fresh, good-looking guys, but I can tell that he is one of those guys that I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with.</p>



<p>&#8220;Last time, I couldn&#8217;t steal the ball from you! I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this revenge!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you! Ussassassassa!&#8221;</p>



<p>By the way, the main opponents are the passionate senpais who lack practical experience, so I mostly watch. However, there&#8217;s a mysterious rule that if I lose in a one-on-one match, for some reason, my mask gets removed. Why only me&#8230;? It&#8217;s unjust, unfair&#8230;.</p>



<p>I suddenly ponder. People have different faces, and in relationships with others, we construct various versions of ourselves. That means that others are the ones who bring about change within ourselves. Perhaps change can only occur through interactions with others. No, it should be said that there must be a motive to change.</p>



<p>If I were to remain a loner, I wouldn&#8217;t have needed to change. If no one was around me, if I was always alone, I could have stayed the same. Not changing would have been acceptable. But now&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, Yuki, you&#8217;re really amazing. Only you can do something like this&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori says, smiling without a care in the world. I&#8217;ve been clouding that smile.</p>




<p>&#8220;Just saying thank you isn&#8217;t enough. Every day is so, so enjoyable. I&#8217;m sure everyone else feels the same way. Mihou-kun, the senpais too. That&#8217;s why there are always so many people around Yuki. Because it&#8217;s surely fun&#8212; that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I couldn&#8217;t be alone. I won&#8217;t say that this is not stressful. Even this morning, when I woke up in the morning, my mother was sleeping next to me. This is already the seventh time this month.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve become friends with Hinagi Suzurikawa. My rival in love. But you know, I wish that days like this, days when we can laugh at each other like this, could go on forever and ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori has changed. So has Hinagi. She chose to change and stepped forward. She is no longer weak like before. There are no more shadows. Maybe I am the only one who thinks they are the same as they used to be. I have not been able to keep up with the speed of change. I have been left behind by their growth. Let&#8217;s catch up with them. No matter how slowly, one step at a time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahaha. It&#8217;s fun!</p>



<p>Why is she getting taller again? She had grown up. Not only in height, but also in mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aim for 180 cm, Usa!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing I don&#8217;t want to do!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, doesn&#8217;t it seem like there are a lot more participants?&#8221;</p>




<p>The court of Stubas is filled with several teams in addition to the senior players we invited, such as Daigo and the other members of the powerful Tei-Wang High School basketball team. Some of the basketball teams we have invited, others we don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Although the number of participants had been gradually increasing, it had unexpectedly become a huge success.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, long time no see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who are you, Usa?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned around as someone called me from behind, and there was my university senior, Hiyakuma.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Usa. Did Hiyakuma senpai come to practice too, Usa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuku&#8230; I see, so that&#8217;s why there are so many people here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori, who knows Hiyakuma senpai from Stubas, asked.</p>




<p>According to Hiyakuma-senpai, there&#8217;s been a peculiar buzz in town about a mysterious figure wearing a skillful rabbit mask, known as the enigmatic Bunny Man, who disrupts basketball courts. There are rumors that some basketball teams are waiting for challenges from the Bunny Man. The situation had become more serious than what Sayuri-sensei warned about.</p>



<p>It seems that one enticing factor is that the Bunny Man&#8217;s true identity will be revealed upon winning.</p>



<p>As a result, the outdoor court was bustling with spectators who gathered to catch a glimpse of the Bunny Man, as well as basketball teams and street basketball enthusiasts who came to challenge him. It created an unprecedented lively atmosphere.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great for us that Stobas is gaining popularity. We don&#8217;t have to worry about finding opponents. There are even strong high school teams participating, so it&#8217;s unexpected that it would generate excitement in this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I&#8217;ve been hearing voices here and there saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s the Bunny Man!&#8221; and &#8220;Wow, he really exists!&#8221; People are asking to take photos together and various other things. Photo shoot, OK!</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, whether you wear the mask or not&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it. Don&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, you really stood out! Oh, my ears twitched.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend for it to turn out like this, Usa&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The monster &#8220;Invitation from the Bunnyman&#8221; soon became the status quo of the basketball team.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, the Bunnyman meme contamination was quietly spreading throughout the country.</p>



<p>This was the beginning of what would later become the &#8220;Third Basketball Boom&#8221;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Shiori PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;Expressing gratitude&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For all the help you&#8217;ve given me as well.&#8221; (Yuki)</p>



<p>The classroom buzzes with excitement upon hearing those words. Naturally, I&#8217;m included.</p>



<p>Yuki, who just finished serving his suspension, says he wants to thank us. It&#8217;s true that we worked hard to have his suspension lifted, but the ones at fault were Tojo-senpai and the school, not Yuki. He had done nothing wrong. If anything, he should be the one receiving apologies for the unjust punishment.</p>



<p>Yuki already has done so much for me and the others, more than we can ever repay.</p>



<p>There was never any obligation for Yuki to thank us.</p>



<p>However, those words are like a deadly poison to a maiden in love.</p>



<p>Because, because Yuki wants to thank me! How can I let this opportunity slip away!?</p>



<p>The self-questioning quickly reaches a conclusion. Being weak-willed, I immediately pounce on the bait right in front of me.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Anything is fine!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Impossible to do &#8216;anything.&#8217; Saying &#8216;anything&#8217; leads to disastrous outcomes. The other day, when I told my mom I would do anything, she asked if we could sleep together five days a week. It was terrifying.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Too much child affection?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was tough after that. I said I would do anything, but when I asked her to spare me just one day, she insisted on six days instead. I was completely cornered. What did I do wrong&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you said &#8216;anything&#8217;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Fortunately, Yuri-san was there, so it should be fine, but Yuki is truly loved by his family.</p>



<p>But still, this is a difficult task. What should I ask for?</p>



<p>I absentmindedly touch my wristwatch. It has become a habit without me realizing it. I feel hesitant about receiving gifts. Just recently, Yuki gave me a custom-made wristwatch of my own.</p>



<p>And it was made by Yuki himself. I don&#8217;t know the details, but I can tell it&#8217;s quite valuable.</p>



<p>More than anything, it&#8217;s my precious treasure filled with Yuki&#8217;s efforts and thoughts.</p>



<p>What should I ask for? I pondered, and suddenly, I remembered a video I saw on the internet last night.</p>



<p>A nearby aquarium was recommended as a great date spot. They even have dolphin shows. I haven&#8217;t been to an aquarium since elementary school.</p>



<p>A date with Yuki! I can&#8217;t help but smile. I&#8217;ve been chasing after Yuki for quite some time now. What lies ahead is unknown, and every day is a desperate struggle, just wanting to apologize.</p>



<p>But Yuki gave me a chance to start over. If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll show him that I can build everything from scratch once again—to fulfill this love.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll reset everything and start from here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, how about we go out and have fun together? I heard we can interact with the fish too. Want to go see them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, fish. Fish, huh&#8230; Wait a minute? Yeah, lets check it out.&#8221;</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Shiori PoV]</h4>



<p>The morning sun gradually illuminates the blackened surface of the water. A magnificent and fantastical scene unfolds before me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m left speechless and mesmerized. The overwhelming scale gives me goosebumps.</p>



<p>As far as the eye can see, the vast ocean stretches out. The sun&#8217;s rays reflect off the shimmering blue surface of the sea, resembling precious jewels.</p>



<p>Seagulls gracefully dance through the sky, and fish leap from the water in the distance.</p>



<p>The fresh scent of the sea fills my nostrils. Everything feels like a first-time experience.</p>



<p>Indeed, I said I wanted to go see fish. I even mentioned being able to interact with them.</p>



<p>But isn&#8217;t this a bit too much? I&#8217;m at a loss.</p>



<p>Yuki&#8217;s actions were unexpected, but it seems I still lack a proper understanding of this enigmatic person named Yuki.</p>



<p>On the ship sailing through the Pacific, overwhelmed with emotion, I shout to release the frustration in my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, you idiooooooooooooooooot!</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yuki PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Boss. Shiori seems to be enjoying it too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori shouts something loudly towards the sea. It seems she likes it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bouzu, I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t check, but when she said she wanted to see the fish, she didn&#8217;t mean go fishing, she meant the aquarium, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The aquarium? That won&#8217;t do. We can&#8217;t eat fish there, can we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Bouzu, you need to learn some common sense. By the way, it seems like even after finding out we were going on a boat, she decided to come along. She must really like you, Bouzu. Take good care of her.&#8221;</p>


<p>To fulfill Shiori&#8217;s request to see fish, I asked the captain for permission and joined the fishing trip.</p>



<p>It was surprising to learn that Shiori had an interest in fishing and wanted to interact with fish. People can be quite different from what they appear to be. Shiori is skilled at swimming and seems to have a strong affinity with the sea.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s early in the morning, but the view from the deck dispels any drowsiness. The sea expands 360 degrees. The entire field of vision is dyed with the colors of the ocean, evoking a sense of loneliness as if I&#8217;ve been left behind by the sea.</p>



<p>A few days ago, when I told Shiori that we had obtained permission to board the ship, she started clapping her hands with joy. I wonder if she was that happy. I suppose there&#8217;s something gratifying about being able to fulfill someone&#8217;s request.</p>



<p>We, as rookie sailors, can&#8217;t disturb the fishermen. Of course, I can&#8217;t let Shiori do anything dangerous, so she&#8217;s wearing a life jacket borrowed from the captain.</p>



<p>Since I had ridden ferries before, but this was my first time on a fishing boat, I was unfamiliar with the process. While the captain skillfully began the fishing operation, we held fishing rods in hand for some fishing. I started teaching Shiori, who had no fishing experience, from scratch, starting with how to put bait on the hook.</p>



<p>&#8220;A small shrimp?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like an amaebi, but it&#8217;s not actually a shrimp. It&#8217;s called scattered bait, and we use it to attract fish.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a shrimp, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Amaebi looks like shrimp, but it&#8217;s not shrimp. It&#8217;s called soramaki-yae, and it&#8217;s used to attract fish.&#8221;</p>



<p>We scattered the Amaebi from the boat onto the sea surface. Shiori&#8217;s question was reasonable. After all, it definitely looked like a shrimp. Although it appears to be a shrimp, Amaebi is a type of plankton. Living creatures are mysterious. I also prepared some Okiami. Once Shiori gets used to fishing, she can try using them.</p>



<p>There are also isome (lugworms) and gokai (sandworms), but they won&#8217;t be needed since Shiori was on the verge of tears just seeing them. As far as I know, there are only a few girls who excel in handling insects. Shakado may look like a small animal, but she might be the most reliable one. Truly, appearances can be deceiving.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wawa! Yuki, how do I attach this?&#8221;</p>



<p>I took over from Shiori, who was struggling to put the Amaebi on the hook. Although it was my first time fishing from a boat, I had some fishing experience. I had studied various things to be prepared in case I was ever kicked out of home. With basic survival skills like fire-starting and fishing, I could at least survive on a deserted island if I happened to drift there. Depending only on fish would result in a nutritionally unbalanced diet.</p>



<p>&#8220;After attaching the bait, swing the rod like this and cast it.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a strong swing of the rod, the weight at the tip of the hook would pull it away and fly into the distance.</p>



<p>Once I confirmed it splashed into the water, all that was left was to wait for a bite.</p>



<p>&#8220;So this is how you fish. At one point I wondered what would happen, but I&#8217;m thrilled!&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt sorry for Shiori, who was excited, but fishing sometimes requires patience. When they&#8217;re not biting, they really won&#8217;t bite. Even if you change your location, there are times when you don&#8217;t get any bites.</p>



<p>In the first place, if there are no fish in that area, you won&#8217;t catch any. However, today we were fishing from a boat. The boat was equipped with a fish finder, so it was unlikely that we wouldn&#8217;t catch anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki! I got a bite! Does this mean I caught something? What should I do from here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Was this beginner&#8217;s luck too? Shiori was already reeling in a catch as she said that.</p>



<p>&#8230;It seems like we&#8217;ll have some fun after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! I caught one! Yuki, I caught a fish!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations. It&#8217;s a horse mackerel.&#8221;</p>



<p>After a struggle, Shiori finally reels in the fish. Although I helped, it&#8217;s the first fish Shiori has ever caught.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8230; It&#8217;s surprisingly small? It felt so heavy!&#8221;</p>


<p>She seems a bit disappointed. For Shiori, it seemed to have enough weight. I remember having the same impression when I caught my first fish. It&#8217;s quite a nostalgic memory.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the weight of life. Fish desperately resist being caught because they don&#8217;t want to be caught.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; I see, I get it now. So this is the weight of life&#8230; I took the life of this fish.&#8221;</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, the fish is still alive, but Shiori gazes at the fish she caught with deep emotion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you scared?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no. But I have to understand. That we take lives to survive and eat. We buy fish at department stores, but they&#8217;re always processed, and even when we eat sushi, I&#8217;ve never really thought about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we Japanese say &#8220;itadakimasu&#8221; before meals, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I almost killed you, Yuki. I took your life&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She starts trembling and having a flashback, so I gently stroke her back to calm her down.</p>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, living like this, and back then, I didn&#8217;t want you to feel guilty. I helped you because I wanted you to keep living. So don&#8217;t take life for granted.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, we&#8217;re just getting started. I want to fish too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I give Shiori a push on her back. Knowing the weight of life, she will grow from this experience.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, I&#8217;ll do my best!&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s fine now. I feel relieved. Perhaps I didn&#8217;t need to worry in the first place.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right. Bouzu, how about we clean them here?&#8221;</p>



<p>As the captain pulls up the net with the winch, it reveals a variety of colorful fish.</p>



<p>There are octopuses and such, but we release anything unnecessary. According to the captain, this catch is enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing, Boss. Fumu, let&#8217;s start with the horse mackerel Shiori caught.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to eat it as filets, be careful of parasites. You can tell by looking at them.&#8221;</p>



<p>I efficiently filet the horse mackerel, just as Boss taught me. Shiori is attentively watching the process.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gross, you know. You don&#8217;t have to watch.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, if we&#8217;re going to eat it, I don&#8217;t think I should look away. Besides, I want to learn how to cook&#8230; even though I&#8217;m not confident.&#8221;</p>



<p>I see her looking uncertain. It seems like she has a long way to go.</p>



<p>Anyway, I wash the cut mackerel, place it in a small dish, and dip it in soy sauce.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, Bouzu, how is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s completely different just because it&#8217;s fresh. Shiori, do you want to try it too?&#8221;</p>


<p>Shiori timidly puts a piece of fillet in her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fish I caught. It&#8217;s my responsibility to eat it, right? Itadakimasu&#8230; It&#8217;s so juicy!&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori&#8217;s eyes widened. It&#8217;s the fish she caught. The taste must be extraordinary. Just like a horse mackerel.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re enjoying your meal. When we get back to the port, I&#8217;ll treat you to something nice. By the way, Lady, you actually wanted to go to the aquarium, didn&#8217;t you? Did you have fun today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha&#8230; You saw through me. I never imagined I would be on a boat like this. But I had a great time and had a valuable experience. Thank you so much for today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems like Bouzu didn&#8217;t notice, but he really lacks common sense. You&#8217;ll have a hard time, but next time, clearly tell him it&#8217;s a proper date to the aquarium.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Shiori never said anything about an aquarium&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s head back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;-Unbelievable!? Is this good-looking mature man&#8217;s communicative ability? In such a short time, he understands Shiori better than I do. I unintentionally caught a glimpse of why charming older men are popular.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, thank you for today too. This kind of experience couldn&#8217;t be had at the aquarium, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori&#8217;s satisfied smile shines as brilliantly as the sun reflecting on the sea&#8217;s surface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the early morning group, the classroom flows with a leisurely atmosphere.</p>



<p>Among the sparse classmates, everyone rummages through their bags to find what they need.</p>



<p>&#8220;I caused trouble for Yukito, so I can&#8217;t receive any gratitude&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that you helped me. Besides, I&#8217;ve already made it for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the suspension incident, Hinagi helped me without considering herself. For Hinagi, who has struggled in the past, it couldn&#8217;t have been an easy choice.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, she chose to help. While saying it would be cool if I helped her, in the end, I was the one who was helped. Therefore, I must express my gratitude.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. It&#8217;s cute, and soft&#8230; so fluffy. Yukito is talented.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;I can only do simple things like sewing buttons.&#8221;</p>



<p>I hand the Yukito Bear plushie to Hinagi. I also made one for Hiori-chan.</p>



<p>Recently, since my mother does most of the household chores, I have less to do at home.</p>



<p>Feeling idle and anxious about my own purpose, I started studying sewing.</p>



<p>One of the results of my efforts is the requested Yukito-kun plushie.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just an ordinary stuffed animal. If you hit here, it screams! It contains a collection of nine different death cries. Perfect for stress relief.&#8221;</p>



<p>I press the head part, and it emits a sound of me screaming, &#8220;Nwaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>



<p>The fact that someone specifically requested a plushie resembling me suggests it&#8217;s for stress relief.</p>



<p>When feeling angry, they can step on it, punch it, or throw it against the wall.</p>




<p>If that&#8217;s the case, the screams are indispensable to enhance the sense of realism. I&#8217;ve really done a good job.</p>



<p>Hinagi squeezes the chest of the Yukito Bear. A scream of &#8220;Ngyaaaaaa!&#8221; echoes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why screams! It&#8217;s too horrifying! Seriously, you&#8217;re such an idiot. It would have been better if it called my name or something&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi pouts a little. Next time, I&#8217;ll listen to her request and record her voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;And also, look at this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;This is a book, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Pop-up Hinagi-chan Picture Book.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I open the book, a young Hinagi-chan pops out. The content is very simple, telling the heartwarming story of adventurous Hinagi-chan, who experiences various things and becomes happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;You used to like picture books, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? But this is amazing. I can&#8217;t believe you made something like this&#8230; Huh, the last page is blank?&#8221;</p>



<p>As Hinagi flips through the book, her hand stops at the last page.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your future, your path will continue from here on. It won&#8217;t be an end.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As she looked at the finished picture book that incorporated educational elements, Hinagi-chan&#8217;s eyes turned red once again.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right. When we were children, Hinagi-chan loved picture books. She often came to me and said, &#8220;Yu-chan, let&#8217;s read together!&#8221; It was always me who read it aloud while Hinagi-chan exclaimed, &#8220;Amazing!&#8221; in admiration. It&#8217;s nostalgic.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking, Yukito, do you like crafts and such?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure. I haven&#8217;t really thought about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never been conscious of it, but maybe I don&#8217;t dislike getting engrossed in something.</p>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of joining a club too. Now that I&#8217;m a high school student, I want to start something new.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wiping away her teary eyes, Hinagi-chan showed a smile. She, too, is growing as she walks through the blank pages. She&#8217;s trying to live her own life, not just focusing on me and neglecting herself as she did when she first entered school.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no need for unnecessary words. I&#8217;ll just respect her decision.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve decided. I&#8217;ll join the art club!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not the brass band club?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Hinagi was in junior high school, she was in the brass band club. Now Hinagi-chan is in the brass band club as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I like the brass band too, but I wanted to try expressing myself through something tangible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing her gradually growing, step by step, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel proud.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, Yukito-kun, hurry up! I&#8217;m starving. I&#8217;m so hungry!&#8221;</p>



<p>She seemed annoyed. Fearing divine punishment, I immediately apologized.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, esteemed divine being, Takami Musuhi no Mikoto-senpai.&#8221;</p>



<p>[TL: Takami Musuhi No Mikoto (高皇産霊尊) is the name of a deity found in Japanese mythology. In the &#8220;Kojiki,&#8221; it is mentioned as one of the gods that appeared at the beginning of heaven and earth, alongside Ame No minaka nushi no Kami and Kamu Musubi no Kami. The name can also be written as Takami Musubi no Kami. &#8220;Musu&#8221; signifies birth or creation, while &#8220;Hi&#8221; represents spiritual power or essence.]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the Floor Boss, also known as Goddess-senpai, who always appears on the emergency staircase, but I had informed her of the plan in advance.</p>



<p>&#8220;The divinity is too heavy! By the way, why can you say that complicated name so smoothly, but you can&#8217;t remember my name? Tell me the truth. You actually remember, don&#8217;t you? You&#8217;re doing it on purpose, right? Just pretending to forget to hide your embarrassment when we&#8217;re alone together, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, that&#8217;s not true. I definitely remember.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, say it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yare yare. I&#8217;ve been quite underestimated. I do remember Goddess-senpai&#8217;s real name.</p>



<p>&#8220;As I recall&#8230; umm, the Shogi that moves in a strange way. It&#8217;s not Argent&#8230; not Shokugeki&#8230; Wait. Was it&#8212;-Bringer?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you remember it!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Mera.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mera! No, wait, not that either. It&#8217;s Souma, not Zoma. So-u-ma. It&#8217;s a lovely name, Souma Kyoka, the Mirror of the Equine Blossoms. Remember it properly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, everyone around calls you Goddess-senpai, that&#8217;s the prevailing rumor, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because you started calling me that, that it spread! Why are you saying it as if it doesn&#8217;t matter!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well. I&#8217;ll give you a baguette.&#8221;</p>



<p>I handed the baguette I had in my hand to Goddess-senpai. I noticed that she had been eyeing the baguette a few times since earlier.</p>



<p>To calm down the agitated Goddess-senpai, offering an offering is the best way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, you said you would make me lunch in return, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not store-bought. I baked it myself. Here, have some. It&#8217;s Dragon Fruit Jam.&#8221;</p>



<p>Due to the size being too large to bake in the oven at home, I borrowed the head chef&#8217;s help.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing, but honestly, it&#8217;s really impressive! I&#8217;m curious about the jam with such a strong and unique name, but even if I receive such a big and hard baguette for lunch, I won&#8217;t be able to finish it. Wait, are you planning to make me say that line just now!?&#8221;</p>



<p>“There is French bread, but there is no Japanese bread.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, listen to me for a moment! It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m the only one saying embarrassing things.&#8221;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s &#8220;Japanese bread&#8221; supposed to be? Panpan-zemi (a seminar on bread)?</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ve prepared it properly. Please nibble on the baguette during class, like a squirrel hoarding food. Oh, and here&#8217;s this pistachio jam, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apart from the baguette, I hand over a bento box.</p>



<p>&#8220;You made a bento for me too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I stopped by the home economics room to warm it up. Please, it&#8217;s Unadon (grilled eel on rice).&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Luxurious! It&#8217;s suddenly a significant upgrade. &#8230;Is this still in the bento category?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I learned it from someone and prepared it myself. Then I made it into a grilled eel style.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you planning to become a cook, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have such intentions&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The head chef even said to me, &#8220;If you ever run into trouble in the future, I&#8217;ll make you the successor of this shop.&#8221;. The owner&#8217;s son seems to be a regular company employee. He laughed boldly, saying that he had no particular intention to impose on the store and that it would be fine if it ended in his generation, but it seems to be the same everywhere that people are troubled by the lack of successors.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, don&#8217;t you have something for yourself, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have this.&#8221;</p>


<p>I take out a block from the paper bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, a high-quality loaf of bread that you hardly see these days!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never tried eating it before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t either. Can I have it a little bit later?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, go ahead. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could finish it all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did you bring a whole loaf then!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Quenching my thirst with a tapioca drink, I immediately tear off a piece and try it.</p>



<p>&#8220;How is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Maybe try to use some jam?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The high-quality loaf of bread, despite its simplicity, was delicious.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a line-up like someone who missed the boom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ugh. I secretly receive a blow from the merciless comeback of the current high school girl, but I won&#8217;t be discouraged.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I have one more thing as a token of gratitude.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, did you bring something else for me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not food, but here it is! Behold, an A3 tapestry featuring a freshly taken photo of Goddess Senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the bonus item from last time!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8211;HA!? What am I even…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps Goddess-senpai received some divine revelation. She&#8217;s becoming even more goddess-like.</p>



<p>To avoid any misunderstanding, let me clarify.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a bonus item, it&#8217;s available for purchase.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been doing as you please for far too long. But fine, I&#8217;ll take it for now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got scolded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm, it&#8217;s delicious! But eel is quite expensive, isn&#8217;t it? I feel a bit guilty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, the cost is only for the ingredients. By the way, did you know that the midsummer day of the ox is not limited to Saturdays? It means you can eat it today without any problem.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh, really!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the afternoon, we became a little wiser through this conversation.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Long before the beginning of the common era, there existed a prehistoric civilization. The romance of ancient civilizations with advanced technology surpassing the present day is endless, but for us living in the present, knowing the history after the start of the era and the year 1 AD is challenging enough.</p>



<p>While indulging in the grand history and letting our thoughts wander, there is something important we must not forget. Let&#8217;s reflect upon the humble and trivial history.</p>



<p>Within the nine-square-meter room, there exist two distinct eras: the &#8216;Old Era of My Room&#8217; and the &#8216;New Era of My Room.&#8217; The transformation was truly dramatic.</p>



<p>My modest and lifeless room has completely changed, adorned with pastel colors spreading throughout.</p>



<p>The prehistoric civilization has vanished without a trace. Even finding remnants has become a challenge.</p>



<p>And suddenly, a dresser appeared. It wasn&#8217;t there just yesterday!</p>



<p>Of course, it is evident that the culprit behind this change is either my mother or sister, or perhaps both. Despite me meekly protesting their casual intrusion into my room, they pay no attention. Dependent family members can be tough to handle.</p>



<p>As I silently weep in my heart, studying in this restless room, an unprecedented crisis suddenly befalls me. It is a predicament comparable to forgetting the function calculator essential for my qualification exam. This is the Great King Angolmois that Nostradamus prophesied.</p>


<p>Trembling with powerlessness in the face of an approaching adversary, I find myself backed against the wall. There&#8217;s no more room to retreat. Determined to face the overwhelmingly powerful opponent, I muster up the courage to confront them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regain your sanity, sister!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am always sane.&#8221;</p>



<p>Attempting to persuade her, I realize that my sister is indeed sane. If that&#8217;s the case, then this is it!</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t regain your sanity, sister!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, maybe I have lost my sanity a long time ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Invincible, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I am completely defeated by Yuri-san, who flawlessly defeats my strongest and invincible theory. I can&#8217;t even look directly at Yuri-san. However, a divine inspiration descends upon me, and a solution comes to mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it! Just wait a moment!&#8221;</p>


<p>I rush out of my room in a panic, heading to retrieve what I need.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuufuufuu. This will make it perfect. I&#8217;m ready now. What do you need?&#8221;</p>



<p>I accidentally stub my toe against a corner, causing excruciating pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing!? Are you okay? It&#8217;s dangerous to do something like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a flick, the eye mask was thrown away. My eyes were also badly damaged.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you naked?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I ask you to measure because my chest had gotten bigger? I need to buy new bras too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you weren&#8217;t joking&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I vaguely remember her mentioning that her underwear had become tight.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, am I really the one who&#8217;s supposed to measure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? Who else would do it if not you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>Actually, isn&#8217;t anyone other than Mom more suitable? It seems like a more appropriate task for someone other than me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom is my rival. She may be ahead of me for now, but eventually, I&#8217;ll surpass her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Since I didn&#8217;t quite understand, I gave a vague response.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re already used to seeing me naked, right? Why would you be embarrassed just to measure my bust size?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good if I&#8217;m used to seeing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister tilts her head in confusion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Was there any reason to doubt that?&#8221;</p>



<p>I tilted my head in confusion as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about that. Let&#8217;s get it measured. Bring the measuring tape.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister clasps her hands behind her head and opens her armpits wide.</p>



<p>As a teenager, it was a seductive and toxic sight for me to behold, but she seemed completely unfazed.</p>



<p>There it was, a perfect masterpiece. Her beautiful posture resembled that of a sculpture, evoking a divine presence. Flawless and delicate skin devoid of any impurities. Its purity, Twelve Nine.</p>


<p>I dropped to my knees. Thunderous applause resounded in my heart. I savored this overwhelming sensation.</p>



<p>A meeting of the modern Renaissance. Driven by a yearning that welled up from the depths of my heart, my voice trembled.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Erotic Venus.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s by Milo.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mouth slipped! Slipped! Slipped! (Echo)</p>



<p>&#8220;If you say so, then it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>I could only admire her incredible tolerance.</p>



<p>&#8220;You measure from the back. The difference between the top and under determines the size.&#8221;</p>


<p>I acquired unnecessary knowledge again. Sister harassment is on the verge of exploding tonight.</p>



<p>If I don&#8217;t measure, it seems like this won&#8217;t end. Gathering my courage, I slowly wrap the measuring tape from the back. Aligning it to intersect at the top and adjusting the numbers&#8230; Ahhhhhh!</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8230; It tickles&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I need to escape from this hell as soon as possible, or my credits will run out, and my life will be unable to continue.</p>



<p>&#8220;..There&#8230;.rub there&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t heard anything, I haven&#8217;t heard anything, I haven&#8217;t heard anything, I haven&#8217;t heard anything. What number repetition is this now?</p>



<p>&#8220;Subtraction, yes, I need to subtract! Uhm&#8230; Around twenty-five centimeters, maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>I check the size chart with a crawling body. I should look at the column for a G cup.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only now that I realize there are different types even within the same cup size. Being a woman is tough, unlike men. It&#8217;s quite educational since I&#8217;m learning sewing.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems like I&#8217;ve grown after all. Measure me once a week from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that too often!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the growth period.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The growth period is incredible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The persuasiveness of the growth period is unmatched.</p>



<p>Anyway, even though the measurement is over, my sister, who usually doesn&#8217;t care, continues to stare straight at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? It&#8217;s not something that will decrease, so feel free to look.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Have a little more modesty&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re family. You don&#8217;t need to worry about that.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Well, if you feel that way, I have something to say too!&#8221;</p>



<p>Snap. Finally, I snapped too. Even my patience has its limits. Despite having a mental fortitude as unwavering as a level, there are limits, just like the credit limit on a credit card.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a saying about familiarity breeding contempt, but even within a family, there should be some manners.</p>



<p>Cut it out already. What&#8217;s with that attitude when I&#8217;m the one putting up with it!</p>



<p>Yeah, I understand. Fine! You started this war. I&#8217;ll take you to the limit!</p>



<p>&#8220;Jii.&#8221; (Sfx stare)</p>



<p>I stare intently. I gaze freely. It&#8217;s like an eye examination. I let my gaze roam all over her body.</p>



<p>Fuhehehe. How&#8217;s that? Isn&#8217;t it intimidating? Experience the power of a lewd and lascivious gaze filled with hidden motives!</p>



<p>Yuri-san flinches for a moment. I won! Along with a sense of accomplishment comes a sense of loss.</p>


<p>The cost of victory is high. I&#8217;m disqualified as a little brother, and there&#8217;s no way to justify my actions even if she looks at me with disgust.</p>



<p>As I inwardly panic, she embraces me gently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s enough. Do as you please. I&#8217;ll accept everything. Because&#8230; I only have that&#8230; My worth&#8230; My purpose&#8230; Be true to your feelings and prioritize emotions. If it&#8217;s what you, Yukito, desire, then I&#8217;ll do anything&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yuri-san snaps back to reality and moves away.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sister?&#8221;</p>



<p>For just a moment, her eyes flicker with a touch of sadness.</p>



<p>Feeling an indescribable uneasiness, my gaze wanders. What was that just now&#8230;?</p>



<p>Starting over, Yuri-san opens her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to buy underwear, so you&#8217;re coming with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I decline.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy you underwear that you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you say it in such a flippant way like buying me candy, ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? You are coming right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me join you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our outing is decided. Maybe we&#8217;re gradually returning to being a normal brother and sister.</p>



<p>However, the bittersweet and troubled expression on Yuri-san&#8217;s face remains etched in my mind.</p>
