<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Chapter 4 - True Feelings and Suspicions.</h3>

<p>The next day, when I left the house to go to school, fully recovered, my sister stopped me at the entrance of the house. Even though we went to the same high school, we did not go to school together. I usually leave the house earlier than my sister, who is weak in the morning.<p>What does she want?<p>“Hmmm…”<p>As I was wondering what was going on, she put one hand out in front of her.<p>Hahaha, I see. So you’re charging me because you took care of me yesterday, huh?<p>I made you buy a lot of things for me yesterday. I feel bad for having bothered her. I took out my wallet and put a one-thousand-yen bill in her palm.<p>“Ha?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I was joking.”<p>I know, 1,000 yen is not enough! I’ll change it to a 5,000 yen bill.<p>“Are you making fun of me?”<p>This is bad! Her eyebrows are wrinkled. I must have made her angry. Unlike boys, girls have to pay for everything. It was only natural that I should add it to the nursing fee. I took out a 10,000 yen bill from my wallet with this in mind, but the voltage of my sister’s anger skyrocketed.<p>“C-Can you give me a break on this somehow?”<p>I offered her my entire wallet. I usually don’t spend much money, so it’s no problem. My name is Yukito Kokonoe, a man who has never been a rebel. If my sister needs it, I’ll just give it to her.<p>I’m just thankful that they let a piece of s**t like me go to school in a decent way to begin with. It is my policy not to go against my family.<p>“I never said I wanted money?”</p>

<p>“…… then what do you want me to offer you?”<p>“What’s with the assumption that I’m asking for something?”<p>“I’m sorry I’m such a foolish brother.”<p>There was no way for me to understand the thoughts of my deeply thoughtful sister. I will be diligent.<p>“I know you’ve been sick. You’re anxious, so I’ll hold your hands and we’ll go together.”<p>“Are you crazy?”<p>Am I in kindergarten? I can’t keep up with the unexpected and oblique answer at all. If a high school senior tries to go to school holding hands with my sister, there will be another problem. My sister is famous for her beauty. It would cause unnecessary rumors. Besides, there is no way I can hold hands with my sister.<p>If we did that, it would be just like that time again—–.</p>

<p>“—I can’t do it…”<p>“You still don’t trust me?”<p>“No, that’s not it.”<p>I can’t take advantage of her kindness. It was enough for me that she was concerned about me like this even if she didn’t like me. I can’t ask for more than that.<p>I’m already in perfect physical condition. I turned on my heel and headed for school.<p>I know that the only thing that lies ahead is sadness.</p><p>“How did this happen……”<p>“You’re getting a lot of attention right off the bat, sexy man.”</p>

<p>As soon as I arrive at the classroom, a fresh handsome guy makes fun of me. I was sick, and this commotion was hard to deal with in the morning. My sister was persistent. She was so persistent that she forced me to link arms with her, as if she was annoyed that I would not hold hands with her. I tried to push her away, but she was holding me tight and it was impossible. Thanks to this, I had to go to school in the morning in a state like a couple of idiots.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it was an early topic of conversation, and rumors quickly circulated. If there was one good thing that came out of it, it was that I enjoyed the soft feeling on my arms, but the fatigue was winning out. It was not worth it. After spending the first period of class exhausted, I was summoned to the hallway by a senpai whom I had never met before.<p>“Sorry to call you out. I’m Mizuguchi, a second-year student. Is it true that you’re Yuuri’s younger brother?”<p>“I don’t look much like my sister.”<p>“In the morning, I was surprised because I thought she had a boyfriend. Did something happen?”<p>“I caught a cold, so my sister was just worried about me.”<p>“Are you all right now?”<p>“Yes, I’m fine. I took yesterday off and rested well, so I’m fine, but I’m a little tired from the morning’s commotion.”</p>

<p>“Kuku. She’s a popular person. But still, she’s a very anxious person. I think it’s good that she cares about her family, but I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.”<p>“My sister’s eccentricities amaze me, too.”<p>“I don’t have much time, so I’ll keep this short and sweet, but I do have a favor to ask of you. Is that okay?”<p>“Are you talking about confessing to my sister?”<p>That’s the only way it can be when he asks me something about my sister. Yuuri is a beautiful woman, just like my mother. This happened to me several times in junior high school, “Does your sister have a boyfriend?” I was often asked. But we didn’t talk much, so I didn’t know much about her private life. It would not be surprising if she has a boyfriend.<p>“I’m embarrassed to even say this, but could you call up Yuuri and ask her?”<p>“Do you need to rely on me?”<p>“I don’t know if you know this, but she never comes when I call her. I’ve given her love letters and stuff, but she either doesn’t read them or ignores them. She’s famous for that too.”</p>

<p>“Who is that b***h? Ah you mean my sister huh.”<p>“I know, but that’s the weakness of being in love with someone. Even if you confess your feelings to someone and they reject you, you can’t let them go, can you?”<p>Even though she is my sister, her attitude is too harsh. The truth of the world lies in the fact that she is popular in spite of this. I took a quick look around Mizuguchi-senpai, but he doesn’t look like a barbaric person. He speaks to me in a friendly manner, and I have a good impression of him. I’ve just given my sister a lot of trouble, and I don’t know what kind of response I’ll get, but I should reward her once in a while.<br>As a love cupid, it must be my brother’s duty to support my sister’s love life!<p>“I understand. Leave it to me!”<p>“Will you do it, young boy!”</p><p>“You’re only one year older than me.”<p>“You’ve got to knock it out of the park.”<p>Mizuguchi seemed like a nice guy.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Yuuri PoV]</b>

<p>“—-Hiaaa!”<p>“just now did you just make strange noises?”<p>“Shut up.”<p>“What’s with that character ……?”<p>I checked it over seriously, but it was definitely an e-mail from my brother.<p>Was it a misdirect? But there was no way that the message was sent to someone other than me, as it said, “I have an important message for you, Yuuri. I still couldn’t believe it, because he almost never sends me e-mails. Even if he did, it was only to communicate with me on a rare occasion, and this was the first time he had ever sent me something like this.<p>“……, what should I do, I’m not wearing any makeup today.”</p>

<p>“You always do. You’re unusually upset, what’s up with this morning thing?”<p>“From now on, it won’t be so unusual. But still, what the hell is going on……”<p>“Eh, what? Are you going to walk to school in that every day?”<p>“I’d love to—-Eh, no way, was that thing in the morning an ‘aneikatsu’!?”<p>[Aneikatsu: A woman provides financial and other support to a younger man. In many cases, the female partner pampering the younger man is intended to enjoy a pseudo-sibling relationship. The specific details include buying him a meal or paying for his shopping. Basically, the goal is often to provide support to the partner, rather than focusing on a romantic or physical relationship.]<p>I noticed it suddenly. In the morning, for some reason, my brother handed me some money.<p>It may sound a bit juvenile, but there is such a thing as “papa katsu” in the world. I was wondering if my brother might have proposed “aneikatsu” to me. He said that the content of the offer depends on the amount of money, but I don’t understand it because I don’t know the market price. Come to think of it, my brother first offered me a 1,000 yen bill. Eventually he offered me his entire wallet, which makes me wonder how far he wanted me to go with that.<p>What did he want me to do? Sh*t, I should have never said no!<br>I couldn’t stay like this. I took out my cosmetic pouch from my bag and headed for the restroom at once. This was the first time I had ever received a call from my brother. I had no idea what it would be about, but I had no choice but to face it with a single-minded determination. I waited for after-school while suppressing my excitement.</p>

<p>“Where are you with Yukito?!”<p>The fire escape is always quiet. I looked around, but my brother was nowhere to be seen.<p>“Thank you for coming, Yuuri.”<p>I felt like someone had called my name, but I didn’t care about that. For some reason, the man I didn’t know well who came in front of me made me feel depressed.<p>“I have something to tell you.”<p>“Who are you?”<p>“Kyoichi Mizuguchi from the next class. We were on the beautification committee together once before.”<p>“I don’t know you. I’m busy. If you don’t need me, can you go somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“W-Wait a minute! I’m the one who called Yuuri. I asked your brother for you to come here.”<p>“Ha?”<p>I finally became interested in the Mizuguchi in front of me when I heard that much.</p><p>—-Just now, what did he just say? Did you ask my brother?<p>“I-I like you. Please go out with me!”<p>“Did you say something Mizuguchi? Did you use my brother?”<p>“N-no. It’s not like that, I just asked him to help me, otherwise you wouldn’t come. ……”<p>“You’ve got to be kidding me! Don’t drag my brother into your nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I’m just confessing to you–“<p>“Then why don’t you just tell me right there and then! Did you threaten my brother by calling me out here?”<p>“Threats, I didn’t do that!”<p>“Who knows. Mou!”<p>Ignoring Mizuguchi, I start running. I have to leave now. I’m worried that he might have done something to me.<br>By then, the fact that he had confessed to me had completely disappeared from my mind.<p>“Uhm, …… your answer?”<p>On the fire escape, left alone, Mizuguchi was at a loss.</p>

<b style="text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</b>

<p>Did my sister’s love go well? Yes, yes, I feel very good. From now on, I will make it my goal to do one good deed a day! Maybe, but that’s what Shakyamuni Buddha said. They say it comes from Buddhism, but my family is not religious.<p>I heard footsteps slamming and came to a stop in front of my room, and the door was opened vigorously without regard to my knocking. Yuuri-san, who had taken off her school uniform and was now wearing a tank top, was standing in front of me. Oh, did he succeed?<p>“Welcome back, Yuuri-san.”<p>“That guy Mizuguchi didn’t do anything to you, did he?”<p>“? He just asked me to call Yuuri-san.”<p>“Thank god…..”<p>“Did you and senpai become lovers?”<p>“I could care less about anyone who tries to take advantage of you.”</p>

<p>My sister was spitting with a face that she couldn’t show me. She seems to be fuming. What happened, Mizuguchi-senpai? For some reason, my sister sat down next to me.<p>“Senpai, he seemed to be a pretty nice guy.”<p>“Ha? So what? Are you asking me to go out with him?”<p>“Yes…….”<p>I never said anything like that, but her eyes scared me. I had to keep my mouth shut.<p>“You know, if there’s something you want me to do, I don’t need money or anything.”<p>“Thank you? Yes, yes?”<p>What is it that I want her to do for me? Her cheeks were slightly red. Don’t you want money? Come to think of it, we had such an exchange in the morning. Fumu… So, my wallet is not enough money. Maybe there is something she wants. I’ll do my best to cooperate!</p>

<p>“Then, let’s take it out of my savings.”<p>“Savings!? What is it that you want me to do?”<p>“I don’t spend much money.”<p>“But that is just too morbid! I understand. I’ll make up my mind. I’ll do whatever you want. I don’t want your money, so just tell me when you’re ready.”<p>“I-I see. Thank you?”<p>“It’s fine. No, I just want to do it for you.”</p><p>The sister’s face changed and she walked out of the room with a look of love and contentment on her face. She left like a storm, but I didn’t quite understand what she was saying until the end.<p>……What do she mean by morbid?</p>

<p>“Yukito, let’s compete in the next 1,500-meter run!”<p>The fresh and handsome man’s face is as radiant as the clear sky. It’s a beautiful day, huh.<p>“Why don’t we do long body forward bends anyway?”<p>“I don’t understand what you mean by “anyway”. Is it fun to compete in body elasticity?”<p>A large number of students are gathered on the field. Today, a new physical fitness test was being held to measure individual athletic ability. Some of the tests had already been completed.<p>My grip strength, which had been a personal concern, was almost back to normal.<p>Looking next to me, I saw a sparkle in the eyes of a fresh and handsome man. What is it that makes me so sad that I have to deal with this all-around sports prince? I’m pretty good at basketball, but not so good at other sports. As far as my running ability is concerned, I can run long distances, but I’m no match for the fresh, handsome guy when it comes to short distances. Knowing that, I chose middle-distance running, which is really obnoxious. When I was about to open my mouth to say something sarcastic, the girls cheered. They seemed to be getting excited about something.<p>“That’s Kamishiro isn’t it? She’s amazing!”</p>

<p>The fresh-looking guy was impressed, but I followed his gaze.<p>At the center of the circle was Shiori Kamishiro. She had set a new record in the standing long jump.<p>“Shiori is a physical specimen. I’m not surprised.”<p>“It’s a shame that Kamishiro is a home coming student when she’s so athletic.”<p>“That’s true…… yes?”<p>Her smile was dazzling, filled with energy like a bursting bullet.<p>However, I felt something strange about the way Kamishiro was looking at me.<p>“O-oi! Yukito, where are you going?”</p>

<p>I headed toward the group of girls.<p>The sudden intruder had quieted the cheers and made the girls’ eyes go black and white.<p>“Kokonoe-chan, what’s wrong?”<p>“Yuki? Why are you here ……”<p>“You look very sick. Are you alright?”<p>Kamishiro’s movements were dull. It was obvious to those who were more or less familiar with her. The fact that she can still record a record is impressive, but Kamishiro, who has her mind set on physical parameters, is a girl who can do more than that.</p>

<p>“Eh? Ah…..yes. There is nothing to worry about. Look, I’m full of spirit!”<p>It seems like an empty cheerfulness, but then I remembered.<p>“I see. Come to think of it, you’re pretty good at lying.”<p>“–?!”<p>“Sorry for interrupting.”<p>I was conscious that I was talking in a very mean and cowardly way. But it might be useless.<br>I asked out of curiosity, but when I thought about it, it would be extremely annoying to being worried by a shady person like me. It’s not surprising that people might think that a bottom-feeder like me should crawl down and sip muddy water, which would just be annoying. I’m sorry to have interrupted the excitement.<p>“W-wait! I’m sorry, Yuki. I lied!”<p>Just as I was about to go back, I was stopped by a frantic-looking Kamishiro.</p>

<p>She looked pale, as if she was getting seriously ill.<p>“Uhm, I just forgot to eat breakfast, it’s really not that big of a deal. ……”<p>“That’s enough.”<p>“I just didn’t want you to worry! I won’t ever lie to you again.”<p>“Did you oversleep or something?”<p>“I was a little busy in the morning …… and all I had that night was a cup of noodles …….”<p>“You’re a big eater. What are you doing?”<p>“I’m sorry ……. I don’t want you to worry about it.”</p>

<p>“You’re three sizes?<p>“……Eh? The last time I measured it, it was 90—-wait a second, Yuki? Do you know what you’re doing! T-That kind of thing has to be done in secret later.”<p>Oh, she told me. I was just asking in the heat of the moment. ……<p>“Shiorin, were you really sick?”<p>“Y-yes…. It’s not so much that I can’t move, but it’s not very comfortable.”<p>“I didn’t notice it at all. And yet I made a fuss, sorry, Kamishiro-san?”</p>

<p>“It was my fault. I didn’t mean to hide it, I just thought it was okay. ……”<p>Kamishiro apologizes apologetically. The people around her are also worried.<p>It was enough to know that she was not ill. It was very typical of Kamishiro to be so hungry that she didn’t have any energy, but she should be able to complete the rest of the tests without any problem.<p>“Hey, Kokonoe-kun. How did you know that Kamishiro-san wasn’t feeling well?”<p>“Yeah. She didn’t appear to be that way at all.<p>Sakurai and the others gathered around, asking me ” teach me for the future”.<p>As expected of a cheerful girl, she was very attentive to others. I pointed at her ponytail.<p>“Whenever she’s happy, in a good mood, having fun, or has too much energy, her ponytail bounces around vigorously. Look at that. Right now, she’s a little sad”</p>

<p>“Now that you mention it, it certainly is …….”<p>“My ponytail doesn’t work like a dog’s tail!?”<p>All of them became reluctant. I was one of them.<p>“Eh? Eh….W-what? Did I say something funny?”<p>“Haa…yare yare”<p>Geez not good. Not good at all Kamishiro-kun.<p>“Look. A face that is trying to resist the classic “that’s a horse’s tail, not a dog’s tail” comment.”<p>“It’s my fault!?”</p>

<p>“What’s the point of burning calories with a lucky break if you’re not feeling well?”<p>“I feel like I’m being treated unreasonably.……”<p>Kamishiro is being dishonest, which is one of the advantages of Kamishiro that it doesn’t last long.<p>“Actually, it’s just an observation. In time, everyone will understand. I’d be punished for disrespect if I didn’t notice that Yuuri’s bangs were just slightly shorter.”<p>She gets into a bad mood right away. “Don’t you have something to say?” When asked, I desperately search for changes. As a result of persistent asking, I have improved my observational skills. This is also the result of Yuuri’s training.<p>“Don’t be too hard on yourself.”<p>“Yes. Sorry you had to worry about me”<p>This should allow things to proceed smoothly and without recklessness. The people around her would not force her to do too much.</p><p>However, I was concerned about how fragile Kamishiro seemed to be at some point.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p>“I’m very disappointed.”<p>After school, we were summoned to the staff room. In front of us was Sayuri sensei with a stern expression on her face.<p>“Sensei, are you mad?”<p>“Yes, I’m mad.”<p>“…………”<p>“…………”<p>There is an awkward silence.</p>

<p>“If you’re ashamed, you shouldn’t have said it.”<p>“You made me say it!”<p>I’m sorry, sensei. I apologize in my heart.<p>“I’ll get straight to the point, why are you guys in the homecoming club?”<p>We looked at each other at the unexpected topic. Kouki Mihou and Shiori Kamishiro were standing next to me.<p>“Why? Because isn’t it common knowledge that shady people go home?”<p>“You’re not as shady as you think you are, you know.”<p>“Eh, seriously?”</p>

<p>“Yes, seriously.”<p>“I just became friends with Shakadou the other day as a fellow shady person. ……”<p>“When did you become friends with Shakadou-chan, Yuki?!”<p>“That person. That’s great, but, well, please be good friends with Shakado.”<p>Shakado, for the record, is a reptile-like girl who loves to be in the shady side of the class. She was loved as the class mascot because of her lovable personality.<p>“I’m thinking of joining the same club as Yukito”<p>“As for me, I’m going to be a manager in the same club as Yuki. ……”<p>“Don’t drag me into this!”</p>

<p>Sayuri sensei pointed at me as if in dismay.<p>“Are you two being blackmailed by this troublemaker?”<p>“Isn’t that a little harsh?”<p>“Reap what you sow. A while ago, a sensei from the athletics club came to me and asked about you guys. I told him that you were a homecoming club. I’m sure they’ll recruit you soon, so think about it.”<p>“That was because you made it an unnecessary contest.”<p>It was a mistake that Kouki inadvertently set a good record in the 1,500-meter run, which was unexpectedly heated. Because he’s so stubborn and refreshingly good-looking.<p>“So, what are you going to do, Yukito? Are you going to join the track team?”<p>“I told you, I’m in the home-coming club. You can do whatever you want.”</p><p>“Then, I’m not going to do it either."</p>

<p>“Sensei, I think there’s something wrong with this guy. His face is too bright.”<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Kamishiro what about you? I heard you had all these great records. You can bet you”ll be getting more invitations in the future.”<p>“I-I’m in a little club right now….”<p>Kamishiro looked apologetic as she turned her gaze toward me.<p>“Geez, I don’t know what kind of relationship you guys have, but there aren’t many opportunities for youth. Make sure you don’t have any regrets.”<p>“Don’t worry. Sensei still has a lot of youth left!”<p>“You really only say unnecessary things, don’t you?”</p>

<p>I made her angry again. I thought I was following Sayuri sensei on the spur of the moment, but it turned out to be a snake in the bush.<p>But I was still taking it lightly at the time. Something had already started to happen.</p><p>“You must be the Kokonoe-kun I’ve heard so much about you.”<p>The next day. As soon as I arrived at school in the morning, I was involved with a group of third-year Senpais.<p>“To make use of your height, volleyball is the only way to go. That’s right isn’t it?”<p>“Am I reincarnated in a gal-game world by any chance?”<p>“Come to your senses. This is reality, okay?”<p>“That’s a little too much for me to comprehend.”</p>

t.getElementById(slotId+'-asloaded'),{attributes:true});</script></span></span><p>Could this be a beauty pageant type of a spoof? The answer to such a question was easily revealed.<p>“If you agree, Kamishiro-san, will also join our club, okay?”<p>“What’s with that agency system for the majors?”<p>“Sorry, can you give him to us?”<p>The one who saved me from a tight spot was another senior student. This time it was a boy.</p><p>“Thank you very much. You saved me”<p>“Don’t worry about it. If I can convince you to go along with me. We are from the track and field club and we are going to have to get serious about this.”<p>“Ah, this one is also bad”</p>

<p>“I invited Mihou to join the club first, and he agreed if you would join.”<p>“That solar-paneled b*stard!”<p>“Hold on. We invited him first?”<p>“Recruitment of potential new members has nothing to do with inviting first, do you think?”<p>“Funn. Well, then, we don’t have any choice.”<p>The seniors were bickering with each other. Then another group of seniors appeared.<p>“Sh*t. They beat us to it! Hold on. The soccer team will take care of him.”<p>“How about we play doubles and go to nationals?”</p>

<p>“Forget about that, let’s play baseball!”<p>How many are there! Don’t try to take me in with the whole group!<p>“Shortage of talented people. Is this another evil of the declining birthrate …… Well then, that’s that!”<p>With the bell ringing, I tried to escape. What is this school?<p>“So why are you so tired in the morning?”<p>When I arrived at class, the source of the evil, the face-colored light-emitting diode, spoke to me.<p>“I’m going to weld your face.”<p>When I explained to him about my morning slapstick, he laughed at me and wondered what was so funny.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Yuki. This wasn’t supposed to happen.……”<p>Kamishiro, listening next to me, apologized, but in Kamishiro’s case, I couldn’t get mad at her.<p>“No way this will go on forever……”<p>I’m not proud of it, but my predictions are always right. And it’s usually for the worse.</p><p>“Now, it’s time for you to switch seats. Take this opportunity to get to know each other well.”<p>Sayuri sensei’s comment set the classroom abuzz. This is an important event that affects everyone equally.<p>Many students begin new friendships by changing seats. Some see it as a chance to get closer to the opposite sex they are interested in.<p>One by one, they draw lots. The results are mixed. The result is not the last row by the window, which is the privilege of the main character, but a common seat slightly in front of the center of the room. Then Sakurai and Mineta came in.</p>

<p>“Oyo, Yay! Kokonoe-chan is here~”<p>“Mineta-chi, that’s right girl. Seriously, I understand how you feel. We really gotta KP on this” [TL: KP is slang for kan pai aka toast]<p>“S-sorry. Kokonoe-chan, you don’t have to force yourself to use Gyaru language, okay ……?”</p><p>“? I thought it was essential for communication, but I guess not.”<p>“You don’t mistake Gyaru for some kind of rare animal or something, do you?”<p>“I’m the one who’s treated like a rare animal. Ahahahaha.”<p>” ‘Ahhahaha’—– There is no such thing right!?”<p>“Kokonoe, your dark joke is not funny, you know?”</p>

<p>“It is not that dark joke?”<p>“Don’t you have self-awareness ……”<p>Somehow, the seat behind me was the refreshingly handsome man. And next to him sat Takahashi.<p>“I’m glad to finally be a part of this group. Nice to meet you!”<p>“You’re not gloomy, I decline”<p>“That’s a bit of a stretch, don’t you think……”<p>Takahashi complains about the group, but I’m a loner, yet I’m in a group. I don’t remember making it….<p>After all the chattering and moving, Sayuri Sensei opens her mouth.</p>

<p>“You may be happy, but it’s almost time for the exam. Study hard. Thanks to the three idiots in the homecoming club, I’m in a very awkward position in the staff room. You should feel sorry for me.”<p>“Shakudou, don’t cause trouble for sensei.”<p>“Hihi …… S-she was talking about me…… Sensei, I’m sorry …….”<p>“I’m talking about you, Yukito Kokonoe! Don’t rub it in Shakadou’s face!”<p>“?!”<p>“Stop making a face like you’re out of the loop. Anyway, supplementary examinations are troublesome. You should do your best to avoid them as much as possible.”<p>As I watched Sayuri Sensei leave, I asked the dazzling man behind me.<p>“By the way, idiot No. 2, how is your test going?”</p>

<p>“You never know unless you try, but, well, it’s not a problem, I guess? What about you, idiot No. 1?”<p>“Why am I number one? I can’t embarrass my sister.”<p>“You seem to be having a hard time….”<p>“Y-Yuki!”<p>The familiar face that took the seat next to me had a pitiful expression on her face.<p>“Can you …..teach me?”<p>Kamishiro, a.k.a. Idiot No. 3, was not good at studying.</p><p>“Eh. Today, at the request of No. 3, we are going to hold a study session.”</p>

<p>“I’m Assistant No. 2.”<p>There was a round of applause. Isn’t that funny?<p>“No.3. What’s this all about?”<p>” Uhm,…… I told them I was going to have a study group and they all said they’d join me…….”<p>A crowd of people gathered behind Kamishiro, who was looking very distant. This girl is very popular.<p>“Kokonoe-chan, we will join you. Oh, by the way, I’m No. 4. I’m Kanna-chi’s No. 5</p><p>“It’s so lame! And is that numbering really necessary?”<p>“Eh, so I’m No. 6? If I get a red mark, my advisor will get mad at me.”</p>

<p>“Hihi……, I-I’m No. 7. I’ve never scored more than sixty on a test. ……”<p>“I’m No. 8.”<p>“Stop playing around Suzurikawa. From a feeling point of view, you are No. 7. Sorry Shakadou. Give your place up.”<p>“What’s with the obsession!? It doesn’t matter! Let’s get on with it.”<p>After school, there were quite a few people left in the classroom. There were too many people with too much free time.<p>They were writing questions and answers on the blackboard.<p>“There will be this question on the test, to be honest. Memorize it.”<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>Everyone looked at each other with a blank expression on their faces.<p>“How do you know, Kokonoe?”<p>“Because it’s been on the test for four years in a row. It will probably come up again this year.”<p>Since it appeared last year, it will not appear this year. It is tempting to think so, but in fact that is unlikely. As long as the course scope is fixed, the content required within that scope is also fixed.<p>The fact that the questions are asked every year means that they are of high significance. It is not a test to check the comprehension of a class unless you make up some outlandish question. Past papers are filled with such wisdom and knowledge.<p>“I have a copy of last year’s test from Yuuri-san. Normally, there is a fee for this service, but this is a special grand opening.”<p>A little while ago, Yuuri gave it to me, saying, “It’s almost time for you to take the test. I’ll give you this.”.<p>To put it mildly, she is an angel.</p>

<p>Based on this, I went back and looked up the questions from past years and identified the ones that are always on the test every year.<p>“Woohoo, Kokonoe that’s awesome! Thank you!”<p>“Hihi…… As I thought, a God ……”<p>“Thank you, thank you”<p>“If you see Yuuri from now on, worship her properly. Don’t be disrespectful.”<p>I took this opportunity to lift up my sister. Praise and worship Yuuri-san, all you believers!</p>

<p>“Now, I will explain about the pre-test question hinting that each teacher does before the test—-“<p>“Yuki-sensei! I-I feel like this is not a study session!”<p>What’s the matter with you, No. 3? …… It’s complicated. Kamishiro protests.<p>Before a test, teachers always give hints in class. Recognizing those cues is a very important factor in test-taking strategies, but not from Kamishiro’s point of view, apparently.<p>“………………………Uhm, how come?”<p>“L-Look. A study group is where everyone teaches each other if they don’t understand—–right?”<p>I see. Heh. I chewed and crunched slowly. I looked at the ceiling. There is no particular change.<p>“……………………There’s no question that you need to understand.”</p><p>“So blunt!?”<p>“Uwaan, Kana-chi. I hate Kokonoe-chan!”<p>“Yosh, yosh Miki-chan.”<p>“I guess that’s true, Yukito”<p>Even the assistant, the fresh and good-looking guy, has the same opinion as me? Assistant?<p>“Uwaan. Kana-chi. I hate Mihou too!”<p>“Yosh, yosh. Miki-chan.”<p>“No, Mihou! Don’t let Yuki brainwash you!?”</p><p>“I-I see. Right. When did this happen to me ……”<p>This refreshingly handsome guy totally betrayed me.<p>“Uwaan. Elizabeth. I hate the fresh looking guy!”<p>“Uhm…. I will not do it? And don’t look at me like that, okay?”<p>“After all, we are rivals.”<p>“I don’t know anything about that setting?!”</p>

<p>After all, Elizabeth and I were water and oil. We are natural enemies.<p>“Haa. I knew this would happen. What are you doing? Let’s get started.”<p>Suzurikawa was the one who was in charge of the project. No. 7 was a high achiever.<p>“Can I ask you this question, Suzurikawa?”<p>“Oh, yes. This is…”<p>Suzurikawa was an excellent teacher. Her teaching skills were excellent. However, Kamishiro was reserved and only asked questions to me or my assistant. I was curious, so I secretly asked Elizabeth.<p>“Sakur…… Elizabeth. Are those two not getting along?”<p>“You didn’t hear that, Kokonoe!?　 And you almost said Sakurai, right? Right?”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-132 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>“Kokonoe-chan. that’s not true. Those two are rivals.”<p>“I see. Kind of like me and Sakur …… Elizabeth.”<p>“You’re doing it on purpose, right? Hey, you’re doing it on purpose, right?”<p>The study session ended without a hitch.</p>

p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p>For some reason, I was walking with Kamishiro. The reason was stalking. I’m the victim.<p>We stopped by the park and shot on the clay basketball court that had been set up.<p>I hadn’t felt it in a long time. I missed the feel of the ball.<p>I clench my hand a few times to check it, but it still feels slightly uncomfortable.<p>“It doesn’t really matter. ……”<p>I’ve been running and doing strength training as part of my routine, but mindlessly shooting like this has a relaxing effect on my mind and helps me to organize my thoughts in a smart way. Aerobic exercise is amazing.<p>“Yuki, I’m done with my preparation!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d actually follow me ……”<p>“I’ve been looking forward to it!”<p>Kamishiro is very motivated, but I was in trouble.<p>Perhaps she is trying to relieve the stress that has built up from her unaccustomed brain work. A big smile on her face.<p>Sure, we talked about that before, but didn’t that one mean “I’ll go if I can” Of course, it’s the one I don’t go to. In the first place, today, I am simply distracting myself. I wonder if it’s a good idea to make Kamishiro accompany me in that kind of thing. As I was pondering this for a moment, a voice suddenly called out to me.<p>“Hey, Yukito-kun, it’s been a long time!”<p>“Hyakuma-senpai?”<p>Names were called from the rear. Several people had gathered. All of them were familiar faces to me.<br>The person I called “Hyakuma-senpai” was not a senior at school. He is a member of a street basketball team that often practices on this court and is currently a college student. I met him when I was in junior high school, practicing outside, and since then we have played together from time to time.</p>

:<p>“Did you join the basketball team in high school as well?”<p>“No, I’m a shady person, so I’m a homecoming member. I haven’t been able to come to the club much since I entered the school.”<p>“I see, you are busy, aren’t you? Do you have time today? Let’s have fun!”<p>“Yes, I’d like that.”<p>“Is that cute little girl over there your girlfriend?”<p>“G-Girlfriend….that’s not possible….”<p>“Y-You don’t seem too upset?”<p>Kamishiro put her hands on her cheeks and shook her head reluctantly.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to say. I can’t afford to be misunderstood. Well, it would be safe to tell him that we were classmates. I thought, but my light mouth slipped out. Stupid, stupid, you fool.<p>“Kamishiro is a dog.”<p>“What are you talking about, Yuki?!”<p>“Such a maniac play at that age …”<p>“Y-you got it wrong! Yuki forced me to …… do it—–That’s not what I meant–“<p>“That’s right. Look, Senpai, she doesn’t have a collar on. It’s a stray dog.”<p>“Why are you adding fuel to the fire!? I come with a pedigree from the Kamishiro family!”<p>Ain’t that a dog!</p>

!important}</style></span><p>“We’re classmates, as a matter of fact."</p><p>“You’re still the same, aren’t you?”<p>While Hyakuma was holding back his laughter, Kamishiro protested vehemently. I’m sorry.<p>“Mou! I’m Shiori Kamishiro. I used to play basketball too, and I thought I’d come here today to exercise with Yuki. ……”<p>“Heeh, I see! What a good opportunity, so why don’t you join us, Kamishiro-san? We often practice on this court. I guess you and Yukito-kun are fellow basketball players.”<p>“I see. I’m looking forward to working with you!”<p>“Alright! I am so excited to have a girl. Let’s split into two teams. Let’s keep it light. Yukito-kun and Kamishiro-san, you’re in that team.”<br>Understood.<p>“Roger”</p>

<p>“Yes!”<p>I feel a little uplifted by the fact that I haven’t played against them in a long time. I feel as if I have forgotten these feelings for a long time. This was neither a physical education class nor a club activity. It was a match for the pure purpose of having fun.<p>This feeling is “fun” I was glad that I still had such feelings.<div style=height:100px aria-hidden=true class=wp-block-spacer></div><p>“I am tired. I’m losing strength. ……”<p>“Keep your body cool. Yes, slowly stretch and hold for 10 seconds.”<p>“Ouch, ouch, ouch. You’re so solid in these areas, aren’t you, Yuki?”<p>“I’ve had so many problems with people. I know how to take care of myself.”<p>“Sorry….”</p>

<p>“I was not trying to be dramatic.”<p>Practicing with the seniors was a nice change of pace. I was sweaty from working hard for about an hour.<p>After breaking up with the seniors, we did some cool-down stretching on the spot. As we relaxed our muscles, we could feel them gradually relaxing.<p>“Are you going home like this, Yuki?”<p>“My body needs sugar. A crepe.”</p><p>“Are you going out to eat? I’m going too!”<p>After waiting for the sweat to subside, we walked downtown for about ten minutes and quickly found the restaurant I wanted to go to. I am hesitant to snack before dinner, but the orexin secreted from my brain forms a separate appetite for something sweet.<p>I ordered a crepe with chocolate and caramel, topped with bananas and ice cream. As I was biting into it with a smile on my face, for some reason, Kamishiro, who was standing next to me, was blushing.</p>

<p>“Hey, this kind of thing feels like a date, doesn’t it?”<p>“I don’t want to go on a sweaty date like this.”<p>Of course, I’ve never been on a date before, so I don’t know what it’s like.<p>Perhaps there is such a thing as a sweaty date in the world. My poor imagination could not come up with such a thing. It was the limit of my poor imagination. I am also at the age when I worry about sweaty armpits.<p>We headed home while eating crepes. Kamishiro is moving forward with a slow pace as if she is regretting leaving behind her last breath.<p>I couldn’t leave her behind, so my pace naturally slowed down as if I was being caught.<p>“I didn’t know Yuki had that many acquaintances.”<p>“I’m a loner yet I’m cheeky, aren’t I? Ihihihihihi”</p>

<p>“With a straight face, you don’t look like you’re smiling at all!”<p>“But, well, not everyone knows everything about the other person.”<p>“Right ……. But I want to know more about you! I had a lot of fun today.”<p>Very. It was like we were back in junior high school. I was glad to be with her.<p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve had fun with you, too.”<p>The truth spills out. Kamishiro gasps in surprise.<p>“Then, then, let’s do it again! I’ll be Yuki’s manager!”<p>Somehow, I knew it was going to come to that. It is understandable that Kamishiro is so obsessed with the idea. But there is no point to it. Such a relationship would only be unfortunate for her.</p>

<p>“Kamishiro, it was my choice to do that. As long as you weren’t hurt, that’s all that matters. I’ve said it many times, you don’t have to worry about it.”<p>“I don’t care about that. This is just my selfishness. I want to see Yuki playing again. I want to see you running on the court. I want to see Yuki holding the ball and shooting. This is my selfishness.”<p>“I’ve said it many times, but I have no motivation. I don’t have a goal I want to achieve.”<p>“Then, if you find it, will you do it?”</p><p>“That depends on the time. I am comfortable at home and I am getting used to laziness.”<p>“Me too, in the past I was always involved in club activities, so it’s liberating.”<p>“The seniors are annoying to recruit, but I can understand their desire to draw you in.”<p>I know how much they want to pull her in. There are many people in need. A physique that is well endowed. Athleticism to make the most of it. Athletic talent that would be at the top of any athletic club’s list. Don’t waste your talent by going home.</p>

<p>“—-!”<p>Parting of the ways. Approaching a crossroads. As I was about to take a step forward to get away from the sad look on her face, something bumped into my back.<p>“I don’t feel guilty! I want to be with you. I love Yuki! Why can’t I be with you then?”<p>The hand that is placed on my back conveys body heat.<p>” The confession I made then was not a lie. But it’s different now. I don’t know why I said that. …… My friends made fun of me, I was embarrassed, I was trying to protect myself, I could only see myself. I didn’t understand anything. That falling in love is such a pain–“</p>

<p>“Kamishiro?”<p>“It wasn’t just the injury. Afterwards, too, why didn’t you tell me I was the cause?”<p>Kamishiro, who has moved away from my back, turns in front of me. She takes my right hand and holds it delicately as if it were a piece of jewelry.<p>I’m the one who got injured and betrayed the expectations of those around me, and nothing has changed that.<p>The cause is a trivial detail. There is no need for her to worry about it.<p>“I am grateful to you for protecting me twice. Because Yuki protected me, I am able to do this now. I feel guilty, too. I want to make up for it. But, but more than that, …… I’m in love with you. That is undeniably my true feelings. Can’t you tell by this?”<p>“Your heart rate is elevated because you’ve been exercising—“<p>“I have cooled down. Embrace it.”</p>

<p>Kamishiro’s expression was serious. No room for rebuttal. There is no room for light talk.<br>Her heart was beating like a fast bell. It is not only the hand. At that moment, I realized for the first time that Kamishiro’s body was also trembling. No idea. What should I do? How can I convince her? I couldn’t find the words to say to Kamishiro, who was much, much closer to me than before.<p>“You’ve got cream on you.”<p>“I was wondering when you would notice.”<p>“Too much bruising.”<p>“….I just wanted you to wipe it off.”<p>I gently wipe her cheek with my finger.</p>

<p>“You told me before. Why you started devoting yourself to basketball.”<p>Simply because I was heartbroken. It was such an easy reason.</p>

<p>“Then, why can’t I be your reason this time?”<p>“Kamishiro being my motivation?”<p>“I want you to look at me. Yes. I want to become. I want to be Yuki’s motivation. Because I can’t end it like this. I don’t want it to end.”<p>The strength in Kamishiro’s hands was strong. It was more powerful than I had expected, and it held a strong will.<p>I had not thought that I had forgotten about it, but I remembered. Kamishiro is a gymnastic maiden no matter how far she goes.<p>She should have a place where she belongs.<p>“My motivation will be, all-you-can-do sexual harassment”<p>Saying it myrself like a donkey’s *ss. No excuse for being pointed at as an enemy of women. This is enough to make even Kamishiro give up on me. That’s all I can pray for desperately.</p>

<p>“That’s fine”<p>She should give up on the idea.<p>“If that’s what motivates Yuki.”<p>Please give up on me.<p>“—-Believe me. I love Yuki. I’m not lying. It’s not atonement. It’s my wish.”<p>I grieve to the heavens. Why is it that so many things are not going well?</p><p>I knew that Kamishiro was suffering. That is why she and I should never have met again.<p>The Constitution of Japan stipulates that every human being has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>The best thing for both of us to have done would have been to forget about each other and stay away from each other. Yet, why did it happen?<p>“Love” is a vague feeling. It is an illusion that will eventually cool down. I can no longer remember how I felt when I loved Suzurikawa Besides, my mother is divorced.<p>The divorce rate in Japan is said to be around 35%, but that’s nothing compared to the rate for those who marry with a vow of eternal love. Even if you marry someone with a promise of eternal love, that’s just the way it is. Reality is cruel.</p><p>“Which would you prefer, Yukito?”<p>I was being preyed upon. Apparently, she was going to treat me to a cake.<br>On the way back home, I inadvertently ran into Himiyama, and before I knew it, she was taking me into her house. She smiled at me and asked me to join her, and when I tried to refuse, she gave me a very sad look. As an advocate of “ladies first,” I had no choice.<p>“The Mont Blanc on that side, please.”<p>“Fufu. I’ll have the rare cheesecake, then. I am so happy to see you today.”<p>Himiyama-san’s home had changed since the last time I saw it. The cardboard boxes have been put away and the décor and interior have been completely changed to a more feminine look.</p>

<p>And for some reason, she was sitting next to me again. She sits so that her body is perfectly close to mine. No doubt, she is trying to seduce me! The aroma of the room is slowly weakening my resistance. I can’t …… do anything anymore. ……<p>The era is social distance. My personal space should be three times larger than that of others, but it didn’t matter to Himiyama-san. Rather, I was in close contact with her thighs and so on. Himiyama-san was completely a three-density woman.<p>“Eating alone is boring, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I see”<p>Why was she using a slightly questioning tone? Was it an invitation for me to come and play with you because you were bored? Himiyama-san lacked the awareness that she was a beautiful woman. I had worked up a nice sweat playing basketball with the seniors, but now I was sweating cold sweat.<p>“Sorry, I know, I smell sweaty. I was exercising a little.”<p>“Don’t worry about it. Besides, I don’t dislike it. Students are like that.”<p>She was in a great mood. Does the smell of sweat make you happy? Does she have a fetish for sweat? The situation was getting critical. If I didn’t get out now, I was going to get stuck in a quagmire.</p>

<p>But it’s no good … it’s moving …<p>Mom is beautiful, but so is Himiyama-san. Even with 8K resolution, there is not a single blemish. She is at the forefront of the times. Beautiful people will always remain beautiful. It’s unfair, isn’t it?<p>When my mother came to visit my class a long time ago, she was so beautiful that I couldn’t make eye contact with her at all. There were many other parents there, but no matter how I looked at it, she was the most beautiful one. I felt strangely embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t turn around and just looked straight ahead at the blackboard.<p>Mom was sweet to me. I didn’t want to bother her. She bought me all sorts of things even though it wasn’t my birthday or Christmas. Thanks to her, I have never wanted anything in particular.<p>“Yukito, would you like to have dinner with me?”<p>“I-I’m sorry, but unfortunately, I can’t do that. My mother has prepared something for me.”</p>

<p>“I see. Unfortunate. I know, it was sudden, so it can’t be helped. Can I invite you again next time? Will you come then?”<p>“Yes.”<p>The answer is no. But I am Japanese, so I couldn’t say no in this situation.<br>Incidentally, my mother has been working from home, which means she spends much more time at home, so she cooks dinner for me. Until then, I had been the main cook, and my cooking skills had been improving rapidly, but I’m sorry to say that I have fewer opportunities to show off my cooking skills these days.<p>“What’s troubling you, Yukito? You look so troubled.”<p>“Come to think of it, Himiyama-san, you used to have a fiancée, right?”<p>“I’m devoted to Yukito now.”<p>“I dug a grave. …..”<p>“I’ll bury you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I know this is extremely rude and may offend you, but I wanted to ask you what you think about your fiancée now.”<p>“Ara ara, you care about me?<p>I wonder what it means to “like” someone. My mother is divorced.”<p>“Is there someone you like? Or did she confess her love to you? Wait a minute.”<p>Himiyama-san walked from the living room to the bedroom. The door closes, and after about five minutes with a rustling sound, Himiyama-san comes out. I involuntarily choke on my Mont Blanc.<p>“How do you like it? I’m so old and embarrassed.”<p>“W-Why are you playing such trick……?”<p>“By your reaction, it seems that you’re ‘not ready’ yet.”</p>

<p>“Hii!”<p>Himiyama-san came out of his bedroom wearing clothes that would kill me. No matter how patient my mentality is, like the agave that blooms only once every sixty years, there is a limit.<p>“Funn. I secretly bought it. Does it look good on me?”<p>“I-it looks good on you. It’s so good on you. It has almost collapse my reasoning.”<p>“Are you going to collapse?”<p>She whispers in my ear. Like a rock being mined by a boring machine, the mental barriers are being chipped away. Uoooooooooo banishing evil spirits. Dispel evil spirits! It was the vexation that was to be dispersed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, please let me go, please!”<p>I had no choice but to beg with a lowered head. My veins were dying out.<p>“Well, are you feeling better?”<p>“I’ll refrain from commenting.”<p>I look down. No. No matter what I do, it will only be a comment on the bottom of my voice.<p>“I used to like you. But there were things I couldn’t control, things I couldn’t fill with just liking him. We had to break up. That’s all.”<p>“Did the feelings ever go away?”<p>“I guess I gave up on it. So, apart from feelings, there is nothing left but the fact that I used to like him. I think that’s the way it is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand.”<p>“There are some feelings that will always remain with you. The feelings of hurting someone do not go away.”<p>Himiyama-san patted me on the head. Her eyes were somewhat compassionate, yet sad at the same time. I don’t know Himiyama-san well enough to ask her what it was.<p>“I don’t think you have to think too hard about it. At least while you are a student, I think you are allowed to do so. No one will judge you if you freely put your feelings first.”</p><p>“I wonder if there is something like that in me. ……”<p>Himiyama-san sees me off with regret on my way home. I’m sure she’s a good person, but the distance between us is so broken. She definitely likes me, doesn’t she? I should say to myself, “It’s hard being a popular guy,” but I was the one who had never had a girlfriend in my life.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Mother PoV]</b>

<p>My son was a little late getting home. He told me that he was visiting Himiyama at her home. Apparently, he was invited. It seems like nothing more than a friendly neighborhood encounter, but I feel it is something more than that. He has bad luck with women. He is unstable and has some kind of danger. It was my fault.</p>

<p>I can’t regret it enough. A child’s character is formed in childhood. I wonder how much love I had given them at that time. When I realized it, it was too late. I was naive because he was my second child.<p>“Mommy, today…”<p>“I’m sorry. It’s late tonight, so I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”<p>“Yes.”<p>He was trying to tell me something. He was desperately trying to spell out the words.<p>“Today…”<p>“I’m going to be late today, so will you eat dinner with your sister first?”<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The fact that I was busy with work and it was an important time for me to get back on track was just an excuse. As I kept repeating such things, I realized that he had stopped talking to me about anything. I even foolishly mistook it for growth.<p>And part of it was that she was taking advantage of Yuuri’s role as his big sister. Mothers and sisters have different roles. I had forgotten that I could never take her place. Yuuri was still a child. As a result, Yuuri reached her limit and overflowed.<p>And then the incident happened. After that, Yukito was like a different person. Something was missing. Since then, I began to feel insecure about my ability to treat him properly. I don’t feel that any of my feelings or words are being conveyed correctly to my son. I feel as if his eyes are rejecting me.</p><p>On birthdays and Christmas, children usually beg their parents to give them something they want. Yuuri also used to say that she wanted something. However, Yukito has never asked me for anything. He even forgot his own birthday. He had no interest in himself. He despises himself. He feels he is not needed.<p>I was afraid of that, so I bought him things that he seemed to want at any given moment.<p>But what I really should have done was not that. I knew that.<br>When I went to visit the class, I froze. While the other kids turned their backs in embarrassment and looked at their mothers as they conversed, Yukito did not give me a second glance, but only looked ahead. No conversation took place until I spoke to him. Perhaps he thought that I was not there anyway.<p>My sister Sekka was furious with me for being such a bad influence, and she angrily told me that she would take my son away from me. We had an argument, but Sekka’s argument was the most plausible, and I could not refute the fact that I had neglected child-rearing and had not given him enough love. And the child had to live under the care of Sekka for a month. Since then, Sekka has been very concerned about Yukito. Or perhaps she cares too much. Anyway, she is always attached to him and loves him like a cat. Her eyes are also dangerous.<p>I can’t help but feel that Himiyama-san is just like my sister. It may be too late. But still, I must face my son properly once again. Since I now work from home, I have much more time to spend with my son. I cannot waste this opportunity. No matter how late it is, no matter how much I can no longer communicate with him, as his mother, I cannot pass up the chance to give him my love. No matter how late it may be.</p>

<p>I feel a strange rivalry with Himiyama-san. I am his mother. That is the one thing I will not compromise. A sense of frustration and possessiveness wells up in my heart.<p>“Why don’t we take a bath together once in a while?”<p>While my son is bathing, I intrude to wash his back. When was the last time we took a bath together like this? I wash his head. I wash his back. Aah, I can’t believe that just by doing that, I can feel so much love for him—<p>“My resting place is not even at home!?”</p><p>Ara, what’s wrong? My son’s scream echoed in the bathroom.</p>
