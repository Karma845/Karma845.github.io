<h2>Chapter 4: Red Summer Wish</h2>

<p>I wake up before the alarm clock, with the sound of &#8220;chun chun chun&#8221; and the morning sun as my background music.</p>



<p>I sit up abruptly, still in a daze from sleep, and gaze blankly at the wall.</p>



<p>On the cream-colored wall, there are posters of my mom and sister. Mom&#8217;s poster is a B1-size, and my sister&#8217;s poster has a summer-themed polka dot collage. Seeing them in their swimsuits gives me a sense of summer vibes, but there&#8217;s something special about these posters. When you overlay the special polka dot sheets, she appears naked. It&#8217;s an incredible and ridiculously unnecessary effort.</p>



<p>Muni. Huh? I feel a soft sensation in my hand. It&#8217;s an enchanting touch. It weakens my resistance and makes me helpless. Muni muni.</p>



<p>Still half asleep, I can&#8217;t resist the allure of the memory foam-like feeling, so I indulge myself and caress it. Muni muni muni muni muni.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm… not there… stop it…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is she here!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Startled, I quickly turn around to see my mom in her negligee, sleeping peacefully next to me.</p>



<p>I instantly snap out of my drowsiness. It&#8217;s the 11th time breaking my record for the shortest time awake. I have absolutely no intention of reflecting on it.</p>



<p>I recall that she said she would sleep in her own room last night. However, this is also the usual situation.</p>



<p>I suspect that my mom might actually be sick. Despite the b****t cancer scare being cleared, she often goes to the bathroom at night and then ends up mistaking her room for mine. It could be sleepwalking.</p>



<p>I am Yukito Kokonoe, a man who never doubts his family. I take everything they say at face value.</p>



<p>Concerned, I ask if everything is alright, but she always evades the question. Is it really that serious…?</p>



<p>Today is a weekday, and I have to go to school. If I stay like this, I might end up falling back asleep, using my mom&#8217;s memory foam as a pillow. I get out of bed, trying not to wake her up.</p>



<p>By the way, I remember that I created a social media account but haven&#8217;t posted anything yet. Unlike Goddess-senpai, I don&#8217;t have much enthusiasm for seeking approval or self-display, but when I do want to post something, I can&#8217;t think of what to share.</p>



<p>Should I just post about my daily life? But even if I tweet about my daily life, who would find it interesting?</p>



<p>Ah, of course! It&#8217;s too much trouble, so let&#8217;s just do this. Tap, tap. &#8216;If it were my mom, she would be sleeping next to me.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>My attention is caught by a DM that piques my curiosity. I thought it might be a prank, but it&#8217;s from an official account, so that&#8217;s unlikely.</p>



<p>The content is surprising and astonishing, but what should I do? My uncooperative brain can&#8217;t make a judgment. I&#8217;ll consult with someone later.</p>



<p>Well, time to make breakfast.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>During the morning break, for some reason, I found myself being approached by two of Yuri-san&#8217;s friends.</p>



<p>By the way, the morning post I made received an overwhelming response, but I ignored it since it didn&#8217;t really matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, lately Yuri seems down or absent-minded. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s not fully present during classes or break time. Little brother, do you have any idea why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;ve noticed it too. She&#8217;s been acting strange at home as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We thought maybe you were the cause since it&#8217;s Yuri we&#8217;re talking about&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Strange, how is Yuri at home?&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike their usual teasing and playful demeanor, the seniors genuinely seemed concerned about Yuri-san.</p>



<p>Trying to find the cause, I delved into my memories.</p>



<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t hang around my room as often anymore, she stopped measuring, and she doesn&#8217;t accidentally enter the bathroom anymore. But she&#8217;s not angry or in a bad mood either. Hmm, it&#8217;s just&#8230; normal, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hey, isn&#8217;t that abnormal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, Yuri-san wouldn&#8217;t do something like being a normal older sister, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Argh! I can&#8217;t argue with that!&#8221;</p>



<p>The seniors seemed frustrated, but objectively speaking, the relationship between Yuri-san and me had become more normal.</p>



<p>It felt like the distance between us had become that of regular siblings. However, there was an indescribable discomfort. It bothered me that Nee-san had been somewhat secluding herself in her room.</p>


<p>Even today, we went to school separately, and we haven&#8217;t seen each other once since the morning.</p>



<p>This was something unprecedented. Yuri-san used to make it a daily routine to check on me and my well-being.</p>



<p>Perhaps I did something that bothered her and she was avoiding me, but whenever we did talk, she treated me even more kindly than before. I couldn&#8217;t understand what she was struggling with. Even Mom said that Yuri-san was suffering. Yuri-san was different from me. She should be happy. She shouldn&#8217;t be unhappy.</p>



<p>&#8220;If little brother doesn&#8217;t know either, then I guess there&#8217;s nothing that we do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Probably, or rather, it&#8217;s definitely related to you, little brother. Please be concerned about her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Somehow, I was reminiscing about the past. When we were younger, I always followed my older sister around.</p>



<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been disliked and haven&#8217;t tried to get to know her. I kept my distance.</p>



<p>But now&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll definitely do something. Because Yuri-san is&#8230; an important family member.&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave Yuri to you&#8230; but I also have something to consult about, is that okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Ichiyou-senpai, who had been acting timidly until just now, began to fidget and hesitantly opened their mouth.</p>



<p> When I asked for their names, they introduced themselves as Sera-senpai and Ichiyou-senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;For a love consultation&#8230; I have feelings for Saki Kuma from Class D.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not just to me, but why would you come to me for love advice?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I mean little brother. You&#8217;re like the god of love, the &#8216;Hero.&#8217; It&#8217;s thanks to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a must to consult with you, little brother, at this school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No wonder I keep getting consulted.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, I had gained a divine status. The &#8216;Hero&#8217; referred to Hot-blooded Senpai.</p>



<p>The whole story of how I expelled a hot-blooded senior member from the basketball club was uploaded on video by someone. The video was uploaded by someone. The hot-blooded Senpai, who defeated me dressed as a bunny man and succeeded in publicly confessing his love to her in full view of the public, was called a &#8220;Hero&#8221; because of his courage, and his fame seems to have spread to high school students all over Japan.</p>



<p>Although the basketball club lost in the fourth round, he was considered a winner in love. How annoying!</p>



<p>&#8220;Not only the &#8216;Hero&#8217; but also Sōu-senpai and the first-year &#8216;Minstrel&#8217;&#8230; they&#8217;re all your doing, little brother. You&#8217;re famous as the Cupid of love within the school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When did this world turn into a fantasy?&#8221;</p>



<p>In this world, there are too many goddesses, angels, and holy mothers, don&#8217;t you think? Soon, a saint might appear.</p>



<p>Because of these circumstances, I often receive love consultations, despite being someone who has never had a girlfriend.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>With numerous love consultations being brought to me, I inevitably became acquainted with intricate human relationships. A complex and bizarre network of interpersonal connections gathered around me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even Saki Kuma Senpai approached me for love advice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…No way! Saki Kuma? But, I thought he had no interest in love or anything like that…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, little brother. Congratulations, does that mean…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ichiyou Senpai, that&#8217;s great for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You did it, Mayu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah! So, Saki Kuma actually… I can&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sera Senpai clapped her hands in delight. Due to Ichiyou Senpai being friends with my sister, Saki Kuma Senpai approached me for advice, and it was surprisingly resolved quite easily.</p>



<p>This will only further enhance my reputation. Gahahaha!</p>



<p>&#8220;But from here on, it depends on you, senpai.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Of course! Thanks for your help, little brother! It&#8217;s like a dream… I still can&#8217;t believe it. I want to show my gratitude somehow. Since I&#8217;ve entrusted you with Yuri&#8217;s matter, how about letting I let you touch me for a bit? Or maybe Kaoru&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Mayu, don&#8217;t sacrifice me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please stop. Can you listen, Senpai? If you genuinely like someone, you should avoid actions that might lead to misunderstandings. Things like buying presents together for the opposite sex as a surprise, testing their feelings, or pretending to feel something you don&#8217;t—these tend to set off bad ending flags in this world. So please, treasure yourself and your partner.&#8221;</p>



<p>I earnestly explained to Senpai, not in a sermon-like manner but through reasoning. Ichiyou Senpai&#8217;s eyes gradually lost their sparkle.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was my fault. Oh, Master, I sincerely apologize.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Happiness is always right in front of you. Be true to yourself, and the path will open.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mayu, it feels like you&#8217;ve been brainwashed, Mayu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it, Kaoru. Master would never do such a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And please continue to be good friends with Yuri from now on. Let&#8217;s consider that as your gratitude.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yes, Master. Yuri and I will be friends forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to smooth things over, but this is definitely dangerous! You won&#8217;t accept any offerings, right? Is this what the Love Fulfillment God is like? It&#8217;s not what I expected, and don&#8217;t brainwash Mayu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That kind of brainwashing wouldn&#8217;t have made him a hero.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Himura-senpai has been brainwashed!? That isn’t romantic at all!”</p>



<p>With the love consultations resolved without a hitch, the break time passed by.</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, Yuri, are you going to participate in the forest school?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a boy, so I won&#8217;t go. I&#8217;m not into outdoor activities.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Yuri seems more like an indoor person.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But more importantly, what&#8217;s wrong with this kid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She was sort of brainwashed against her will…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Brainwashed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-san, let&#8217;s have lunch together!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a bang, I swung open the classroom door. Surprised gazes turned towards me. Peace, peace.<br>Who cares if it&#8217;s the seniors&#8217; classroom? It has nothing to do with me!</p>




<p>Come to think of it, I hardly know anything about Yuri-san. If you want to shoot for the target, first shoot the horse.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s something troubling her, if I want to help her, it&#8217;s crucial to get to know Yuri-san.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t enter the tiger&#8217;s den, you won&#8217;t catch its cub. If you have time to hesitate, you should jump into the other person&#8217;s arms.</p>



<p>So, during lunch break, I came to my sister&#8217;s classroom to have lunch together.</p>



<p>My sister was sitting side by side with the two who had come for advice in the morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………………………………………Ha?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri-san looked dumbfounded. Her usual sharpness was nowhere to be found.</p>



<p>I dashed forward to catch the chopsticks that were about to fall from her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already taken action, little brother? You&#8217;re quick when it comes to these things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kyoso-sama-! Over here, over here.&#8221; [Kyoso = Founder of a religious sect]</p>



<p>Ichiyou-senpai prepared a seat for me and beckoned me over.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha-wha-wha-why are you, you, you, you, here, here, here, here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought we could have lunch together. Here, mineral water.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>I handed her the purchased bottle, and she casually opened the cap and spilled it all over her head.</p>



<p>At first glance, she seemed normal, but her sudden strange behavior was clear evidence of her agitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-san, water is meant to be drunk.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course it is. It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t taken a sip, and you&#8217;re completely soaked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well… this is a dream, right? Because it doesn&#8217;t hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister pinched her own cheek. Not satisfied with the damage, she started punching her own face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri, calm down! Mayu, stop her!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou! Kyoso-sama will be sad. Yuri, wake up. This is reality.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t… hurt. It throbs, but it&#8217;s not pain. Yukito inviting me out, there&#8217;s no way that would happen. Is this a dream? Maybe a parallel world?… The future I didn&#8217;t make a mistake about? Or a metaverse? Or a multi-verse, omega-verse, backscreen combo…&#8221;</p>



<p>Muttering mysterious incantations, my sister&#8217;s focus is off. That verse is probably wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-san, can I come into your embrace?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>




<p>For some reason, I&#8217;m seated on my sister&#8217;s lap. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a marsupial kangaroo to fit into someone&#8217;s embrace. But I&#8217;m happy, so I&#8217;ll just sit here quietly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I never thought Yuri would be such a mess…&#8221;</p>



<p>Sera-senpai is astonished. I agree completely, but my mission is to find out Yuri-san&#8217;s troubles. It&#8217;s painful to see my sister so down.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Onee-san, when are you taking me shopping? I&#8217;ve been waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mayu, Kaoru, I&#8217;m leaving early. Take care of things here.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a clatter, my sister picks up her bag and stands up. I, who was sitting on her lap, also stand up involuntarily.</p>



<p>&#8220;You… were looking forward to it? The promise we made before. I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t forget. Well then, shall we go?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, Yuri. How about after school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have a problem with that, huh?!&#8221;</p>



<p>She has such a foul mouth. It took about five minutes for my aggressive sister to calm down.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;ve calmed down a bit. What&#8217;s the matter, Yukito, all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister, who has finally calmed down and can understand words, asks anxiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lately, Onee-san, you haven&#8217;t been coming to my classroom, so I&#8217;ve been lonely. I couldn&#8217;t even see you this morning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ll come during the break every time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still not calm at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thoughtful Sera-senpai. The three of us are having lunch together, but just before I came to my sister&#8217;s classroom, I casually informed Saki Kuma-senpai that she had feelings for him, and as a result, Ichiyou-senpai was invited to lunch by Saki Kuma-senpai and hurriedly left. I feel like my level of faith in me has increased even more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right, Onee-san, do you like outdoor activities? Let&#8217;s go on a day trip camping together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love it. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a day trip.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m underage, so that might be difficult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Little brother, don&#8217;t trust this girl! She&#8217;s a troublemaker and a lia!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your problem?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And you have a foul mouth.&#8221;</p>



<p>I learned authentic BBQ from the American father, so it might be a good idea to polish my camping skills before summer vacation. I never know when a dungeon might appear on this Earth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whatever you want to do, I&#8217;ll make it happen for you. &#8212;-Tell me now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, those eyes. The eyes of my sad sister. The true feelings behind her words.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m here because I want to know that. I&#8217;ll save her, for sure.</p>


<p>If I&#8217;m the cause, if I&#8217;m the reason, in this world full of enemies, I won&#8217;t let my precious family, who has always been there as a companion, become unhappy.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I want to do? I want to get to know Onee-san better.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was my sincere and honest answer.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&#8220;Ara, is that motif your sister?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. How do you think? Does it resemble Yuri-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really beautiful, but why your sister?&#8221;</p>



<p>After school, I joined the art club as a temporary member. It was a limited-time trial membership.</p>



<p>With the summer tournament over and the seniors retiring, the basketball club has reached a lull. For now, we are focusing on preparing for the Winter Cup, but it has become a period of self-practice where we calmly go through the daily training menu. Since there isn&#8217;t much to do, Shiori is temporarily assigned to the girls&#8217; basketball team.</p>



<p>In the first place, the boys&#8217; basketball team, which still has few members, doesn&#8217;t really need a manager. The sports clubs are the ones who truly need Shiori. She was concerned, but when I told her that I would be joining the art club for a while, she understood. I hope Shiori can continue to give her best in a club activity where she can fully utilize her abilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;I caused a lot of pain to my sister.&#8221;</p>



<p>Painting is a solitary activity. But strangely, it doesn&#8217;t feel burdensome. I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to it before, but perhaps I&#8217;m suited for diligent work.</p>



<p>Noticing my demeanor, Sanjoji-sensei, the art club advisor, called out to me. I must have been deeply focused because it was almost time to go home. The other club members had already left.</p>



<p>In the quiet art room, I simply faced the canvas with a clear mind.</p>



<p>I chose my sister as the motif for the painting to be exhibited in the art competition, but this painting is nothing more than my imagination. I was uncertain if it resembled my sister, but Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s words brought me relief. When asked why, I couldn&#8217;t find the words. Perhaps I should consult with Sanjoji-sensei about it.</p>



<p>This is a change. The old me would never have opened up like this or sought a solution on my own. But now I know. I&#8217;m receiving kindness from others.</p>



<p>There are plenty of people who are not like that, who are enemies, but there are also many who are on my side. They will help me when I&#8217;m in trouble. It&#8217;s not wrong to rely on them.</p>



<p>Hinagi has also grown. I&#8217;ve learned to rely on others. I shared with Sanjoji-sensei what happened between my sister and me in the past. I didn&#8217;t expect any answers. I just wanted someone to listen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why…Higu&#8230;. how…Biki&#8230;. can you be so kind?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei burst into tears. I hurriedly handed her a handkerchief.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you… I&#8217;ve always had a weak spot for tears, embarrassing as it may be. Even as an adult, I easily cry while watching movies and such… I&#8217;ve been holding back, but it was too much. I&#8217;ll wash the handkerchief and return it later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not necessary. We can just wash it together.&#8221;</p>



<p>I hastily handed it to her, but I&#8217;m sure Sanjoji-sensei also has a handkerchief or two.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve been a burden to my sister all this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just my sister&#8217;s life. I now realize that it even distorted my own personality.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding my sister&#8217;s suffering by looking away. I didn&#8217;t try to understand.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true! Your kindness must have saved your sister as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The people around me have taught me kindness, I want to give it back. It&#8217;s mutually beneficial.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not about beautiful ideals. One-sidedness won&#8217;t work. Selfless devotion will eventually wear thin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, of course, that includes you too, sensei. Thank you for always being kind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve your gratitude… Why, why now… You&#8217;ve always had kindness since back then, yet I…!&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei covers her face with both hands and continues to cry. Maybe there&#8217;s something that weighs on her as well. There are only a few teachers whom I truly respect. There should be many students who have been saved by Sanjoji-sensei.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re my teacher, Sanjoji-sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Please don&#8217;t make me cry anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was unjustly scolded. Hopeless… Oh, by the way, I almost forgot.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, sensei, about that matter…&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;…Please don&#8217;t make me cry anymore!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve stirred up a hornet&#8217;s nest. I can&#8217;t help it, so I decide to wait patiently while making small talk until she stops crying.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahem. I apologize for showing you such an unsightly side of me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I never expected that you had a past of seeking pen pals through a submission magazine…&#8221;</p>



<p>In this day and age, it&#8217;s easy to have interactive conversations through phone calls and chats, but in the past, even when going out to meet someone, they had to specify a meeting place in advance, or they wouldn&#8217;t be able to find each other.</p>



<p>Moreover, with pen pals, it would take a minimum of three days to receive a reply. The generation from the Showa and Heisei eras is amazing!</p>



<p>&#8220;Please keep it a secret, it&#8217;s confidential… By the way, I think it might be better not to submit this painting to the art competition.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The value of this painting can only be understood by you and your sister. It&#8217;s not something that can be objectively evaluated by others. Even after hearing your story, it&#8217;s beyond my comprehension. It&#8217;s a very beautiful painting directed at a single individual, not for the masses… This is your ideal, isn&#8217;t it? You probably want to keep it a secret from your sister. So why not take it home and display it once it&#8217;s completed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see… I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope she&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The canvas is still blank in its preliminary stage. It will take time to add colors and complete it.</p>



<p>By then, I&#8217;ll somehow find a way to solve my sister&#8217;s troubles. I clench my fist with renewed determination.</p>



<p>&#8220;And by the way, I hope you&#8217;re not just all talk when it comes to that matter. Please stop teasing and mocking. I know. Even I, as a teacher, am called a backward old lady behind my back by the students. It&#8217;s not like I enjoy being behind. I&#8217;m serious about it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really diligent, sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>Who the heck would say such terrible things! But don&#8217;t worry, sensei. I&#8217;m serious about it!</p>



<p>As we prepare to leave, we discuss the matter at hand.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>&#8220;It happened just last week. In the sultry late night, I suddenly woke up feeling suffocated, and my whole body was paralyzed. I couldn&#8217;t move a muscle. I heard a strange noise, like a faint whisper, right next to my ear. And then, I thought I heard footsteps coming from beyond the door, but the sound stopped abruptly right outside my room… <em>click</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gulp. So what happened next, Kokonoe-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mineda leans forward. Ghost stories are an essential part of summer.</p>



<p>To enjoy a moment of coolness in the humid summer, we decided to share ghost stories during our break time. However, for some reason, Hinagi-chan sighs heavily.</p>



<p>Maintaining an eerie atmosphere, the conversation between the storyteller, I, Yukito Kokonoe, and the others continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then, the door creaked open, and a long-haired woman entered the room, right before my eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mineda-san, don&#8217;t take it seriously. Since it&#8217;s Yukito, he&#8217;s probably just experiencing sleep paralysis, being unable to move because his mom is hugging him next to him, and the person entering the room is probably Yuri-san. It&#8217;s obvious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil the punchline. That&#8217;s against the rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In a way, it was scarier than a ghost story.&#8221;</p>




<p>Even the spotlight on their faces seems perplexed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then how about this story? It&#8217;s an episode from when I went to Kyoto with Sekka-san in the past. While I was exploring the streets of Kyoto, away from Sekka-san, I saw a girl walking alone who looked like a Japanese doll. I was going to pass by without paying much attention, but it seemed that the girl was in trouble. When I asked her, she said she was lost. Reluctantly, I decided to help her find her guardian.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa…&#8221;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with that suspicious look from Hinagi-chan!?</p>



<p>&#8220;And then, a woman who came from the other side suddenly shouted that you were a kidnapper, and you ended up being taken to the police&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is the direction of fear is different for you! What&#8217;s scary about that? It&#8217;s not even a ghost story!?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a chilling and frightening experience I had in Kyoto, the first time I went there…</p>



<p>&#8220;We were mistaken to have expectations from Yukito. Besides, this guy wouldn&#8217;t be scared by ghost stories.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was an unpleasant sense of trust. Ghosts are scary… probably.</p>




<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s really hot every day, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mineda flutters a fan. The weather forecast shows a bright red. It has been scorching hot for days.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re accumulating fatigue due to the constant dangerous heat. It&#8217;s hard to muster any motivation in this condition.</p>



<p>However, I have a secret plan to deal with this heat.</p>



<p>While going shopping with my sister, I&#8217;m planning to introduce something that I&#8217;ve been interested in for a long time. The day is near when this idea to revolutionize schools will become the standard.</p>



<p>Call me the inventor Yukito Kokonoe. I&#8217;m looking forward to it. Fuhahahaha!</p>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, was it the one with the fan? Is it okay to attach that to the school uniform?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;First, I want to experiment and see if it&#8217;s really cooling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it noisy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s better than the heat. By the way, what did you come to buy today?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was troubled with heat countermeasures, and I noticed the clothes that workers wear at construction sites and such.</p>



<p>It should be applicable to school uniforms as well. Its name is the &#8220;Air-conditioned Uniform.&#8221; If it&#8217;s only used during the summer, it won&#8217;t be used more than fifty times in a year. Lithium-ion batteries can be recharged hundreds of times. So even considering the battery&#8217;s lifespan, it should last for three years. It will also contribute to saving electricity costs by using it alongside an air conditioner.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful idea that benefits everyone. Let&#8217;s push it on the principal.</p>



<p>As I board the train and extend my journey to the bustling town, the population density changes drastically. For now, I&#8217;ll put the air-conditioned uniform on hold. I accepted my sister&#8217;s invitation to go shopping without hesitation, but I want her to let me handle at least carrying the bags. I was asked by my mother and my sister&#8217;s friends as well. I&#8217;ll do my best to resolve the troubles my sister is facing during this precious opportunity.</p>



<p>Alright, let&#8217;s do my best! Ei-ei-oh!</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you. Underwear.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I remembered that I had to push BAD to the distributor of the annoying video, so I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do that later. Now, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want toooooo! Let me go, let me goooooooooooooooo.</p>





<p>&#8220;These underwear will suit that woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to have fun?&#8221;</p>



<p>With a thud, I place my wallet on the cash counter, attempting to delegate the task to the saleswoman, but unfortunately failing. This is an uncharted territory, a lingerie shop. It&#8217;s a restricted area for boys. Even exploration teams are not allowed.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t stay in a place like this. I&#8217;m going home! (Flag of death)</p>



<p>&#8220;Full cup, longline… 1/2… Heh, there are so many types.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can choose the one you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>The color variations were abundant, and there was a wide range of vibrant options. It was a completely different culture from men&#8217;s underwear, where they usually only care about the size.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you say that… I have no idea what to choose when someone asks me for recommendations without knowing anything about their preferences. It&#8217;s difficult to decide what to pick, especially when dealing with insensitive people like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah, there are people like that. And then they might criticize or say the recommended item didn&#8217;t suit them. It&#8217;s so annoying and the worst. If that&#8217;s the case, they should find it themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Do you really want to know so much about me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With so many options, I&#8217;m too ignorant to make a choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>If I end up choosing poorly and getting underwear that doesn&#8217;t fit, it would be unbearable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, then let&#8217;s go to the fitting room. I&#8217;ll tell you every detail, from the underwear I&#8217;m currently wearing to every nook and cranny.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really need to know that much—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even the animal encyclopedia or monster encyclopedia you often read has detailed information, right? Then you should also know my details. Make a note in your &#8216;Yuri Encyclopedia.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Indian elephants can be defeated in ten seconds. Special Attack ◎ Excellent against younger brothers, dealing quadruple damage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where does such strength come from in those skinny arms of yours!? Store clerk, help—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Take your time.&#8221;</p>



<p>I waved my hand at the salesperson with a sales smile, but resistance was futile, and I was dragged into the fitting room.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the completion rate of the &#8220;Yuri Encyclopedia&#8221; exceeded 80%.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve become more knowledgeable, let&#8217;s choose right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For now, how about choosing a size different from the underwear you&#8217;re currently wearing?&#8221;</p>


<p>That would be the safest choice for now. After that, it&#8217;s up to Yuri-san whether she wants to try other options.</p>



<p>&#8220;What, you want sexy lingerie that much? Well, I guess there&#8217;s no helping it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, is this some kind of conversation with a fictional me?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was suddenly unable to communicate, and I looked puzzled, but Yuri-san&#8217;s unstoppable rampage erupted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? A black babydoll? The lace is lovely, but this string is just too much. Wait, this is a bit too… It&#8217;s see-through, and you can almost see my entire butt. It can&#8217;t hide anything in the front… Alright, alright, stop making that disappointed face. It&#8217;s embarrassing, but I&#8217;ll wear it properly. You&#8217;re such an incorrigible kid. Look forward to tonight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, uh… Oi, Yuri-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be happy if it had a front clasp, right? I see, you&#8217;d be happy. Then let&#8217;s buy this too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The conversation finally started even though I didn&#8217;t say anything!?&#8221; </p>



<p>A new ghost story of midsummer was born. It&#8217;s seriously scary.</p>



<p>I continued looking at the underwear with my sister. Different sizes, daring garter lingerie, inexplicable body stockings, longline bras, bustiers, night bras, and more, my sister and the imaginary me kept choosing one after another. This sense of alienation, could it be that the fake one is me…?</p>



<p>However, my sister seems to be enjoying it in some way. Maybe shopping is a way for her to relieve stress. Well, there&#8217;s no other choice, I&#8217;ll make the imaginary me do its best.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew. We bought a lot, didn&#8217;t we? Eh, are you looking forward to it too? Fufu, I&#8217;ll make sure you&#8217;re satisfied.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe we should exorcise it first?&#8221;</p>



<p>I feel like the imaginary me is about to say something outrageous, and I&#8217;m feeling a sense of crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;What, I don&#8217;t mean to seduce you… Mou! Yes, I admit it. I was thinking of seducing you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa! Evil spirits begone, evil spirits begone!&#8221;</p>



<p>I desperately try to purify the place at the lingerie shop.</p>






<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they come closer to me?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because your expression looks scary, and the atmosphere is tense?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have a straight face.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister and I are at a cat cafe. If you want to quickly gain popularity, there&#8217;s nothing like some fluffy cuddles.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hugely popular on video-sharing sites, and if you get reincarnated in another world, beastmen and Fenrils are a must.</p>



<p>I was hoping that the healing effect of the cats would comfort my sister, but for some reason, only I&#8217;m being swarmed by cats. Feeling a bit lonely, I put one cat on my sister&#8217;s lap.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nyan (Humans, always trying to please… This is also work…)&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nyan (Ora, play with me! Pay more attention to me!)&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nyaaaaa~ (I&#8217;ll give you the right to pet me).&#8221;</p>



<p>Thanks to the cat resting on my head, my head feels pleasantly warm. Can you move a bit?</p>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really cute when you look at it like this&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister gently strokes the cat with a kind look in her eyes. This is where the fluffiness of cats shines.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wanna try keeping one as a pet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough for only you to be doted on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What the heck… Am I just a pet in the Kokonoe household…&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a shocking revelation, but considering the hierarchy in our house, it might be appropriate. Unfortunately, I have no complaints about my current treatment. I&#8217;ve been too well-trained.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s normal to be a beloved pet animal, but being a beloved pet human is a whole different level of darkness. It&#8217;s as black as a human farm.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Onee-san, do you have any worries or troubles?&#8221;</p>



<p>This is not the time to be falling into darkness. The real target is here.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Why are you poking your nose into everything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt like you were troubled.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister&#8217;s gaze wanders in the empty space. She seems about to say something but quickly withdraws.</p>



<p>Is she hesitating? Or does she not want to show her vulnerability to her younger brother?</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m sorry for worrying you. But I&#8217;m okay, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;――Are you sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>I peer into her eyes as if trying to see through her true intentions. I, who have kept my distance from my sister until now, cannot fathom the complexity of her inner feelings. I feel like I&#8217;m being drawn into those obsidian-like eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, you don&#8217;t need to worry about anything. Your wishes are my wishes… .&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My wishes? All I want is for Yuri-san to get better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. You&#8217;re such a kind child… even to someone like me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her cool hand touches my cheek. Her expression looks ephemeral, as if it might disappear.</p>



<p>Gently, I hold onto that hand. Thanks to the cat, my hand feels warm.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to summer vacation. Let&#8217;s play a lot together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I bought this because they were having a local product exhibition from Okayama Prefecture. Let&#8217;s eat it together later.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not my intention to corner my bewildered sister. Even if she doesn&#8217;t talk now, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. To aim for that someday, it&#8217;s crucial to get along better with my sister first.</p>



<p>Rushing things will only lead to failure. There&#8217;s no need to be impatient. I have time. It&#8217;s okay to take it slow.</p>



<p>To change the subject, I take a box out of the bag. I was drawn to it and ended up buying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kibidango?&#8221; (sweet dumpling made with mochi flour and (sometimes) millet flour (famous product of Okayama))</p>



<p>&#8220;When you mention Okayama Prefecture, you think of Momotaro. And when you think of Momotaro, you think of kibidango, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking of kibidango, it&#8217;s a magical item that appears in a fairy tale where Momotaro, on his way to defeat the demons, gives it to the monkey, pheasant, and dog, whom he befriends.</p>



<p>Honestly, defeating demons with just kibidango would be excessive black labor, but there probably wasn&#8217;t labor standards back in those times.</p>



<p>Whenever there&#8217;s a local product exhibition selling region-specific sweets, you can&#8217;t help but buy them, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s kibidango… does that mean… you really want to make me your ally?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Did she say something that couldn&#8217;t be ignored?</p>



<p>&#8220;Does that mean I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s the pet?… Well, it&#8217;s fine, even so.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Hey, what are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll become that for you. Your pet on the bed. A familiar, or perhaps a servant?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I still haven&#8217;t purified the imaginary me yet!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do? A hand? Or perhaps&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s value yourself a little more!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go ahead and try to train me as you please. I&#8217;ll learn any tricks you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Begone imaginary meeeeee! Begone!&#8221;</p>



<p>Crap, this is bad! The exorcism failed miserably, and it has become an irreparable situation.</p>



<p>Yuri-san&#8217;s eyes are shining suspiciously and brightly. It seems she&#8217;s gained some energy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we go out to buy a choker later? Make sure I wear it around my neck. It&#8217;s a proof that I&#8217;m yours. I&#8217;ll brag about it to Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m begging you, please, please stop that!&#8221;</p>



<p>I desperately plead, but she doesn&#8217;t care. This is bad. If I give the kibidango to Mother, it might end up the same way. Then, how about Sekka-san? No, that&#8217;s even worse!</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re willing to put a leash on me, I won&#8217;t go anywhere&#8212;&#8211;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister shakes her head as if shaking off stray thoughts. It&#8217;s such a painfully sad expression.</p>



<p>My heart tightens. I don&#8217;t know what those fleeting thoughts that passed through her in that moment are.</p>



<p>However, like the clear skies of Okayama, I vowed to clear away the haze in her heart.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>&#8220;I never thought I would hear the real sound of the Shishiodo… How elegant.&#8221;</p>



<p>A pleasant sound resonates periodically. The Shishiodo, not the name of a monster, but a device that produces sound by the up-and-down movement of a bamboo tube utilizing flowing water. It matches perfectly with the Japanese garden spread out before me. How refined… It feels like my soul is being cleansed.</p>



<p>Even though I&#8217;m escaping from reality, this is the main headquarters of the Himiyama family. I was invited again because I couldn&#8217;t formally greet them at the wedding.</p>



<p>&#8220;I also want to express my gratitude. Thank you for helping my granddaughter.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the other way around. I&#8217;m the one who received help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;These kids are such troublemakers. They should learn their lesson through hardships.&#8221;</p>



<p>The one expressing indignation is Rishu Himiyama. He may be a good-natured old man, but his occasional gaze is sharp.</p>



<p>A little research is enough to find numerous achievements of Rishu Himiyama.</p>



<p>Although he has already retired, he was once a politician, not only serving as a minister but also holding key positions in the party&#8217;s top three. Among them, the Secretary-General was effectively the number two position, responsible for personnel and finances. Even after retirement, he still holds tremendous influence over the party, according to Papa Tojo. It&#8217;s no wonder Papa Tojo&#8217;s face turns pale. I apologize for the overkill.</p>



<p>Earlier, Rishu Himiyama was present, but he wanted to talk privately, so we are now facing each other in the guest room. Am I going to be okay? I won&#8217;t be killed, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Misaki with such a smiling face for so many years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rishu-san gazes at the Japanese garden with a distant look. He seems somewhat happy.</p>



<p>I did not know the details of the situation, but it seemed that the reason he was so grateful was that Himiyama-san had been depressed for a long time due to a series of unfortunate events.</p>



<p>She had been so depressed that her family was worried about her. I learned a surprising secret about Himiyama-san.</p>



<p>After many twists and turns, she moved to a new place for a change of environment and met me there.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I received a message from Misaki, I was surprised. Her anger, her unreasonable treatment towards you, seemed unforgivable to her. She aspired to be a teacher but faced setbacks, and she couldn&#8217;t fulfill her role as a wife either. Once someone&#8217;s spirit is broken, it&#8217;s difficult to stand back up. I also wanted to do something for her, but I couldn&#8217;t make it happen. That&#8217;s why no matter how much gratitude I express, it feels insufficient.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Himiyama-san&#8230; Was Misaki-san in such a terrible state?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At one point, she lost a significant amount of weight and couldn&#8217;t even eat. There were times when she needed to be hospitalized and receive intravenous drips. Misaki still has a long life ahead of her. She has already experienced enough unhappiness. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking you to continue looking after her. For some reason, Misaki has taken a great liking to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I deeply understand that.&#8221;</p>



<p>After my plan to lower her favorability failed, I tried an opposite approach with the plan to increase it, but I ended up feeling endangered by how much her favorability rose. It was ridiculously high.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me. Please take care of her. It may be a biased opinion, but Misaki is beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what troubles me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s precisely because she is charming that she&#8217;s difficult to handle. After all, I&#8217;m going through adolescence.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was also surprised to learn that you know Genzo. It seems you&#8217;re training under him. Are you planning to succeed Itsumaru? We have had a long-standing relationship with that place, but there hasn&#8217;t been anyone to succeed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have such intentions, but the Boss has been very kind to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious thing. It seems you have a connection with the Himiyama family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Genzo is the name of the Boss. In my mind, I recognized him as the Boss, so when they mentioned his name, it didn&#8217;t click at first. The Himiyama family has had a close relationship with them for decades.</p>



<p>Certainly, even if there were secret discussions, nothing would leak from there. It&#8217;s only natural for a prominent politician to have at least one such establishment. Being invited to that place is also considered a status symbol.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, you seem to be quite famous. I apologize for prying, but I looked into it a little. However, for some reason, everything about you remains ambiguous, and I couldn&#8217;t grasp the full picture. But there&#8217;s no doubt that you&#8217;re the real deal. It&#8217;s truly amusing.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a smirk, Rishu-san shows me a stack of documents.</p>



<p>&#8220;But none of these seem to have any charm, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are these candidates&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The documents I was given are essentially detailed resumes. &#8230;Wait, isn&#8217;t this becoming a list that I shouldn&#8217;t be looking at?</p>



<p>&#8220;I may have retired, but I still have influence in the local area. People gather seeking my endorsement, but they all seem lacking in some way. Do you know what qualities are necessary for a politician?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What would that be? Practical skills, perhaps?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That may be necessary, but it&#8217;s not an absolute requirement. My son and Misaki&#8217;s older brother aren&#8217;t that type. However, such types are weak in elections. Unfortunately, popularity matters.&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san&#8217;s older brother actually works in a central government agency and seemed sincere and diligent.</p>



<p>&#8220;The essential quality for a politician, in my opinion, is the ability to attract people. Leave the detailed work to bureaucrats. It&#8217;s about having a broad perspective, a vision for the future, and the ability to execute decisively. You could say it&#8217;s about personal charisma. People won&#8217;t act without self-interest, but they won&#8217;t support someone without virtue. It&#8217;s a rare and valuable ability.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>The secret to smooth interpersonal relationships is to avoid discussing politics, religion, and baseball.</p>



<p>Not wanting to delve too deeply into the topic, I casually look for a way to wrap up the conversation and head home. I can&#8217;t shake off this unpleasant premonition I&#8217;ve had since earlier. It feels ominous.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, would you be interested in becoming my successor? Inheriting my network would be a good opportunity. There&#8217;s no rush, though. You&#8217;re still young, and there&#8217;s plenty of time. Despite being a high school student, you have the ability to attract people, which makes you suitable for a politician. What do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, even if you ask me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha! Don&#8217;t worry, leave it to me. I&#8217;ll take care of all the arrangements. It&#8217;s a discussion for the future, after all. I&#8217;ve been troubled by the issue of succession for a long time. Now, I can finally put that burden down. It brings peace to my mind. But still, we must choose someone before the next election. Is there anyone&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>My future employment was decided without my consent. This is taking it to a whole new level. And then I realize.</p>



<p>Could it be that the random person who greeted me at the wedding&#8230;? I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of formal followers on social media. What do they expect from a high school student like me? It seems like preparations are already underway.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fumu, you want to get engaged to Misaki?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221;</p>



<p>That would be a chaotic and rushed path. If things continue like this, I&#8217;ll become a real relative of Himyama-san.</p>



<p>Wait a minute? Oh, right! Papa Tojo said he would help if I&#8217;m in trouble. This is it!</p>



<p>&#8220;Rishu-san, I have a perfect candidate in mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll just push all the troublesome matters onto Papa Tojo. He mentioned that his goal was to enter national politics but it got derailed after angering Himiyama-san. He&#8217;s the perfect candidate.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to be considered as a successor. I also want to focus on raising my precious oranges.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh? So you forgive that foolish man? How generous of you. Your capacity is truly admirable, accepting even those who have been your enemies. In the world of politics where treachery runs rampant, such qualities are necessary. It makes me want to make you my successor even more.&#8221;</p>



<p>Could it be that Himyama-san&#8217;s lineage has an unconditional rule of increasing my likability?</p>



<p>&#8220;Papa Tojo is a wonderful person. He seems to have a good eye for things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, very well. In that case, let&#8217;s trust your words.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rishu-san is contacting someone, but I&#8217;m proceeding with the conversation without knowing the details. I hope everything is going fine.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s unfortunate, but Papa Tojo brought this upon himself. Become the sacrificial lamb for my sake.</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>&#8220;Ah, good morning, Miki-chan! Are you feeling better from the flu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I missed you, Kana-chan! My fever went down quickly, but I couldn&#8217;t go out or meet anyone, so I&#8217;ve been bored and lonely. Thanks for keeping in touch every day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;re not just friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kana-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Miki-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>The two of them embraced tightly. Minada, who had been absent from school for a while due to the flu, returned to school and was delighted to reunite with Elizabeth.</p>



<p>Speaking of the flu, it usually spreads during the dry winter season, but it can actually occur throughout the year. Practices like gargling and handwashing are important for infection prevention.</p>



<p>I continued working while keeping an eye on their reunion. It&#8217;s almost finished.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Kana-chan, I&#8217;ve been wondering, is there something off about the atmosphere at school? Maybe it&#8217;s just my imagination, but it feels unusually sweet and… strange.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think so too, Miki-chan? I had the same feeling. It&#8217;s a bit weird, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What could it be? It gives me goosebumps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi oi, aren&#8217;t you two forgetting something? Most of the strange things happening at this school are caused by that guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interrupting the girls&#8217; conversation with utmost social skills was the charismatic and refreshing handsome guy.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what did you do this time, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rude. What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you even doing right now? Wait… Why are you doodling on the textbook like a regular student!? That&#8217;s not like you at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a para-para manga (flipbook) where Kuya, who was reincarnated in the modern world, breakdance and spreads Buddhist chants.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was anything but regular! The quality is unnecessarily amazing!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s not a bad thing for Kongming to become a partygoer. It&#8217;s one of those things that can work.</p>



<p>Flipping through the textbook with a swift motion, it indeed looked like a monk was breakdancing. It was an artistic technique that utilized optical illusions.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Let me see!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This person&#8217;s movements are creepy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t it nice? Isn&#8217;t it nice?&#8221;</p>



<p>The textbook left my hands and passed on to my classmates.</p>



<p>Well, isn&#8217;t it nice? Isn&#8217;t it nice?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Mihou-kun, is it really Kokonoe-kun the cause of all this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t it nice?&#8221;</p>



<p>The carefree handsome guy casually interjects with his own remark.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the manga. Yukito, why have you been calling your sister &#8216;onee-sama&#8217; lately?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri-san said there was a character in a manga she got hooked on who used that term. She asked me to call her that for a while because she found it enviable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So it was about manga, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, in that manga, calling someone &#8216;Onee-sama&#8217; is usually done by a same-sex underclassman, so it&#8217;s unknown whether I, as her younger brother, am truly satisfied with using that term.</p>



<p>&#8220;And even Mom started asking me to call her &#8216;Mama&#8217; because of it. It was quite a situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a bit embarrassing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been taking care of me all this time, so it&#8217;s a small favor in return.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem like the issue here… But anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you suddenly saying such things, Mihou?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because of this guy, everyone in the school is catching on to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t his influence too strong!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even the girls in the basketball club started using the term &#8216;Onee-sama&#8217; and everything feels so sweet. Most likely, that&#8217;s the cause of all this strangeness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too much to attribute everything to me!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I protest in a small way, but no one pays any attention to me.</p>



<p>It seems that Mineda and the others are also convinced. Why are they so easily convinced!?</p>





<p>&#8212;&#8211;It all started a week ago.</p>



<p>My sister, who was reading a manga in the living room, closed the book with a snap, stood up, and slowly approached me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can call me &#8216;Onee-sama&#8217; if you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t we taught about subject and predicate in grammar?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s telepathy, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s completely different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… If you call me &#8216;Onee-sama,&#8217; I&#8217;ll give you something nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>I inadvertently furrow my brows. Her idea of something nice is probably that. The coupon for a shoulder pat (ten tickets) or something like that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s a grateful coupon to be able to pat my sister&#8217;s shoulder, but it took me two years to use them all. I used the last ticket just five days ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Exclusive ASMR for Little Brothers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are special benefits too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can actually experience it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Track 10 is a must-listen, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? You want it, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Actually, I&#8217;m secretly curious about its content.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, Yuri is being unfair. If you don&#8217;t mind, could you try calling me &#8216;Mama&#8217; too?&#8221;</p>



<p>Even Mom joined in unexpectedly. Her eyes are filled with anticipation, piercing through me.</p>



<p>It was clear that if I were to refuse, she would be disappointed. I&#8217;ve only been causing disappointments so far. It&#8217;s my role to live up to my family&#8217;s expectations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I got it. I&#8217;ll call you &#8216;Mama,&#8217; okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ngya-waiiiii!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Mom collapses to her knees and starts screaming while writhing on the floor.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s as if a fish washed up on land.</p>



<p>&#8220;What, what&#8217;s wrong, Mama?! Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nho-oooo!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right! We need to call an ambulance quickly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s alright! It was just a little too much of a shock, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing &#8220;just&#8221; about it! Mom was clutching her lower abdomen and looked like she was in pain.</p>



<p>Could it be that she has some illness!?</p>



<p>&#8220;Mama, does it hurt when I poke you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufii! I-It&#8217;s not like that! This is just… this area is throbbing with joy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, I see! Huh, but that&#8217;s some kind of disease! What shall I do? Onee-sama, Mama is in trouble!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaaaaaaaaah!&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turn around, Onee-sama is banging her head against the wall. It&#8217;s so frightening.</p>



<p>&#8220;What happened to Onee-sama too!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m perfectly calm. I just got a little too excited.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-sama, your forehead is turning red. Let me pat it for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I pat her forehead, Onee-sama bangs her head against the wall again. Like a woodpecker.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyawaaiiiii!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shukiiiiii!&#8221;</p>



<p>While the two of them are writhing in agony, I&#8217;m at a loss for what to do, watching them with my back turned.</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8211;That&#8217;s about it. There wasn&#8217;t anything particularly different, it was mostly normal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean it&#8217;s normal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather unusual, no!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be that it happens all the time in everyday life. This world is not a comic book or a video game. And don&#8217;t you dare say that I&#8217;m the cause of everything!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The boomerang has hit the mark.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They say that the one who gets hit by the boomerang doesn&#8217;t realize it, but it&#8217;s really true.&#8221;</p>


<p>There&#8217;s no way I could be the cause of everything. It can&#8217;t be true!</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be… right?</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Erika Tojo PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;Please look! Thanks to Erika Onee-sama, my grades have improved!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s thanks to your hard work. Have confidence in yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-thank you so much! Will you continue to teach me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, anytime you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>During lunch break, I had a relaxed time with just my junior and me. Even though I didn&#8217;t go as far as making tea by hand, I still felt that this time was precious, and I&#8217;m sure my junior sitting next to me felt the same.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm, there&#8217;s something I wanted to ask. Who is that person who&#8217;s always following Onee-sama? He seems like a dangerous student, and I can&#8217;t stand him!&#8221;</p>



<p>Pum pum, as I sensed Kumi&#8217;s frustration, I immediately understood who she was referring to.</p>




<p>My face tensed up. I clenched my fist tightly and took a deep breath to calm myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kumi-san, he&#8217;s not following me. If anything, it might be the other way around. And he is a dear friend of mine. A truly important friend. Even if it&#8217;s you, I won&#8217;t tolerate anyone making fun of him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Without thinking, a cold voice escaped my lips. I hesitated on how to address the adorable junior who was now looking down. She admires me so much, and I don&#8217;t want to disregard her feelings.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s done nothing wrong. She was just worried about me. Even if I abruptly scold her, her emotions won&#8217;t understand or accept it. It might trigger an outburst.</p>



<p>And if that happens, the one who will be hurt is not me this time, but the person who was unfairly inconvenienced before and now, it will be her standing right in front of me.</p>



<p>In the first place, even in that incident, nothing was made public. Ultimately, only he took the blame. It pains me that people&#8217;s negative impression of him remains unchanged.</p>



<p>What he has done has become clear, but my name was not mentioned in that disclosure.</p>



<p>In reality, suspension or even expulsion wouldn&#8217;t be unreasonable considering the severity of my actions.</p>




<p>Being able to live in peace like this is also thanks to what he did.</p>



<p>He already stands out enough as it is. Naturally, there are people who don&#8217;t think highly of him.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m working to restore his reputation, but I can&#8217;t actively spread the truth.</p>



<p>However, I can&#8217;t run away here. If I were to run away now, I would spend the rest of my life unable to forgive myself. That&#8217;s why I must convey the truth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please listen, Kumi-san. He is not the person you think he is. On the contrary, he&#8217;s like a hero. He is-&#8220;</p>



<p>I speak passionately. What will she think?</p>



<p>She may be disappointed. I may not become the ideal senpai she admires.</p>



<p>Still, I can&#8217;t pretend to hide my foolish actions at this moment.</p>



<p>He is my friend, after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are very ugly creatures. And of course, that includes me. You are so pure and it reminds me of my past self. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m worried. I don&#8217;t want to tarnish the beauty you possess.&#8221;</p>



<p>I want to protect that innocence. In this era where the ugliness of humanity is so vividly displayed. It&#8217;s filled with so much malice that it can extinguish one&#8217;s spirit.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to be swept away by it. The more pure you are, the more you get hurt.</p>



<p>And then you become tired and slowly get stained by it.</p>



<p>But, just for now. Even if it&#8217;s only until graduation, I want to remain pure within this closed world called school. I want to stay as the ideal I aspire to be, even if it&#8217;s impossible. I find myself wanting to be the &#8220;Onee-sama&#8221; she seeks.</p>



<p>I wanted to do my best. To be able to always have peaceful moments like this.</p>



<p>Both her and him. I wish for everyone to be kind to one another.</p>



<p>&#8220;I cherish you, Kumi-san. That&#8217;s why I want you to have many people you cherish as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only her classmates, but also juniors, regardless of gender, seek her advice and support, and she gained immense popularity. Her attitude was always kind, approachable, and compassionate.</p>


<p>Eventually, Erika Tojo would also be known as</p>



<p>&#8212;-Saint Senpai</p>



<p>&nbsp</p>


<p>&#8220;Father, I don&#8217;t care what happens to me! Please help me! If things continue like this, it will be because of me that Kokonoe-san… That must never happen!&#8221;</p>



<p>In a rush, Erika returns home and hurriedly enters her father&#8217;s study. Seeing her daughter in a panicked state, Hideomi, while bewildered, calms Erika down and prepares some coffee before urging her to speak. It is an important matter for Hideomi as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;What happened, Erika?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Sudou-san&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>Takefumi Sudou, the eldest son of the Sudou family, currently twenty years old, and the person who proposed an engagement to Erika.</p>



<p>Takefumi&#8217;s father&#8217;s company was listed on the Nasdaq exchange four years ago. Hideomi had met him a few times but didn&#8217;t find him to be a desirable partner, giving off the typical nouveau riche impression.</p>



<p>Such individuals often seek social connections. And Sudou had set his sights on the Tojo family.</p>



<p>Hideomi is currently in a difficult situation. He has been stripped of his official status and is in an independent position.</p>



<p>Not only is he seen as a fallen figure by those around him, which is indeed true, but Hideomi has no way to regain his former standing.</p>



<p>While he has been forgiven by Misaki after bowing his head and offering a formal apology, it is only natural for them to distance them from Tojo, who is being glared at by Himiyama. In fact, if another person were to find themselves in a similar situation, Hideomi would reconsider their relationship. The difference in influence is that vast.</p>



<p>Elections require money. With the loss of his party as a backing, Hideomi will face a tough battle. He cannot rely on sheer numbers as he has done before. His current position is precarious, and there are countless candidates aiming for his seat.</p>



<p>Keen-eyed Sudou saw an opportunity there and offered assistance, under the condition that his son Takefumi become engaged to Erika. While Hideomi was outraged and rejected the offer, Sudou&#8217;s forceful and increasing pressure is wearing him down. If Takefumi were an outstanding individual, Hideomi might have considered it, but he couldn&#8217;t see that in him, and Erika also harbored dislike towards him. As a father who genuinely loves his daughter, he couldn&#8217;t use her as a tool.</p>



<p>The Sudou family lacks the pedigree and status, and Hideomi lacks allies.</p>



<p>On the surface, it may seem mutually beneficial, but in reality, it is a takeover of the Tojo family. If Erika were to be engaged to Takefumi, he would inherit the Tojo name. Sudou would obtain history. It was something that Hideomi couldn&#8217;t tolerate.</p>



<p>&#8220;That man… What a fool. Haha, kuhahahahahahahahaha!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Father? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Sorry, sorry. This feeling of relief is just… Erika, there&#8217;s nothing for you to worry about. Such obstacle to Kokonoe-Sensei are meaningless,&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Erika, after school, she was ambushed by Takefumi and persistently invited to a meal near the school gate. By chance, Yukito Kokonoe intervened, but during the altercation, Takefumi made threatening remarks towards Yukito and his family. It is unclear whether he was enraged or simply deluded himself into believing that Sudou had such power, but it was like provoking a devil.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting more and more head-over-heels, aren&#8217;t we? Erika, cherish this relationship. There is no more suitable person for you to marry, but even if you put that aside, you must not sever your relationship with Kokonoe-sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Father?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The next election. I will enter national politics.&#8221;</p>



<p>A phone call that just came in has completely changed Hideomi&#8217;s difficult situation.</p>



<p>He is still filled with excitement, a feeling he has not experienced in a long time. Asked for a response, he immediately gives one.</p>



<p>A shudder runs through his body. The Tojo family&#8217;s long-cherished dream, which he once had stolen away, is being brought back, and it is none other than he who is making it happen.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems that Kokonoe-Sensei has recommended me as a successor to Rishu-Sensei. Eventually, he will officially take over that constituency, but until then, he will support me.&#8221;</p>



<p>What a bold man. Hideomi is amazed. He doesn&#8217;t know the details of how this decision was made, but it is extraordinary for someone who had caused him harm as an enemy not only to be forgiven but to be saved. Erika, too, has been saved by Yukito Kokonoe, and there is no doubt that he will become an outstanding figure who accomplished great feats in the future. If that is the case, Hideomi swears to protect his seat until then.</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s not enough. His mission is to expand his influence, gain support, and strengthen his foothold even more than before for the sake of the country.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have received a great favor that cannot be repaid. So, I will repay this debt through my work. I will pioneer the path for Kokonoe-Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>He is not currently in the position to do so, but it may be decades in the future. Time is plentiful. Until then, Hideomi has decided to devote himself to serving this country.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Father, about Kokonoe-san&#8221;</p>



<p>Erika was heartbroken that she had ruined the Tojo family&#8217;s long-cherished dream. But now she had dragged him into her family&#8217;s affairs. She could not repent enough. If Sudou had tried to touch Yukito Kokonoe, she had even been prepared to accept his offer of a fiancée.</p>



<p>But that unexpected development was beyond his understanding.</p>



<p>Hideomi absentmindedly opened his SNS. Looking at the trending topics, he burst into laughter.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I understand is that he is definitely not an entity to be opposed to.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;An entity? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hideomi handed his phone to Erika, whose expression became indescribably subtle.</p>



<p>&#8220;Father, what is this!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Sudou is finished.&#8221;</p>



<p>The concerns that had been troubling him were resolved, and now Hideomi was filled only with the determination to face new challenges. He made a firm vow to himself: He would never go against him again.</p>



<p>[On the other side]</p>



<p>&#8220;What on earth were you doing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, father!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shuji grabbed his son&#8217;s collar as soon as he returned from work. It was a terrifying sight, a rage that his son had never seen before.</p>



<p>Shuji Sudou is cold-hearted. He excels at thoroughly investigating his opponents and exploiting their weaknesses. That&#8217;s how he expanded his business. Tojo was also one of his targets. He invested money and strategized to eventually take control of their family&#8217;s legacy.</p>



<p>Shuji was not the type to raise his voice normally. That&#8217;s why this outburst left Takefumi shocked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Take a look at this!&#8221;</p>



<p>Shuji showed Takefumi his social media feed. Takefumi was unsure of his father&#8217;s intentions, but when he saw the trending topics, his face turned pale. The situation was beyond his comprehension.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is my name here?!&#8221;</p>



<p>He quickly opened his own phone and checked his accounts. Notifications overflowed.</p>



<p>His name was trending, and his real name, university enrollment, and even his family structure were all identified. But the biggest problem was that a clear video of Takefumi&#8217;s threats was being widely circulated.</p>



<p>Following the origin, they found an account with over ten thousand followers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would a video like this…- Wait, this person!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takefumi&#8217;s task was to ruin Erika. Erika had no way to escape. Even if she rejected him, once they became engaged, she would just be a high school student, easily disposable in his eyes. Eventually, he would take control of the Tojo family.</p>



<p>If it came to that, Takefumi would be free. There would be no need to obsess over Erika. There are plenty of other women out there. He had no feelings for her and she was just a mere pawn after all.</p>



<p>When he approached Erika to fulfill his objective, there was a guy who got in his way. Just an ordinary, unsophisticated high school student.</p>



<p>Takefumi wanted to intimidate the impudent brat. That&#8217;s all he did. He didn&#8217;t resort to violence. And yet&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;What the hell is this! Father, why is this happening!&#8221;</p>



<p>An account named &#8220;Yukito Kokonoe.&#8221; Takefumi couldn&#8217;t understand why a mere high school student would have over ten thousand followers. The posts causing the controversy were extremely simple.</p>



<p>With the video, there was only one line: &#8220;Got threatened out of nowhere by some weirdo. LOL&#8221;</p>



<p>Even an emoji laughing while sweating was added. He was clearly being provoked.</p>



<p>Just one line. Only a single line. And yet, it sparked a fatal uproar.</p>




<p>&#8220;My name and even the name of the company have been identified and spread around. But that&#8217;s not the problem!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean, that&#8217;s not the problem! What are we going to do, father?&#8221;</p>



<p>Takefumi was about to throw his phone on the floor, but he held himself back. What else could happen?</p>



<p>Despite feeling an inexplicable fear from his father&#8217;s words, what his father pointed out were the followers.</p>



<p>&#8220;What am I going to do? There&#8217;s nothing we can do about this! I&#8217;m done for!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute&#8230; This guy is weird! Something&#8217;s not right! And father&#8217;s company, it&#8217;s&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>The followers were not just ordinary high school students, but also major companies with which his father&#8217;s company had business transactions, advertising agencies, and even politicians and executives of companies whom Takefumi had never even met. It was a low-quality joke, to put it lightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Himiyama, that&#8217;s&#8230; That guy who retired, right? And Kyoto&#8217;s Touran&#8230; It can&#8217;t be&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is absurd! How is there such a connection? It&#8217;s the result of your reckless actions! You have to fix this yourself!&#8221;</p>


<p>Takefumi had followed his father&#8217;s intentions. He had just been a bit careless. That&#8217;s all. But even so&#8230;</p>



<p>He had received education from his father as well. That&#8217;s why he understood&#8230; This was impossible.</p>



<p>The situation that would unfold from now on would likely be a catastrophe for both his father and Takefumi. Even his own employment prospects were now uncertain. At this point, there was no time to worry about people like Tojo.</p>



<p>Messages kept pouring into his phone one after another. &#8220;You&#8217;re the worst.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t contact me anymore.&#8221; Fearing that it would spread to themselves, friends and acquaintances were cutting ties. Even the person he had been dating dropped him without hesitation. It was a heartless web of relationships.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go and apologize immediately. Don&#8217;t come back until you&#8217;re forgiven!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, Father! I was in the wrong. So, let&#8217;s go together—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to clean up your mess!? You&#8217;re already an adult. Take responsibility for yourself! Don&#8217;t come back until you&#8217;ve earned forgiveness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Father, you understand, right! I can&#8217;t handle this on my own—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the company. It looks like I won&#8217;t be able to come home for a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>With swift steps, Shuji left the house. Takefumi stood there dumbfounded.</p>



<p>What had he done to make himself an enemy? The world had changed as if by some absurdity.</p>



<p>&#8220;…A demon.&#8221;</p>



<p>His murmured words carried a tone of sorrow.</p>
