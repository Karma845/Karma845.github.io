<h3>Epilogue.</h3>

<p>“Seriously, this is bad.”<p>Yesterday was seriously bad. I ended up going to bed with my sister hugging me afterwards. I know I’ve worried you a lot recently, but my mom and sis are too overprotective.<p>The problem is me. I am too old to sleep with my sister.<p>No, wait, isn’t that crazy? I have been talking about such things as a matter of course, without worrying about it. Why did I think I couldn’t say it even if it was out of my mouth?<p>It’s not like I wouldn’t have thought of such a thing until now…….<p>Well, never mind. It’s silly to worry about it as soon as I get to school.<p>There’s a lot for me to do today. I have to move on to find out who I am. I need to be something different. A different me.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you, Yukito. You look so confused.”<p>The fresh handsome guy was looking fresh today, too. Good morning. It has been raining since yesterday, but the fresh and handsome man’s face is clear today. He is a guy who has no sense of the season at all. Isn’t it tiring when it’s sunny all the time? Doesn’t it ever get cloudy? But I am not a weather forecaster. I didn’t have time to worry about such things today.<p>“I’m going to join the basketball team.”<p>“What!? Really! What kind of change of heart is that?”<p>“For now, it’s just until the tournament that the hot-blooded senpai told me about. After that, it depends on whether I want to continue or not.”<p>“I understand. Then I’ll join the club too!”<p>“Gross! Don’t try to follow me. Do you like me?”<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”<p>For some reason, there was a loud cheers from inside the classroom, which was filled with a sense of tension. I pretended not to look at it because I was afraid this would be a snake in the bushes if I got too deep into it.<p>“Kamishioro…no, Shiori.”<p>“Y-Yuki…?”<p>I call out to Kamishiro, who was looking at me fearfully.<p>I hurt her just because she got involved with me. I broke my arm because of Kamishiro, and I couldn’t participate in the tournament because of it. That’s true. But I was already broken, so I wasn’t hurt by that. My body was hurt, though.<p>But what about Kamishiro herself? She must have been tormented for a long time. If I had hurt someone in the same way, I would not have been able to ignore it.<p>“Don’t you ever have two words for a woman?”</p>

<p>“Eh? That’s a word for men. ……”<p>“It’s a gender-equal society. Don’t worry about it. I’ll ask you again. Do you have two words for me?”<p>“I don’t know what it is, but I don’t. I’ve decided to never lie to Yuki again!”<p>“Okay, then be my manager.”<p>“Eh? Yes, yes!”<p>Again, there were shouts from all parts of the room.<p>Is this class going to be okay like this?</p>

<p>“I know. I wonder what’s going on all of a sudden.”<p>“You look kind of happy, Yuuri.”<p>“Is that so? I guess I must be.”<p>“He’s so great, isn’t he, little brother? Bring him back.”<p>My little brother is causing a stir right away, it seems. He is getting excited about how he told his classmates to “be my girl” or something. He was making his timeline look awesome.<p>When did he become such a selfish character? I’ll interrogate him when I get home.<p>As usual, his words, deeds, and actions were being reported, but whatever had happened to him, it was a little or a lot different from his usual ruckus. If anything, that kid is trying to do something on his own, instead of getting involved for the first time.</p>

<p>It reminds me of yesterday. My eyes might still be a little red. I cried without a care in the world. In fact, I even fell asleep with him because I didn’t want to let him go.<p>Not only yesterday, but today, tomorrow, and in the future. I slept with my mother, too, and it’s okay with me, isn’t it? I want to ask for such an unspecified consent. I always wanted to be called. I wanted to be recognized as a sister. I wanted him to see me not as a stranger but as his immediate family.<p>Maybe I could touch his heart a little. Until now, there had been nothing but bad changes.<br>Maybe for the first time, a good change had occurred.<p>If that was the case, I absolutely could not let this opportunity be destroyed.<p>I can’t let her hurt him again with her malice. I must protect it. This time, it will be me.</p><p>“That’s why I ran away from the noisy class.”<p>“You are much more famous now, aren’t you?”<p>Lunch break. Eating peanut butter bread and chocolate bread on the fire escape.</p>

<p>It was a bad choice. Too sweet. Even though I have a sweet tooth, these two breads were too much for me. My body was now craving a fight more than sugar. I’m sorry, liar, I don’t want to fight.<p>“But more importantly, Hestia-senpai, aren’t you always here?”<p>“Stop calling me that, because it sounds like I’m wearing something naughty!”<p>“What are you talking about?”<p>“No. If you don’t know, forget it. It’s nothing.”</p><p>“I’ve got that string.”<p>“So you do know! And why do you have it?!”<p>“I thought it might be something with that name.”</p>

<p>“A-Are you trying to make me wear that ……?!”<p>“You don’t have the chest for it.”<p>“Oi, junior”<p>“Pardon me! Pardon me, !”<p>Hestia Senpai was eating lunch alone on the fire escape as usual. I knew she was a loner no matter what I thought. She even confessed it to me. My senpai is beautiful.<p>But she doesn’t have any friends.<p>“Well, well. Hestia Senpai. I’ll be your friend.”<p>“Why are you looking at me like you are above me? And you think I’m just some lonely who doesn’t have any friends, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Am I wrong?”<p>“Yes! I have a lot of friends, you know!”<p>“I don’t understand why peanut butter is so sweet. Damn you, America!”<p>“That’s why, listen to me. I’m talking to you, right?”<p>“Do-do-do-do.”<p>“I’m not a horse! I’m not a horse!”<p>“You’re a goddess, right?”<p>“I’m getting tired of it, and I’m starting to feel okay with it. ……”</p>

<p>For some reason, Hestia-senpai was upset. I felt sorry for her, so I gave her the string.<p>“I’m not a loner like you, okay? Are you listening to me?”<p>“I’ve been thinking lately that maybe I’m not so lonely.”<p>“Huh, really? It is true that you are a little bit of a problem in many ways. ……”<p>“Well, I’m still a shady person, though! Guerarararara”<p>“Don’t laugh with a straight face. You’re scaring me. But I’m glad to hear that.”<p>“I don’t know if it’s a good thing, but if Hestia-senpai says so, I’m sure it’s a good thing.”<p>“Yes, yes, you must listen to me, because I am a goddess, right?”</p>

<p>“Oi oi, you think you’re really a goddess?”<p>“Don’t suddenly take the ladder off! You said it yourself!”<p>The light rain was still falling. In such a situation, only Hestia and I were the only students who had the unusual idea of having lunch outside. The fire escape was not wet, so there was no problem, but it was a strangely comfortable space.</p><p>I wondered if school or home would ever be such a comfortable space for me.<p>I’m sure that I’ve been–</p>
