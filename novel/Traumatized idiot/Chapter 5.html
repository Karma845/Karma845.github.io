<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Chapter 5 - False Accusations that clCome to Light.</h3>

<p>Crowded trains, it is the baptism of company livestock. Thank you for your hard work early in the morning.<p>My life’s diagram is completely disordered and delayed, but I’m going to school by train today. Yesterday, I stayed at Sekka-san’s house.<p>Sekka Kokonoe. She is my mother’s sister and an aunt to me.<p>Kokonoe is my mother’s surname, so please don’t be confused. I used to live with Sekka-san for about a month. In the past, my mother and Sekka-san had a big fight because of me, and she was forced to take me in.<p>Since then, I had to stay with her regularly or she would be sad. That’s when I had to commute to school by train.<p>Sekka-san was overly overprotective of me, as if she was worried about me. It sounds good to say she was a kind aunt, but she was too young to be an aunt.<p>She tries to buy me everything, but yesterday I was ready to accept defeat. She was melting my steel mentality into mush. “Yuki-chan, is there anything you want? A child perhaps” If I nod yes, I wonder what will happen to me ten months from now. I’m scared. I am too scared. I had no choice but to pretend I couldn’t hear.<br>Even though the train was packed, I was sitting down now. It’s because I won the game of chair. A faint sense of superiority. I was feeling comfortable with the jealous eyes on me, —–but when I arrived at the station, the newly arrived passengers were pushed into the train car.</p>

<p>Is she all right? The woman standing in front of me, she doesn’t look good. She looks like she is in a bad mood. Recently, it is said that an increasing number of old people get upset when they are offered a seat. However, there was no use thinking about it.<p>“Here you go.”<p>“Eh, ……, thank you.”<p>I quickly stood up and gave up my seat. Despite appearances, I am confident in my physical strength. I used to be active in club activities, although I am now a depraved homecoming club member. My legs and back are strong. It is only a few more kilometers to go, anyway. There is no need to be stubborn.<p>I played with my phone to pass the time. There are words in the search history that I cannot show you, such as “ten months later,” so I will erase them in due course.<p>As I think about this, the figure of a female student near the entrance comes into view. So what’s the matter with her, she was looking downcast as if she was holding something back.<p>Are there too many people in bad shape? Is it this poor environment of crowded trains that makes them so? But it didn’t seem that way. She was pressed against the wall, shivering. There was only one possibility that came to mind.<p>“Are you too naughty in the morning?”</p>

<p>Early in the morning, sleepiness probably prevails in most people, but there may be some people whose sexual desire prevails. I can’t speak for others because I’m also troubled by Sekka-san, but that doesn’t mean I can’t get excited in such a crowded train.<p>There is no such thing as a hobby! It’s true, right?<p>I quietly move closer to her as if to wade through the waves of people. I give a little distance to observe the situation.<p>I hate to admit it, but there is no doubt. How is it that a grown man can be fondling the buttocks of a high school girl so early in the morning? There are too many perverts. Too sick. A sigh spills out from my mouth.<br>The next station arrives. I walk along with the flow of people and reach out to grab the hand of a businessman in a suit and tie it.<p>“What are you doing?”<p>I realized that my hand had been grabbed.<p>I realized. It was another trouble I had gotten myself into.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[President PoV]</b>

<p>It was just a few minutes ago that I received a call from my best friend, Yumi Mikumo<br>Apparently, she was being molested again. She is too well-liked to be molested even for a short time before meeting up with me. She is a cute little animal, so she is an easy target.<p>After I meet her at the station, there will be no problem because I will be there, but until then she will inevitably be alone, so there will be no end to my worries. In fact, this is how Yumi sometimes contacts me.<p>I get angry when I see a short “help” message typed on my phone.<br>Perhaps it is because of these incidents that Yumi has developed a mild distrust of men. There must be many people on the train. Not all of them are perverts. But why didn’t anyone try to help her? I also blame the passengers for pretending to ignore the situation.<p>(Well, what should I do ……)<p>It depends on how the other party responds. If he apologizes honestly, there is still room for improvement, but depending on his attitude, I may have to consider turning him in to the police. If that happens, we will be late for school, but this is also for the sake of justice. The station staff or the police will tell the school what happened.<br>The train arrives. Yumi is always in the same position in the same train, so she is easily recognizable.<p>So, what kind of guy will we be dealing with today? I am a martial arts student, so I have a certain amount of strength. First and foremost, as student body president, I will not tolerate anyone who tries to harm the students of our school. Even though I am not at school, I am on my way to school.<br>That is the duty of the student body president, and it is also the justice and the pride of Tsukitsuki.<p>“That’s him!”<p>I grabbed the arm of the man who was reaching for Yumi and twisted it up. I was about to check what he looked like when I was surprised. It was a student from our school.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Yukito Pov]</b>

<p>“No, it wasn’t me. ……’<p>“I won’t listen to your excuses. You, a student of our school, have you no shame?”<p>My arm was twisted up and I was held down to the ground. I could have forced myself to shake her off, but the situation was about to get complicated, so I complied maturely. I had a feeling this was going to happen, though, didn’t I? After being named a molester in high spirits in the train, I was pulled out of the train and pursued. I am having a bad day.<p>“I can see with my own eyes that you were reaching for Yumi. You had better not lie.”<p>“It’s a knotty hole.<p>“What the hell….?”</p>

<p>With a snap, a weight was placed on my arm. It was a very dignified move. The other woman lying on the ground next to me is a woman.<p>She was very different from the other female student who was lying on the ground next to me. I think I’ve seen her somewhere before, but I couldn’t find her name in my brain library. It sounds good to say that she is a sporty type of girl, but this is something else. Brainy.<p>“If you had just admitted it and apologized, there would have been extenuating circumstances,”<p>” I cannot admit to something I didn’t do. It’s against my justice.”<p>“A molester can’t talk about justice.”<p>“I didn’t molest her.”<p>“Then I’ll have to call the police.”<p>I’m in a bind. I couldn’t get through to her. As for me, I was fine with that. If I verify it thoroughly, my innocence should be clarified. In that case, it’s the girls who will be in trouble, but as expected, I can’t feel any sympathy for them if they treat me like I’m guilty. If they suffer from that, it’s their own responsibility.</p>

<p>“Then, why don’t you just call them out?”<p>“Do you really think that because you are a student, you are not guilty? You are very foolish.”<p>“You look more foolish to me.”<p>“I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry, call the police. Such a person has no place in our school. We don’t need you.”<p>“Ah….Yeah. I understand.”</p><p>The station attendant was about to run out when I said the word. I’m not sure why I’m having such bad luck with women.<p>“Wait, he didn’t do it. He is not the perpetrator.”<p>Let me take back what I said before. Maybe my luck with women is not that bad.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[President PoV]</b>

<p>I was surprised that the molester was a student at our school. He seemed to be an underclassman. The fact that he looked at me and showed no reaction bothered me, but I felt a little remorse in my conscience whether I should crush a young man with a bright future. However, this student showed no remorse whatsoever. At all times, he insists that it was not his fault. This open attitude is gradually making me feel irritated.<p>If he is a student at our school, he may meet Yumi in the school if things are left unchecked. Yumi is distrustful of men, and she can’t bear the thought of the man who molested her being in the same school with her. I was able to save her this time, but she might be attacked someday. I could not allow that to happen.<p>The only way was for this student to be expelled. Having such a student enrolled in the school was not a positive thing. I decided that there was no room for rehabilitation, and I was prepared to call the police.<p>“I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry, call the police. Such a person has no place in our school. We don’t need you.”<p>“Oh, ……, yeah. I understand.”<p>Now I’m going to be late, but I don’t have a choice. If left unchecked, not only Yumi, but other girls and other women may be harmed. He is an unforgivable person.<p>Why is it that no one tries to help Yumi, but only people like him? It makes me feel so gloomy and anxious since this morning.</p>

<p>“Wait, he is not the perpetrator.”<p>The words slipped into my ears as I lamented in my heart.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</b>

<p>“Huh, where are you?”<p>“Thank you for earlier.”<p>The woman who approached me was looking somewhat better.<p>It was the woman who stood in front of me in the morning. Apparently, she was going to help me. The woodcutter who dropped his axe in the lake may have felt this way when he saw the goddess.<p>“What the hell? I’m sorry. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I was sitting in front of him. He’s not the molester.”<p>“You were sitting? I saw this man reach for Yumi. Why would you, who was in the middle of the train, try to cover for him?”<p>“Because he approached the girl on that side by himself.”<p>“That’s because he was going to molest her, isn’t it?”<p>“That’s not true. Hey, you, remember when you were molested? When you were being molested, were there boys around you wearing school uniforms?”<p>The focus turned to the girl who had been molested, who had barely spoken up to this point.<p>“Eh, ……? I-I was …….”<p>“Remember. He thought you might have been molested, so he approached you. He must have been trying to help you. He got close to you just before you arrived at this station. You must remember at least a little bit about who was around you when you were being molested, right?”</p>

<p>“I-I was afraid…… because they were all adults. Come to think of it, maybe it was someone in a suit. ……”<p>“Was there anyone wearing the same school uniform?”<p>“I don’t think there were any. …… N-no, there weren’t!</p><p>“What?!”<p>The senior who still doesn’t listen to my arm kicking in. The only thing I can do is enjoy the feeling of her breasts, but it’s sad to say that it’s not a situation where I can call it a privilege.<p>“Haa. ……. That was a little indiscreet. You guys, you could have possibly ruined his life, you know? Not only that. If it turns out later that he is innocent, you will be accused of being the ones who set up the false accusation.<p>“No way…… Then, wou’re trying to help Yumi. ……”<p>“I-I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, don’t worry about it so much. I’m the one who’s at fault.”<p>“…… What do you mean……?”<p>I don’t feel anything now that she apologized. In other words, as usual, I did something wrong. It was a mistake to act. It was a mistake to care.<p>“Since it was the senpai who saved the day, she didn’t need me.”<p>I knew that I would not be good at anything if I got involved. I should know that better than anyone, but I always end up making the wrong choice. After all…<p>“I shouldn’t have tried to help her.”<p>I should have ignored her. If she’s being molested, she should have just raised her voice herself. Relying on someone else, depending on someone else, asking someone else to protect you, is not going to solve anything. At least, that’s how I lived my life.<p>“—-!”</p>

<p>“May I ask you to let go? Don’t worry. I won’t make the same mistake. I will never make the same mistake again. It’s just as you said, senpai. You don’t need me.”<p>I will not repeat the same mistake. In this case, the cause is clear and the countermeasure is easy. From now on, even if I see a woman who looks like she is being molested, I will abandon her. Then nothing will happen. I will not be involved in anything. It is the person who should change, and it is the molester who is committing the crime. I, an outsider, have nothing to do with it. I am a stranger after all, and it doesn’t matter.<p>“W-wait! ! I’m sorry, you’re not wrong. Everything you did was–“<p>“That’s enough. Well then.”<p>I shake off the hand of Senpai who is clinging to me and turn away, and I bow my head to the elder sister.<p>Without her, I would have been in more trouble.<p>It is no exaggeration to say that she is truly a savior for me!<p>“Thank you very much. May I call you Messiah?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, but you’ve made me feel a little better. I have low blood pressure in the mornings and I don’t feel very well. It was especially hard today, which is why I’m glad you gave it to me. But then I saw you in such a mess. I was so surprised. I’m curious about that.”<p>“Are you feeling all right now?”<p>“Maybe not quite yet. Haa. ……. I was going to go to college like this, but I guess I’ll just have to take the morning off.””<p>“I don’t feel so good either, I’m going to go into a coffee shop for a bit and rest.”<p>“Oh, you can skip school? Then can I join you?”<p>“I’m a problem child, so I’m fine. Then please let me buy you a drink. I should at least thank you for saving my life.”<p>“I know it’s not okay, but I’m sorry. It would help me a lot….”<p>“The return is too big.”</p>

<p>While chatting like that, I decided to rest for a while in a coffee shop with the elder sister.<p>Her name is Mio Ninomiya. She gave me her contact information, saying, “If you have any trouble after this, please contact me.” In this world, there are women who make false accusations against you, but there are also saviors who can help you. If there is a God who discards, there is a God who picks up. It’s a very well-made world. That’s just the way it is.<p>“I don’t want to go to school. ……”<p>My mood had cleared up somewhat, but it was around ten o’clock. Yes, I am an outlaw, Yukito Kokonoe. After all, I’m a problem child. A little slacking off wouldn’t be a big deal.<p>By the way, if I take the train for about 30 minutes from here, I will get to the Seaside District. One of my few hobbies is to visit sweets stores, and a store nearby that sells a limited number of tarts (50 a day) has become the talk of the town. Sugar is calling me.</p><p>“Phew. That’s settled—“</p><p>I smile to myself, grinning, and start walking away from the school toward the exact opposite direction.<p>This may also be called youth.</p>

<p>So I skipped school and went to the Seaside District by myself, and the limited edition tart was very tasty. Only because it was limited. I achieved my main goal, but I still have to go to school in the afternoon.<p>No one would think I’m skipping school and playing here. Fufufu.<p>There are many places to play. Shall I go shopping at the mall? Or maybe I could go on a Ferris wheel ride or even go to a TV station for no particular reason, just like a school trip student. A one-person school trip is also a fun and somewhat shady experience. It is also romantic to enjoy the empty International Exhibition Hall, which is different from the festivals held during the Obon and New Year’s holidays. The spring sunlight was dazzling. The smell of the ocean uplifted my spirits.<p>I gazed at the sea in a daze. Watching the birds play with each other.<p>When it comes to things like purses and wallets, the return rate for lost and found items in Japan is said to be around 60%.<p>I lost a “affection” at some point in my life.<p>I don’t know when that was. Was it that time or the other time? No matter how much I look back, I cannot find the answer. I may say, “I’m lost,” but I’m just lost.<p>Where is the ” affection” that I have lost? Will there ever come a day when I can get it back? After I lost my “affection,” I don’t care about anything anymore. I don’t care how people see me or what they think of me. If there is no “affection,” there is no “ill will,” either. I don’t care if other people don’t like me. I don’t care what kind of feelings people have for me, and I don’t direct those feelings at them.</p>

<p>There is a gaping emotional void.<p>But that is not right. That’s not possible. There was a time when I had a “affection” for someone. And now that I have lost “affection,” I am not qualified to face anyone. I can’t return the same amount of feelings no matter what kind of feelings are directed at me by the other person.<p>No matter how many “affection” they show me, I will never return the same amount of “affection.”<p>It is impossible for me to return it. The feelings of ” love” that are supposed to be beyond those feelings, and the “love” that I feel, are also lost. I can no longer be in love with someone else.<p>Therefore, I should not get involved with anyone. At least, until I get back what I lost, I have to stay in the shadows.<p>“Now thinking about it….”<p>How could this happen at all? Contrary to my intentions, strangely enough, there are a lot of people around me who want to get involved. Frankly, it’s annoying. I’m not good enough as I am now, and I’m going to hurt someone. I would make them unhappy. I don’t want that.<p>Suddenly, I looked at my phone. There were several messages. I had suddenly skipped the class without saying anything. Someone might have been concerned and contacted me. Why didn’t they just ignore me? Why try to get involved? It’s a bad trend. Caring about me is not a good thing. I’m sure they don’t understand that, which is why I’m here now.</p>

<p>“Haa ……”<p>Somehow, the depression returned. By that time, I had lost all desire to go to school in the afternoon. I’m free, so let’s go to the arcade.</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Third person PoV]</b>

<p>“Sorry, is Yukito Kokonoe this class?”<p>Lunch break. A sudden visitor appears.<p>“The student council president and …… vice-president?”<p>The two students were Mutsuki Kedou and Yumi Mikumo. As Student Council President, Kedou has many opportunities to address the entire school. Even from the first year, they were familiar faces.<p>What did such a president want with the first-year students? Surely, the president is not the kind of person who would show his face in a first-year class without a reason. The first person to respond to this question was Sakurai, who was the subject of many suspicious glances.<p>“Kokonoe-kun is absent today, did you have some business with him?”<p>“If it’s Kokonoe-chan, he’s skipping school!”</p>

<p>Mineta, however, was the one who yelled. Kedou’s expression turned severe.<p>“What? He didn’t come? No, that’s strange. He was supposed to be on his way to school this morning.”<p>“M-Mutsuki, this is not good. This is–“<p>“Come to think of it, Fujishiro Sensei said she hasn’t heard anything from him.”<p>” What should we do, maybe he just went home like that ……”<p>“Senpai, what’s going on?”<p>“I want to know too. I tried to contact him, but he never replied.”<p>The bustle and noise filled with mystery spread out.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I can’t talk about it too casually. Yumi, let’s go to the staff room.”<p>“Yes, we have to hurry!”<p>The class was quiet as the two Senpai students rushed out in a hurry with impatient expressions on their faces.<p>The air was filled with a sense that something must have happened.<p>“I’ll go with you.”<p>Mihou runs out into the hallway.<p>Some of the students ran after him, following the back of the Senpai students.<p>“Fujishiro Sensei! Sorry for interrupting. Do you know anything about Kokonoe?”</p>

<p>The door to the staff room was opened with a bang. Fujishiro, who had been sitting down to eat a piece of bread, choked as her name was suddenly called out.<p>“—Gohogoho. W-What’s the matter, Kedou? How unusual. What about Kokonoe?”<p>“It’s our fault!”<p>“W-Wait a minute. Stop strangling me! Calm down. What’s going on?”<p>“Have you heard anything from Kokonoe? I heard he’s absent today.”<p>“Aah, he’s a real pain in the a*s, that guy. He was absent without notice.”<p>“You got it wrong. In the morning, he was—-!”<p>“Anyway, speak in chronological order! Stop hanging on me. You’re going to rip my neck out! What happened?”</p>

<p>They told Fujishiro about the details of this morning’s events. Fujishiro’s expression became more and more grim.<br><br>The other teachers were listening to the unusual situation, but by that time, Mihou and the others had arrived. Not noticing the situation, Kedou continued,</p><p>“So that’s why he didn’t show up today? But still, you’re lucky it ended in an attempt. If it had turned into a major incident, we would have had to get rid of someone.”<p>“I’m responsible for everything. He did nothing wrong!”</p><p>“If it had gone as it was, Kokonoe would have been innocent. If it had been left as it was, Kokonoe would have been in trouble, and if he was innocent, you guys would have been in trouble, on the contrary. Totally troublesome ……”<p>“What should we do, Sensei? Do you know where he is?”<p>“In that circumstance, I would think twice about an unexcused absence, but I haven’t heard from him either. Perhaps Yuuri would be able to do something–“<p>“Kokonoe–I see, Yuuri Kokonoe is his older sister!”<p>“Mutsuki, let’s go!”</p>

<p>“W-wait. Don’t be quick. I’ll call her on the broadcast</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Kedou PoV]</b>

<p>The situation became more and more chaotic.<p>This is not good, this is not good—!<p>When was the last time I had felt such a sense of urgency?<p>No, perhaps for the first time in my life. A vague sense of anxiety swirled in my chest.<p>During lunchtime, I headed to his class to make a formal apology. I checked his face in my memory against the student roster and immediately recognized his class. His name was Yukito Kokonoe.<p>His last line of dialogue stuck in my ears. My chest tightens as I wonder what I have done that cannot be undone. I have distorted and twisted his justice. I violently trampled and mistreated what he cherished.</p>

<p>I should never have harmed a student without protecting him, even though I am the president of the student council. I have always placed a high value on justice. I have tried to be fair and just.<p>People have gathered around me, and they have come to appreciate me.<br>And now I am in the position of student council president.<p>However, this is only the result of my actions. I have only followed the way of life and justice that I believe in. As a result, I am standing here now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>My beliefs were shaken. I am amazed at how fragile and weak my standpoint is.<p>Fear that my justice may have destroyed someone else’s justice.</p><p>He did nothing wrong. His actions are justice itself. I don’t think I acted wrongly either, and if the same thing were to happen to someone else, I would move without hesitation.<p>Still, it was my fault and my sin that I was not thoughtful enough, that I did not listen, that I fell into narrow-mindedness, and that I hurt the other person unilaterally. I must atone for that.<p>Otherwise, I will never be able to act according to my own justice again.<br>My justice must not be a distortion of someone else’s justice.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I can’t stop the turmoil in my heart. This is the second time I have felt this way.<p>Why do I remember it now? Is it because I saw the look in his eyes as he was leaving?<br>He didn’t come to school. Of course it was my fault. It’s because I hurt him. What is he doing now? Is he grieving? Is he in despair? Does he hate me as a person?<br>I am afraid. I am afraid to see him. And yet, I still want to say to him…</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Yuuri PoV]</b>

<p>“What have you done to him!”<p>“Yuuri, calm down! Can’t you get in touch with Yukito?”<p>“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier!”<p>“Weren’t you two going to school together?”<p>“He went alone today! Aah, mou!”</p>

<p>I was so furious that everyone around me was horrified, but that wasn’t the point.<p>What a stupid senpai. The student body president. I can’t believe that such a person is the student body president! Again. Someone has hurt him again. Just like me. Just like they did to the boy. I hurry to make a phone call. He’ll answer if it’s from me.<p>After a few calls, the connection is easily connected to the mesh, regardless of my concern.<p>“Yukito! Where are you?”<p>[At the ocean?]<p>“Eh, ocean?”<p>The people around me start to get confused. Of course they would. It’s not the kind of place you would skip school to go to. The fact that the situation is so complicated stirs up unpleasant imaginings.<p>“You’re not thinking of throwing yourself into the sea, right?!”</p>

<p>Impatience rushed to my mouth. Tension clearly ran through the staff room. It was not only Fujishiro, the homeroom teacher.<p>The other teachers were watching with bated breath.<p>[Ahahaha. That’s really funny!]<p>“It’s not a laughing matter!]<p>[I can’t find what I have lost, so I’m about to leave. Ah, I have some souvenirs for you.]<p>“What souvenirs?! where are you going?”<p>[I’m a problem child, so it doesn’t matter]<p>“—- ‘problem child’? ……I never thought my words would affect him ……”</p>

<p>Fujishiro was mumbling something, but I couldn’t care less at the moment.<p>“After all, the International Exhibition Hall is only open during the Obon and New Year’s holidays.”<p>“What are you talking about? Anyway, I heard what’s going on. You’re okay, aren’t you ……? You’re really coming back, right ……?”</p><p>[Just wait for while you’re at the high school. I won’t bother you anymore.]<p>“…… high school? Wait. What do you mean? Could it be that you–?”<p>[I’ll be going soon. It’s too early to leave.]<p>“—!? Stop it, Yukito! That’s not what I—-“<p>[I will be going home]</p>

<p>The call disconnects. I was in a state of shock. I didn’t think that even now…<p>“O-oi Yuuri. You seem distraught, are you okay?”<p>“He’s going home for now.”<p>“I-I see.”<p>“So he is going home now. I think he will come to school normally tomorrow. Why don’t we talk to him tomorrow? There is nothing more we can do today.”<p>“Yuuri, I’m really sorry!”<p>“I’m very sorry!”<p>“I will never forgive you.”</p>

<p>I left the staff room without a single glance. I saw the faces of Yukito’s classmates.<br>I could no longer hear what they had to say. I couldn’t get the last words of my brother out of my mind. I knew it was true. I had a feeling that one day, if I had seen the way he was behaving, that such a day would come.<p>I still remember what he said to me. The feeling that lingers in my hand. The tired, exhausted look on his face. The little bit of Yukito’s true feelings that leaked out during the conversation. It is extremely rare for him to reveal even the slightest of his true feelings. That’s how much he may have been thinking about today’s incident.</p><p>He had asked me to wait for him during my high school years. If that is the case, the time limit is now only three years until graduation. After that, it would be too late.<p>Suzurikawa that was a childhood friend of his. My brother was getting better by being in touch with her. I was relieved. I knew I could trust her. Before I knew it, however, things had returned to normal. No, it had gotten worse. And his childhood friend, who should have always been next to him, was gone.<p>As he threw himself into basketball to forget her, this time a woman named Shioro Kamishiro was snuggled up to my younger brother. He was slowly getting to know her. I hoped that maybe it was her, but she was also gone after hurting my brother as much as she hurt him.<p>I didn’t think that even the student body president would enter my brother’s trauma race, but why do all these women, including me, gather around my brother?<p>What my brother needs is not someone to hurt. I don’t trust anyone anymore. There is no one to trust anymore. It has to be me. This time, I will never betray him—</p>

<b style= "text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</b>

<p>It is said that even if the warrior can’t afford to buy the meal, he will proudly flaunt a toothpick, I am not a samurai, I am a high school student, not even in the Edo period. Nevertheless, I would like to live in such a noble way. Even I, whose life is closed off from the rest of the world, have that kind of yearning. I’m going to banish the Bantenren<p>Be that as it may, it is now lunchtime. I am standing in the hallway in front of my classroom.<p>In front of me, the student body president and vice president are on their knees. What is this situation?</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Yukito Kokonoe! Please forgive me.”<p>“I’m sorry, Kokonoe-kun!”<p>Needless to say, the classroom was abuzz. The students who were walking in the corridor also stopped and looked at the situation from a distance. Pictures were being taken with their cell phones. For now, I’m going to make a W-piece. We stand out. It stands out as a ruinous and bitter chachiya. No, it’s crazy, isn’t it! Are they warriors? When did I become a feudal lord? It’s time to go to work.<p>“Hold your heads up. No, I’m just kidding. Please stand up, you’re standing out.”<p>“I want to sincerely apologize for hurting you.”</p>

<p>“Uhm….Thank you for trying to help me!”<p>“Didn’t I say that I had it enough?”<p>Finally, the student body president and vice president looked up and stood up. In the meantime, the gathering continued to grow, but the two were either oblivious to their surroundings or not paying any attention to them.<p>Objectively speaking, there is no way that a third-year student walking up to a first-year student’s classroom and getting down on their knees to apologize would not attract attention. The student body president was on the other end of the line. The student body president was on the verge of becoming a star. I would love to be sidetracked. My road to being a loser had a red light on it.<br><br>And if she’s going to apologize, shouldn’t she at least bring one of those golden buns with the koban on them? No doubt, Echigoya must be furious.<p>” I cannot have it that way. This is important to me too!”<p>“You know, I need to do something for you.”</p><p>“Please leave me alone.”<p>I tell them as coldly as possible, because the more I get involved, the more it will be unilaterally my loss.</p>

<p>“Yukito Kokonoe —- Hold me!”<p>“I was wondering if you’d let me buy you a drink or something— Mutsuki-chan?!”<p>Senpai has a very clear and smooth voice. She is indeed the president of the student council. This school is in good hands. Yeah, yeah. I’m glad the vice president is sane. I know, I know! I’m just trying to escape reality, damn it! For now, I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that. I’m the main character, so I can use this kind of technique.</p>

<p>“Eh, what is this?”</p><p>“I’m new to this too, Yukito. If possible, I want you to use this.”<p>My technique was a failure due to lack of skill. I will be diligent. Struggling, Senpai handed something to me. The box was marked 0.01 mm. I don’t know …… don’t know……. It looks too familiar. There was also one at Sekka’s house. It was placed in an exquisite position in the field of view, as if it was very appealing.<p>And, isn’t it kind of thin? The development of technology is amazing!<p>“But if you don’t want to wear it, I will accept it.”</p>

<p>“Mutsuki-chan! Hey, this is strange, what’s going on?!”<p>Gakugaku, the vice president, Mikumo-senpai, is shaking the president, but Kedou-senpai is not making the slightest move. Her back is straight and straight, and I can see that her core is well-trained. How wonderful.<p>“As long as you want to, I’m fine without it!”<p>“You’re out of control! Please, come to your senses!”<p>“Yuumi, I’m sane.”<p>“You’re not sane at all?!”<p>Come to think of it, it was almost time for exams. I’m confident in my academic abilities, so tests are nothing to be dreaded. It was a bonus time to be happy that school was over early. My thoughts were drifting off to somewhere else, because my mind was going crazy when I heard it. Because listening to them makes me crazy.<p>“But as far as I’ve been able to find out, the one thing that boys love to receive is a form of—–“</p>

<p>“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”<p>“That’s what the magazine said. If I had made a mistake, I might have ended Kokonoe’s life due to my shallow thinking. Then it would be unfair if I didn’t bet my life on it, too. Kokonoe, it’s an apology. Please accept it!”<p>This is the thing. The chairman is the same kind as Sekka-san. A predator of the same class as the ravenous birds of prey. Maybe I’m just a herbivore to be hunted. I will live a quiet life.<p>“Senpai, even if you are embraced with such a feeling of redemption and guilt, I will not be happy”<p>“W-What ……But you may indeed have a point.”<p>“T-That’s right, Mutsuki. Let’s cool down a bit and reconsider, shall we?”</p>

<p>“No but Kokonoe. The feeling of redemption is there, of course. And yet, that’s not all!””<p>“Ah, this person can’t be saved”<p>I tried to say something like that with a smug look on my face, but I failed. I had no experience either, but this was the only way to get through this. It is a shame for a man not to have a meal, but I am not that hungry. A normal meal is enough to satisfy my hunger.<p>“Besides, I’m heading to the store today, so if you’ll excuse me!”<p>The 36th strategy is the best way to escape. I fled the scene. The strategy of defeat is one of the most common strategies used in the Art of War when you are outnumbered. I had lost from the beginning.<p>“HEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!”<p>My screams reached the end of the corridor.<p>I had escaped from the pervert’s clutches and fled to the fire escape. This was the place for a serious rest and relaxation. I let out a sigh of exhaustion and sat down. And, for some reason, there was a guest in front of me. It was a familiar figure. She is one of the twelve gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>“Aphrodite Senpai?”<p>“Hmmph”<p>She ignored me. She seemed to be angry. I was mentally exhausted after being involved with the President, and I didn’t have the energy to deal with her. Everyone has bad mood days. Even my sister has such a day at least once a month. It’s better not to get involved at times like this.<p>I opened the bag of grape bread and cheese milk bread I had bought. This time it was a perfect match. The combination was a real winner.<p>“Uhm, why are you ignoring me and starting to eat?”<p>“It’s a pain in the *ss …… Oh, I mean that in a good way.”<p>“Didn’t I tell you that saying that doesn’t mean you’re allowed to do it?”<p>“Even if you say that, it doesn’t matter to me.”</p>

<p>“It does! Don’t you remember what you said to me when we met before?”<p>“What did I say?”<p>“You said you would come here once or twice a week! But when I came to check on you, you weren’t here at all.”<p>Come to think of it, something like that had happened. I had forgotten all about it. The weather was bad, and I remember that I usually ate in the classroom. But I’m not afraid to tell the truth about it, so I’m going to cover it up. I am a man who can read the air without making a corner, and that is me.<p>“I was going through a lot. I mean, Aphrodite-senpai, did you come here every day?”<p>“Ugh. Not really? I just come here because sometimes I want to be alone, not because I care about you, okay?”</p>

<p>“What, you’re just a shady loner like me? Hahahahaha.”<p>“Stop it! Don’t put us together! And what’s wrong with the name?!”<p>“You see, you are a goddess”<p>“It’s getting complicated in a roundabout way!”<p>“But I don’t know my senpai’s name. ……”<p>“I introduced myself, didn’t I? Right? Y-You’re learning all the wrong things.”<p>“Why is it that the grapes in grape bread don’t really feel like grapes?”<p>“Listen to me! You should be interested in me. I’m pretty popular among the second graders.”</p>

p>“Keh, you think you’re a star, huh?”<p>“Stop being so harsh! You’re embarrassing me.”<p>“Well, well, well. –Huh? Why is Suzurikawa here ……?”<p>As I was taking in Aphrodite-senpai’s self-deprecating boasts, I saw a couple approaching. They looked nervous. They didn’t look like friends.<p>“What’s going on…..tasteless. They’re coming this way, aren’t they?”<p>“Why don’t you just be cool about it? We’re not doing anything wrong.”<p>“It’s awkward! He must be confessing his feelings.”<p>“Aah, I remember Aphrodite-senpai was also confessed here”</p>

<p>“Fufu. That’s right. I’m very popular!”<p>“Cheese and milk bread is really interesting because they’re two different kinds of dairy products.”<p>“You’re really are testing my limits, aren’t you? Ah, come on, hide!”<p>Senpai quickly pulled me by the hand and took me to the shade of a tree.<p>“Do you know either of them by any chance?”<p>“Yes. The girl is a classmate of mine.”<p>“I’d be so nervous if it were me, but I’m thrilled to be a part of something like this!”<p>We are just suspicious people who sneak a peek at the situation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, they are exchanging some words with each other. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but my guess is that it’s Suzurikawa who’s been summoned. Come to think of it, she said she had broken up with her senpai. If that is true, it is not surprising that she is embarking on a new love life.<p>The confession is over, or they are going back to their separate ways.<p>“Haa ……. I was nervous. She was pretty cute, but what happened?”<p>“You’re making it sound like you’re prettier than her, Senpai, lunch break is almost over.”</p><p>“I really need to settle things with you.”<p>The chime rings and we split up. Crap. I failed to get her name after all. Who is she? If not Aphrodite, then Athena. If she’s a famous person, I’m sure I won’t miss her. If I encounter an acquaintance whose name I don’t remember or have forgotten, I can say Tanaka, Sato, or Suzuki, and the percentage of correct answers is about 20%. Most of the time, after that, they will tell me their names, so there is no problem. This was another way of getting around.<p>At that time, I was unaware of it.<br>The presence of one student who stared darkly at the men and women returning to their classrooms.</p>
