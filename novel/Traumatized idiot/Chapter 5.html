<h2>Chapter 5: Yuri Kokonoe</h2>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Shakado PoV]</h4>



<p>I, Anya Shakado, am an introvert. My history as an introvert goes back sixteen years. It&#8217;s a well-seasoned introversion, and a lifelong dedication&#8230; Hihihi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hihi&#8230; I brought you some food. H-here, Chi-chan. Have your meal&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I feed Chi-chan, the chameleon inside the cage. Its long tongue extends and grabs the food. I watch with a smirk on my face&#8230; No, not a cute smile, yes. A sly smile. Hihihi&#8230;</p>



<p>Chi-chan&#8217;s skin is looking great today. Compared to me, we&#8217;re worlds apart&#8230;</p>



<p>But you know what, Chi-chan? I&#8217;ve been working hard on my skincare lately. I try to talk to it, but Chi-chan remains indifferent, just as always. This tsundere&#8230;!</p>



<p>I, Anya Shakado, am a lover of reptiles.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always loved reptiles, but it seems nobody else shares the same enthusiasm. It didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize that my interest in reptiles was an unusual one for a girl.</p>




<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why, from my early memories of kindergarten, but especially in elementary and middle school, I didn&#8217;t have many friends. I couldn&#8217;t join in the girlish conversations of my classmates and remained untouched by romance. I was always alone, sitting in a corner of the classroom.</p>



<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FFWJ4DhH7yLsajoXirCJGm6lx1thWhxpB1ROI9ZrIOa0r5LvGNyFtsKlM9WvF51F_wAvxd1cvuCrZI2qj1n_q8rHU5yFPmYiv1OmSt7mlvbhc4pI7f3neCfVVg2pRDkrc-Vsx2xdinaTlCONrBY62GY"/>



<p>I… I am truly an introvert… Always with messy hair, hunched posture, and a gloomy smile, no one in my class would ever want to approach me.</p>



<p>Forming pairs, creating groups with people you like… That was impossible for me. I was always forced to join groups where there were leftovers.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was never bullied or mistreated. Rather, people found me repulsive and kept their distance. They didn&#8217;t even know I liked reptiles; I kept that a secret. But my introverted aura seemed to push my classmates away.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I had become invisible, treated as if I didn&#8217;t exist. Maybe I had also turned into a colorless, transparent being.</p>



<p>I remember back in elementary school when I told a girl, with whom I often talked, that I liked reptiles. She said, &#8220;You&#8217;re weird.&#8221; It was a gentle denial wrapped in a euphemism, and I realized that she stopped talking to me after that.</p>



<p>Even someone as socially inept as me can tell when someone is being overtly rejected. &#8220;You&#8217;re weird.&#8221; Underneath that, there&#8217;s a feeling of creepiness. When I realized that, I cried.</p>



<p>I, Anya Shakado, am weird.</p>



<p>That thought became natural to me. Gradually, I stopped talking to my classmates, and my rejection was naturally conveyed to them.</p>



<p>Isolation deepened, and I remained alone, always vaguely unseen by anyone, as the colorless, transparent Anya Shakado, kept in the classroom cage.</p>



<p>My parents worry that, as an only child, I don&#8217;t have any friends, but there&#8217;s nothing they can do about it. Maybe they should have given me a younger brother or sister. I might try asking for one on my birthday. Hihihi.</p>



<p>But, it can&#8217;t be helped, can it? I don&#8217;t know how to make friends…</p>



<p>Talking to others is difficult. The threshold for introverts is high. Curiously, I find it harder to communicate with humans than with Chi-chan. The world is so unfair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you lonely, Chi-chan…..&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder how Chi-chan, always alone, feels. I can&#8217;t comprehend its emotions, but I still have these conversations with Chi-chan every day. I didn&#8217;t want to go to school. I just wanted to play with my pet like this.</p>



<p>I go to school because I have to. I don&#8217;t want to worry my family any further… Hihihi.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure it will continue like this in high school. Just like in elementary and middle school, the introverted me will be treated as an invisible presence, an non-existent being. Tedious daily life, colorless every day… That&#8217;s what I thought.</p>



<p>――Before entering high school.</p>




<p>But then, I met him. A god. There was a god in this world&#8230;</p>



<p>Before entering high school, I thought I was different. But perhaps that was a misunderstanding. The words I heard in elementary school weren&#8217;t true. My perception shattered like tiles falling off. I was like a frog in a well; before me lay an immense ocean.</p>



<p>He is someone who doesn&#8217;t care about anything.</p>



<p>To him, I&#8217;m just ordinary. Overwhelmingly ordinary. I&#8217;m embarrassed by my misconceptions and feel extremely ashamed.</p>



<p>Unbelievably dazzling, overwhelmingly intense—he doesn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m different. He doesn&#8217;t think that of anyone. He doesn&#8217;t care.</p>



<p>Y-Yes. That is charisma. The introverted charisma.</p>



<p>Thanks to him, now I&#8217;m just a regular classmate as well.</p>



<p>He turned me from being special to being ordinary. Anya Shakado, who is not special but just ordinary.</p>



<p>This brought a significant change within me, turning the school, which used to be so burdensome, into something enjoyable. During summer vacation, I feel lonely because I can&#8217;t go to school…</p>




<p>Now, for the first time, I&#8217;m able to enjoy school life without isolation.</p>



<p>However, as I have grown so accustomed to the life of an introvert, I am puzzled about how to communicate. I clearly lack experience.</p>



<p>Still, no one rejects me. Even when my love for reptiles was exposed, my classmates accepted it as part of my individuality. And of course, they should. There&#8217;s someone with an incredibly strong personality right in front of us. My uniqueness is nothing compared to that.</p>



<p>I remembered the day when my love for reptiles was exposed. Right after entering school, I was looking at my Chi-chan collection in the classroom when he passed by and immediately recognized that Chi-chan was a Panther Chameleon. He said he had considered having one as a pet before.</p>



<p>He unexpectedly knew a lot about them, and I got excited and talked about it, but he didn&#8217;t seem to mind and accepted it without a second thought.</p>



<p>Since then, something has changed. I don&#8217;t know how my mindset shifted, but people started naturally talking to me more. Maybe it was me who was rejecting and distancing myself.</p>



<p>Ever since, I have started feeling embarrassed about my messy hair and started to care a little more about my appearance.</p>



<p>Of course, because I used to be so indifferent, it didn&#8217;t come naturally. When I went to ask Mom what to do, she was very happy to help. Hihi… I&#8217;m sorry to trouble you.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, people started talking to me without hesitation. Maybe it was me who was rejecting them all along.</p>




<p>The &#8220;Invisible Aura&#8221; acts like a barrier. I learned that if I take even a small step forward, there are people who will respond to it.</p>



<p>I received a notification on my phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Who could it be…? It&#8217;s from Eli-chan…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I checked the screen, and it was a message from Eli-chan.</p>



<p>An invitation to hang out. Eli-chan is actually Sakura, a completely opposite type of girl compared to me. She&#8217;s a top-tier girl in the social hierarchy, someone I wouldn&#8217;t normally associate with. Even though I call her Elizabeth in my mind to show respect, I can&#8217;t bring myself to say it out loud in front of her. Only he, the god, can confidently call her Elizabeth. He is truly a god. Trembling all over, I read Eli-chan&#8217;s message.</p>



<p>&#8220;P-P-P-P-Pool!? Is she planning to sink me by luring me out, or is it the kind of outing where we swim in swimsuits!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Instead of just inviting me to hang out, she suggested going to the pool. As an introvert, it&#8217;s beyond my capacity.</p>



<p>Fuaaaa, what should I do? What should I do?! I can&#8217;t stay like this.</p>



<p>I rushed out of my room and headed to the living room.</p>




<p>&#8220;Mama… W-w-w-w-what should I do!? M-My friend invited me to hang out, but what if it&#8217;s at the pool and I need a school swimsuit!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mama&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, and she seemed to be on the verge of tears.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you finally made such a friend, An-chan… I&#8217;m so happy for you! But, An-chan, I don&#8217;t think you have a school swimsuit. Shall we go buy a cute one together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see… I didn&#8217;t think of that. Thank you so much for telling me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mama was in a very good mood. She seems happy lately.</p>



<p>The loneliness I used to feel has disappeared somewhere. I wish the class wouldn&#8217;t change until graduation. I wouldn&#8217;t have thought about such things in the past.</p>



<p>He, who creates daily chaos, is also stirring up my dull daily life. Every day is a whirlwind of changes. But it&#8217;s so enjoyable and pleasant that I can&#8217;t help it.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, Yukito Kokonoe is the man who is worshiped by his classmates without realizing it.</p>


<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</h4>




<p>It must have been annoying. I&#8217;m sorry, Yuri.</p>



<p>We go to school together in the morning and sometimes she sleeps in my room at night.</p>



<p>It pains me to see my mom&#8217;s eyes filled with sadness, like an abandoned puppy. Sorry …….</p>



<p>On holidays, we went shopping and watched movies together. We even went bowling together.</p>



<p>Basically, she never denies me what I want to do. She affirms everything I want to do.</p>



<p>I tried to make her &#8220;less sensitive&#8221; to me, but apparently she is not less sensitive to me as well as Himiyama-san and my mom are.</p>



<p>As soon as I said I needed to buy suspenders, my older sister rushed out of the house without a moment&#8217;s hesitation. When she returned, I was met with a terrible sight. This must be the infamous &#8220;Gate of Nakedness&#8221; that everyone talks about. But, could such a thing really happen?</p>



<p>Even as the sister of the villainess in a story, if I go too far, my sister will retaliate.</p>



<p>Over the past week, I&#8217;ve identified the cause and reached one conclusion.</p>




<p>My sister is clearly pushing herself too hard.</p>



<p>The more I try to get close to her, the more she tries to accept me, but her expression tightens, her heart pounds intensely, and her breathing becomes erratic. Her body trembles, and she breaks out in a cold sweat.</p>



<p>Trying to force our broken relationship back to normal only creates a distorted and fractured illusion.</p>



<p>There was one time my sister showed me her true feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate you! Just disappear!&#8221;</p>



<p>With those words, she pushed me away from the playground equipment in the park.</p>



<p>I ended up being seriously injured and had to be hospitalized, but I never resent my sister.</p>



<p>It was my fault for always sticking around her. I should have disappeared just as she said.</p>



<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve tried my best to avoid any interactions with my sister.</p>



<p>Now, in hindsight, it was probably the right decision. Those words she spoke back then were her true feelings.</p>



<p>Things began to change after I entered high school. It&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;m starting to realize.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why my sister is suffering. It&#8217;s become especially apparent lately; she&#8217;s deliberately keeping her distance. She spends most of her time locked up in her room and sometimes avoids meeting me altogether.</p>



<p>Of course, when I visit her room, she warmly welcomes me, and she&#8217;s always willing to do things together when asked.</p>



<p>But I know. Afterward, she&#8217;s suffering alone.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve even heard her crying late at night.</p>



<p>Yes, my sister had been forcing herself to like me.</p>



<p>After my serious injury, my sister, tormented by guilt, tried to become an unwavering ally. She vowed never to repeat the terrible incident she caused.</p>



<p>She used her rationality to suppress her true feelings of dislike.</p>




<p>Inside my sister, there exists only the feeling of liking me.</p>



<p>She will never allow herself to harbor any other emotion toward me.</p>



<p>However, if she continues to force herself like this, there will be a breaking point.</p>



<p>Between the conflicting emotions, my sister continues to suffer.</p>



<p>There is no reason for us to get along just because we are siblings.</p>



<p>If she dislikes me, then it&#8217;s okay. Trying to forcefully deny it only makes things complicated.</p>



<p>There are siblings who don&#8217;t get along, and there are countless others who remain indifferent to each other.</p>



<p>Since the accident, my sister and I have maintained a suitable distance from each other. Thus, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine that the current situation, where that distance is wavering, is an unbearable pain for her.</p>



<p>Realizing this, I purposely closed the distance between us over the past week.</p>




<p>What my sister needs is the courage to admit that she dislikes me.</p>



<p>To release her heart from the prison of lies and face her true feelings.</p>



<p>I can see that my sister is growing increasingly haggard day by day. She&#8217;s reaching her limit of endurance.</p>



<p>Even so, I won&#8217;t stop getting closer to her. Even if it pushes her to a corner, I will continue until she completely reveals everything.</p>



<p>Enough is enough. She has cherished me until today.</p>



<p>My sister has endured so much suffering. From now on, she should seek her own happiness.</p>



<p>I somehow understand that this is what independence means.</p>



<p>Until now, my sister protected me under her wing. But that time is over.</p>



<p>I can handle most things on my own, and there are plenty of allies around me who will help.</p>




<p>My sister doesn&#8217;t need the curse called &#8220;Yukito&#8221; anymore.</p>



<p>I hold deep respect for my sister. The time to say goodbye has come.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for staying by my side, even while disliking me. Nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>All that remains now is a feeling of gratitude.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the campsite?&#8221;</p>



<p>I dismount from my cross bike and survey the surroundings.</p>



<p>An open grassland bathed in sunlight. The vibrant young leaves shimmer beautifully.</p>



<p>The refreshing scent of new greenery tickles my nose. I take a deep breath, savoring the great outdoors.</p>



<p>&#8220;Finally, we made it&#8221; </p>



<p>My sister also gets off her cross bike. Sweat glistens on her, making her look beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay? It must have been tiring&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still getting used to it, but I practiced and took enough breaks. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>




<p>My sister and I rode our cross bikes for two hours to reach this natural park.</p>



<p>Since we are underage, it&#8217;s a day trip. Camping is often associated with roughing it out in the mountains, but modern campsites come with all the facilities, making it enjoyable even for beginners.</p>



<p>I invited my sister to change her mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;You were plucking hair from your butt, so it&#8217;s a little painful&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t plucking anything!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen my butt hole, so it doesn&#8217;t matter now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that my fault?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And you even counted the wrinkles.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said, is that my fault?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep it clean and tidy, anytime you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Hey, what are you saying?! Hey, say something?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The first Kokonoe family mahjong tournament ended in a disaster. I won the tournament, but the extreme match-fixing battle between three people with me not wanting to win and them wanted me to win lasted until late at night.</p>



<p>In the end, in the late-night excitement, the situation became so unspeakably disastrous that I thought they&#8217;d report it to the BPO, but I buried those memories in the darkness of history.</p>



<p>By the way, all three of them gave me a yakuman. They are merciless villains.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next week is the Pantyhose Ripping Championship&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Genius idea, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>It sounds incredibly fun. In modern society, we all battle with stress. Everyone has their own way of relieving stress, but there are entertainment facilities where you can throw an axe at the wall or break dishes, satisfying the urge for destruction. It&#8217;s undoubtedly an effective way to relieve stress.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret. I&#8217;m the one with the thinnest denier.&#8221; [TL: Denier, also referred to as den, <strong>measures the thickness of tights</strong>. The lower the denier, the thinner and more sheer the tights will be. Even though we offer tights of the best quality, higher denier and thus more opaque pairs of tights are more durable than more sheer ones.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you suddenly violate the regulations?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom wears compression stockings; she&#8217;s not my enemy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And even if she takes the dominant position?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sekka-san is a despicable woman. Even if she pretends to be clean and neat, she is still a despicable woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of discussions are going on behind my back?&#8221;</p>



<p>The darkness within the Kokonoe family runs deep.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what kind of competition is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We compete to see how beautifully we can rip the pantyhose we&#8217;re wearing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have absolutely no idea what you&#8217;re talking about, but I&#8217;ll pretend to understand for now.&#8221;</p>




<p>I&#8217;m afraid to imagine, so I go along with it as I finish the registration.</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s surrounded by nature, the building has all the necessary facilities, including toilets, and all the equipment is available for rent.</p>



<p>After entering the assigned tent and lying down, I find it surprisingly comfortable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should I give you a knee pillow? Your muscles must be sore after all that cycling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>I forced her into it, yet my sister didn&#8217;t complain and went along with it. I&#8217;m truly grateful to her.</p>



<p>The two-hour cycling trip provided a pleasant feeling of fatigue, but the way back might be somewhat challenging. I resolve to take more breaks on the return journey.</p>



<p>&#8220;But seriously, was it really okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister&#8217;s expression clouds over. I bought the cross bike we used for the cycling.</p>




<p>It cost almost 200,000 yen (1431,93 dollar or 1279,24 euro) for the two bikes combined. I usually save my allowance diligently, so it&#8217;s not an issue, but for a high school student, it&#8217;s a considerable amount, and I understand why my sister would be concerned.</p>



<p>However, I was more worried that I might no longer be considered under mother&#8217;s support.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have some extra income. By the way, would you like to help with part-time jobs too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll support you, so you don&#8217;t need to work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A typical sister who spoils her younger brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you need money, I&#8217;ll earn it for you. I could even try sugar dating—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever say that again.&#8221;</p>



<p>I grab my sister&#8217;s shoulders and look into her eyes. Yuri is serious.</p>



<p>A self-sacrifice so painful it hurts to watch. She would never do such a thing for her own sake, but if it were for me, she might carry it out without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>If I don&#8217;t break the cursed chain binding my sister, she might end up hurting herself someday, believing it&#8217;s her way of atoning.</p>



<p>Today is the only day to settle things. I must make my sister admit that she hates me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you I have extra income, right? I&#8217;m getting a bit hungry, so let&#8217;s have a meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>I take my sister&#8217;s hand. It used to be my sister who always held my hand.</p>



<p>In place of our busy mother, my sister tried her best. Yet, thoughtlessly, I didn&#8217;t consider her feelings and destroyed everything. It was me who pulled the trigger for her downfall.</p>



<p>The one burdened with the greatest sin is not my sister, but me, and it&#8217;s even more heinous.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been exploiting my sister&#8217;s guilt and extracting her kindness as a great sinner.</p>



<p>An unconscious demon, a king of tyranny. I enjoyed her one-sided devotion and acted arrogantly.</p>



<p>I took away my sister&#8217;s smiles and her life, and yet I still crave more.</p>



<p>After being pushed from the playground equipment, I unknowingly exacted revenge, pushing my sister into hell. I accepted her apology, but I didn&#8217;t grant her forgiveness. It&#8217;s utterly cruel and heartless.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m a demon.&#8221;</p>



<p>If my sister is an angel, then I am a demon. So, I will embrace that role to the fullest.</p>



<p>Even if I hurt her again, this will be the last time.</p>



<p>&#8220;What should we do at the camp? Want to play mobile games?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it outdoor or indoor camping, a philosophical question.&#8221;</p>



<p>Doing things like entering a heated kotatsu and eating ice cream in the middle of summer is a sinful act. In the midst of skyrocketing electricity bills, it&#8217;s an unforgivable act.</p>



<p>Lunch is, of course, a barbecue. No need for primitive fire-starting methods.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m grateful for modern conveniences, but I worry if we could survive on a deserted island after a shipwreck without them.</p>



<p>In the American father&#8217;s house, it was all about meat, so this time, I prepared seafood for the BBQ too.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister is struggling with the grilled turban shell, so I take it from her and quickly remove the meat. Yuri is not good at dealing with bitter tastes, so I take out the liver for her and hand it over.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. But why turban shell?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to cherish seasonal ingredients. Plus, eating only meat might get tiresome.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always so particular. I wonder what will become of you in the future?&#8221;</p>


<p>Since studying under the chef, my culinary skills have improved dramatically.</p>



<p>Until now, my cooking skills were strictly limited to household chores, but I have become capable of making elaborate dishes and has started to specialize. Thanks to that, I have begun to develop peculiar obsessions with ingredients and such.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san, the meat is done.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. I can&#8217;t help but eat a lot, but I have to be careful not to gain weight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;On the contrary, you&#8217;re too thin. I think it&#8217;s okay to gain some more weight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think so? I guess that&#8217;s true. If I want to lose weight, I can just move my hips on top of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This beef tongue is so delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>Munch, munch. Pretending not to notice the awkward text message from a friend is also an act of kindness.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve repeated self-destructive behavior by making unnecessary remarks and digging myself into a hole.</p>


<p>The secret to living a peaceful life is to &#8220;see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,&#8221; as Confucius said.</p>



<p>I peel the shrimp and hand it to my sister. Yuri is clumsy. Perhaps feeling a bit sorry or maintaining her dignity, she responds with an &#8220;Ahn&#8221; to the chicken she has.</p>



<p>Under the dazzling sunlight, I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ with my sister.</p>





<p>&#8220;Phew, I&#8217;m full.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s start cleaning up.&#8221;</p>



<p>We quickly begin to clean up. Since the camping equipment is rented, we only need to take back the leftover ingredients.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, why did you suddenly decide to go camping?&#8221;</p>



<p>A question that should have been asked earlier. I should have confirmed it when I invited her.</p>



<p>However, whenever I say I want to do something, my sister never questions me. She just accepts it. And I do the same for her. That&#8217;s why our relationship was twisted.</p>



<p>I look up at the blue sky and check the position of the sun. It might be the right time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just wait a moment! I&#8217;ll get the things.&#8221;</p>



<p>I go to retrieve the boxes that I had sent to the camping site beforehand.</p>



<p>As my sister observes the two boxes, she looks puzzled.</p>



<p>Without paying any mind to that, I carefully unwrap the well-packed materials with a cutter.</p>



<p>The item I take out is a picture inside a frame.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ta-da! Here, a present for you, Nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A present for me? You even bought me a cross bike, so what could it be&#8211;?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister gasps. She stares intently at the picture.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s titled &#8216;My Sister Ten Years Later.&#8217; How do you like it?&#8221;</p>



<p>In the middle of the grassland, a woman in a white dress stands, basking in the sunlight.</p>



<p>She wears a dazzling smile, as if capturing a moment of happiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;At first, I thought about entering this painting into an art contest, but Sanjoji-Sensei suggested that only you should see it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure if she can hear me or not, but my sister remains unresponsive. Did I mess up?</p>



<p>&#8220;…Ten years later? But this, this picture of me is …….&#8221;</p>



<p>Her trembling hand traces the image of herself in the painting.</p>



<p>Yes, my sister depicted in the painting is not the twenty-seven-year-old adult she will become in ten years, but the current seventeen-year-old Yuri. The painting is based on my imagination of how my sister, who was always with me and played with me back then, would have grown into a lovely woman with a smile that suits her.</p>



<p>After the accident, my sister apologized over and over again, and I just accepted it.</p>


<p>After that, the days of my sister&#8217;s redemption began. I noticed that my sister stopped smiling when I was six years old. Now, ten years later, she is still imprisoned in her own guilt.</p>



<p>In the painting is my ideal image of my sister, the way she used to be when I loved her so much. It&#8217;s the future that should have been, a fate that I twisted and bent in conflict.</p>



<p>I put my wish into the painting, hoping that she would smile like she used to.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukito. Could it be that the scenery in this painting is…?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister looks around as if she just realized something. The grassy meadow swaying in the wind, the position of the sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks similar, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Everything matched the same situation as in the painting. Yuri must have noticed it too.</p>



<p>There are no words, but her expression speaks volumes. But it&#8217;s not over yet!</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuufuufuu. This is not the end!&#8221;</p>



<p>I managed to finish the white dress just in time. I&#8217;m proud of it.</p>



<p>The dress in the painting and the outfit she&#8217;s wearing are exactly the same. I accidentally made it too complicated and went through hell making it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you make this, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. The wedding dress was too difficult, so I went with a simple dress.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A wedding dress? Are you going to make me wear it…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Ah yeah, yeah. You seemed like you wanted to wear it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The wedding dress is indeed complex, and I&#8217;ve only managed to make the veil so far.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll have to ask Mom to wait a little longer. Life is a constant learning process.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you forgive me, Yukito, I would… even if it means going against the whole world in this world&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-wait! I&#8217;ll change quickly!&#8221;</p>



<p>My flustered sister rushes into the tent. I take out my single-lens reflex camera from my bag and check its functions. It&#8217;s a waste not to use it at a time like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Has she finished changing? My sister timidly pokes her head out of the tent, cheeks blushing. There stands an unquestionably beautiful woman.</p>



<p>A pure and lovely beauty that words can&#8217;t describe, a breathtakingly beautiful woman. A few seconds pass, then tens of seconds. I forget to breathe, mesmerized by the sight.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You look like an angel.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her pure white dress dances in the wind, like feathers floating gracefully.</p>



<p>The radiant angel, Yuri, manifested before me. Her divinity made me naturally bow in awe.</p>



<p>Yes, I just realized that. Ever since the accident, my sister started preferring black. I, too, wear more black-themed clothes now. But in the past, she loved wearing white. Yet she stopped wearing it because of me.</p>



<p>After my sister pushed me away and I fell, she rushed to care for me and tried to lift me up. Her white clothes were rapidly stained with blood, turning from white to red.</p>



<p>I never saw her wear the same clothes again after I returned home. She probably disposed of them. From then on, she started to prefer black, the color that wouldn&#8217;t be stained by blood.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all my fault. I took away her smile and twisted her preferences.</p>



<p>&#8220;I used to think that white didn&#8217;t suit me… but, it&#8217;s embarrassing, thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister&#8217;s words snap me back to reality. It&#8217;s not the time for remorse now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall I take a picture?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister nods and walks gently towards the meadow.</p>



<p>She takes off her shoes and walks barefoot, feeling the sensation of the earth with her arches.</p>



<p>The sunlight seems like a special effect, warmly welcoming her, illuminating her path.</p>



<p>Invited by the gentle breeze, mischievous spirits seem to guide her, blessing her with joy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this spot good?&#8221;</p>



<p>Perfect. But it&#8217;s not enough. There&#8217;s something missing, something that is more important than anything else.</p>



<p>I just want to see that, I just want that one thing to come true.</p>



<p>&#8220;Smile, please. Like you used to in the past.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yes, you&#8217;re right. Yukito, you worked so hard for this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not one to say this, after taking away your smile, but I really want you to smile again. I love that side of Nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>There have been many difficult times. I thought everyone around me was an enemy.</p>



<p>But there was someone who always supported me, who stood by my side.</p>



<p>Tears start flowing down my sister&#8217;s cheeks. Another discovery.</p>



<p>I thought she was someone who never cried. A strong person, so it shouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>



<p>――I really don&#8217;t know my sister as well as I thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukito. I wonder if I&#8217;m smiling properly? Like back then, when we were always playing together, like in the old days when you and I were good friends.……&#8221;</p>





<p>The wind brushes through her hair, silky and smooth.</p>



<p>A clumsy, awkward smile. But still, to me it is,</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. &#8211;It&#8217;s so beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>Through the viewfinder, I capture the world. Picture after picture.</p>



<p>If she looks at these photos, she&#8217;ll be reminded of her smile.</p>



<p>The scene before me is so fantastical and ephemeral, as if it could vanish at any moment.</p>



<p>At this moment, we are just brother and sister, with pure hearts.</p>



<p>I feel like I&#8217;ve returned to my childhood as I spend time with my sister.</p>



<p>There she is, the ideal big sister I painted in the picture.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had forgotten this feeling for so long.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her smile is like a field of blooming sunflowers, brightening up the whole place just by being there.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to thank you properly. So, look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I already received the best thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>I received the best gratitude possible. It feels like I&#8217;ve been rewarded, and it leaves me feeling refreshed.</p>



<p>Compared to the value of her smile, all the hardships I endured were trivial.</p>



<p>&#8220;Someday, if I were gone, would you be sad, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>A sudden question. But her expression is terrifyingly serious, and her voice trembles.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no need to think about it. It&#8217;s so foolishly obvious. There&#8217;s only one answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d cry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve never cried before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I cried recently.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mom&#8217;s son, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True&#8230; Mom is a crybaby too. I guess I&#8217;m the same.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister smiles gently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of how far we go, we&#8217;ll always be family, brother and sister. Maybe we&#8217;re similar in that sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re family, that&#8217;s all. You don&#8217;t need a reason to love your family. I just came to understand that again.&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister speaks as if she&#8217;s finally come to terms with something.</p>



<p>Under the clear blue sky, far above in the vast expanse, we, as brother and sister, return to a state of normalcy after a long time.</p>





<p>&#8220;Nee-san, should we head back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I won&#8217;t forget this day you gave me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The wind sways my sister&#8217;s long hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Yukito.&#8221;</p>



<p>She hugs me gently, and I am enveloped in the scent of the sun and the grass.</p>



<p>Is this what negative ions do? It must have a relaxing effect; I feel at ease.</p>



<p>On the other hand, impatience wells up from the depths of my chest.</p>



<p>Is what I&#8217;m about to do really the right thing?</p>



<p>If I end it here, things could end happily.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m torn between uncertainty and doubt. I don&#8217;t know the right answer. How much value is there in continuing to toy with my sister&#8217;s heart, and what will I gain from it?</p>



<p>I shake off my internal struggle. However, the melancholic feeling doesn&#8217;t dissipate.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yuri PoV]</h4>

<p>My little brother made me cry. I had sworn that I wouldn&#8217;t cry again, but he easily broke that vow. Pathetic. Yet, strangely, my heart feels uplifted.</p>



<p>Perhaps the tears I shed were not of sadness, but of joy.</p>



<p>When I get home, I decide to practice smiling in front of the mirror. I relax my cheek muscles, which are stiff and tight. I have to be worthy of the dress he made for me.</p>



<p>The feeling of awe still lingers within me. He gave me such a precious memory.</p>



<p>This way, I won&#8217;t feel lonely even if we&#8217;re apart… I tell myself another lie.</p>



<p>In order to give up, should I accept the confession of a classmate named Mizuguchi who confessed to me?</p>



<p>…But I have no intention of doing that, even though I say so. I can&#8217;t involve others in this.</p>



<p>The only one who will get hurt is my brother if I do the same imitation as that stupid young me.</p>



<p>To love someone as an ordinary girl. I wonder if that&#8217;s something I could do.</p>



<p>When did I stray from the right path? When did I fall so deeply in love?</p>



<p>My little brother never blamed me. On the contrary, he apologized, thinking he caused trouble.</p>



<p>He never told anyone about my guilt. He didn&#8217;t ask for anything in return and kept his distance to let me live normally.</p>



<p>I failed to notice his delicate kindness and kept closing the distance, never satisfied.</p>



<p>Even though I know I shouldn&#8217;t fall in love any further, even though I know I shouldn&#8217;t cross that line, denying it all is futile.</p>



<p>I love him. I am in love with him. I cannot pretend these feelings never existed.</p>



<p>After what happened, how could I not love him? It&#8217;s only natural that I would fall in love.</p>



<p>How much preparation did he make for this day?</p>



<p>How much effort did he put in? I am not worthy of such attention.</p>



<p>How should I respond to him, knowing that he did all this for me, only thinking about me?</p>



<p>&#8220;Where is this…?&#8221;</p>



<p>On our way back, Yukito suggests a detour.</p>



<p>A familiar park. The place where I hurt Yukito so badly.</p>



<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve never approached it again. Why now…?</p>



<p>&#8220;Gone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They removed the playground equipment.&#8221;</p>




<p>The answer to the muttered soliloquy was given by Yukito. It was a question that didn&#8217;t need to be asked.</p>



<p>If such a major accident had occurred, the playground equipment would have been removed immediately.</p>



<p>The place where the playground used to be was now empty. A strange void left behind.</p>



<p>Recalling the image of Yukito, crouched down and covered in blood, my body stiffens, and my breathing becomes erratic. I hide my trembling hands behind my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you apologizing?&#8221;</p>



<p>Anxiety swirls within me. Just moments ago, I was so happy, but now an inexplicable fear engulfs me. Even in the summer, it feels as if the temperature has suddenly dropped.</p>



<p>The curtain of night falls. In the darkness, only the streetlights illuminate us.</p>



<p>Perhaps under this spotlight, the trial will begin.</p>



<p>The dream I longed for so much now terrifies me.</p>



<p>&#8220;That day, I destroyed your world, Nee-san. You know, that feeling of trying to join a close-knit group but feeling alienated. It&#8217;s a common experience for loners like me, like being an intruder between a hundred lilies. I intruded into the relationship that you and your friends had built. Like an outsider, committing a sin that should be repaid with death. I trampled on your world. It was my fault, and your rejection was only natural. I&#8217;m the one at fault and you carry the guilt.&#8221;</p>



<p>No, you&#8217;re wrong! You&#8217;re not at fault! I&#8217;m the one who almost killed you!</p>



<p>I want to shout, but my voice won&#8217;t come out. A victim defending the perpetrator is unforgivable. It goes against justice. But there is no anger or blame in my brother&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>His words flow calmly, without a trace of resentment… Is this the world as seen through Yukito&#8217;s eyes?</p>



<p>The world seen by my little brother. A world colored in faded sepia, always looking up at the sky from the bottom.</p>



<p>Yukito always refrains from saying anything bad about others. I used to find that endearing.</p>



<p>But now that I know and understand, I can&#8217;t bring myself to say it.</p>



<p>What a sad world this is. Yearning for the sky from the depths, from the very bottom.</p>



<p>Continuously striving for heights that can never be reached. In the darkness, with no one around.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Nee-san, you forced yourself to affirm the broken world. You accepted me as an outsider and determined that it was the right thing to do. You killed your emotions and shattered your heart.&#8221;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t remember the emotions from that day. Now, I can&#8217;t even fathom why I committed such a foolish act.</p>



<p>But if I follow my memories, it&#8217;s true that at that moment, I detested and rejected my brother. That&#8217;s the truth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san, it&#8217;s okay now. You don&#8217;t have to force yourself. If you hate me, then it&#8217;s okay. You don&#8217;t have to pretend, twist yourself, or try to like me. It&#8217;s alright.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gently, Yukito takes my trembling hands and holds them against his neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-! Do you mean to say you noticed!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just had a feeling sometimes.&#8221;</p>



<p>My blood runs cold. No, that&#8217;s not it! I don&#8217;t feel that way at all!</p>



<p>I want to shout, but who would believe such an excuse?</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t utter words seeking punishment, driven by the temptation of further sins.</p>



<p>I placed my hands around my sleeping brother&#8217;s neck many times. But it was like a ritual.</p>



<p>It was to acknowledge my unforgivable sin. I had no intention of actually strangling him.</p>



<p>But if Yukito noticed, if he ever woke up sensing my presence, how did my foolish act appear to him? Perhaps he felt fear in the face of a nonexistent murderous intent.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then to Yukito, I&#8217;m still a murderer…</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to see you suffer like this. If you hate me, that&#8217;s fine. So forgive yourself and set yourself free.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you saying? There&#8217;s no way I could hate you—&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito tightens his grip over my hands. A chill runs down my spine.</p>



<p>No, stop it… Stop, stop, stop! Don&#8217;t make me do that much!</p>



<p>An ominous shiver runs through my spine. An invasion of life. A violation of dignity.</p>



<p>&#8220;When strangling, you don&#8217;t apply force all over; rather, you compress the carotid artery by grasping this part gently. It&#8217;s an effective way to cut off consciousness.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if casually offering trivia, Yukito demonstrates it without hesitation.</p>



<p>Suddenly, strength drains from Yukito&#8217;s body, and he falls to his knees.</p>



<p>&#8220;…It&#8217;s a lie. A lie, right? Say something! Why are you doing this! Yukito, <span class="uppercase">Yukito</span>!&#8221;</p>



<p>Why, why did it come to this? You&#8217;re the one who said it!</p>



<p>He wants me to smile like I used to. He wanted me to smile. Yet, why?!</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s no one to show that smile to, then it&#8217;s meaningless.</p>


<p>I never wanted to see you like this again. I swore to protect you, but I&#8217;m the one hurting you!</p>



<p>I shake my little brother&#8217;s body. He&#8217;s barely conscious. I won&#8217;t let him die, no way!</p>



<p>Struggling to control my rising confusion, I grab my phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right, an ambulance!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito&#8217;s hand grabs my arm.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cough, cough! Uuuuuuuuuuugh!&#8221;</p>



<p>He seems to regain consciousness, coughing and struggling to breathe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay!? Why would you do something like this! In a world without you, there&#8217;s no reason for me to—&#8221;</p>



<p>In a world like that, there&#8217;s no reason to live.</p>


<p>In a world like that, I don&#8217;t need it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yuri-san, sorry I couldn&#8217;t disappear.&#8221;</p>



<p>The same words as before. It feels like a sharp knife gouging out my heart.</p>



<p>I killed Yukito. I&#8217;m being confronted with my sins, never to forget.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it! The one who should disappear, the one who has to disappear, is not you but me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong, Nee-san. I realized that there are people who say they love me, who consider me precious, and who would be sad if I were gone. So, I can&#8217;t act like I did back then anymore. I&#8217;m sorry. I can&#8217;t fulfill your wish anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sorrowful expression on Yukito&#8217;s face. But those words are the opposite of what he said back then.</p>



<p>Once, he wished to disappear but failed, but now, he&#8217;s saying he can&#8217;t.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s growth. He knows he&#8217;s loved, and he wants to live for someone else.</p>


<p>&#8220;My wish? That you disappear? There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s true!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself, Nee-san. Acknowledge it. If you keep going like this, you&#8217;ll eventually break. Pretending to be someone you&#8217;re not forever is…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare decide my feelings for me!&#8221;</p>



<p>My clueless brother. I raise my hand as if to slap him, but I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it, and instead, I gently stroke his cheek. It&#8217;s impossible… because I love him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you! I know it&#8217;s my unforgivable, forbidden love. I never intended to put it into words. I wanted to resist it. But you&#8217;re so kind…&#8221;</p>



<p>Tears overflow. Tears that I have been holding back for years, decades of tears, deciding not to cry, are streaming down my cheeks. They dripped onto the ground. I was pathetic. I was so miserable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said, it&#8217;s your misunderstanding, Nee-s—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you hate me, I will continue loving you until I die.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if it&#8217;s an unrequited love, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to loving someone without being loved in return.</p>



<p>If what Yukito says is true and these feelings are just an illusion, I&#8217;ve still transformed them into something genuine. Something irreplaceable, something that no one can deny, even if it&#8217;s for Yukito.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Nee-san, for you, I&#8217;m just a detested enemy, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only beloved little brother in this world for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Nee-san, for you, I&#8217;m a demon you hate enough to kill.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a beautiful, untainted, and the one and only treasure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito seemed perplexed. It&#8217;s understandable. I suddenly said something like that.</p>



<p>I never meant to say this, and I should have kept it buried forever.</p>



<p>For some reason, this child who should hate me has started leaning on me lately. It was like a dream for me, who envied Mom&#8217;s carefree affection. I tried to keep my distance, but Yukito only got closer in response, leaving me at a loss.</p>



<p>But I didn&#8217;t hate it; I was extremely happy.</p>


<p>—To the extent of thinking I&#8217;ve been forgiven. Immersed in such an absurd delusion.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not possible, right…&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt deflated. I&#8217;m exhausted. I was given a wonderful dream in the end. That&#8217;s enough for me.</p>



<p>He gave me such a beautiful drawing, made a dress for me, and made me smile.</p>



<p>What more happiness could I possibly wish for?</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Yukito. And I&#8217;m sorry for everything up until now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I vaguely understood that this was a farewell.</p>



<p>Even if I go abroad to study, I will keep on loving him. That alone is enough. I don&#8217;t want anything more.</p>



<p>If he becomes happy, that will be my happiness.</p>


<p>&#8220;Nee-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>He looked like he had noticed some crucial mistake, a delicate expression of concern. It felt strange.</p>



<p>Yukito seemed troubled as he opened his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Things not adding up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?&#8221;</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</h4>



<p>Carrying the crossbike, we head home. Along the way, we try to align our perceptions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri-san, you&#8217;re going to study abroad!?&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised by this sudden revelation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like our perceptions are completely misaligned, and I can&#8217;t help but feel uncomfortable. Both of us are so absent-minded. We&#8217;ve just been saying what we wanted to say without really communicating with each other.</p>



<p>Our sibling relationship truly mirrors our communication issues. I guess it&#8217;s inevitable after all these years of a strained relationship.</p>



<p>Talking it over again, it turns out that Nee-san wants to study at a university abroad.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which country are you planning to go to? England, maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san is really skilled in languages. But her best language is probably &#8220;Yukito-ese.&#8221; What on earth is that!?</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… it&#8217;s not about that…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, Yuri-san looks hesitant, which is unusual for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not about that… It&#8217;s more about whether you need me or not. I was thinking maybe it&#8217;s better if I stay away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, you can do anything, can&#8217;t you? I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ll protect you, and maybe Yukito hates me, right? I&#8217;m such a terrible sister. You don&#8217;t have to push yourself, Yukito.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was not suffering from a hatred of me, but rather, she had lost sight of the meaning of her own existence and role, and was worried that she could only fulfill her purpose by leaving me. In other words, what I was thinking was completely off the mark. Just a hasty conclusion.</p>



<p>What the hellllllllll!</p>



<p>What was that all about? I was so seriously worried about her. Above all, I might have caused Yuri another unnecessary trauma.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so embarrassed that I&#8217;m dying of indignation. My face is about to burst into flames. Face open.</p>



<p>Haa? It&#8217;s impossible for me to dislike Yuri-san. We&#8217;re such close friends that there&#8217;s not a part of each other&#8217;s body that I don&#8217;t know about. Why would that happen? …… (irresistible force)</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make assumptions about my feelings, Nee-san!&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same line I said earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but… I can&#8217;t support your decision to study abroad for such a reason.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-! Sorry, I was insensitive.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be lonely without my big sister.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll stop it right away. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t really want to study abroad in the first place. It&#8217;s too troublesome, going overseas and all.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an incredible change of heart. As always, my sister&#8217;s ability to make quick decisions is uncanny. Is this really okay?</p>



<p>I let out a deep sigh, feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, or perhaps it was all in vain.</p>



<p>But if my sister&#8217;s worries are resolved, then this should be a happy ending, right? Let&#8217;s just be happy about that for now.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems like there were misunderstandings on both sides…&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes… I wonder what I was worrying about. Haa… It took quite a long time to sort things out, but we&#8217;ll fill in the gaps one by one. We have plenty of time from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s start with my motto. Everything I have is yours. What&#8217;s yours is yours. And I myself belong to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re overflowing with a spirit of service!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this what an angelic being is like? I hope she doesn&#8217;t attract any weirdos with that attitude…</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry for causing you trouble this time. I never intended to confuse you. But please believe one thing: My feelings for Yukito are genuine, not a lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…It&#8217;s an honor to receive such overwhelming words.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Words alone may not be enough to earn your trust, right? Then, how about a &#8216;Brother-Exclusive&#8217; tattoo on my lower abdomen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, absolutely don&#8217;t do that!? Your idea is way too horror-themed just because it&#8217;s summer!&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right. Instead of &#8216;brother,&#8217; maybe &#8216;Yukito Exclusive&#8217; would be better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not any better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one allowed to write the character &#8216;正&#8217; (right) on my thigh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Where on earth does she get this knowledge from…?</p>



<p>Well, anyway,</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly, this is the real Yuri.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, this craziness is my sister&#8217;s true self. She doesn&#8217;t suit being down.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just right to be playfully pushed around like this. I don&#8217;t hate my sister, after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start over from the beginning. Even Mom is getting a fresh start as Mama, right? So can we.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A smiling big sister is much more charming.&#8221;</p>



<p>We thought we had to distance ourselves because we hated each other. We refrained from interfering in each other&#8217;s lives.</p>



<p>But if that&#8217;s not the case, then we should be able to return to being close siblings like we used to be.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay for me to love you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You told me that it&#8217;s not for me to decide, so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you dress me in a wedding dress?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll dress you in a wedding dress, Nee-san!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>



<p>Hmm, is it really okay for things to remain like this? I&#8217;m starting to feel anxious.</p>



<p>Finally, the apartment building comes into view. I&#8217;m tired today. I just want to rest soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Yukito, I won&#8217;t hold back anymore. I&#8217;m serious about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>As she said that and started running, my sister&#8217;s expression was the same gentle smile I had seen in the past.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The backstage of the photo studio was filled with excitement.</p>



<p>A makeup artist was skillfully applying makeup to Shiori, enhancing her already lively and cute appearance. Shiori was a cheerful and energetic girl, and the makeup added a touch of allure to her.</p>



<p>As I munched on the snacks brought in as treats, I couldn&#8217;t help but gaze intently at the makeup artist, trying to learn her techniques.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, this outfit is just too embarrassing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually less revealing than a swimsuit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wearing something this skimpy on the battlefield feels wrong…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Throughout history, dancers have dressed like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…But why does dancing increase our abilities?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;Well, because it&#8217;s fun to watch the movements!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the case!&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori blushed, but bringing up these concerns right before the performance wasn&#8217;t helping. There was no turning back now, especially since her outfit was custom-made to fit her perfectly. It was a one-of-a-kind piece, and it cost quite a bit. Of course, we had to contribute to cover the expenses.</p>



<p>&#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d end up cosplaying like this… My sister would laugh at me.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a wry smile, the fresh and handsome guy started changing into his costume. Once Shiori finished her makeup, she headed to the dressing room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mihou is also good-looking and nice. I can&#8217;t believe I can show such a figure to Suzune. Yukito Kokonoe, thank you very much!&#8221;</p>



<p> Himura-senpai, or rather, the brave senpai, is in full heroic mood, dressed in a gore-glazed costume.</p>



<p>This full-armored hero was designed to sacrifice mobility for extreme defense, known as the Defensive Model. He excelled in defense and was essential in guarding the goal area.</p>



<p>&#8220;But basketball…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I wondered if it was a typo, and they meant &#8220;Banuke&#8221; instead of &#8220;basket.&#8221; Maybe I should try creating a clone…?</p>



<p>As I flipped through the reference materials, I noticed every detail was meticulously designed.</p>



<p>The adults&#8217; bad joke knows no bounds. As a result, there is nothing but gain for us, so we don&#8217;t mind, but will it ever see the light of day one day……?</p>



<p>We were about to begin the filming for a WEB CM. We had two versions, one for fifteen seconds and the other for thirty seconds.</p>



<p>It all started with an inquiry from a company that reached out to my social media account.</p>



<p>I was approached by a major sportswear company to create a special edition of basketball shoes called &#8220;Bunnyman Model,&#8221; or the so-called &#8220;Bash.&#8221; The collaboration goods are set to be released this summer!</p>



<p>Initially, it was just only the Bunnyman, but after the incident involving the expulsion of Himura-Senpai and his subsequent rise to fame as the &#8220;Hero,&#8221; gaining nationwide recognition, they decided to create a &#8220;Hero Model&#8221; as well.</p>



<p>In addition, the cheerful and handsome Kouki and the exceptionally athletic and beautiful Shiori, who often appear together in the videos, have also attracted a lot of attention.</p>



<p>Since we&#8217;re all together, they decided to produce them as a team called &#8220;Snow Rabbits.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is all just pure mischief. Thanks to the greedy scheming of the adults, the project progressed at lightning speed.</p>



<p>But with that decision, Bunnyman, Hero, and then them, Kouki and Shiori, with no unique nicknames, felt a bit lacking in character.</p>



<p>So, we brainstormed together with the staff and came up with this idea!</p>



<p>&#8220;Reincarnated as a Basketball Team&#8221; &#8211; Let&#8217;s abbreviate it as &#8220;ReiBasu&#8221; (Rei = Reincarnation, Basu = Basketball).</p>



<p>Search for the hashtag &#8220;#ReiBasu&#8221;!</p>



<p>The commercial is also based on this concept, but instead of being reincarnated into another world, we are transmigrated from a fantasy world of swords, magic, and basketball into the modern world. It&#8217;s an outrageous setting!</p>



<p>This groundbreaking solution gave each of us unique characteristics &#8211; &#8220;Hero&#8221; Himura-Senpai, &#8220;Sword Saint&#8221; Kouki, and &#8220;Dancer&#8221; Shiori formed the party of the Hero, Sword Saint, and Dancer.</p>



<p>Originally, Shiori was set to be a magician, but it just didn&#8217;t suit her at all. I mean, come on, Shiori as a magician? No way! We even considered making her a martial artist, but I put a stop to that idea. Sure, she&#8217;s physically strong, but she&#8217;s still a girl. It would be pitiful to turn her into a brute character.</p>



<p>Think about it, the &#8220;Dancer&#8221; fits her appearance much better than a martial artist, right? Hehehe, unanimous decision (except for Shiori).</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s how the five types of &#8220;Bash&#8221; shoes were decided to be released.</p>



<p>What, you say there are only four types? Well, just wait a minute.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t you think a princess is essential for an isekai setting?</p>



<p>When I think of a princess, I imagine someone with beautiful, long hair.</p>



<p>It was only natural for me to approach my sister with this idea. It was the perfect follow-up to the part-time job offer.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I feel a bit uneasy about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a noble aura and wearing a gorgeous dress, Yuri finished changing and revealed herself.</p>



<p>The guys cheered. There was a stunning beauty right there before their eyes.</p>



<p>She looked just like a princess who had transmigrated from another world. [SSR / 8-Star Princess Yuri]</p>


<p>&#8220;As expected of Yukito Koknoe&#8217;s sister. It suits you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think so? I don&#8217;t want to hear any insincere compliments.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-san, you look super pretty!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It suits me? But remember, I&#8217;m only your princess.&#8221;</p>



<p>She patted my head. It seems like she has come to terms with things lately. Yuri has been in a good mood.</p>



<p>After a strict discussion with mom, it was decided that she would sleep in my room three days a week and in her room for the rest. Please, just sleep in your own room.</p>



<p>Yuri seemed to have been really against the idea of studying abroad. She doesn&#8217;t even like going overseas in the first place.</p>



<p>It appears that she took it quite seriously as an older sister. My apologies for the inconvenience.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the reactions too different compared to when it was my turn?&#8221;</p>


<p>Himura-Senpai seems dissatisfied, but Kouki is giving high praise.</p>



<p>Of course, of course. Yuri is a beauty, after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;After the CM shoot is over, let&#8217;s do some role-playing in these outfits in another world.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What exactly?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8230;.How about this? You save me from a group of goblins who are about to assault me in this world where we got transmigrated, and then you make a dunk!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What an innovative concept!&#8221;</p>



<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have asked. I regret it. What kind of world is this &#8220;ReiBasu&#8221; exactly?</p>



<p>After Yuri finishes changing with composure, Shiori, in her dancer outfit, comes out blushing.</p>



<p>With a mysterious veil covering her mouth and a bikini-type top, she wraps the lower part of her body with a cloth like a pareo. The audience marvels at Shiori&#8217;s mysterious appearance.</p>


<p>&#8220;Hmm, it&#8217;s kinda naughty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You shamelessly harassed me without even trying to hide it!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori freezes in place, but I really want her to dance and buff us.</p>



<p>In a fantasy world, there&#8217;s always an existence of absurd armor with seemingly no defensive capabilities. The bikini armor is the prime example, and Shiori&#8217;s outfit lacks any protection as well. She won&#8217;t survive a single blow.</p>



<p>And now, the whole &#8220;ReiBasu&#8221; cosplay group is assembled. It&#8217;s surreal.</p>



<p>We already have several events lined up this summer to wear these outfits. Shiori is on the verge of tears.</p>



<p>By the way, besides the CM, we&#8217;ve signed sponsorship deals as well.</p>



<p>The contract requires that during our warrior training, each of us wears the designated Bash shoes. Whenever we go for training, someone always records a video and uploads it. It&#8217;s the ultimate form of promotion.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just shoes; we have collaborated with an apparel brand as Bunnyman individuals.</p>


<p>They are releasing T-shirts, hoodies, towels, and various other Bunnyman goods with our logo on them. The smoothness of these collaborations is somewhat eerie.</p>



<p>In no time, Bunnyman has become completely independent of me.</p>



<p>My followers are forming a meaninglessly chaotic community. Maybe that&#8217;s why the staff gets nervous when meeting with them. I&#8217;ve become a legendary mysterious figure. When I go for meetings, company executives come to greet me one after another.</p>



<p>Thanks to this, my credibility and influence are through the roof.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already finished shooting a gravure and an interview for a basketball magazine featuring the Snow Rabbits. I stayed true to the setting and used &#8220;Usa&#8221; as my signature phrase in all the written text. That&#8217;s professionalism for you.</p>



<p>The media requests for interviews keep pouring in, but I only accept specialized basketball magazines.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the extra income has become outrageous. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m seeing dollar signs.</p>



<p>At this point, I don&#8217;t even think about doing part-time work during summer vacation to earn money. I&#8217;ve heard that Bash reservations are already coming in.</p>



<p>Bunnyman, who was supposed to avoid standing out, has become a slightly suspicious figure spotted around the neighborhood, an internet phenomenon, and now even appears in commercials. The most outstanding figure in history.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s deeply moving, and I can&#8217;t help but think again… How did it all end up like this?</p>





<p>&#8220;Huh?… Nee-san, is this script correct for me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>After finishing the 15-second commercial shoot, we moved to an outdoor court for the 30-second version.</p>



<p>The CM transitions from the &#8220;Otherworld Edition&#8221; to the &#8220;Modern Edition.&#8221; It&#8217;s a two-part commercial set-up, where the 15-second version is shown on video-sharing sites, and the full 30-second version can be viewed on the official website.</p>



<p>It leaves viewers curious for more and leads them to access the official website for the continuation.</p>



<p>In the Otherworld Edition&#8217;s ending, we get transmigrated back to the modern era, and the stage shifts to a basketball match once again.</p>



<p>Inside the location bus, I check my script and find out that, for some reason, my last five seconds are blank.</p>



<p>After confirming with Kouki and the others, they all have the same lines, each adjusted to our respective roles, except for the last part. The stage directions simply say &#8220;blessing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri, the lines for us at the end are like &#8216;Eeeeeeeeeehhhhhh?!&#8217; Is this okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori and Hot-blooded Senpai ask for confirmation. I don&#8217;t understand why only I have no lines.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, I know what this is. This is the prelude to a huge storm… Right!?&#8221;</p>



<p>The handsome guy stammers. The script was worked out between me and the staff, and my sister was the one in charge.</p>



<p>She volunteered to help, and her angelic character is truly something. Originally an outsider, she might have felt alienated.</p>



<p>After multiple meetings, she boasted that it turned out to be the best content. The staff also praised it as &#8220;this will definitely become a hot topic,&#8221; but I can&#8217;t see a single scale of that yet.</p>



<p>As we arrive at the outdoor court, we start preparing for the CM shoot with a slight unease. Something&#8217;s off. I feel a shiver down my spine.</p>





<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yuri PoV]</h4>


<p>(You don&#8217;t longer need me… That&#8217;s true, right?)</p>



<p>I mock myself inwardly, trying not to show it on my face. I never imagined a day like this would come.</p>



<p>The days when I used to suffer from sleep deprivation seem like a lie now. It&#8217;s all thanks to my little brother.</p>



<p>I was always involved in some kind of commotion since I was a child. I said I would protect my little brother and had a strong determination to do so.</p>



<p>But before I knew it, there was no longer any need for me to protect him.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m sorry… I feel bad for Yukito, but I can&#8217;t go back to the way things were.)</p>



<p>What we have is not a reset but a remake.</p>



<p>Instead of starting over, we&#8217;re recreating ourselves into something new.</p>



<p>I almost committed murder, but it was my little brother, the one I intended to kill, who saved me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible. There&#8217;s no way I could harm my brother. There&#8217;s no need for me to protect him. Because he is so strong and brave. It&#8217;s an arrogant misunderstanding. From that day until today, I was the one being protected.</p>



<p>I filled the blank with many words. It was fun and heartwarming. That child revealed his true feelings to me without hiding anything, just as it was.</p>



<p>&#8212;He cared about me. He didn&#8217;t hate me.</p>



<p>From them, I felt cherished. I was never hated.</p>



<p>That alone made me feel so rewarded. My heart was warm.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t force myself to believe that I love my little brother. On the contrary, it was the opposite. I believed that I was hated. I thought I deserved to be resented, that I should be hated.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t like that. Just like back then, I was liked. I was loved.</p>



<p>Once I learned that, I couldn&#8217;t control my feelings anymore. Holding back was impossible.</p>



<p>The fourth attempt at murder. I can no longer delude myself into thinking that I might kill my little brother.</p>


<p>I was arrogant. The blade I wield is not something that could reach that child. I don&#8217;t possess such power.</p>



<p>Yukito gave me the comfort I longed for more than anything.</p>



<p>He told me that I could love him. He accepted that it was okay to love him.</p>



<p>He even let me wear the wedding dress, didn&#8217;t he?</p>



<p>What kind of gentle demon is Yukito to make me feel this way?</p>



<p>Yukito often compares me to an angel, but if angels are opposite to demons, then indeed, it&#8217;s like defying a taboo.</p>



<p>There was no hesitation to taste the forbidden fruit.</p>



<p>Everything feels so fresh and new. I never imagined a day like this when the world would appear so colorful.</p>



<p>Looking down at my elegant self, it might be a woman&#8217;s dream, but to be honest, being a princess isn&#8217;t really my style. However, because Yukito chose me, I will confidently play the role of a princess.</p>


<p>I don&#8217;t know what Yukito&#8217;s intentions were in choosing me as the princess.</p>



<p>But I can&#8217;t just be a princess waiting for a hero in a castle.</p>



<p>&#8212;Wait. I will prove that to you.</p>





<p>Bunnyman&#8217;s shot missed, and he fell to his knees.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… impossible…&#8221;</p>



<p>The confrontation with the evil demons that had plunged the world into chaos had come to an end. The hero, the sword saint, and the dancer were covered in wounds, yet their expressions overflowed with the joy of victory.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our fate ends here!&#8221;</p>



<p>The long-lasting battle between Bunnyman and the Hero Party reached its conclusion.</p>



<p>Transmigrating to another world and facing their strange destinies, the final chapter of their extraordinary encounters came to an end.</p>



<p>Exiled and revived from the depths of despair, the hero&#8217;s determination shattered Bunnyman&#8217;s ambitions.</p>



<p>…Even though I wrote the script myself, what is this?</p>



<p>As I returned to my senses, I couldn&#8217;t help but calmly provide some commentary. I quietly waited for that moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, hero. Finish this!&#8221;</p>



<p>The dancer urged for the final blow. This could be seen as Bunnyman being defeated, leading to a happy ending.</p>



<p>You might think that&#8217;s how it goes. But it&#8217;s not supposed to be like that.</p>



<p>We were approaching the climax. In my dress, I hurried to where Bunnyman had fallen, trying not to trip.</p>



<p>My little brother lacks a sense of crisis. Kusu, well, that&#8217;s what makes him cute.</p>



<p>He entrusted me with the script without any doubt, even though he could have questioned it. He even gave me the role of a princess.</p>



<p>Does that mean I&#8217;m a princess to Yukito? If so, I&#8217;ll live up to those expectations.</p>



<p>Everything is so dear. Every single thing. I realized there&#8217;s no limit to these feelings.</p>



<p>I had given up. I thought I was no longer needed.</p>



<p>Even now, I can&#8217;t forgive what I did. I doubt I&#8217;ll ever be able to forgive myself.</p>



<p>Still, the one who saved me was none other than my little brother.</p>



<p>As I look at the painting hanging in my room, I practice my smile in front of the mirror every day.</p>



<p>I want to get as close as possible to that child&#8217;s ideal. To become a proud big sister he can rely on.</p>



<p>I have received far too much. To repay it, I dedicate my entire being, my heart and soul. My life itself is a tip and a stake.</p>



<p>I swear to love my little brother until the end of my life.</p>


<p>Once I&#8217;ve made up my mind, there&#8217;s nothing to fear. My heart is clear.</p>



<p>I forced myself to believe I loved him, and now I&#8217;ll keep forcing myself to love him and that&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>A life like this is surely enjoyable. It was until now, and it will be from now on, all for you.</p>



<p>There is no one in this world who could make me happier than you, Yukito.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bunnyman, I love you!&#8221;</p>



<p>I embrace him with all my strength. Yukito stumbles a bit from the force, but I catch him securely.</p>



<p>His muscles feel firm and strong. Without realizing it, he has become so robust.</p>



<p>I whisper into his ear, just for him to hear.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the results of my practice.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I kiss my little brother on the lips, and our tongues intertwine. It&#8217;s a serious kiss, where our saliva creates a thread as we lock lips for five seconds.</p>





<p>[EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHH?!]</p>





<p>As scripted, voices of congratulations (?) resounded from behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-WHAAAAAAAT?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-I told you. I meant it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I whisper again and smile. With the best smile I can muster.</p>



<p>I hope this feeling will be conveyed to the one and only person I love.</p>
