<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>[Mom PoV]</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm…..a…is that you, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>In my dazed consciousness, my beloved son was peeking at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re awake. Mom, are you thirsty? You have these dark circles under your eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I was being tucked into bed. I was supposed to be in the living room. ……</p>



<p>I quenched my thirst with a sip of the soft drink my son had brought me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was so surprised when you suddenly collapsed. It seems like you didn&#8217;t sleep well, are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried to sit up, but he held me back. I was happy to see his casual kindness.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ……. I&#8217;ll make breakfast right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I checked my watch, it was past ten o&#8217;clock. It seemed that I had been asleep for an hour.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have already prepared it. It&#8217;s your day off, so take your time.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was feeling a little out of sorts. Finally, my mind started to work.</p>



<p>&#8211;At that moment, I was struck by fear.</p>



<p>Yes, I didn&#8217;t sleep a wink last night. Gradually, the memory comes back to me.<br>A piece of paper I took out of the envelope.</p>



<p>No way, I thought. I prayed that I had seen it wrong.</p>



<p>But no matter how many times I checked, it was the same. The words &#8220;Needs close examination&#8221; were written on the paper.</p>



<p>Dizzy and weak, I fell to my knees. I was distraught with fear.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Breast cancer screening. It is recommended that women in their forties undergo breast cancer screening. I could not rest easy either.</p>



<p>After all, my grandmother had breast cancer. They say that if you have a relative with the disease, there is a risk of inheritance.</p>



<p>I should have taken the test to dispel my anxiety, but a nightmare awaited me.</p>



<p>I hurriedly looked up the diagnosis, and found that it was highly likely to be benign, but malignancy cannot be ruled out. There is a few percent chance of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Just a few percent. But it was enough to make me despair.</p>



<p>Impatience. I rushed to make an appointment for a checkup, but my body stiffened and wouldn&#8217;t move.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the fear of death was in front of me.</p>



<p>The end of life, the end of my life. One day, I would face the end of my life.</p>



<p>But I was still too young to understand it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>A vague future. &#8211;What will happen to my children if I leave now?</p>



<p>No! No! No! I don&#8217;t want to! I don&#8217;t want to disappear! I don&#8217;t want to go away! Because I still have so many things I want to do, so many things I need to do!</p>



<p>I desperately suppress my inarticulate screams and hold on.</p>



<p>I will disappear, from this world. An inevitability that will come equally. But not now.</p>



<p>At least let me watch over my children until they grow up. I don&#8217;t want to die yet!</p>



<p>I am afraid. I&#8217;m afraid of leaving my children, of not seeing them again forever. One day I won&#8217;t be able to talk to them, I won&#8217;t be able to touch them, I will lose their warmth, and I will die alone.</p>



<p>Leaving behind regrets and remorse. The shifting view of life and death. The reality that confronted me.</p>



<p>Fear flashes back, and my body stiffens.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll take care of the house. Sister is still sleeping. So you should go to bed, too. They say that lack of sleep is the enemy of beauty.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;……Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>My son&#8217;s words brought me back to myself. He cares about me. Me like this.</p>



<p>And yet, I could do nothing for this child. Tears welled up in my eyes.</p>



<p>What could I leave behind? A savings account, a life insurance policy. Even a car and this house. My legacy includes securities and other things. I had worked so hard not to make it hard for them.</p>



<p>I should be able to leave enough money to my children until they come of age. And yet!</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to leave …….&#8221;</p>



<p>As if clinging to him, I reached out with a trembling hand and touched my son. He gently squeezed me back.</p>



<p>Regret washes over me. The sixteen years I have spent in idleness.</p>



<p>There was plenty of time to start over. I could have made it up to him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>It was I who had not done so. I cannot leave this child as his mother</p>



<p>Memories of me, proof that he loved me. The love he had for me.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tell him now. I don&#8217;t want my family to worry unnecessarily.</p>



<p>Until the results of a full examination are available, Please, please stay ――</p>



<p>&#8220;Please …… stay by my side.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you have a scary dream? Or did you have a hard time at work? Thanks for everything. It&#8217;s best to forget about the bad things. Oh, yeah, let&#8217;s sing a lullaby, shall we? No, wait a second. In this case, isn&#8217;t it a parental lullaby? If that&#8217;s the case, the tune should be bossa nova&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>He encourages me in my weakness. He is a wonderful son who is too good for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know,…… I couldn&#8217;t sleep because I was very anxious. I want you to sleep next to me. Because I feel safe with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Human skin is warm. Anxiety and fear are swept away. It soothes my feelings so easily. It envelops my heart, which was so fearful and yet so fragile just a moment ago. In fact, I should be the one to do that for him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I always receive love, and by the time I regret it, it&#8217;s too late. However I!</p>



<p>&#8211;I love you.</p>



<p>My beloved rugged boy who protects me.</p>
