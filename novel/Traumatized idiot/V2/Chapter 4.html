<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 4: Malicious Loser</h1>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this student again from that class ……&#8221;</p>



<p>The staff meeting at the beginning of the week was rough. The principal whispered bitterly while looking dumbfounded.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is an unprecedented situation, Principal!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a disgrace to the school. You have taken on a terrible student.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of the teachers, who were not pleased with his presence, agreed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you see anything suspicious, Fujishiro-sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sayuri Fujishiro assured them. For Fujishiro, the results of the previous test were something to be proud of and nothing to be ashamed of. However, it was also true that some of her colleagues were jealous of the fact that Sayuri Fujishiro was the best among them.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What about the other teachers who supervised the test?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there were any students who were acting suspiciously when I was there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it would have been difficult to conceal the fact if it was done on such a large scale.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the principal urged them on, they answered one after another as they recalled those days.</p>



<p>The answers were unanimously positive. It was impossible.</p>



<p>There was no surprise there. If this were true, it would mean that everyone who was in charge of supervising the examinations had proven themselves to be incompetent.</p>



<p>It all started with a single postcard that was leaked earlier in the week.</p>



<p>A massive organized cheating during a test in Class B of the first year.</p>



<p>The average score of the B class was notably high, so the contents of the letter could not be ignored.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, there is no proof. The teachers who oversaw the test all testified that there was no such cheating going on. If that were the case, it could have been dismissed as just jealousy and a despicable lie to undermine them, but the problem was the student who was said to have led the charge.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe. His name is frequently mentioned in staff meetings as a problematic student. The preconceived notion that this student might be capable of committing a wrongdoing clouded their eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we call him out and have him solve the problem under close supervision? Let&#8217;s expose him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as gray as black can be.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is also the matter of slander and libel. Principal, may we consider disciplinary action?&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the case was rootless, few would defend it. With Ando looking away, only Fujishiro and Suzuka Sanjoji were struggling on their own.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just now, everyone who surveyed the test, testified that there was nothing suspicious about it. I don&#8217;t understand why this is the case!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I also disagree with the idea of punishing someone for being suspicious without any evidence. What are we adults supposed to do with such shortsightedness?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji&#8217;s words could be taken as a reprimand, but the principal quieted her as if to admonish her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;But, you see, it is a problem when someone writes a letter like this. It doesn&#8217;t change the fact that he is a disgrace to the public.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a problem. I don&#8217;t want them to cause more trouble for the school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong? This is not like Sanjoji Sensei. I think you are the one who should be teaching him properly. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Each of them speaks out in bewilderment. The teacher, Suzuka Sanjoji, is extremely talented and fair-minded. People around her well understood that she was not the kind of person who would tolerate injustice.</p>



<p>&#8220;What justification is there for any of this!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Calm down, Sanjoji-sensei. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do. For the next exam, we will have a strict inspection of their belongings and two exam proctors. Is that okay, Fujishiro-sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… That&#8217;s fine&#8221;</p>



<p>Fujishiro bit her lip in frustration. For Fujishiro, the decision was humiliating.</p>



<p>&#8220;Also, I can&#8217;t let this matter go to the ears of the teacher. The school spirit is very strong in me. As an alumnus, I will not tolerate this. The inspection shall be the responsibility of Class A.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! That&#8217;s&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujishiro-sensei. There are many excellent students in Class B. I am concerned about the negative impact on them. We can&#8217;t just leave rotten apples on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>The school principal glared at her as if that was the natural course of action.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you serious about this?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Fujishiro-sensei, please be very careful not to damage the reputation of the school any further.”</p>



<p>He terminated the conversation with an annoyed and vexed look at her.</p>



<p>As if the previous confusion had never happened, they moved on to the next task on the agenda. Leaving nothing but a huge mess in its place.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Kokonoe I&#8217;m sorry about Reika. let&#8217;s play chess again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in the board games club, right?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Aihara-senpai leaves with a wry smile. Speaking of Aihara, he is the head of the board games club, but he is also a very strong chess player and he beat me to a pulp. I will never forget the bitterness I felt when he tortured me to death, leaving only the &#8220;King&#8221; behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is your face so wide?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean? It looks normal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Through the introduction of the hot-blooded senpai, I have been accompanying Aihara-senpai for a while to discuss love affairs with Suo-senpai, the love of his life, but the fresh and handsome guy said something unexpected.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen okay? If you want to measure an irregularly shaped object, first divide it into triangles and then sum them up using Heron&#8217;s formula.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about the area of your face! Honestly, what is it about you that makes you a loner? It&#8217;s about time you got pissed off from all sides.&#8221;</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t understand. You don&#8217;t understand, you fresh-looking guy.</p>



<p>Let me show you the reality. Don&#8217;t be surprised to hear that I&#8217;m a loner.</p>



<p>In the morning, I go to school with Yuuri. At lunchtime, I&#8217;ll either be worshiping the Goddess of Mercy, or I&#8217;ll be caught by Hinagi and Shiori in the classroom. If anything, there is a possibility that the president will come to the school. After school, it&#8217;s club activities, and even outside of that, I&#8217;m usually involved with someone. If I go home, I am mentally attacked by my mother and sister, who are devoted to invading my personal space, and if I try to go outside, I am discovered by Himiyama-san.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What part of me is a loner!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my line!&#8221;</p>



<p>While we were having a silly argument, Seido, who was getting ready to go home, called out to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have dinner with you next time, Yukito. My mother and father would like you to come again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hm? Your mother too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…… We&#8217;re still family.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Well, call me any day that works for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood! Thank you. Bye!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seido is going home, but that can&#8217;t be helped. It wasn&#8217;t a very comfortable situation, but he&#8217;s finally calmed down. It might be a good idea to ask him to join the basketball team.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Mikuriya, he has brightened up a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At one point I wondered what was going to happen. …… Shall we go to club activities for the time being?&#8221;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;My students are rotten apples? Screw you, that old man and his friends!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujishiro-sensei, please don&#8217;t drink too much. It will affect you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji gently rubbed Fujishiro&#8217;s back in exasperation. After the staff meeting, Sanjoji, worried about Fujishiro, invites her to dinner.</p>



<p>Fujishiro downs a gulp of sake and bows her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I got Sanjoji involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright. I feel the same way.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was the first time for the two of them to dine together like this. From Fujishiro&#8217;s point of view, who is still new to the position, Sanjoji is above the clouds, and until now has been an unapproachable person to deal with.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I made Sanjoji&#8217;s position worse.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fujishiro was unintentionally embarrassed. Their careers were very different. Sanjoji&#8217;s kindness toward her, a young woman, made her vaguely idealistic about what a teacher should be like.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that what this is about? I don&#8217;t care. They will eventually understand. And when they do, it will be too late. &#8211;They are really stupid people.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fujishiro gasped at Sanjoji&#8217;s unusual behavior.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sanjoji Sensei, are you….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed to say this, but I used to be on that side of the world. I guess I didn&#8217;t have the eyes to see people. If things had stayed the same, I am sure I would have joined them in condemning you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fujishiro did not dare to touch what had happened in the past. Surely it was not something to talk about at a drinking party like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please tell me about it sometime…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure. Speaking of, when I went to the New Year&#8217;s shrine, I drew a omikuji fortune. It said that there would be a turning point in my life. I had my doubts, but today I became aware of it. Now is the time.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It sounds like a love fortune, right? Although I am not very good at that side of things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That may be so. The person I was waiting for appeared at the place where I ran away. This must be fate, too. I never thought this would happen. I am grateful to God for giving me one more chance. It must be ……. Fujishiro-sensei, there is nothing to worry about. No matter what happens in the future, please have faith in your students. That&#8217;s all you need to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……… I may have misunderstood you, Sanjoji-sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a secret that she thought she was a stiff and difficult person to deal with.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu. Is that so? I&#8217;m that lonely woman who, despite my age and maturity, is still unmarried, and when I go home, my dog soothes my soul.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is wrong with men in this world to leave such a good woman alone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, Fujishiro-sensei, you should cheer up too. But, yes, I do. Maybe you have already met your destiny, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder what kind…..&#8221;</p>



<p>The prophetic words of Sanjoji were burned into Fujishiro&#8217;s mind.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry! It was my fault for not protecting you.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the morning, Sayuri-sensei is apologizing with her head so low that her forehead almost touches the podium.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t blame Sayuri-sensei. Rather, it is the small Sayuri-sensei who can bow down to her students in this way, head-on, who is the adult. She is an admirable teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, we didn&#8217;t cheat!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We worked hard, but this is terrible. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with all the circumstances ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is Yuki the only one who gets blamed for this?&#8221;</p>



<p>The blame goes to Sayuri-sensei, but everyone feels the same way.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that. It was brought up at the staff meeting, but no one took it seriously. So I wasn&#8217;t going to tell you guys…….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Sayuri-sensei tells us the story. The genesis of the matter is simple.</p>



<p>The last test was cheated and it was on the agenda at the staff meeting. But since there was no proof and the credibility of the information was extremely low, it was not passed on to us.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the school, wishing to avoid any misconduct, decided to change the inspection to another class for various reasons.</p>



<p>This is the end of the story, but here is where an irregularity occurred. The same information was circulated on social networking sites. It seems that there was some kind of large-scale organized cheating, and the main culprit was, of course, me, Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>The flames had been flared up by a self-made maneuver, and while the fire has not yet been completely extinguished, this is a follow-up to the fire. Another page has been carved in the legend of the evil Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Still, the world is not so bad after all, to know that there is a third party with good intentions who is willing to cooperate with my shady little plan. Keep up the good work, stranger!</p>



<p>&#8220;[Please don&#8217;t bring the school&#8217;s reputation into disrepute]. Is that right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s disgusting. How come you guys get the bad end of the stick? Why are we suspicious? Then there&#8217;s no need to change it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sayuri&#8217;s expression was very sad. What she said was the most reasonable. The fact that the school changed the inspection site was like an implicit admission that they were suspicious of the students. It is easy to understand what &#8220;various circumstances&#8221; means.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;The teachers seem to be in a panic now that it has become public knowledge. Well, that&#8217;s a good sign. What rotten apples. I&#8217;ll never forgive anyone for mocking my students, ever!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s obvious that I&#8217;m a fully automatic reputation-destroying machine at this school, but I can&#8217;t just turn a blind eye to what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I caused all this trouble for all of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. You didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was trying to live a quiet life, but how could I let this happen?</p>



<p>But I have to make up for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very soooooooooooooooooooorrry!&#8221;</p>



<p>I perform a grand prostration. I ruined the results of everyone&#8217;s hard work on the test. My personal apology will not be forgiven. I am prepared to commit seppuku.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Then why don&#8217;t I just quit school?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I must be a degenerate, to have forgotten something as simple as this. If I quit school, there would be no further damage to their reputation, no more sarcasm from Sayuri-sensei, and my classmates would get their deserved reputation, and all would be well. My classmates would be fairly evaluated, and all would be well. It&#8217;s a win-win proposition that will bring smiles to everyone&#8217;s faces.</p>



<p>I may cause trouble for my mother, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll forgive me if I get down on my knees and lick her feet. She&#8217;s been strangely kind to me lately, even more so than before.</p>



<p>Wait a second? I just thought of something even better! A brilliant brain. If they want, I&#8217;ll leave home at this point. I don&#8217;t need any money sent to me. It&#8217;s going to be okay, I can manage. I&#8217;m sure my mother will be happy to agree with me. I&#8217;ll live on a remote island and grow mandarin oranges.</p>



<p>As I present this perfect plan that has nothing but merit, everyone gathers around.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll quit school too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? What nonsense are you talking about? Akane-san would never allow such a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I quit too! Let&#8217;s make tangerines together, Yuki.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So what are you guys talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Remember? I came to this school in pursuit of you, Yukito. If Yukito is gone, what the point of being here?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hinagi spins her words with a smile and a chuckle. But there is not a single lie in her words. I turn my gaze next to her as if pressed by her. Shiori also had a similar expression on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… cowardly. I know. I know that if I say it this way, Yukito will be in trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you again and again. &#8211;I like you. I want to be with you because I like you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi said it clearly and unabashedly. The people around her held their breath and no one could interfere. I knew it was a checkmate. The board could not be overturned. But I struggled to get my foot in the door.</p>



<p>Ungracefully and ugly. I felt that the truth I did not want to admit was hidden there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Think about your future. With this, your future is—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then what about the future of you, Yukito? Where is your happiness?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m at a loss for questions I haven&#8217;t thought about. The future. I wondered if there was such a thing.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had never envisioned the future. I was so busy living in the present that I never thought about what lay ahead. I had no idea where happiness was, and such things were nothing more than a pipe dream. If there was a future for me, the future I could see was….</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll probably die in the field.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let that happen. I will never allow such a future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your defeat. But if it were to happen, I&#8217;ll quit school too. We are talking about you. If you start growing tangerines, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll make a big fuss over a new species or something, and it&#8217;ll be more fun that way.</p>



<p>For some reason, the fresh and handsome guy joins in. Is everyone really that much averse to the school?</p>



<p>&#8220;If all four of you quit at once, Sayuri-sensei will be in a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do not worry about it, Yukito kokonoe. If you quit, I&#8217;ll retire too.&#8221;</p>



<p>These people are crazyyyyyy! I asked my classmates to agree with me, but my allies were nowhere to be found.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, sensei. It won&#8217;t come to that. Besides, Yukito will solve it in no time. Because that&#8217;s the kind of person I like about &#8212;&#8211;Yukito Kokonoe&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The fresh handsome guy was right. Absolute defeat. I was the only one who didn&#8217;t understand. Neither did Hinagi nor Shiori. When we first met again, they looked so gloomy, but now I don&#8217;t see the slightest hint of gloom. If that is growth, the only one who has not grown is always me. I sat down as if to give up. I took a deep breath and exhaled.</p>



<p>I deserve to die for making Sayuri-sensei bow her head and deny the efforts of my classmates. Then there was only one thing to do in this situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make them realize that Sensei&#8217;s bowed head isn&#8217;t cheap.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the shocking SHR, I opened the newspaper.</p>



<p>One of the arguments in favor of newspapers that is prevalent in the world is that, with the Internet, one can only get information that interests him or her, but with newspapers, one can see information that does not interest him or her, and the information is unbiased.</p>



<p>Nonsense. This is nothing more than the plaintive cry of a declining media.</p>



<p>Where does the assumption come from that people who read newspapers read them cover to cover?</p>



<p>Some people only read the TV section, some are interested only in stock prices. There are probably people who read only the three-page articles. One should not forget that newspapers themselves are biased. In the end, all media have their advantages and disadvantages, and this kind of advocacy does not in any way indicate the superiority of newspapers.</p>



<p>Regardless of this, the class was, as expected, in disarray.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>

<p>&#8220;Cheating? We didn&#8217;t do anything like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwa, there are a lot of terrible things written in the paper. Kokonoe, you shouldn&#8217;t look at them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Poor Fujishiro-sensei. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get in trouble for getting good grades. What are you going to do about it, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>What what, another victory for the goddess of the legal profession? Heh, there are goddesses in the legal profession. It&#8217;s not only in this school, huh? Maybe there are goddesses everywhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, Hinagi and Shiori grabbed my arms tightly. What&#8217;s wrong with you guys?</p>



<p>They are looking at me with anxious but strong-willed eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;No one person can do it alone. We must think together. I won&#8217;t allow Yukito to be the only victim.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not just Yuki&#8217;s problem. We are all here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been going …… again. That&#8217;s enough!&#8221;</p>



<p>She took the newspaper away from me and was unreasonably angry with me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so, you know, ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the local section of the newspaper caught my eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hihi-…… even though my mom praised me, …… it&#8217;s sad …….&#8221;</p>



<p>A leopard lizard-mockingbird comforts a dejected Shakado. &#8212;-!? Ah, what a gacha figure. I was surprised. Gacha these days can be anything. Picone!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a flash of inspiration!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still the same cartoonish guy.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>I hesitate to say my thoughts out loud. It&#8217;s always easier when I&#8217;m alone. No matter what the outcome, I don&#8217;t have to bear the responsibility, no conflicts. But, maybe&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t allow only Yukito to be sacrificed. I think it is the same for everyone. I will help you because I love you, and I will cooperate with you because we are friends. That&#8217;s all there is to it. What Yukito has done for us so far. You always do your best for someone, you always do your best for them. So don&#8217;t think too hard. You are not alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>She looks around. I was supposed to be a &#8220;shady, lonely person,&#8221; but I&#8217;m going in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>Somehow, my surroundings are always full of people. A sigh escaped my lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do this on my own. I need everyone&#8217;s help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>The two people who clung to my arms were quickly pulled away and I began to talk about what I had come up with, and gradually a wicked smile began to appear on the faces of my classmates.</p>



<p>&#8220;Given what schools are most reluctant to do right now, the answer is obvious. It&#8217;s the right approach.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What were they doing, putting our homeroom teacher through all that? Let&#8217;s teach them a lesson, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahahaha! Kokonoe, you&#8217;re the best! Let&#8217;s do it, let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom would have said OK immediate. She was originally planning to attend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, what about fathers?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If anything, the school might not like fathers as much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll have a little talk with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Kazu in a while. I&#8217;m embarrassed, but I guess I don&#8217;t have a choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Takahashi and Akanuma hold hands tightly. In fact, these two have been classmates since junior high school and are apparently good friends. Everyone is already making moves, contacting their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, in this situation, it would be irresponsible for me not to inform you. It can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I could not turn my back on the situation. I had asked for everyone&#8217;s cooperation, but I couldn&#8217;t do nothing on my own. I had no choice but to bring a gift and go and ask for help.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope you can rest in peace, Sayuri Sensei. I should be the one to clear your name.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are aware that our homeroom teacher is still alive, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>He never forgets to fang chop me. The refreshingly handsome is so disciplined.</p>

<br>

<p>It was very sad. It was hard and painful. How could I have forgotten?</p>



<p>I vaguely remembered that this feeling that was going through my heart was sadness.</p>



<p>I was not sad when I was rejected or when I could not participate in the games. There was only resignation, and I was satisfied that that was the way it was.</p>



<p>Maybe it was because I was sad for the rest of my life on the day I took Sekka-san&#8217;s hand. The pain of separation from love. I was so sad, heartbroken, and exhausted.</p>



<p>The sadness of that day overshadowed everything else, and I stopped crying.</p>



<p>&#8220;How can you be so selfish!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, Sekka! I don&#8217;t have much time left!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just like that day, Mom and Sekka-san were arguing because of me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I was filled with apology. I felt sorry for myself.</p>



<p>A deep sadness engulfed me. If only I hadn&#8217;t existed, if only I hadn&#8217;t been born, the two of them would never have quarreled with each other. My existence is the cause of their discord.</p>



<p>I am a foreigner who blesses this world and spreads misfortune. That is me, Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>I cannot bear to be here, even though I know I&#8217;m here.</p>



<p>My mother is very beautiful and charming. She is a proud mother who is kind and caring to her children.</p>



<p>But if I observe her carefully, I think she has aged a little. It&#8217;s natural, and she is young for her age. Still, I know that the burden of me, the stress, is causing her a lot of hardship. It&#8217;s not just money. I am exploiting my mother&#8217;s time, even her youth. I am the biggest obstacle.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will change. I will become a mother who is not ashamed of her children and who is proud of them!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you do that earlier, to Yuki-chan――&#8221;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t meant to be this way. It&#8217;s too lousy to be excused.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The reason why the two of them ended up fighting goes back to an hour ago now.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trivial thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou! Yuki, you always say that, but I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried to give her some of the fancy chocolates I had bought, but Sekka-san got mad at me.</p>



<p>Sekka-san&#8217;s pet rabbit, Friedrich II, pounces onto my lap and starts munching on some moo moo food. Pre-plop. Oh, he pooped on me. By the way, the reason why he the second is because he is the second generation.</p>



<p>&#8220;For some reason, animals have always liked you, Yuki.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Such a thing…there should be…seems to be…I wonder if there is?&#8221;</p>



<p>I lost confidence along the way. Come to think of it, when I go to parks and such, the pigeons are usually urging me to feed them. I never have it so conveniently, though.</p>



<p>&#8220;I bet you were a tamer in your former life. Do you like rabbits, Yuki?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Rabbits? They are cute and adorable, aren&#8217;t they? My name contains &#8220;Usagi&#8221; too, so I feel like I&#8217;m related to them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s good. I&#8217;ll order a reverse bunny then!&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka-san, who was satisfied with the order, fiddled with the computer. What is a reverse bunny? I look behind Friedrich II. Prrrrrrrrrr. Ah, it pooed again.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with Friedrich II in particular, so I search for it on my phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait! Let&#8217;s calm down and discuss!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, look at international politics. Talking will not solve anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Click.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>The relentless blow of the mail-order button causes Yukito Kokonoe to scream in agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is bad, this is bad! What are you going to do?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to wear it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to wear it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The beneficial bacteria in my gut are running low. Well then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think you can escape?&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s too much of a difference in level to escape! And if I think about it, this is the boss&#8217;s room. I can&#8217;t stop trembling and shaking, and Sekka is in a good mood. Is this the level difference between us?</p>



<p>The reason I came to Sekka-san&#8217;s apartment today was to ask her to come to my class visit and to talk to her about my mother, who has been acting strange lately. My sister is always acting weird, so I&#8217;ll spare her the details, but I&#8217;m worried about what&#8217;s going on with my mother.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thank you for inviting me, Yuki. I&#8217;ll be there with makeup on!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please have mercy. I can&#8217;t let you get any more beautiful than this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou! Yuki, you really are good at making people happy, you know that? This, this!&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka-san was writhing and squirming in agony. For me, she&#8217;s the one person I can&#8217;t get my head around, and I&#8217;m always grateful for her help. I have nothing but gratitude.</p>



<p>&#8220;So she changed her mind, ……. Sis, what&#8217;s up with you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe she was actually a robot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what changing her mind means, Yuki.&#8221;</p>



<p>I am also skeptical about the robot mother theory, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can just leave it alone. That&#8217;s why I came to talk to Sekka-san about it. At first, I thought she might be worried about her being sick, but to be honest, my mother has become very charming.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s changed specifically, Yuki-chan?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When I&#8217;m asked again, I feel troubled. There isn&#8217;t a clear change. If I had to put it into words, it&#8217;s more like an atmosphere, or a sense of distance, something vague like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm…It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s become more erotic or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Erotic!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sh*t! I had unknowingly said something unnecessary again.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not! Oh, that&#8217;s right. She said something about redoing everything being my mother!&#8221;</p>



<p>Somehow, the nuance of training from scratch stirred up my uneasiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Does she wants to start over with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think so……&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m stumped. As expected, even Sekka-san doesn&#8217;t understand. I don&#8217;t see any particular harm in my mother becoming a mom. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m nervous and uncomfortable. It might be heart failure.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I have to call my sister and ask her about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka-san calls my mother on her phone. Even though I can&#8217;t understand it very well, Sekka-san who is smart, will be able to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>[Oh, sis. Yuki asked me to attend the class visit. &#8211;Eh, what? Why you? What are you talking about now? And Yuki said you&#8217;ve been acting strange lately&#8212;-Ha? No matter how terrible things have been until now&#8211;enough, I&#8217;m leaving now!]</p>



<p>She hangs up the phone angrily. Apparently, something had gone wrong with my mother. I was going to leave now, so I decided to follow along.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuki. Anything going on lately?&#8221;</p>



<p>I used to consult with Sekka-san about all sorts of things. I couldn&#8217;t figure things out on my own, and I couldn&#8217;t do anything about it. Somehow nostalgic, we talk about recent events as we wish.</p>



<p>I talked about meeting people I never thought I would meet again, being falsely and genuinely confessed by someone, a highly sensitive stranger, a strange family member, being falsely accused of molestation, getting into a bicycle accident, and the list goes on and on.</p>



<p>Sekka-san&#8217;s eyes widened as she listened to my rambling on and on.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yuki, could it be that you are&#8212;&#8220;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Mom and Sekka-san are arguing intensely in front of me. A human-made disaster that I caused by easily asking Sekka-san to do something for me. Looking back, I have always torn their relationship apart.</p>



<p>If I hadn&#8217;t been there, the two of them would have been close sisters.</p>



<p>The scene I saw one day. A collision I never wanted to see again. It was because of me, because of me, caused by me, all the time, every time.</p>



<p>No matter how many times I bowed my head and said I was sorry, the fighting never stopped, and it just made the situation worse, as if it were pouring oil on the fire. I was left with nothing but tremendous helplessness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go. If you stay here, Yuki, you&#8217;ll get destroyed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just like that day, Sekka-san reaches out her hand to me. I naturally tried to take her hand, but I was held back from behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you have him anymore! I love him! I need this child!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a strange feeling. I had never seen my mother so desperate.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She was just so single-minded, so sincere, so honest, no matter what.</p>



<p>&#8211;Need. Do you really need me?</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize how much you&#8217;ve hurt Yuki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be forgiven. I don&#8217;t care if he hates me for the rest of my life. Still, I can&#8217;t bear the thought of parting without being able to tell him, because I can&#8217;t stand it like this anymore. I&#8217;ll tell him. I want him to know. How much I love him and how much I care about him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Mom? Eh, again? Your face is getting closer and closer…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;H-hey, sis. What are you&#8211;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The legs are flailing about, but they don&#8217;t seem to budge. Gradually, I began to run out of oxygen.</p>



<p>Sekka-san hurriedly tried to pull away, but she couldn&#8217;t budge the embrace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Zhezhe …….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The second time is far more intense and dense. My headache is blown away by the shock of it all.</p>



<p>Not good…… head is spinning. My lungs were in intense need of fresh oxygen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sekka, I&#8217;m serious. More than anyone, more than you.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was as if she was slapping a declaration of war on her. Sekka-san was stunned for a while, but then she came to her senses.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re being so shameless! …I won&#8217;t lose. To my sister, I&#8217;ll never lose.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka-san confronts her. Her eyes held a strong sparkle that was as strong as my mother&#8217;s.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>The uninspiring background music made me feel drowsy and sleepy.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t solve the &#8220;Mom&#8217;s acting weird problem&#8221; even with the help of Sekka-san, but then I came up with a hypothesis. You know what they say. Too much stress is bad. If you don&#8217;t release it, it can cause physical and mental problems.</p>



<p>Perhaps a similar characteristic exists in motherhood?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In other words, motherhood is currently too much and is modulating her body and mind.</p>



<p>I am optimistic, but I believe that the current situation is nothing more than a sale of excess motherhood, and that once it has dissipated, things will return to normal.</p>



<p>I hope she will soon return to her usual gentle mother who doesn&#8217;t care about me at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? How unusual. I can&#8217;t believe Yukito being that tired.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I learned the appearance of defeat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At first glance, it looks like you were studying hard, but it&#8217;s definitely not for the same reasons.&#8221;</p>



<p>As far as our family is concerned, it is maternal lust. Hojo Yasutoki also smiled wryly at this.</p>



<p>Even though I am used to getting into trouble, the recent disturbance was not within the scope of that. I can&#8217;t hold myself like this! I would become a captive of my mother.</p>



<p>So, I stayed up all night last night thinking about it and formulated the following fifty-one laws in the home.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Knock when you enter a room.<br>Sleep in your own room.<br>Take a bath alone.<br>Never leave your clothes behind.<br>Brush your teeth by yourself.<br>Excessive touching is strictly prohibited.<br>Snacks are limited to 300 yen.<br>Keep your bills to a reasonable amount.</p>



<p>I was so elated that I proposed the rule with enthusiasm, thinking that it would be a two-way vote of approval, but the proposal was immediately rejected. Give it back! Give me back my sleep!</p>



<p>My sister was terrible. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we walk around in our underwear?&#8221; Hmm, okay, okay. She doesn&#8217;t understand anything.</p>



<p>Since the Kokonoe family is a family of three, the proposal should have passed with the consent of two members. …… If I think about it, there are no allies on my side. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way,…… am I allowed to be here……?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was shocked, Shakado suddenly appeared from behind me. As usual, her stealth is as good as ever. Is it really necessary to erase your presence?</p>



<p>&#8220;If anything, she is the key person in this case. If you have any problems with reptiles, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee hee… Leave it to me… But, it doesn&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;ll have a chance to do anything…&#8221;</p>



<p>Dragging a dreary Shakado with me, I take a seat at the table with a refreshingly handsome man.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>The blue sky is beautiful. The sky is clear. The housewives and elderly people seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p>



<p>On the weekend, the three of us, a different kind of group, were participating in a quiz tournament in our town, just to &#8220;go and win a little&#8221;. All of our classmates knew this.</p>



<p>The team name that we participated under will surprise you. It&#8217;s &#8220;Cheating Class 1B&#8221;.</p>



<p>This is a great name for a team that is worthy of a quiz.</p>



<p>Unless there is a quiz king, we are sure to win.</p>



<p>&#8212; and while I&#8217;m saying that, we won. I get interviews and stuff.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. This team name means something. Actually, our class got a good grade in the last test, but we were falsely accused of cheating, which never happened, and we were treated unfairly. The only people who believed us were our homeroom teachers, Sanjoji sensei and Fujishiro sensei. But I can&#8217;t believe that the principals would do something like that to damage the school&#8217;s reputation. Today, we participated in the quiz competition to prove that we didn&#8217;t cheat!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We are …… innocent, but we are sad …… to be doubted …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m next. Well, …… principal, please stop. We didn&#8217;t cheat! We won this tournament on our own merit.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Refreshingly handsome, you&#8217;re not a good actor. I discovered an unexpected weakness.</p>



<p>The interview was cut off prematurely, as if they thought the atmosphere was unpleasant.</p>



<p>In fact, this quiz competition is being broadcast live on a local program of a regional information channel.</p>



<p>This means that it is now being broadcast on TV to rave reviews.</p>



<p>I happened to find a notice in the local section of the newspaper inviting participation and decided to take advantage of it. It may not have a large audience and it may not spread, but that&#8217;s not the point.</p>



<p>Sorry to the interviewer with the twitchy smile on his face, but in this day and age, you can&#8217;t hide anything. We quickly left the venue and immediately uploaded the full interview to a video site, asking our classmates to spread the word.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this going to cause a firestorm? It doesn&#8217;t seem to have much of an effect. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that what we&#8217;re trying to do?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>All we are doing is merely setting the stage. If anything, we don&#8217;t even want the uproar to spread.</p>



<p>&#8220;Think about it. Who is the most angry this time? We don&#8217;t have to do anything, they&#8217;ll take care of the rest. Shakado should be able to figure it out now, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Mama…… was really angry ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, so that&#8217;s how it is. It&#8217;s starting to make me feel sorry for them … &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s their own fault. What about you, fresh handsome man?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. When I told my mom about it, she was so happy, it was embarrassing.&#8221;</p>



<p>It may be a joy for a parent to be relied upon by a child at the difficult age of puberty.</p>



<p>There were also families that said, &#8220;Okay, Dad, I&#8217;m going to do my best!&#8221;</p>



<p>Family circumstances vary from person to person. Some of my classmates were so tense that they hardly talked to each other. If this could be an opportunity for them, it would be a win-win situation. Even though it is a beautiful thing to do, after all, it is best for families to get along well with each other.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Even if that&#8217;s the case, there may be parents who are difficult to reason with, who are harmful to their children. The fact that these kinds of parents exist is a reality. While it is not necessarily always right to get along with them, it is important to have ideals to strive for.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mama was …… going to be in on it from the beginning …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about you, Yukito?</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, my head ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Here comes the effect of lack of sleep. It&#8217;s hard to think any more. Good night.</p>


<br>

<p>&#8220;How did this happen……&#8221;</p>



<p>An urgently called staff meeting was filled with a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>The inspection had ended without incident, and just when they were relieved, another problem arose.</p>



<p>Trembling and shaking as he stared at the documents in his hand, the principal squeezed out a voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure there was no fault on our part…….&#8221;</p>



<p>The video of Yukito Kokonoe, who was participating in the quiz competition, was immediately called into question for what he said, but at that point, the situation was settled with some confusion.</p>



<p>In the first place, there is no such thing as a fact that large-scale cheating took place. Interviews with the teachers who were in charge of supervising the examinations also concluded that there was no suspicious behavior whatsoever.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that the allegations themselves were malicious harassment of Class B, but the school did not intend to make any wrong decisions. There was no negligence that would have caused problems.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Furthermore, there is no way that the teachers, led by the principal, would have voluntarily taken the initiative in damaging the school&#8217;s reputation, no matter how much they try to pin it on the school.</p>



<p>The claims made by Yukito were so absurd and ridiculous that they did not even spread widely. It is not even worth dealing with. In fact, his behavior itself was so controversial that it was considered to be a serious defamation of the school&#8217;s reputation.</p>



<p>After all, there is no way that pressure tactics using social networking sites, such as those seen in dramas and novels, will work. It is a childish idea that makes fun of adults, controlled by a sense of omnipotence peculiar to adolescents. He thought it was just a silly and shallow idea. As a matter of fact, it had no significant impact.</p>



<p>However, at the beginning of the week, Fujishiro&#8217;s report shook him to his core.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujishiro, is this a …… mistake ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>With a bead of perspiration on his forehead, he was compelled to confirm this, even though he was hoping it was a lie.</p>



<p>&#8220;The rest of the students don&#8217;t know until the end of the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How did this happen……&#8221;</p>



<p>The principal muttered the same words as before. No one else spoke.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Finally, he realizes. This was his main goal from the beginning. It was not a foolish and reckless act by a confused student. It was a precise, detailed, and calculated attack on a weak point.</p>



<p>&#8220;From what I hear, many of the parents are outraged.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji winks at him for a moment, and then returns the same look.</p>



<p>(Sanjoji-sensei, did you know this was going to happen?)</p>



<p>This year, most of the parents were scheduled to participate in the class visit, which is usually attended by only about 20% of the students. Only two parents circled &#8221; do not attend&#8221;. Those two parents were also in the process of adjusting their work schedules until the very last minute.</p>



<p>Like the principal, Fujishiro&#8217;s hands trembled with cold sweat when she held the form in her hands.</p>



<p>Normally, this would have been a joyous occasion. However, at this particular moment, it was clear that this was nothing more than a clear protest by the parents against the school.</p>



<p>If it were just one or two parents, it would still be manageable, but if there is a high possibility of being scolded by this many parents, it&#8217;s not possible to continue as normal. Some of the parents are high-status individuals and it&#8217;s not known who has what connections.</p>



<p>Unable to pretend that it all didn&#8217;t happen now, he was stuck in a situation where he was trapped in all directions.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>(I never thought that I would even be protected by Yukito Kokonoe…….)</p>



<p>She mocks herself in her chest. If such a thing were possible, there would be no need to go to the trouble of doing it that way. The reason why he dared to make such an unreasonable claim in the form of a video was to clarify the position of Fujishiro and Sanjoji.</p>



<p>If the names of Fujishiro and Sanjoji had not been mentioned in the video, Fujishiro would have been just as horrified as the principals.</p>



<p>（Yes, I&#8217;ll be nice to him next time. But still, I never thought that even the parents of Mikuriya would participate. Really, that man ……. I don&#8217;t know which one of us is the teacher…….)</p>



<p>Mikuriya Seido. He was a noteworthy figure in the class, apart from Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Fujishiro had always been concerned about him. He was not a problematic student, but rather a normal student. However, there was a risk that this might happen again.</p>



<p>His parents were divorced, and his father had custody of him. However, this was only recently decided. Seido&#8217;s mother had been having an affair for five years.</p>



<p>It was double adultery, as the other party was also a married man. The affair was discovered by a call from the other spouse, who became suspicious and requested an investigation by a professional investigator.</p>



<p>A detached, adult relationship. However, he learned that such a beautiful phrase was an illusion once he was exposed. Not only is it a discrete relationship, but it is a one-way ticket to hell, a straight line to ruin, not only for the family, but also for the relatives.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The amount of alimony will also increase if the divorce is based on cheating. Not only will he have to pay alimony to his spouse, but his partner&#8217;s spouse will also demand alimony from him, and he will lose everything. Aside from men who earn a lot of money, Seido&#8217;s mother is a full-time housewife. With no way to repay the money, she had no choice but to put her trust in her parents.</p>



<p>The cleanup took several months, and the other spouse divorced. But that was not the end. Betrayals such as cheating and adultery will always torment those involved.</p>



<p>This is where the tragedy of Seido&#8217;s life began. His father, who had never heard of his wife&#8217;s adultery over the years, became suspicious and asked his wife if Seido was really his child. When Seido happened to hear about it, he was shocked and depressed.</p>



<p>Of course, Seido is unquestionably his father and mother&#8217;s child. Already sixteen years old, Seido can choose his parental rights. At his fastidious and difficult age, adultery is unforgivable. He would not be able to follow his mother, who owed him a large sum of money in alimony. Although custody was easily decided in favor of his father, Seido&#8217;s father&#8217;s suspicions of mendicancy caused Seido to feel a deep sense of despair, as if he had lost all allies in the family.</p>



<p>He is the only son and has no siblings. His father, who immediately realized his blunder, apologized, but it was too late.</p>



<p>He was left to deal with the situation alone, suffering and struggling with algae. Even Fujishiro could clearly see that Seido was pale and emaciated.</p>



<p>When he finally reached the end of his rope, the person who extended a helping hand to him was Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe has been talking with many of his classmates for a long time. For some reason, the questions he asks for help are also diverse. They range from how to solve a problem he doesn&#8217;t understand to how to get rid of a stink bug that has stuck to the screen door. Perhaps it is because he places himself at the bottom of the pile that he is so easy to talk to. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I be a loner?!&#8221; Fujishiro thinks it will be impossible as long as he stays in school.</p>



<p>(Come to think of it, Soma has become a lot brighter lately, and if I may say so, Suo, too. What is that man really doing day in and day out…..)</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Soma Kyouka, huh? The student is famous among the second year students, but the truth is that many of them hated her.</p>



<p>Being referred to as a high-class flower may sound good, but if that kind of atmosphere and attitude rubs people the wrong way, it&#8217;s not likely to be well-regarded by the same sex… or at least that was the case until now.</p>



<p>Recently, however, she has somehow become very soft-spoken and no longer has the sting and prickliness that she used to have, and this has led to a significant change in the way she is viewed not only by the opposite sex but also by the same sex.</p>



<p>The correlation between the people surrounding Yukito Kokonoe is complicated and bizarre.</p>



<p>People mysteriously gather around that man. Against his will.</p>



<p>There is no telling why Seido Mikuriya decided to open up to Yukito Kokone.</p>



<p>Was it because he could sympathize with the fact that Yukito Kokonoe was also a single parent, or was it because he was always in dire straits, or was it because he had seen the details of what had happened with Hinagi Suzurika and Shiori Kamishiro? Either way, Seido needed someone to help him.</p>



<p>When Yukito Kokonoe heard the story, he went to Seido&#8217;s house frequently. His mother was frightened of Seido, saying that she could not bear to face her child. His father, too, was tormented by remorse for the deep hurt he had caused Seido. Yukito acted as an intermediary, listening to his parents&#8217; thoughts and feelings and conveying them to Seido. He also hears Seido&#8217;s feelings and conveys them to each of them.</p>



<p>At first, the parents were puzzled by the sudden appearance of Yukito Kokonoe, but when they learned how he was doing at school and how much pain Seido was in, they burst into tears. The parents apologize while crying. Seido heard about it from Yukito Kokonoe with tears in his eyes. In this way, he patiently and repeatedly bridged the gap between the two sides.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>These days continued, and gradually the relationship began to improve. The divorce remains unchanged.</p>



<p>However, Seido&#8217;s father decides not to ask his ex-wife for alimony. Instead, he made her promise to repay the alimony to the adulterous spouse by working herself. In fact, Seido&#8217;s father would actually pay it back.</p>



<p>He also made a promise that when all the repayments were paid, he would consider restructuring the marriage.</p>



<p>Seido was a witness to the Mikuriya couple&#8217;s relationship. Both of them cared about Seido. That is why they were stubborn at first, but chose to compromise.</p>



<p>The righteous mother cannot act like a mother at the earliest opportunity. No matter how much she talks to her children about studying, obeying the rules, and other moral and general issues, if she is kicked out of the house by an affair. In some cases, the mother&#8217;s presence may have a negative influence.</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a full circle at the time of adultery. Everyone is hurt, and the cost of a trivial temptation is too great. Nevertheless, this settlement saved Seido&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>And as a consolation prize, Seido asked his parents to come to his class.</p>



<p>His mother, who cried for hours apologizing that she had no right to do so, finally nodded her head, and his father, also in tears, promised to attend.</p>



<p>Seido never forgave his mother. If he had been a little younger, he might have rejected her altogether. He was able to come to terms with the situation, and there was someone who reached out to Seido. It was a choice that was made because of the timing. No one knows if it is right or not. It will probably be a long time before the result is known.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Fujiashiro heard these details directly from Seido. Apparently, Yukito Kokonoe told him that his homeroom teacher was worried. He is a man who is always on top of things.</p>



<p>Fujishiro was devastated by her own helplessness. Certainly, she was worried. She was concerned, but it could be said that she was just anxious. It was impossible for a teacher to get involved in a family situation, let alone a school problem.</p>



<p>It would be even more so if she considered it only as one of the places of employment. That is why Fujishiro respects Sanjoji for her philosophy, but even Sanjoji can&#8217;t help her.</p>



<p>(…… unusual. I would have a pit in my stomach. What on earth kind of mentality would make this possible ……? Doesn&#8217;t that guy have anything to be afraid of? Come to think of it, he said he was afraid of peaches……He&#8217;s still the guy who I don&#8217;t understand at all)</p>



<p>At the very least, Fujishiro is far from being able to step into the &#8220;shuraba&#8221; and work to improve the relationship. For the Mikuriya family, Yukito Kokonoe is a benefactor.</p>



<p>The same may be true for the Suzurikawa and Kamishiro&#8217;s parents.</p>



<p>If so, they would never allow anyone to harm him. After all, the mother of the Kokonoe is also said to be a devoted mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Okay, Fujishiro-sensei? Please explain carefully to the parents so that there will be no misunderstanding. We have no intention to humiliate the students.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will do my best. However, there is a possibility that I am not competent enough to handle the situation. ……At that time, I will ask you for help, Principal.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The principal shudders and shakes. One wrong move and the situation could turn serious.</p>



<p>He is now in a situation like he has never been in before. All he can do is hope that the situation will pass without incident.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>（Sleep with a shiver, you bald b*****d!)</p>



<p>Swearing. Not understanding what he and the others were becoming enemies with. There was no hint of the decisive situation that awaited them in the future.</p>



<p>From that point on, the staff meeting was chaotic. A discussion was held to determine how the situation had been handled without any problems, and a list of hypothetical questions and answers was prepared.</p>



<p>It was also decided that a proper explanation would be given to the Class B students before the class visit, and the meeting was almost over when the principal received a phone call.</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;T-Tojo-sensei! Is this about the other day? …… That student is indeed registered. He has often been a problem you know &#8212;- y-yes. He will be punished immediately.]</p>



<p>The impatience of the situation made him sweat uncomfortably. This is because the principal&#8217;s gaze occasionally caught Fujishiro&#8217;s.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The urgency of the principal&#8217;s gaze heightened the tension in the room. When he finished the call, he let out a loud sigh and opened his mouth slowly, gravely.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Fujishiro-sensei, please call him up right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>He felt as if he had stepped into a slimy, bottomless swamp.</p>
