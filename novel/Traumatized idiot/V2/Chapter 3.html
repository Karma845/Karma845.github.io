<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 3: A Man Who Causes Trouble at the University</h1>   

<p>&#8220;Perish, you Parisian!&#8221; </p>



<p>[TL: The term “Parisi” refers to people who like to get together at seasonal events such as Halloween and Christmas, as well as at clubs and music festivals where many people gather to have fun together. It can also be used to mean simply “playing with friends,” “making a lot of noise,” or “someone who is in a good mood. It can also be used as a verb, as in “to be Parisian.]</p>



<p>I would have made a clenched fist, but I&#8217;m in college.</p>



<p>So this is the dungeon. I must brace myself. The Parisian Lair ※Recommended level: 18<br>After returning home and changing, I headed to the designated place at the university.</p>



<p>Since this is my first time visiting the place, I hope she can at least give me a tour. The campus is too big.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Yukito-kun. This way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ninomiya-san? It&#8217;s been a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>I found the person I was looking for surprisingly easily. Mio Ninomiya.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>She was the messiah who saved me from being falsely accused of molestation. If it weren&#8217;t for Ninomiya-san, I would have been in a lot of trouble with President Kedou.</p>



<p>Since then, we have kept in touch from time to time, and I received a call from Ninomiya-san asking me to come over to her place after school.</p>



<p>We had had some small exchanges in the past, but this time she asked me to do something for her. As a high school student, there is not much I can do for her, but she asked me to come …….</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to call me Mio. I&#8217;m a good friend of yours, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, what kind of relationship do you think we have?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Master and slave?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Slavery has been revived in modern Japan ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just kidding. We&#8217;re lovers?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;ve never had a girlfriend in my life? The other party was a female college student.</p>



<p>Unlike girls my grade, her fashion and makeup were more mature. This made me realize that there is a difference between a college student and a high school student. Needless to say, it didn&#8217;t seem like a very good match for me. It was too much to bear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming today. But what do you want me to do for you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;Will you be my lover?&#8221;</p>



<p>To sum up, it was like this. Mio was invited to a blind date today.</p>



<p>A blind date, the real deal! I thought it was an imaginary ritual, but it seems to be real.</p>



<p>According to Mio, she is not interested in going to the party and does not want to participate, but her friends begged her to come to the party to make up the number of people.</p>



<p>The party was a basketball club, but the reality of the party was just like any other party.</p>



<p>As for my part, there was no room for my involvement. I had nothing to do with it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>To me, this was an omen of unexpected trouble.</p>



<p>I was just too curious as to why I, a high school student, was invited to this meeting.</p>



<p>“But it’s a blind date? I’d get really drunk, then someone would carry me to their place, and a video of me making ahegao doing peace signs would be sent to Yukito-kun?”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“I’d say things like Yukito-kun you can’t satisfy me anymore?”</p>



<p>“Mio, you’ve been watching too many weird videos.”</p>



<p>“And I was threatened on the basis of that, and one day I’ll conceive a child by a man I don’t know.”</p>



<p>“Crap. You’re a completely uncommunicative species. Were you always like this?&#8221;</p>



<p>“So, Yukito-kun, you’re going to help me, right?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>“No.……” </p>



<p>“Do you want to see me end up with nipple rings?” </p>



<p>&#8220;College students are awesome. I mean, in the brain.&#8221;</p>



<p>“You don’t like it, do you?” </p>



<p>“Is this what they call a one-way communication?</p>



<p>“You don’t like it, do you?”</p>



<p>“No!”</p>



<p>I could only shake my head. In short, she was avoiding guys. She wants me to act as her temporary boyfriend during the party, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have any questions about it.</p>



<p>“Why me? Isn’t a high school student a bit strange?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>“Because you’re the only one who I can ask to do this. I don’t know many men, and moreover, the content is so specific that it can only be done by someone you trust.”</p>



<p>“But if you bring your boyfriend to a party, is it really a mixer?”</p>



<p>“I told her I wouldn’t go otherwise. That’s fine. Let’s just make out on our own, okay?”</p>



<p>“Like I said, we don’t have that kind of relationship.……”</p>



<p>“It’s fine because we’re lovers.”</p>



<p>It seems that before I knew it, Mio’s trust in me had increased. It’s a strange thing. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know because I have never attended one in the first place, but isn&#8217;t a blind date an event to make a boyfriend or girlfriend? I feel uncomfortable about participating as her boyfriend there, but if Mio-san and the other members are satisfied with it, is it okay?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to see Mio regretting such a thing either. I owe her a debt of gratitude for saving me, so why don&#8217;t I help her out!</p>



<p>“I understand. I’ll do it!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>“I wanted to hear those words.”</p>



<p>We headed for our destination, exchanging a few words in the style of a mysterious doctor.</p>



<p><strong>[Tristy PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be doing this ……!&#8221;</p>



<p>I, Tristy Heitra Shiran, am depressed. I curl my pink-gold hair around my fingers. It&#8217;s a habit I&#8217;ve had for a long time when I&#8217;m in deep thought.</p>



<p>I think I have a cheerful personality, if I do say so myself. I&#8217;ve never been this depressed before.</p>



<p>The reason for this is because of me. A while ago, I had an accident.</p>



<p>A bicycle accident. It was just a little pride. A lack of awareness of reality. A gross negligence caused by such things. I was riding my bike with headphones on.</p>



<p>That in itself is a problem, but then my phone rang. If I needed to answer it, I would stop the bike and answer it. With this in mind, I picked up my phone while still on the bike. It was a minor carelessness. It led to an accident.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The moment I took my eyes off to check my phone, I was hit by the other cyclist.</p>



<p>The other party was a boy in high school. The impact struck me as if I had hit something very hard, but the other boy was sent flying by the force of the collision.</p>



<p>I turned completely blue. Immediately, someone nearby rushed to the boy and dialed 110. I also hurriedly got off my bicycle and went to the boy.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was no noticeable external injury, but I could not rest assured. In the past, there have been cases of people who suffered brain injuries from being hit by bicycles and died a few days later.</p>



<p>If he had hit his head hard from the impact of the collision, it would not matter whether he had suffered trauma or not.</p>



<p>What should I do! What have I done! I have never experienced such fear in my life.</p>



<p>I might have stolen the future of a completely innocent boy in front of me.</p>



<p>I would be arrested as a criminal myself. I have betrayed my parents and caused them grief. The boy in front of me was the one who was going through the hardest and most painful time of his life, but I was angry and saddened at myself for being so selfish.</p>



<p>Tears were spilling out of my eyes. All I could do was hope that the boy would be okay, and I stood there in a state of utter disbelief.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As it turned out, a settlement was reached. The other party had no noticeable injuries, and the examination results were normal. I, my dad, and my mom apologized desperately.</p>



<p>By that time, we were prepared for a lawsuit. No matter how big of a monster I was, what I had done was socially unacceptable. I caused the accident by holding my phone in my hand while wearing headphones. It was unforgivable.</p>



<p>But the boy forgave me. I was spared a lawsuit and a settlement was discussed. I was prepared for it to be expensive, but the boy did not want that either.</p>



<p>On the contrary, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m used to it, so don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; as if he cared about us as we went to apologize. The boy&#8217;s kindness made my heart ache even more, and I could not forgive myself for hurting such a boy.</p>



<p>Since then, my life has gone on as usual. But I never felt better. The face of the boy comes to mind. This is how the perpetrators of accidents are tormented by guilt for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>If I had not been a little bit wrong at that time, I would not be here now.</p>



<p>My friend invited me to a party to cheer me up. I don&#8217;t like such things very much and have always declined to participate. I have always had a good growth because I am half-Japanese. Perhaps because of this, many members of the opposite sex have confessed to me that they are interested in my body, and I have always felt the sting of their eyes on me, even in college.</p>



<p>I thought about refusing again this time, but since she was trying to cheer me up, I was afraid to say no. But I was afraid that I would worry my parents and make them worry about me. But how could I enjoy myself after causing my parents to worry and, more importantly, after what had happened to that child?</p>



<p>I stumbled my way to my destination, my melancholy mood still not lifting.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Sorry, I&#8217;m late!&#8221;</p>



<p>The other members of the group were all there. They were already having a great time. I could see the men&#8217;s tension rising at the sight of me. They were giving me unwanted glances and looking at me, staring at my chest and legs.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here, Tristy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What would you like to drink, Tristy?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alcohol was being offered one after another. I am not very good with alcohol.</p>



<p>I knew what it would mean if I were to get drunk in a place like this.</p>



<p>(Disgusting ……!)</p>



<p>I wanted to leave now. Why am I doing this? Why am I in a place like this? I have never liked these kinds of places to begin with.</p>



<p>I looked around my seat in a gloomy mood. A couple had already formed a little distance away from me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>They were talking to each other in a friendly manner.</p>



<p>Eh? Is that&#8212;-. There was a boy sitting there who looked familiar to me.</p>



<p>I have been thinking about that boy ever since then. A very kind boy.</p>



<p>I am not bold enough to think that just because I apologized, that was the end of everything.</p>



<p>I wanted to talk to him more. I wanted to apologize more.</p>



<p>What brought me to this place?</p>



<p>I was wondering why I was here, when I realized that I had jumped in front of him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Guguhee! Sudden loss of vision and a mysterious oppressive feelinggggg.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>







<p>&#8220;Yukito, have you had any pain since then? Any lingering aftereffects?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? If you have any problems, you can always tell me, okay? I&#8217;ll do anything I can do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiran, I&#8217;m fine, so don&#8217;t worry about it so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh ……,I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already apologized. And a bit more distance&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope you call me Tristy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I got it, so just go away from&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you want to drink, Yukito? I know you can&#8217;t drink alcohol. Would you like a Coke?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;How strange, you can&#8217;t hear my words from this distance……?&#8221;</p>



<p>The mystery of why the people around me never listen to me is only getting deeper and deeper. Conversation seems to be taking place, but it is not. It was like a scene out of a comedy show, with the two of us being out of sync.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Tristy covered my vision. I mustn&#8217;t realize what this soft touch was, so I had to remove it from my thoughts. I&#8217;m a healthy high school student, after all. Oh, it&#8217;s so big! I wonder what cup she has. I had failed to remove it from my mind.</p>



<p>I never thought that I would meet the perpetrator of the accident again at a place like this. I have nothing against Tristy, nor do I have any ill will toward her. I wasn&#8217;t even seriously injured, so her being so heartbroken makes me feel like I did something wrong here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, do you know Tristy? Surely you didn&#8217;t try to get a girlfriend while you have me, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you putting on such stiff air?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because Yukito-kun. Do you realize you&#8217;re playing my lover right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand. Mio looked at us curiously, but then she whispered in my ear. There was nothing I could do, but I thought it would be better to explain the situation. It&#8217;s nothing to hide. It is just that I am an idiot.</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8212;-That&#8217;s how it happened&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Something like that happened. I&#8217;m not sure if it was you or the hare. Come to think of it, I think I saw such news. It was Yukito-kun huh? I&#8217;m really sorry to hear about your bad luck. So you&#8217;re not hurt or anything, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. The tests didn&#8217;t show any abnormalities, and I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been hard on Tristy, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how hard it&#8217;s been, because it&#8217;s my fault. I made my mom and dad worry. Above all, Yukito, you have had the hardest time. Glad to see you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Normally, don&#8217;t you hate it? Like you don&#8217;t want to get involved…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I care! I&#8217;ve always cared about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>While conversing, I felt the gaze poking into my eyes from a while ago.</p>



<p>Currently, I am in the middle of a party, but me, Mio, and Tristy, who joined later, are sitting slightly apart from me. I had no intention of participating.</p>



<p>To put it bluntly, we were floating around because we were the only ones there. Because of this, the other men looked at me strangely with resentment.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Excuse me, I&#8217;m going to the bathroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you alright? Do you need some help?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Give me a break&#8221;</p>



<p>If Tristy helped me, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a healthy high school boy myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fue…..&#8221;</p>



<p>I did my business at once. Not the big one, but the small one. I sigh with satisfaction.</p>



<p>Seems a little too old for me, no? However, what in the world am I doing? Even though I have not been drinking, it is out of the question for a high school student to be participating in a blind date with college students. Even if I don&#8217;t think about it, it&#8217;s out.</p>



<p>In many ways, I&#8217;m an out-of-control person, so it&#8217;s a little late for me to say this, but I could have been punished by the school in a normal way. Well, it&#8217;s a little too late for me to get punished!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I was leaving the restroom, someone approached me. It was someone from the basketball circle.</p>



<p>He seemed to be a very flirtatious person, but of course, I did not know him, and we had never had any conversation before.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could you please read the air?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mob A spoke to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nitrogen is 78%, oxygen is 21%, and argon and carbon dioxide together are about 1%.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t asking you to read the main components of the air!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s supposed to be a neat little chemistry joke, isn&#8217;t it? Kerakarakera&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop making a straight face when you are laughing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what do you want from me?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah? Yes, that&#8217;s right. You know this is a blind date, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I heard.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems that Ninomiya-san brought you here, but to tell you the truth, I don&#8217;t like having you here.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had thought it would be something like that anyway, but I was right. He was staring at me with a blatant glare. However, there was nothing I could do about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you say so, I was only asked by Mio.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tristy-san is also sticking around with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it because she doesn&#8217;t want to attend a blind date party with a yarisaki?&#8221; [TL: university club for socializing and having s*x]</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, are you making fun of us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come down, let&#8217;s have some fun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not having a good time when you&#8217;re around&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re just not that attractive.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tsk. Don&#8217;t be high of yourself&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just being honest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t talk so lasciviously. You&#8217;re younger than me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not ashamed to intimidate a younger man?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go home with Mio.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa? Leave Ninomiya-san behind.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Are you stupid? Ah, it slipped out&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop messing with me&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, Mob A was angry with me. Thinking back, perhaps the first thing I lost was the feeling of fear. When I wished for my own death, the feeling of fear dissipated.</p>



<p>Since then, I have never been afraid of anything. Well, I am afraid of my sister.</p>



<p>The next emotion I lost was anger. When I gave up on life, everything turned to resignation, and I no longer had such a rage.</p>



<p>I gave up on myself and expected nothing from anyone or anything. As a result, I did not even recall those negative feelings anymore.</p>



<p>At first glance, this may seem like a good thing. At least, that&#8217;s what has made me who I am. But that&#8217;s not what I need right now.</p>



<p>Fear and anger, I had them. If so, I can get them back.</p>



<p>Understanding the feelings of others is consistent with understanding the &#8221; affection&#8221; that may be directed at me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I can&#8217;t respond to anyone&#8217;s feelings as I am now.</p>



<p>The feelings that I lost one day. To regain them is what I needed to do in order to go from negative to zero, and to understand what lies beyond that.</p>



<p>That is why I seek. What I once lost. I don&#8217;t want anyone to be sad anymore. To not see anyone cry. I shake off the throbbing headache.</p>



<p>I want to &#8220;like&#8221; someone. I want to trust someone.</p>



<p>And I want to &#8220;fall in love&#8221; again.</p>



<p>I want to regain the love that has disappeared, and someday I&#8212;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know that it is Mio&#8217;s decision and not mine, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go home alone right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here at Mio&#8217;s request.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s none of my business.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this what happens when one&#8217;s head is dominated by sexual desire?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get carried away.&#8221;</p>



<p>He grabbed me by the chest. I pulled on his collar and easily removed his hand and quickly returned to Mio&#8217;s place. For crying out loud, there is nothing I can do…..</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah Yukito, welcome back! &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in trouble because I got tangled up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh. Yukito-kun. By whom did you say you were entangled?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That man.&#8221;</p>



<p>I pointed at Mob A who was about to return from the restroom. His eyes met perfectly with mine, as he was looking at me with hatred.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What did you do to Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, Tristy, I didn&#8217;t do anything …….&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy takes a bite out of Mob A. He&#8217;s getting slower and slower. The place was getting noisy. I sensed that I was about to get into trouble, so I quickly made a phone call.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, let&#8217;s go home. I&#8217;m uncomfortable being here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>It quickly connects with a few rings.</p>



<p>[Huh, Yukito-kun, what&#8217;s going on? That&#8217;s unusual?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyakuma-senpai, it&#8217;s been a while. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m at a blind date party with your basketball team, but I&#8217;m having trouble getting along with them, can you help?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Ours? What are their names? I mean, I didn&#8217;t hear anything about a blind date. And what&#8217;s Yukito doing there?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s going on later, but I think Mob A is the name of the group.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Mob A?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. I think he called himself Ishii or something like that. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>[Ishii? There&#8217;s no one in my circle. We&#8217;re not the only ones playing basketball, so it must be some other circle?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;Yarisisa&#8221; group.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Aah, those guys, huh? If that&#8217;s the case, then it&#8217;s even more important that it&#8217;s not us. And, Yukito-kun, we are a legitimate club. We don&#8217;t want to be lumped in with those people.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, that is what you said. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s fine. Are you involved somehow? Do you want me to handle it?]</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m just glad you&#8217;re not involved with them.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>[What are you going to do?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait and see&#8221;</p>



<p>After hanging up the phone, I called out to Tristy-san, who seemed to be in a rage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Tristy-san. They didn&#8217;t do anything to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Yukito-kun….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the result of everyone trying to have fun in their own way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Yukito, you came all this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy is really cute and sad. And that&#8217;s when I came up with a really great idea. The tournament is coming up soon. Could this be a good opportunity?</p>



<p>The hot-blooded seniors are lacking in everything, but the fresh and handsome guy is good at what he does, but he&#8217;s not strong. He still lacks in many areas. He wants to improve, and this might be a good time to take advantage of it. I stopped to think about it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s part of the club activities. Even though I&#8217;m entrusted with the entire training menu, it would be a problem if I organized an international match without permission.</p>



<p>Wait a minute…isn&#8217;t it okay if it&#8217;s private? The school can&#8217;t interfere with the policy of the cram school, and this way, no one will be inconvenienced. If the members are not gathered, I can ask for help from Hyakuma Senpai. It&#8217;s perfect!</p>



<p>I approach Mob A and the others, who are looking indignant, and make a proposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, you guys are in a basketball club, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want, why don&#8217;t you play against me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to run away, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You little……!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Then, good. I&#8217;ll let you be a sacrifice to our basketball team, which is overwhelmingly lacking in practice as well as practice! Kahahahahahahahahaha! Gehogeho</p>


<p>&#8220;So, are you going to tell me what this is all about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito Kokonoe, if you like older Woman, you have me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been causing trouble at other schools, and &#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe, you know. Shouldn&#8217;t you try to restrain yourself a little? &#8220;</p>


<br>

<p>After school, I was abducted to the student council room and forced to sit on my knees.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t that a little too unreasonable? It&#8217;s complete power harassment.</p>



<p>I glanced up at her. My sister was in a bad mood that I could clearly see. I don&#8217;t know what to call the power harassment by my sister, but I named it &#8220;Sister Harassment&#8221; or &#8220;Sis Harassment&#8221; for short.</p>



<p>However, recently, I feel that she is very attached to me. The other day, I found her sleeping in my bed. I woke up in a cold sweat. Basically, I am at her beck and call because I cannot disobey her, but she is not the only problem.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>There were also the HIPBOSS president, Kedou, Mikumo, Hinagi and Shiori. The ratio of women is too high.</p>



<p>Sensing the danger, I brought along fresh looking guy with me, but for some reason, I was the only one forced to sit on my knees.</p>



<p>&#8220;We just played a friendly game of street basketball.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your real reason?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I was pissed off…… haa?! No, that&#8217;s not it. I was just fulfilling everyone&#8217;s request, and there was no room for any doubt&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I smell a woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your nose is too sharp?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just the other day, I had a showdown with Mob A.</p>



<p>Even though they were college students with superior physiques, they were not a serious club, but just a gangster group. In the first half of the game, our opponent had the upper hand, but we had been working hard to improve our basic physical fitness, and our athleticism never dropped off. From the second half on, we continued to dominate from start to finish.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Things were going well up to that point, but Mob A, fed up with the situation, began to play rough. Having played a lot of street basketball in junior high school, I was used to rough play, but the hot-blooded senpai and the fresh, handsome guy were not so lucky.</p>



<p>As we were gradually being whittled down, Hyakuma and the others, furious at the rough play against the high school students, asked Kouki and the others to switch places, and we responded with some rough play of our own, winning hands down.</p>



<p>The dejected Mob A members were taken away by the seniors. They will probably receive a hard education from now on. Show them mercy, master.</p>



<p>I wonder what happened to them after that? I can&#8217;t help but wonder, but they are just a mob. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll forget about it.</p>



<p>This situation was more critical than that. Could you please give me a break?</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know why you were called out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the street basketball?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The other side hasn&#8217;t said anything about this, and I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not a problem, but I&#8217;m not going to question it. I am somewhat skeptical about the motive.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei let out a big sigh of exasperation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Then why am I here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the party.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suddenly I have a stomach ache. I&#8217;ve got an E. coli outbreak, so I&#8217;m going to call it a day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Don&#8217;t try to run away.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got up and tried to leave, but I was held firmly from both sides. Apparently, they would not let me leave. Stop it, stop it, stop it! I&#8217;m leaving! I tried to be a spoiled brat and stormed out, but it was a futile attempt at resistance. The fresh and handsome guy is looking away. I&#8217;m going to double his practice menu!</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you at the party? Even though I&#8217;m there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think I heard some strange words and actions out of nowhere, but it must have been my imagination.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re frustrated, I&#8217;ll be your partner. Today is a good day for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean!? You&#8217;re blushing, what&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That, of course, is&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid, don&#8217;t answer that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still in school! I will educate you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Sanjoji-sensei. This is my student.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, why don&#8217;t you come over to my house today for first time in a while? My mom said she&#8217;d be waiting for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was a battlefield. The moment I agree with someone, I feel like my life is over.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, so my participation in the blind date was force majeure, not my intention ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Which woman&#8217;s will? Be honest and tell me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Kokonoe. I&#8217;m here. There is no need to be distracted by other women.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this what you&#8217;re like, Mutsuki……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call me Yuki?&#8221;</p>



<p>There is something lively going on, but did I do something that bad?</p>



<p>I simply attended the party because Mio asked me to, and I have nothing to be ashamed of! That&#8217;s right. What did I do? Don&#8217;t be stupid!</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with going to a blind date! It doesn&#8217;t matter if I went to the party or not.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. It was my fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>Scaaaaaaaaaaaary! What&#8217;s with those eyes!? Her eyes were telling me that she was going to totally kill me?!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>





<p>&#8220;So to say it was a mess&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Yukito-kun. I&#8217;ve caused you a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry about it. Mio-san did nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, has anyone done anything to you since then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. I received a message from Hyakuma-senpai that he had educated him, so I think he did a good job.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s great!&#8221;</p>



<p>The student council room was as hellish as a damaged floor with no countermeasures for me. It is an unusual space where one&#8217;s HP is gradually being cut down even though one is not doing anything. Also, there were too many women, and the luscious aroma was making me dizzy. When I went to the café where I was invited, I found Mio and Tristy waiting for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was sorry for getting you involved in something strange the other day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said before, please don&#8217;t worry about it. If something happened to you because of that, it would not be good.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;W-What about me!? What about me, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tristy-san, I&#8217;m glad that nothing happened to you either.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san was smiling with her cheeks dyed red. Mio-san is a benefactor for me, but Tristy-san is a perpetrator from my point of view. Although she did not cause me any great harm, I could feel from her words that she was deeply regretful about the accident that she caused. It was painful to see Tristy-san seeming to be driven by remorse, even though I didn&#8217;t care.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Yukito-kun, why did you suddenly suggest such a match?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s, well, honest and straightforward.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You said you got tangled up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had originally planned a practice match with another school. It was just a good opponent, but yes, that is true. The other thing was that those people were talking about Mio and Tristy as if you were a thing, and that pissed me off. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because of us?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I was just pissed off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have an expected cute side&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, fuhhee……&#8221;</p>



<p>Tristy-san, who started to say something I don&#8217;t understand, suddenly touches me. In this day and age of alcohol sanitizers, what kind of an insane person would voluntarily engage in such intimate contact with another person? I was treated like a pet that I could not resist. Am I a lapdog?</p>



<p>Once again, I could clearly recognize my feelings when I put them into words. Yes, I was pissed off. Mio had been encouraging me a lot, but I couldn&#8217;t let myself get so angry.</p>



<p>Besides, the street basketball showdown brought back one emotion for me.</p>



<p>When Mob A and the others switched to rough play, the first one to be harmed was Himura-Senpai. Just before taking the shot, Senpai&#8217;s clothes were pulled and he fell over. It was an obvious foul, but there was no official referee. There was nothing they could do about it if they were given a white flag. I could clearly see that Mob A and the others were grinning and planning to repeat the rough play.</p>



<p>I was angry. It was a feeling I hadn&#8217;t had in a long time. A feeling I thought I had lost. I might not have thought anything of it back in junior high school.</p>



<p>Back then, I used basketball just for me. No one else existed. I didn&#8217;t care about my teammates, the outcome of the game, or anything else.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But what about now? I have no regrets or interest in basketball. Still, I started playing again because I wanted to change. To get back what I lost one by one. Unlike back then, I am not playing basketball alone now.</p>



<p>When I saw the fallen Himura-senpai I thought</p>



<p>What are you doing, you b*****d! Is what I thought.</p>



<p>The reason he is working so hard is because he is going to confess his feelings to an other Senpai, Takamiya. If he were to get injured and not be able to participate in the tournament, he would be out of luck. I had lost my last tournament in junior high school because of that. I didn&#8217;t want that to happen to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s why I did it on my own, so please don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not how it works.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Yukito, can you give me something as an apology?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, this is going to end badly for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have a bad feeling about this, I know I do. Suddenly, my phone vibrated. It was my sister. Is she monitoring me? I wonder where my human rights have gone. ……</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Come hang out with us!&#8221;</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;I did nothing but drag my feet. …… This is something I can&#8217;t forgive myself for. I can&#8217;t protect Suzune if I keep going like this! I can&#8217;t confess my feelings with such a weak state. Above all, I want to work even harder with everyone!&#8221;</p>



<p>After school, the hot-blooded senpai is nodding off during club activities. The same was true for the other members.</p>



<p>The sorrowful voice that sounds as if it is being squeezed out of him speaks volumes about the state of his heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe, I want to be better! I have never wished for anything so much. I thought it would be good if I could have fun. But that&#8217;s not enough for me anymore!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Toshirou…..&#8221;</p>



<p>Takamiya-senpai was looking at him with concern. She could hear him saying about the confession, but that may not matter to the two of them</p>



<p>After plenty of hoarding at the sight of them, I open my mouth in a grim manner.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Do you want power?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I want it! The power that can lead everyone, the result that can make Suzune proud!&#8221;</p>



<p>On the spur of the moment, I said one of the top three lines I&#8217;d like to say in real life, but the hot-blooded senpai was in no rush to follow up. You&#8217;re so easygoing, you know that?</p>



<p>Now, I wondered what I should do, and then I remembered.</p>



<p>I heard that the other day, the fresh and handsome guy had met with a senpai from his junior high school who went on to a top school. As one would expect from such a charismatic and popular young man, he has a wide circle of friends. This is useful!</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with you, Yukito? You look like you&#8217;re planning some kind of evil scheme.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give it a try.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Try what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Training.&#8221;</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Eeh, it is a myth that if you master yoga, you will be able to breathe fire or teleport, and should never be taken seriously.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes, Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s funny. It is an ironclad story, but I was not amused at all and was not listened to. I can&#8217;t reach out my hand or my foot. If I wanted to, I would teleport out of here right now.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll forgive me. My mother and Himiyama-san were looking at me with expectant eyes. Stop, stop! Don&#8217;t look at me with those eyes!</p>



<p>We are at a 24-hour fitness club next door to our apartment. Mom had been trying to go to the gym to get some exercise and keep in shape, but apparently her work schedule made it difficult for her to find the time.</p>



<p>However, since she recently switched to working from home, she has more time to spare and has decided to start going to the gym again. Heh, I see.</p>



<p>That explains why she&#8217;s so attractive! I&#8217;m so proud of her as her son.</p>



<p>So why am I here?</p>



<p>Well, listen. There&#8217;s a not-so-deep reason.</p>



<p>I played basketball in middle school, and I learned a lot about how to take care of my body in the process. I had been injured a lot in the past, so I studied stretching, yoga, and Pilates in my spare time while I was in the hospital.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Knowing the basic structure of the human body is essential in order to handle the body well.</p>



<p>I, Yukito Kokonoe, am a modern-day human being who lives in a world of Taher Anatomia.</p>



<p>That is why my mother asked me to accompany her to the gym as an instructor, and I had no choice but to refuse. I would be very happy if I could contribute to my mother, who is the breadwinner of the family, even if only a little.</p>



<p>But there was a pitfall. We ran into Himiyama-san on the way and for some reason ended up going together. Suddenly, I had a bad feeling.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have the slightest bit of hope in my gut, but for some reason, I want to get out of here right now.</p>



<p>After checking in, we go inside. The gym is quiet since we are the only ones there.</p>



<p>The problem, however, is the way they are dressed, having just come out of the locker room.</p>



<p>They are wearing fitness wear, so naturally they are a bit thin in many ways.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure if it should be rated R or even X. If it&#8217;s CERO, it&#8217;s not exempt from a Z.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Shaking off any evil thoughts, I consider the individual menus. Since this is a gym, there is a full range of training equipment, including aerobics and lat pulldowns, but neither of us is looking for strength training, so yoga is a safe choice here.</p>



<p>&#8221; Since Mom does a lot of sitting, she&#8217;s concerned about her stiff shoulders, no? Is there any part of you that bothers you, Himiyama-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m new to this kind of thing, so I&#8217;ll leave it to you. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s left.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any physical problems or concerns?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right……. I have a sensitivity to cold, so I&#8217;d like to do something about that, is that possible?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Then, let&#8217;s start with a slow breathing exercise in the comfortable sitting position. After you get used to it, we will gradually move on to poses. Please imitate me. It has the effect of regulating the autonomic nervous system, so you can expect a good night&#8217;s sleep.&#8221;</p>



<p>I am yoga instructor Yukito Kokonoe. While activating the third chakra, the Manipura chakra, let&#8217;s focus on Mom&#8217;s upper body and Himiyama&#8217;s lower body.</p>



<p>After a brief explanation of the breathing exercises, we proceeded to the poses, explaining their benefits.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cat pose is good for stiff shoulders.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>On all fours, balancing on the floor. I felt like a cat when I was stretching and twisting like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s my br*asts or what, but my shoulders are really stiff. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s lessened.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, me too. Right, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Misaki. What does this have to do with my son?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufufufufufufufufu&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufufufufufufufufufu&#8221;</p>



<p>Uhm, can you please do it quickly? Why am I the only one who&#8217;s feeling empty?</p>



<p>&#8220;Next is the camel pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t do it perfectly the first time. It is good for relieving fatigue and is good for the lower part of the body, including the groin, abdomen, and thighs. Just watch your knees.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-this may be difficult. ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do one side at a time, slowly. Breathe in as you go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Will this make a difference to my body shape?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, if you do it continuously for about three months, I think you will see results. It will soften your body and is good for your back pain and skin, so let&#8217;s go for it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can count on it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s something you do for yourself, but what the hell has it to with me?</p>



<p>I look at my mother because I&#8217;m afraid of Himiyama-san.</p>



<p>&#8221; Mom, you seems to be hunched over. Do you want to do a pose that stretches your spine? I&#8217;ll sit on your side and we&#8217;ll put our backs together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. Do I put my hand, Yukito?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes. Put your hand on your knee, and twist it in the direction you put your hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That feels good. I like the way your back is so snug against my back, it feels safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>At a glance, it looks like we are just sitting back to back, but this is surprisingly hard. Mom&#8217;s breath gradually increases.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun, let&#8217;s do it with me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pose you can do alone&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it together.&#8221;</p>



<p>The pressure of her smile was incredible. Mom aside, Himiyama-san is a stranger.</p>



<p>I was sweating cold sweat.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>“Your appearance too stylish, and I don&#8217;t want to directly touch ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m against discrimination! And there&#8217;s nothing harmful about it. It&#8217;s fitness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What the hell! So that&#8217;s what you were going for……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just purely out of interest, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>The two were serious at first, but as time went on, what they were competing about gradually heated up.</p>



<p>You two are in high spirits even though it&#8217;s nighttime. I&#8217;m getting tired, you know.</p>



<p>This is not the yoga I know! This feels like breathing fire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said, how many times have I told you that the forward-bend/backward-bend pose is a pose where you are on top of the other person with your back to each other&#8212;&#8211;I can&#8217;t see it, but aren&#8217;t you facing the other way? I feel something soft on my back!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san is supposed to be bending backward over me as I am bending forward, but all I can see is the floor from my view. However, from the feeling through my back, it is obvious that she is leaning on me as it is. Naturally, there was no effect. It only makes me happy.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;And, how does it feel?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It feels good. That&#8217;s not what I mean!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My son is in trouble! Move out of the way, I&#8217;m taking over!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! I thought I explained everything to you, but you didn&#8217;t get the message.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get in. Boom!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nnuuuuuuuuuuuuu! Ah, Mom, it&#8217;s a little heavy. Thank goodness. Because it&#8217;s not good to be too skinny, you know, there&#8217;s a BMI number, and there&#8217;s a proper weight…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;F-Fat…..&#8221;</p>



<p>Gaining weight is not necessarily a bad thing. For those who are too thin, it can be seen as a sign of good health.</p>



<p>To begin with, the Japanese have one of the lowest obesity rates in the world, and Asian countries in general have low rates. The obesity rate in Japan is one of the lowest in the world, and the rate in Asia is generally low.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I see! These days you eat dinner at home at a regular time, so you must be getting healthier, too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why, why is my son suddenly rebellious now?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu…. You can&#8217;t talk like that anymore, Yukito. Even if it is a clear fact, it is forbidden to say such things to women.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Araa? Did you just say something that I shouldn&#8217;t have heard you say?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see you because my vision is blocked, but I can feel a sinister aura behind me… ……? Also, can you please get off of me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, please move away from him, you heavy Ouka-san. Let&#8217;s take turns.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since when is this a system?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it! It&#8217;s mine!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you listening to me?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The feeling through the wear was great, but I couldn&#8217;t say it out loud, even if it was the wrong thing to say.</p>



<p>I could not say a word about it. I could only sneak it out and play it off.</p>



<p>After that, I was caught between the two of them trying to compete with each other in some way, and by the time I left the fitness club, my strength had been drained until my life gauge turned red.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be able to shoot a super special move. Mom apologizes apologetically.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, okay? I was having a good time and got carried away.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a manner of speaking, she felt bad and was sorry. Mom and Himiyama-san were not the best of friends. One plus one is two hundred. Thanks to this, I was completely exhausted.</p>



<p>We were about to leave Himiyama-san and go home, but I was hungry after the workout, so Mom and I decided to stop by a family restaurant. We were a family, so it was no problem.</p>



<p>Since we had already had dinner, we ordered mainly fries and other snacks.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t do it right, it won&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;ll be serious this time, will you go with me again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine…..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a parfait. You like sweets, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, you knew that?&#8221;</p>



<p>I certainly like sweets, but I&#8217;ve never told anyone about it.</p>



<p>It was from such a simple question that I asked back, but my mother gasped because she was shocked by the question.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..I know that much. But that&#8217;s all I know. I&#8217;m a bad mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>She smiled sadly, looking downcast.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that, and don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;&#8212;-So, tell me. I don&#8217;t care what it&#8217;s about. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s about school, what you like, or some other trivial detail. I want to get to know you better.</p>



<p>She was serious, to the point of being scared. I hesitated for a moment, wondering what I should tell her.</p>



<p>I desperately searched for a topic, but nothing came to mind. When I think back to when I was a little kid, I felt like I had so many things I wanted to talk about. I was overflowing with things I want her to listen to.</p>



<p>But I can&#8217;t remember what they were or what they were about.</p>



<p>It must have been something trivial. It was so insignificant, so meaningless.</p>



<p>What on earth was I trying to tell my mother at that time?</p>



<p>What did I want her to hear? What kind of conversation was I looking for?</p>



<p>There must have been so many things I wanted to talk about back then, but now I can&#8217;t think of anything, really anything. School, favorite things, trivial things?</p>



<p>None of the topics presented to me had anything to say.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>There was nothing worth sharing with others.</p>



<p>The only thing is that I don&#8217;t want to worry them with something unnecessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why now&#8212;-no, nevermind. Don&#8217;t force yourself. Oh, here they come. Let&#8217;s eat.&#8221;</p>



<p>I swallow down the words that are in my throat and act as I always do. I believe it is the right thing to do.</p>



<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be bothering my mother who is working hard for me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve caused her so much trouble by worrying about her. I am happy now, so I should be satisfied with this. I tell myself to be humble. To wish for anything beyond happiness is greed. All I can do is be grateful.</p>



<p>Mom&#8217;s face was sad and her expression was dark. A moment ago, she was smiling like a bubbly girl.</p>



<p>I thought I had chosen the right answer. And this is the result?</p>



<p>I am not happy about it. I was filled with apology.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I feel a dull ache. It feels unreal, as if this is all just a dream for a moment.</p>



<p>It felt as if I was being told that this must be a fleeting illusion.</p>


<p><strong>[Mother PoV]</strong></p>



<p>I hate the rainy season. It&#8217;s too much trouble to put up an umbrella. Or my feet get wet from wearing heels.</p>



<p>Looking out the window, I saw that the rain was continuing to pour down in torrents without slowing down.</p>



<p>Such weather always reminds me of that day. It was a long time ago.</p>



<p>That year, there was talk of an event to commemorate the zoo&#8217;s 50th anniversary.</p>



<p>&#8220;It sounds interesting. Are we going?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>I gave a small nod. I should have been very happy to say that, but I had been so busy with work that I had forgotten about it. It had been in the back of my mind for a long time, but I had been thinking that we could go there anytime.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hey, when are we going? It&#8217;s almost over. That boy is looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so stunned. Did you forget about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked by Yuuri, I hurried to check. I did not know that the event would be held for a limited time. I can&#8217;t just say that I didn&#8217;t know about it after having promised to do so.</p>



<p>More than a month had passed. I heard that the boy had been preparing well, researching the ecology of animals in a zoological book. If only she had told me earlier &#8212;&#8211; I couldn&#8217;t let such whining leak out to my children. They are too busy to be bothered with me.</p>



<p>I looked at the calendar and saw that the last day of the event coincided with my vacation. I was relieved that I made it just in time. I didn&#8217;t have to lie. I should have been.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course not.……&#8221;</p>



<p>On the day of the event, heavy rain had been falling since the morning. The rain was getting heavier and heavier, making it a chore to even go out to the convenience store. I had been worried about the weather forecast, but it turned out to be right on target.</p>



<p>The zoo was closed and the event was over.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In the morning, the little boy was just quietly looking out the window without saying a word.</p>



<p>What feelings were going through his little heart?</p>



<p>I was too scared to ask. It was a huge mistake that could not be said to be inevitable.</p>



<p>It could have been prevented if I had checked the dates and made a schedule.</p>



<p>Since then, no matter how many times I asked him to go somewhere, he never nodded his head.</p>



<p>He just sulked. I can say that because of the bond we have built up as a family. Even if we have had one or two disappointing events, our family will not be broken because we have so many happy memories that far outweigh them. But for me and that child, there is nothing.</p>



<p>After that, Yuuri and I often went out alone. Even when I invite him out, he just stays at home as if it were a matter of course. Even if I forcefully took him out, he would just apologize and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m busy, sorry&#8221; but he never had any fun at all.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s true too. For that boy, going out with me is a pain.</p>



<p>Children are sensitive and watch adults very carefully. They will not speak or say anything if they think the other person will not listen, and they will not trust a person who does not keep his or her word.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I hate the term &#8220;family service&#8221;. If you act condescending, like it&#8217;s your duty, your children will soon find out. Everything is an excuse, and even that is blocked.</p>



<p>Time just passes with no way to make up for it, and the more time that passes, the more difficult it becomes to rebuild. It seems that the time it takes to reach adulthood and the time it takes to experience adulthood are the same.</p>



<p>I could not create any pleasant memories with him. On the contrary, I have only burdened him with painful memories that are the exact opposite.</p>



<p>I have harmed his heart in every way I could, carefully and persistently.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am an unfit mother. I can&#8217;t argue with that, even if Yuuri says so.……&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered to myself as if I was nodding my head. I vaguely wonder if I am in the right place at the right time.</p>



<p>Despite the gloomy weather, the reunion was quite lively.</p>



<p>A little bit of alcohol makes my body burn. Talking with old friends was fun as it reminded me of my school days. I was surprised, happy, and saddened to hear their journey. I learned about the many different paths their lives have taken since graduation.</p>



<p>As we talked to each other thoughtfully, we naturally divided into married and unmarried groups.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The married group was mainly talking about their complaints about their husbands or wives, or about their children.</p>



<p>Some of the unmarried people were proclaiming their singleness, while others were engaged in marriage activities. As a divorced woman, I felt as if I didn&#8217;t belong anywhere, so I quietly left the circle.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong Megumi? Are you not drinking?&#8221;</p>



<p>I talk to Megumi, who is standing quietly in the corner, in a good mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ouka? Well, tea is enough for me. I don&#8217;t want to worry about Haruhiko&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, Megumi&#8217;s lover, is that restrictive?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not like that. He sent me off to have a good time. I just decided not to drink alcohol unless I was with Haruhiko.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haruhiko-san was your boyfriend back then, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, he is my beloved person.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Her bashful smile proved more than anything that Megumi was at the peak of her happiness.</p>



<p>Megumi was betrayed by her first boyfriend when she was in college, and for a time she was so distrustful of men that she was depressed. She even attempted suicide. We tried our best to cheer her up, but I heard that it was her current boyfriend who continued to stand by her and support her. Marriage was finally arranged with him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided never to let him worry about anything, no matter how trivial it may seem. That&#8217;s how I can repay Haruhiko-san&#8217;s devotion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, Megumi has never spoken alone with a man since the reunion began. She was always accompanied by someone she knew of the same sex. She is thorough to a fault.</p>



<p>I came back to myself. I was not full of pride when I was wooed out of character at the reunion. I had no intention of doing so. But it is true that I had a chance to make myself feel that way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any complaints?&#8221;</p>



<p>I feel a little guilty and ask such a nasty question.</p>



<p>&#8220;There shouldn&#8217;t be. Even if there is, it&#8217;s just a small thing, and it&#8217;s something that Haruhiko and I should talk about together. I don&#8217;t want to say anything bad about him, whether he&#8217;s there or not. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s okay if he doesn&#8217;t hear. If I said that, I would never be able to laugh in front of Haruhiko again.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s strange. She used to be so fragile ……. The current Megumi looks stronger than anyone else.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I can&#8217;t help but think of Yuuri in that light. Something the two of them have in common, something I don&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>Just as if I had been doused with cold water, my intoxication sobered me up at once. I suddenly feel ashamed of myself for having been so excited, and I feel like a miserable person.</p>



<p>Sadness and conflict were about to spill out of my mouth, but I held them back.</p>



<p>How could I realize it now! Nothing had changed since that day. I keep repeating the same mistakes. No wonder Yuuri hates me.</p>



<p>Yuuri had always seen through my naivete. I was half-hearted and unprepared to face her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Does Ouka have someone she cares about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My children, I guess&#8221;</p>



<p>That much is non-negotiable. I understand the meaning of what Megumi was saying. If I had hesitated for even a moment to answer Megumi&#8217;s question now, I would not have recovered.</p>



<p>&#8220;If so, tell them how important they are, how precious and treasured they are. It&#8217;s not enough to just think about it. You have to tell them with words and attitude, otherwise you can&#8217;t build trust with them.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I cared about my children more than anything else. But it was just a thought. My words, my attitude, my actions, all of them denied my feelings and hurt that child, Yukito.</p>



<p>For 16 years. Even if I suddenly tried to face him now, the negative trust I&#8217;ve accumulated would get in the way. I finally realized that Yuuri and I had a decidedly different starting point. There is no way I will be able to do the same as Yuuri. I am far in the back of the pack.</p>



<p>Looking around, I saw a few people who were particularly close to Megumi looking at me kindly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Megumi, you&#8217;ve become a beautiful woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to all of you who encouraged me back then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Maybe I&#8217;ll invite my husband over when I get home for the first time in a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I got a text from my husband. When I went out, he was so casual and pretended he didn&#8217;t care, but he&#8217;s so cute and adorable too.&#8221;</p>



<p>The conversation was lively and centered around Megumi. She does not grumble as she did earlier. Before I know it, the complaining has turned into fond banter.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Right. I&#8217;ll do my best too, Megumi.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>After greeting everyone, I left the reunion early. I wanted to see him as soon as possible.</p>



<p>I hurried to get a cab without worrying about getting wet in the rain.</p>



<p>I was branded as an unfit mother, but I wanted to make up for the past 16 years.</p>



<p><strong>[Mother PoV]</strong></p>



<p>A memory of the abominable past. A record of mistakes I don&#8217;t want to remember.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go. Yuki-chan, you&#8217;ll be killed if you stay here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8211;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>My son took Sekka&#8217;s hand instead of mine. Yuuri did not say anything. It was just as Sekka had said.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Why……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Yuuri&#8217;s voice was muffled as if it had been snatched away. Please stop, don&#8217;t take him away! I desperately reach out my hand, but my son doesn&#8217;t turn around, only his little back denies me.</p>



<p>I see, I&#8217;ve been given up on. The realization weighed heavily on me, and I let out a sob.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did you&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>My son stopped Sekka, who was about to throw words at me in a fit of rage, with a small shake of his head to the side.</p>



<p>The hostility directed at me by my sister. I may never see my son again. And yet, I couldn&#8217;t move a single step from that spot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Goodbye.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;For the next month, we didn&#8217;t see each other again.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Mom? Something happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just let me do this for a little while.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I remembered when my children were born. Tiny hands gripping my fingers tightly.</p>



<p>I was happy. The best in the world. I could believe that without a doubt. I swore to myself that I would be a good mother so that I would never let go of this happiness.</p>



<p>Everything was a series of new experiences for me. But every day was fun and happy. I had studied parenting, watched and listened to many stories and experiences, and put them into practice.</p>



<p>So how could I have forgotten? Regret is all I feel. I remembered everything when I was raising Yuuri. I should have done more for him.</p>



<p>I can give him a sense of security by hugging him. I should have known that it secretes oxytocin, the hormone of love.</p>



<p>What did I do to this child who had given me so much happiness? Even the fact that I switched to milk early on and held him close to me was nothing compared to what I did for Yuuri. Because I did it for Yuuri, I didn&#8217;t have to do it for him. Such a logic is not possible.</p>



<p>My son&#8217;s body is warm in my arms. The fact that he is here in front of me like this now, I can&#8217;t help but think it is a miracle. Yuuri wants to be skin-to-skin with him because he wants to feel that this child is still alive. I fear more than anything else that I will lose him again.</p>



<p>He rolls his eyes and wonders. No wonder Sekka is surprised.</p>



<p>Suddenly, he comes home from the reunion, a soaking wet rat, stockings streaked and heels broken. The price to pay for pushing himself so hard and running so hard for so long.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When a mother like that suddenly hugs you, you are bound to be worried.</p>



<p>Since that day, I had been afraid of my son. I was afraid of being told in no uncertain terms. He said he didn&#8217;t need me, he didn&#8217;t need such a mother, and he hated me.</p>



<p>I still remember that day with nightmares. I made a crucial wrong choice that day.</p>



<p>I should have gone after him no matter what it took, no matter how badly I clung to him, I should have told him that I needed him, I should have proved it.</p>



<p>When I thought he had given up on me, Yukito must have felt abandoned when he saw me not holding him back. It was a cruel, laughable, and cruel crossing of paths.</p>



<p>I think at that moment, Sekka despised me with all her heart.</p>



<p>After that, I repeated the same mistake over and over again without learning my lesson.</p>



<p>One year, I visited his class. I had an important meeting to attend, and I couldn&#8217;t make it due to work. So I asked Sekka to take my place. I didn&#8217;t want him to feel lonely.</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the meeting went well, and I went to dinner as invited by a man from a business partner. I was unaware that Sekka had accidentally seen me doing so.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I have nothing to feel guilty about. It is just a business relationship.</p>



<p>But to Sekka, I looked like I was enjoying a leisurely dinner with a man, leaving my child&#8217;s class attendance to myself because I had work to do.</p>



<p>Since then, I have never attended Yukito&#8217;s class. Sekka would not allow it.</p>



<p>It was natural that I would lose her trust if I kept doing that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t be a good mother to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You need to change.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please. …… I just need one more chance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have that kind of authority……&#8221;</p>



<p>I hate myself for speaking like a temptress who has cheated on her husband.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m such a toxic mother. I failed to grow as a mother in an immature way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? If you don&#8217;t take a bath and change your clothes soon, you&#8217;ll catch a cold.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to start over with you, as your mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to take a bath with me now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I care about you. More than anyone, more than anything. That&#8217;s why&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>I gently put my hands on my son&#8217;s cheeks. When I saw my son&#8217;s face up close, it was not only cute, but also very interesting and good-looking. His long eyelashes and eyes that looked as if they would absorb me made my heart pound, and I was slowly drawn closer to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Mom? Your face is getting clos&#8212;&#8212;e&#8212;&#8212;-?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>After all, my mother and sister are parent and child, right? (White eyes)</p>



<p>I had an experience that I am not even afraid to mention. This may be what is called a secret that I will carry with me to my grave. Eh? I&#8217;ll leave it to your imagination.</p>



<p>Last night, my mother came back from the reunion and suddenly declared that she would start over as a mother. What does she mean by &#8220;as a Mom&#8221;? Is that a start-over?</p>



<p>Being a mother is a kind of second job, a subclass, an acquired job. To me and my sister, Mom is Mom, but to Mom&#8217;s classmates, she&#8217;s just Ouka Kokonoe. I wanted her to go to the reunion, a place where she didn&#8217;t have to worry about her role as a mother, and refresh herself as much as she wanted, but for some reason, a mysterious surprise was waiting for me: she was going to become a mom. I was in for a real surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oya, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sunday. On my way back from training as a warrior, I found something unexpected.</p>



<p>I heard that if you eat it to purge yourself of evil spirits, you will live a long and immortal life. No wonder Nekutaru appears as a recovery item in video games. Peaches have been considered a sacred fruit since ancient times, as in the phrase &#8220;Peach Garden,&#8221; and with a peach in my hand, I was at a loss.</p>



<p>I made the mistake of thinking that I could get some as a souvenir on my way home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I must have bought too many…….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Peaches are normally in season in the summer, but the earlier harvested varieties, called &#8220;early peaches,&#8221; are available from this time of the year. The opposite is the &#8220;Late Ote&#8221; variety. I bought some peaches that a farmer was selling directly, and when I inadvertently asked him about his story, I was served. There were too many peaches, no matter how many I bought. We are a family of three.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to catch me, I&#8217;m already on my way.&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned around when I was suddenly approached from the roadway. It was not a catch, but a woman in a full face and rider&#8217;s suit straddling a motorcycle.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, a lady robber just in time, no thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No Yukito. It&#8217;s me&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman in the rider&#8217;s suit took off her helmet, and what was revealed was an astonishing figure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Himiyama-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just awful, Yukito. Calling me a robber.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My brain refused to recognize the current situation. This is a far cry from Himiyama-san&#8217;s image of a quiet older sister. No matter how I look at it, she looks like a gang of big robbers who appear and disappear like gods.</p>



<p>&#8220;So your hobby is riding motorcycles.&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried to cover up my upset with casual conversation so that she wouldn&#8217;t notice.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really a hobby of mine, but I&#8217;ve always liked it. Besides, it&#8217;s inconvenient to drive a car because it&#8217;s not so easy to get around.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have come to know an unexpected side of Himiyama. The relationship between Himiyama-san and I is that we are e-mail friends. For some reason, I communicate with her more often than with the fresh, good-looking guy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right! Do you want to ride with me, Yukito-kun? I&#8217;ll get you a helmet. I&#8217;m looking forward to it. I&#8217;ve always wanted to go touring with two people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why does so much anxiety haunt me?&#8221;</p>



<p>It might be the effect of the sunlight. Sweat was running down my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to dive.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I knew you were a lady robber!&#8221;</p>



<p>If it was a lady robber, she would have been evaded at the last moment, but this was a straight shot to the finish line. The chapel bells might ring in the white church.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Yukito-kun? It looks heavy. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right. Would you like some, Himiyama-san? It&#8217;s a bit much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Then, why don&#8217;t you come over to my house later? Let&#8217;s cut it and eat it together.&#8221;</p>



<p>We are already close to home. Himiyama-san has already gotten off her bike, and it looks like she is going to push it.</p>



<p>Crap! While I was caught off guard, I ended up going to Himiyama-san&#8217;s house again by natural progression. For me, Fushimaden pandemonium is full of danger. If this happens, I have no choice. I&#8217;ll try to get out of this predicament even if I have to lie against my beliefs!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Himiyama-san. I don&#8217;t have any plans after this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s good. Yaay. It&#8217;s my lucky day!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Stupid, idiot! I&#8217;m an honest fool!</p>



<p>&#8220;Earlier, I was meeting with my brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you and your brother are getting along so well.&#8221;</p>



<p>While Himiyama-san is cutting peaches, she tells me about the events of the day. I&#8217;ve never heard of her having an older brother, but from my point of view, it&#8217;s a blessing that they don&#8217;t hate each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re just normal. We haven&#8217;t seen each other for a few years. He&#8217;s going to get married soon. I haven&#8217;t seen him in a while to hear the news.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a complete stranger, it was hard for me to feel what it was like, but being Himiyama-san&#8217;s older brother, he must be quite a handsome man. I gave him my blessing.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so busy that he doesn&#8217;t get a chance to relax unless it&#8217;s an opportunity like this&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does he do?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Well, he works for the government, I guess. But my grandfather, parents, and brother are all very good people, except for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m the only one who hasn&#8217;t been able to move forward, and I&#8217;ve been stagnant for so many years.……&#8221;</p>



<p>The self-deprecating words were imbued with a deep sense of resignation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then you are just like me. Mom and sis are both brilliant, and I&#8217;m the only incompetent one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not true! You always work so hard.&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san, who was suddenly at a loss for words, rushed over to me.</p>



<p>Working hard. That does not necessarily mean that it will be appreciated.</p>



<p>No matter how hard I practice basketball, it&#8217;s meaningless if I can&#8217;t play in the games. If I fail to live up to the expectations of those around me, I will be treated like a war criminal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Even if I study hard, I am only trying to make up for the serious score I have received in my internal examinations. If my grades were the same, I would not be chosen for anything other than my performance.</p>



<p>There is nothing positive in it. I&#8217;m always just filling in the negative. Whether or not I am making up for it, I doubt it, but I couldn&#8217;t imagine my life without it.</p>



<p>Or maybe even love. If I don&#8217;t fill in the negative first, I am not allowed to even qualify for it.</p>



<p>I longed to be normal. I was tired of relating to people. That is why I wanted to be a shady loner, and I wonder if Himiyama-san is the same way.</p>



<p>Why does she always care about me like this?</p>



<p>Like-mindedness. I sought a reason for this unnatural kindness.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I talked about such trivial things. Now, I&#8217;m done cutting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Have I met Himiyama-san by any chance?</p>



<p>Now, such a question comes to my mind. I have dared to pretend not to notice.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>From the moment we first met, my affection for her had been shaken out of control. Even I, as expected, felt a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>But even if we had met in the past, I don&#8217;t understand why Himiyama-san is treating me as if we were meeting for the first time. She didn&#8217;t even mention it.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t mention it. I can&#8217;t remember, and if Himiyama-san wants us to meet for the first time, that is the most appropriate distance for both of us.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t recall. Don&#8217;t want to remember? Maybe Himiyama-san was in a piece of the past that I had forgotten.</p>



<p>I had to forget or erase the painful past, or I would not have survived. I couldn&#8217;t remember it forever.</p>



<p>Living life to the fullest. As the word suggests, I am just trying my best to live in the present moment.</p>



<p>No time to look back at the past, no time to think about the future.</p>



<p>So I am sure that we will continue to pretend to be each other without knowing each other.</p>



<p>&#8211;That is the only right thing to do.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It tastes so good. Can I have this much?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s as if I got more as a bonus prize.&#8221;</p>



<p>Eat peaches with a single mind. Never eat the peach next to it, no matter how tempting it may be.</p>



<p>Goodluck, Yukito Kokonoe! I feel like a dog being left in charge!</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, ……, it&#8217;s Sento, right ……&#8221; [TL: The peach is used by the immortals such as the Queen Mother of the West in myths and legends. Generally known as peach tree or peach fruit. Called the peach in the forbidden garden.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Sento? Aren&#8217;t those the kind of peaches that immortals eat? I think these are just ordinary peaches. What&#8217;s wrong, Yukito, you&#8217;re all sweaty?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the season for light clothing. She was leaning on my arm, and not only a beautiful peach, but even the feeling of her peach …… or the first part of the peach was directly transmitted to my arm. The tension is so great that I can&#8217;t taste it.</p>



<p>&#8220;What an outrageous peach!&#8221;</p>



<p>Somehow, this Himiyama-san. My favorability rating has reached the upper limit without any awakening items. I&#8217;m afraid that I might be invited to join a religious group one day.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;By the way, Yukito, do you like late peaches?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I like all kinds of peaches.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that. So you&#8217;re okay with mature peaches. Everyone likes them young.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suwa, what a clever leading question!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt the pressure of the peaches on my arms increase.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can eat anytime you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little full.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s strange. It&#8217;s not dinner yet, but I&#8217;m full.</p>



<p>&#8220;Too bad. But there will be another time, right? &#8212;Meeting like this again.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Behind her smile, her voice sounded somehow very sad.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm…… it&#8217;s Sento peach right……&#8221;</p>



<p>After dinner, this time we eat peaches in our living room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sento? I don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. They are not ordinary peaches.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They are a little early in the season, but they are very sweet and delicious. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>On both sides of the sofa, my mother and sister are sitting in a wooden room after taking a bath.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the season for light clothing. She was leaning on my arm, and not only a beautiful peach, but even the feeling of her peach …… or the first part of the peach was directly transmitted to my arm. The tension is so great that I can&#8217;t taste it.</p>



<p>After all, are these peaches delicious!? I still can&#8217;t taste them.</p>



<p>As I suspected, the exact same situation unfolded as it did a few hours ago.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Hahahan, I see. It&#8217;s a secret huh?</p>



<p>They must be communicating with each other about how to bully me without my knowledge. I was right in the middle of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;That …… unbelievable peach, can&#8217;t you do something about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>The outcasts were all whitewashing me. Finally, I snapped. I stood up with a clatter.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you are so inclined, just like Himiyama-san, I can eat them all with a delicious bite! I&#8217;m starving!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is that woman&#8217;s name mentioned?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Did something happen to Misaki?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mouths are the source of all kinds of misfortune. I had ignited a rivalry that was unnecessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want to eat so much, come to me. Unlike the old ladies, I&#8217;m in season now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The young and green ones are not as sweet as the old ones.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a figure of speech, right……&#8221;</p>



<p>Huh? That&#8217;s not the reaction I was expecting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me see if I have a stomach ache.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, did you actually enjoy the food?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was taken to the bedroom without ever being able to taste a peach properly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Eh, after that? Well, you know, mouths are the root of all evil. I&#8217;ll refrain from going into details.</p>


<br>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry to tell you this, but isn&#8217;t this my room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so open and honest, yet so gracious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it as a compliment. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Somehow, my sister is relaxing in my room after taking a bath again today.</p>



<p>Her uplifted appearance was somehow glamorous. It seems that she has not mistaken the room as her own.</p>



<p>I wondered for a moment if I was mistaken because she was so brazen, but it seemed that I was normal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My sister is incredibly overprotective. She thinks I&#8217;m a three-year-old child or something.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because of the many things that have happened in the past, but that doesn&#8217;t excuse this kind of arrogance. I caught sight of my sister&#8217;s buttocks lying on the bed and quickly averted my gaze.</p>



<p>Even though she is my sister, she is still a woman. Damn it, she&#8217;s trying to make me flustered with such a thin garment! You succubus! And why are you wearing sexy pants?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, speaking of, I think my bre*sts are getting bigger again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This boys-only talk is not going anywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I need a new bra. Measure me later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W h y?!&#8221; (spoken in English)</p>



<p>I reacted like a crazed foreigner, but she wanted me to measure her bust size! My sister&#8217;s insolence knows no bounds. It sounds like the title of a novel. Somehow, my sister&#8217;s brakes have been destroyed, but will a safety recall be effective? I just hope that automated driving will be put to practical use as soon as possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just as a point of reference, what&#8217;s your cup size?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;F. But it&#8217;s getting tighter, so it might be a G. Good for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why should I be happy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can count on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwaa&#8221;</p>



<p>My eyes were dead. My eyes must have looked like dead fish. Even a fish finder couldn&#8217;t detect them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have any naughty books or something? This room is empty, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even your words and actions are like a succubus.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa? I&#8217;m going to S*ck you&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As I was shivering like a hamster when my natural enemy glared at me, the phone rang.</p>



<p>It was a landline phone, not a smartphone. In this day and age, it is rare to get a call on a landline. Was it a survey on the Cabinet&#8217;s approval rating?</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>I escape from the succubus&#8217;s clutches and head for the living room. I check to see who is on the other end of the line, but it is a number I don&#8217;t recognize.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Kokonoe speaking here&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah , I&#8217;m chief&#8217;s&#8212;-No, I&#8217;m a colleague of Ouka-san, is everything alright now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What happened? I heard about the drinking party today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm, are you Yukito Kokonoe? The chief wants you to pick her up at the station, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My mother? Can&#8217;t she take a cab?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so too, but the chief wants you to come. I think she got drunk. I managed to return to my home with her, but it&#8217;s not safe for her to go home like this alone, so you should take her home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. I understand. I&#8217;m on my way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be waiting for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was very rare for my mother to get drunk. It is rather rare to hear of her getting drunk.</p>



<p>She is not usually one who actively participates in drinking parties, but since many of the employees have recently switched to working from home, it seems that socializing at the office is becoming less common. Mom told me that this was one of the reasons why the drinking party was planned.</p>



<p>Still, it was a surprising offer to pick her up. I would have thought Mom would have called a cab and gone straight home. ……</p>



<p>Well, there was no use in worrying about it. I said a few words to my sister, got dressed, and started walking toward the station.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You must be Yukito-kun? Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Haruka Hiiragi, the chief&#8217;s subordinate.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As soon as I arrived at the station, the two of them were sitting and waiting at a place just a little far from where I was told. Mom was looking very groggy. She is always so composed when she is at work, but this was a rare sight.</p>



<p>I could smell a faint odor of alcohol, but it seemed that Hiiragi-san was not that drunk.</p>



<p>Looking at her face, she looks much younger than my mother. Very young. It would be acceptable to say that she is a college student.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for bringing her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry about it! I&#8217;m just doing the chief&#8217;s favor. Also, there&#8217;s something I wanted to talk to you about, Yukito-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to leave my mother sitting on the bench for a little while. Would it be an unpleasant story to hear? Looking at my mom right now, she doesn&#8217;t seem to have the energy to do so……</p>



<p>&#8220;The chief doesn&#8217;t usually get drunk, but she was in a very good mood. So I think she drank too much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;She said she was glad to get to know Yukito-kun better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t fight or anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know the details, but she seemed to be troubled.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hiiragi-san&#8217;s gaze becomes sharper for a moment as she speaks like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, Yukito-kun, there&#8217;s something I want to ask you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Chief, Ouka-san is a beautiful woman, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think so. Even as her son, I can see that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I know best that my mom is a beautiful woman. She has not lost her figure at all, and she always looks young. But, I don&#8217;t know what kind of change of mind she is going through, but recently she has been getting more and more aggressive in her skinship, just like my sister, and as an adolescent DT boy, I have always struggled to get rid of her distractions.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;As you can see, the chief is very popular in the company.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so rare for the chief to get drunk that all the guys came up to her today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have bothered you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, but I&#8217;ll put it another way. I know it&#8217;s not what you want to hear, but it means that there are a lot of people who want to be with the chief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm, does that mean remarriage? I&#8217;m not against remarriage if that&#8217;s what my mom wants. Perhaps sis is not opposed to it either.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish it would be a serious relationship, but in essence, it&#8217;s just about the body.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They tried to sexually harass the chief when she became drunk, and even tried to take her home. I blame her good looks for all of this.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make me feel very good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know, right? So you&#8217;d better protect her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Normally she&#8217;s strong, so I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be fine, but at times like today. It means there might be such a thing. The chief will surely only have you to rely on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As I said before, if my mother intends to remarry, I won&#8217;t oppose it. Of course, I don&#8217;t want her to be with someone who is only physical with her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I don&#8217;t think she meant that, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom is beautiful. It was only natural that she was popular at work. I thought she might remarry someday, and I had no intention of opposing it. But I never thought I would hear that she was not talking about remarriage, but that she was just being targeted sexually…….</p>



<p>&#8220;Chief, you&#8217;re always on her mind, and her face is rather &#8212;- and I&#8217;m not going to tell you any more than I have to. You watch over her, okay? Well, I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hiiragi-san tosses the bomb and leaves. What on earth was she going to say at the end? I was curious about the meaningful dialogue, but I was not able to figure it out.</p>



<p>I looked back at my mother, who was looking at me with soft, happy eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, shall we go home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to bother you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. If it&#8217;s this much.&#8221;</p>



<p>I went home alone with my mother, lending my shoulder to her. It was not far from our house. I tried to get a cab, but Mom stopped me. She wanted to walk home.</p>



<p>Is it for her health? It&#8217;s hard to keep in shape, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>&#8220;What were you talking to Hiiragi about just now? Did she confess her feelings for you? I won&#8217;t allow you to do that with my employee!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t confess to me out of the blue on our first meeting, now would she?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that. You got a mesmerizing eye.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of it?! And I don&#8217;t have one. And I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s the kind of thing that makes everybody unhappy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why are you so popular?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m Mom&#8217;s child.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? I-I see. It&#8217;s because of me. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re popular, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m old enough to know better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hiiragi-san said you had a hard time because of all the men after you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha ……. I see. I&#8217;m sorry, I made you feel bad. I had a little too much to drink today. I don&#8217;t usually do that. In the end, it doesn&#8217;t matter who they&#8217;re after in that situation.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;If Mom intends to remarry, I won&#8217;t oppose it. But I don&#8217;t want you to marry someone like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be with someone like that either. Besides, I won&#8217;t remarry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not?</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I have you, Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that explains it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s all that matters now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t move so much. And something soft is hitting me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your imagination.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom leaned closer with a mischievous smile on her face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I had never been treated like this before. My nerves are on edge thanks to this. Even though it was nighttime, the temperature was still hot. I wonder if I am sweating from the heat or if it is just cold sweat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right, let&#8217;s take a bath together when we get home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W h y?!&#8221; (English again)</p>



<p>It was the crazy foreigner again. I will refrain from appearing in the future.</p>



<p>Mom is also a mother, and she is irresistibly overprotective. I am too old to take a bath with my mother. I&#8217;m not a three-year-old boy.</p>



<p>Yes, I have to change the subject of something. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, by the way, I heard that sis&#8217; bre*sts have gotten bigger again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you later in the bath. You can touch it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Crap. The topic hasn&#8217;t changed!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Mom&#8217;s voice sank. She squeezed out the words with bitterness.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Please. I want you to touch me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mom&#8217;s story was shocking. I remember a while ago when she seemed to be having a very hard time. Mom was in agony when she saw the test results.</p>



<p>I could feel her body trembling.</p>



<p>&#8220;The truth is, I wasn&#8217;t going to tell you until I was sure. I didn&#8217;t want to worry you unnecessarily. But I couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m weak. Please, I want you to come with me to the hospital. I&#8217;m not afraid of anything if you&#8217;re with me. Please give me courage.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother&#8217;s eyes turned red and she bowed her head. There is only one answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared! I am scared, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom was crying inside my chest. It wasn&#8217;t because of the alcohol that she was emotionally unstable.</p>



<p>She had been keeping it to herself for a long time. Unable to tell anyone about her anxiety and unable to speak up about her weakness.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I cursed God. I should be the one to suffer. It should have been me.</p>



<p>I am tormented by the helplessness of being able to do nothing but lend my heart.</p>



<p>My mother relies on me like this. Am I recognized as a member of the family?</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter. If there is anything I can do to lighten her heart, if there is anything I can do to help her, I will do whatever I can.</p>



<p>&#8211;She is an important member of my family.</p>



<p>She continued to cry for about ten minutes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at such an old age. I should check myself regularly. I should make sure I don&#8217;t have any lumps in my br*asts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-As expected, it would be better for sis to do that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Yuuri to do the same. So, you should, too. Okay?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>When you say it like this, there is no room for argument.</p>



<p>I am Yukito Kokonoe, a man who does not go against his family. No matter what time of day, no matter what time of year.</p>



<p>Looking up at the sky, I see that the moon is still shining in the night today.</p>



<p>The moon does not change, but am I changing? Emotions I had never known before swirled in my chest. Conflicts that arise from my interactions with others.</p>



<p>I wanted to believe that one day I would know what these feelings were.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;What is happening…… Mutsuki, are you suffering right now ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>Normally, I would have laughed it off. It&#8217;s not worth caring about. It is rather something to be doubted.</p>



<p>But there it was, the answer to the doubts I had.</p>



<p>I got goosebumps when I saw the fact that I could never ignore it. The horrifying array of words written in the book. I read them until my eyes were glued to the pages, and then I crushed them in my hands.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Watch me now. I&#8217;ll make sure to kick you out of this school. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>The abominable man named Yukito Kokonoe. Witnessing his vile human nature once again, my hatred runs deeper and my anger burns fiercely.</p>



<p>To me, the student body president, Kedou Mutsuki, was the Sun. More noble and proud than anyone else.</p>



<p>I admired her for being interesting and for doing her own righteousness. She is cheerful, kind, equal to everyone, and has a pure and honest way of life. I was dazzled by her presence.</p>



<p>I wanted to be like her. &#8211;I had such a faint longing.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t rivalry, jealousy, or anything like that. It was a daydream, a night dream. It was my first love.</p>



<p>Someday the hidden feelings will quietly burn and warm my heart.</p>



<p>It is my sanctuary, a place that no one is allowed to defile.</p>



<p>My family is wealthy, that is a fact, and I was raised as a so-called &#8220;young lady&#8221;. Perhaps that is why I was always attracted to her uninhibited nature.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>For me, Mutsuki is the very ideal prince who crawled out of the story.</p>



<p>I do not intend to impose this feeling on her. I care nothing about my ego.</p>



<p>Someday she will meet a wonderful man, get married, and be happy. If I could stand next to her and congratulate her on such a natural happiness, that would be all I needed to do. And yet…</p>



<p>She has changed drastically. At first I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears.</p>



<p>It sounded like a joke to me that she would get down on her knees to encourage a first-year student to make friends with her.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t a rumor. It was enough to knock me off the edge of despair.</p>



<p>I saw an image of Mutsuki on her knees and almost fell over.</p>



<p>Since then, she has always been concerned about someone else, as if in a fever.</p>



<p>At first glance, she looks the same as usual. But to me, who has been watching her for a long time, the change is obvious.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Mutsuki is not that kind of person! That&#8217;s why I sought the truth.</p>



<p>I wanted to know why she had changed. And I found it. The part that opened up.</p>



<p>He takes advantage of a woman&#8217;s weakness and puts her at his mercy.</p>



<p>The false accusation that was set up to frame Mutsuki.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t forgive him! I can&#8217;t forgive that man for defiling my ideals!</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s in the same school as me! Mutsuki is not the only one.</p>



<p>His poisonous fangs may one day extend not only to her, but to others as well.</p>



<p>I have to get rid of him, I have to get that man out of her life as soon as possible!</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8212;-</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Father, I need to speak to you.&#8221;</p>
