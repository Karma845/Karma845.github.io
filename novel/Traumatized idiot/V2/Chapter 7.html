<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 7: Yukito Kokonoe</h1>

<p>&#8220;Hmmm. Have I met Himiyama-san in the past, after all?&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san, the hyperinflationary sister of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a very likable person, but it seems certain that I have met her in the past.</p>



<p>She fled for her life from the Peach State, but nearly ascended to heaven.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s acceptable to call a complete stranger &#8216;mom&#8217; only if you are their elementary school teacher or you&#8217;re engaging in a &#8216;mommy activity&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>What is a fake mom-like existence? It may remind one of Gnosticism like the Yaldabaoth, but Himiyama-san may have a little too much motherhood in her.</p>



<p>Please take care of yourself. I can&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>She asked me about the past, but I couldn&#8217;t bear to look at her because she seemed so bitter.</p>



<p>I wondered if it was okay to remain oblivious and unaware.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>All the things I can&#8217;t remember keep piling up. I am confident in my memory, but on the other hand, I don&#8217;t remember much of the past.</p>



<p>It was routine for me to immediately delete memories that were not good enough.</p>



<p>I started to unravel the past by searching for the answers in the forgotten past.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… not much.&#8221;</p>



<p>I went home and flipped through the albums in my room. Although photographs have been digitized, leaving them in an album like this is still very important.</p>



<p>After all, what will remain for posterity is not electronic data but a stone tablet. Information resides on the ground, not in the cloud.</p>



<p>My mom was beautiful when she was young. …… Oh, that&#8217;s a picture of my sister when she was born!</p>



<p>Birth of Yuuri Kokonoe! Divine! A halo of light shines out of her.</p>



<p>I retrace my family&#8217;s steps from the very beginning. They must have taken a lot of pictures back then, because there are many. After I was born, the number of photos gradually decreased. I guess I was not interested at all.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;….That is me?&#8221;</p>



<p>A zero year old who looked like me was crying. A one-year-old who looks like me is laughing.</p>



<p>A two-year-old who looks like me is angry. A three-year-old who looks like me is&#8212;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Come to think of it, this time of year, I&#8217;m sure I&#8212;&#8220;.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, there I was, with a blank expression on my face. The number of photos is almost nonexistent by this time, and rather than a family photo, there are just a bunch of photos of me alone. I know, I know. I don&#8217;t want to be in the frame with them. I was left alone in the album.</p>



<p>I desperately look back at the past, scratching up bits and pieces of memories I had forgotten.</p>



<p>Remember! How did this happen, when did I go wrong?</p>



<p>There was no place for me, no one had abandoned me, no, that&#8217;s not it.</p>



<p>There must have been someone who reached out to me, someone who saved me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Do you have a minute?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom enters the room with a knock at the door. She was dressed more formally than usual, as if she had been out. She was dressed more formally than usual, like an adult woman.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Looking at the album. Is there something on your mind?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing. More importantly, what is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom&#8217;s face looked downcast for a moment, and then she quietly opened her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;……I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t doubt you. I just complained to the school. I will fight them tooth and nail if I have to. But if you don&#8217;t like the school, you can quit. You can transfer to another school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was going to tell you after I made it official, but down the road I&#8217;m thinking of going independent. I would be happy if you could help me anytime I&#8217;m in need of help with my work. So Yukito, you can do whatever you want&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom sits down next to me and gently places her hand on my knee.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What do you want to do in the future?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to grow honey mandarins on a remote island&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Honey mandarins?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a delightful choice. I should have answered without hesitation, but I&#8217;m confused.</p>



<p>In any case, I was thinking of dropping out of school. It would be reassuring if she could support me.</p>



<p>Even Hinagi and the others wouldn&#8217;t really follow me to the point of dropping out of school. Their parents wouldn&#8217;t allow it. I&#8217;m different from them in every way. But&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish we could live together as a family a little longer&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I feel a little disappointed. After all, my mother&#8217;s words and actions don&#8217;t match.</p>



<p>My room is getting more and more of my mother&#8217;s and sister&#8217;s personal belongings. It&#8217;s going to gradually turn it into a storage space. I&#8217;m under ground pressure to get the hell out of here.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I guess I&#8217;ll have to live alone if I change schools. Well, that&#8217;s a no-brainer. In any case, the fact that she is urging me to do so suggests that she is dissatisfied with the situation we are living together. It can&#8217;t be helped.</p>



<p>She says she needs me, but her actions are denying it.</p>



<p>Little by little, I am losing my place at home, and I am about to be kicked out of school.</p>



<p>I should have seen that day coming all along. No shock.</p>



<p>Haha, I see. So it&#8217;s my last supper, huh?</p>



<p>Well, that explains why Mom has been acting so strange lately!</p>



<p>She&#8217;s having mercy on me by being nice to me one last time in anticipation of me being gone.</p>



<p>Motherhood, in other words, has a divinity like Sophia&#8217;s in Ione.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ho? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Tears in the Holy Mother&#8217;s eyes as well. I hurriedly wiped them with a nearby handkerchief.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t believe you said what you wanted to ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Is it that strange?&#8221;</p>



<p>Little by little, something was leaking out. I didn&#8217;t even notice it myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to be recognized as a mother, so please. Don&#8217;t go anywhere! Not to the islands, not to her. Because you are my precious&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>Gently, she holds my head. Is it really that rare for me to express my hopes out loud?</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t hide my confusion, like a natural disaster had occurred, but her warmth and thoughts taught me that everything I had been thinking until now was nothing but fiction.</p>



<p>A distorted cognition of my thoughts. It&#8217;s about time I learned the answer to that paradox.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>A large crowd of students, both boys and girls of all grades, had gathered in front of the broadcast room.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Thanks for your help, Sakki!&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s okay, Shiori. ……, This time, do it right this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lunchtime broadcasts in the school. It was the day that Hasumura of the Broadcasting Club was in charge of the broadcast, but Kamishiro had asked her to take charge of the broadcast. The student council was going to have a slot for the announcement anyway, but the fact that it went so smoothly was a relief to Hinagi Suzurikawa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure about this, Suzurikawa? And Sato. I know this will be a painful confession for you guys.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m not the one suffering or going through the pain.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m the one who made a fool of myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri sternly asks Kedou a question.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t something to hide from the start,&#8221; he said. This is a warning. I would like to kill myself if I were to be so cowardly as to expose my own shame at this stage.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Mutsuki-chan …… sorry.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not because of Yuumi. And look at me. Unlike me, you are not a fake student body president. This is what real popularity and virtue are all about.&#8221;</p>



<p>In just a few short months, Kedou was amazed at how many people had come into contact with Yukito. And all of them are here to help him.</p>



<p>Some are acquainted, some are not. None of them are friends with each other.</p>



<p>And yet, all of them had one thing in common.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop belittling yourself. You will make that child sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Yuuri.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kedou bowed his head at Yuuri&#8217;s reprimand. Yes, that&#8217;s the kind of person she is.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was Yukito-kun who saved me from that hell. My father was so angry that he was about to go and beat me to a pulp. Well, I won&#8217;t stop him.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Seido Mikuriya gives a troubled smile. The reason why he is able to smile like this now is because of Yukito. That&#8217;s why he can&#8217;t forgive this unreasonableness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Renji, I&#8217;ll definitely help you. Okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me plenty to worry about with Reika. This time it&#8217;s my turn, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>The desperate Suo was no longer there. The two of them are connected by way of chain of command.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always owed Yukito a lot of favors. Besides, the basketball team is now in a state of limbo without him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Toshiro, aren&#8217;t you too pathetic?&#8221;</p>



<p>What is Yukito doing now, anyway? I&#8217;ve been trying to reach him, but no luck. I guess he&#8217;s doing whatever he wants to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about Yuki. Because it&#8217;s Yuki.&#8221;</p>



<p>The broadcast room was overflowing with people, too many to fit in. This was all because of Yukito.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This made Kamishiro proud. She was glad that he was the one she was going to fall in love with, and with that thought in mind, she renewed her resolve.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… May I join you? You see, as a goddess, I can&#8217;t overlook the fact that my adorable, adorable believer is in trouble&#8212;&#8212;hahahaha …..ha?&#8221;</p>



<p>The unexpected person causes a bustle of noise.</p>



<p>She is famous among the second-year students.</p>



<p>The atmosphere has recently softened to a different level.</p>



<p>&#8220;Moooooooouuu! After all, it&#8217;s not funny at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>



<p>While Soma was holding her head in her hands, Suzurikawa bowed her head. Suzurikawa was surprised.</p>



<p>She thought she knew everything about Yukito. But that was only a haughty treat.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>A myriad of connections that she is unaware of. It is a great force that is trying to save him.<br>Have a broad perspective. Suzurikawa realized the true meaning of these words.</p>



<p>She had been looking only at Yukito. She had been living in such a small world, just the two of them.</p>



<p>But that was not enough. That is why she made a mistake. So the only person who could help her was Yukito.</p>



<p>From now on, the real high school life will begin, Suzurikawa thought.</p>



<p>The daily life he gave her. Such a gentle world full of possibilities that she taught her.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s begin. And let&#8217;s end it.</p>



<p>To be able to spend time together again with the man who came back to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this okay with you, …… Yukito?&#8221;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Make them stop now!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The staff room was in an uproar. The truth, revealed one after another over the school broadcast, permeates the school with an undeniable reality.</p>



<p>One first-year student is told by the mouths of various students in turn.</p>



<p>He has been suspended and does not come to school anymore.</p>



<p>Why was he slandered, and why was he forced to do so? Suzurikawa, the victim, and Seidou, the perpetrator. What they both say is that they are grateful.</p>



<p>Why did they get good grades in Class B? Why and how did the basketball club, which is now one of the most enthusiastic sports clubs, devote itself to club activities, why and how? The background revealed nakedly is as painful to listen to as if solving a mystery.</p>



<p>The fact that Kedou, the student council president, almost caused a false accusation of molestation and arranged for those who misunderstood his actions to be expelled from the school is also exposed.</p>



<p>Sanjoji stopped her colleague, who was rushing to stop Kedou at the principal&#8217;s request.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no need for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Sanjoji-sensei! If you continue like this&#8211;&#8220;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you saying, Principal? The students are not violating any school rules. It&#8217;s just a school announcement. What in the world could stop them? We don&#8217;t follow the rules, but the students do. Do you think that&#8217;s acceptable?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now is not the time to be talking about such beautiful things!&#8221;</p>



<p>The teachers, who had been secretly rejoicing at the pressure from Tojo, were now exhausted from dealing with the daily complaints from parents and the vehement opposition from the students. Then came this revelation.</p>



<p>It was now difficult for them to even speak out against Yukito Kokonoe .</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems the rotten apples were us. And if we force them to stop, they might send the next message outside the school.&#8221;</p>



<p>The method has already been shown by Yukito Kokonoe. All that remains is to follow suit. Next time it might become a big problem. If that happens, the damage to the school will be enormous.</p>



<p>It has already gone beyond the stage where it can be done peacefully. Control is impossible.</p>



<p>Fujishiro regretted that she had allowed her students to do such a thing.</p>



<p>It was the role of adults to contain the situation before it reached this point of decisive collapse. Nevertheless, they put the blame on the students and even try to suppress it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This is the opposite of the kind of teacher Fujishiro should be aiming for, and it is unacceptable.</p>



<p>(……point of no return)</p>



<p>No one knows what will happen next. Fujishiro just went with the flow, chuckling inwardly.</p>


<br>

<p>&#8220;Is there a student named Kokonoe!? I&#8217;m sorry, but call him right now!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the midst of the whirlwind, he must have been in a state of blood. The man rushed into the staff room with a desperate look on his face. There was not the slightest trace of his normal appearance. Even the casual observer could see that he was in a state of panic.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Tojo-sensei?! What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That student! His name is Kokonoe. I contacted you the other day. What is he doing now?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Although upset by the sudden visitor, he had no choice but to respond. Even the principal, Yoshinaga, is only one person in charge of the high school. The other party was an alumnus of the school and a prominent local figure.</p>



<p>And above all, he is a member of the prefectural assembly. Hideomi Tojo is known for his enthusiasm for education. He was not a person to whom careless behavior would be tolerated.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is currently under house arrest&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Remove his suspension and call him out right now!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What on earth is going on? He was ordered by Tojo-sensei&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t give any orders! I&#8217;m just saying that I don&#8217;t like the idea of having a student like this in the school!&#8221;</p>



<p>His words were filled with the self-protection typical of a politician. At the very least, he left an escape route so that he would not be held responsible.</p>



<p>But despite this, Tojo in front of him looked out of place.</p>



<p>What in the world had happened to this man&#8212;</p>



<p>Everyone wondered that, and Tojo spit out a few words as if he were trying to squeeze them out of his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;If this continues, I will be doomed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hideomi Tojo has served three terms as a prefectural assembly member for 12 years. He was thinking of entering national politics at some point.</p>



<p>His daughter asked him for a favor.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hideomi was very fond of his only daughter, Erika. Hearing Erika&#8217;s story, Hideomi was furious. He could not bear to have such a student attending the same high school as his daughter.</p>



<p>Moreover, the high school where he was going to flounder was also his own alumnus. What the man is doing is a crime, no doubt about it. What he is doing is not only unbecoming of his alumnus, but also unacceptable.</p>



<p>When he visited the school the other day, he was proud of the students who were working hard in their studies.</p>



<p>Hideomi picked up the phone. If he had taken the trouble to corroborate Erika&#8217;s testimony, even a fraction of the time, the situation might have been different.</p>



<p>But it was all in hindsight.</p>



<p>A few days later, Hideomi received a phone call from an official of the prefectural federation.</p>



<p>The contents of the call caught him by surprise. The party&#8217;s official recognition had been canceled. This was an impossible situation.</p>



<p>Hideomi was officially recognized by the ruling party. He was a member of the largest faction in the prefectural assembly, which held the majority of seats. The revocation of his party certification meant that he would no longer be able to obtain the support of his organization in future elections, and he would have to work as an independent. Naturally, his plans to switch to national politics would be thrown out of the window.</p>



<p>There was no way they would accept such a thing. There must be some mistake!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hideomi was furious and immediately protested, but received a curt response.</p>



<p>It was an instruction from Rishu Himiyama.</p>



<p>Rishu Himiyama. He has been a member of the Parliament for eight terms and has served as Vice Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, and Minister of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Although he has already retired from national politics, his hidden influence has not diminished in the slightest.</p>



<p>&#8211;This is absurd.</p>



<p>It is incomprehensible. It is no wonder, then, that for Hideomi, who aspires to national politics, Rishu Himiyama is a man above the clouds. He had never even met or talked with him before.</p>



<p>There was no way he knows me. From Rishu&#8217;s point of view, I was a stone on the side of the road. Why would this person have done such an impersonal thing as asking for his official recognition to be revoked?</p>



<p>However, there was one thing I knew. If I could get Rishu Himiyama&#8217;s attention, it would be a tremendous stepping stone for my entry into national politics.</p>



<p>The ground of Rishu Himiyama is strong. Who will succeed him, and the struggle for his successor, is also attracting attention. If I can succeed him, I will make a great leap forward.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if I am disliked by Rishu Himiyama, then there is no future for me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>A phone call came again to Hideomi, who was shocked and dismayed. It is Haruhiko Himiyama.</p>



<p>He is a career bureaucrat working for the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Haruhiko tells him in a cold voice.</p>



<p>Hideomi, who knew what was going on, turned pale. How could this happen!</p>



<p>Hideomi was not ready to make the transition to national politics at the earliest opportunity. This was no time to be dreaming.</p>



<p>On the contrary, if he did not get this problem under control right now, there would be no future for him.</p>



<p>If things continue as they are, I will be ruined! Hideomi instructed his secretary to cancel all plans and hurried to his old school. It was shallow. It was shallow. He thought it was an insignificant problem. He failed to check the facts.</p>



<p>That meant, as it was, that Hideomi Tojo lacked the qualities of a politician.</p>



<p>It was a blunder that could have been branded as such.</p>



<p>I never thought that student would have connections to Himiyama!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>An innocent student has been framed. It was not even imaginable that there would be a connection with Himiyama.</p>



<p>Regretting his own foolishness in failing to check the facts, Hideomi was driven by frustration.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Thank goodness! I&#8217;m so glad…….&#8221;</p>



<p>I was at the hospital with my mom. A detailed examination for breast cancer.</p>



<p>The result of the ultrasound was &#8220;no abnormality&#8221;.</p>



<p>Mom said that the probability of breast cancer was low to begin with.</p>



<p>However, there was no way she would be okay with it. The mere suspicion of breast cancer is enough to make a woman feel uneasy.</p>



<p>And it is too heavy to carry alone without talking to anyone.</p>



<p>My mother&#8217;s hands were trembling until the results came in. Holding my hand, she endured her fear. Now, perhaps in relief, she was holding my hand even tighter.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry……. For making you stay with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a lot of free time. There&#8217;s not much else I can do.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a normal time of day since I was under house arrest, but it was a time when students were at school.</p>



<p>I was a delinquent, walking around in plain clothes at such hours.</p>



<p>I might call myself a yankee at the very earliest. It would be like Yukito Kokonoe Yankee Form. However, I don&#8217;t have a nail in a bat or a wooden sword.</p>



<p>It is an eternal mystery why people buy wooden swords on school trips.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not true. If you hadn&#8217;t been there, I might have been crushed. Just having you by my side was reassuring. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>My heart aches at the sight of my mother. The blue face finally regains its freshness.</p>



<p>Why Mom? Why me?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I wish I could have taken her place. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>It should be me who should suffer. It should be me.</p>



<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be you. Mom shouldn&#8217;t be the one to suffer.</p>



<p>It should always be me who should bear the karma, and I should be the one to take such a role.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so sweet. But I don&#8217;t want you to say that to me again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her tone was strong, without saying whether or not she meant it. Mom&#8217;s expression stiffened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m the one who has neglected you. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>The tears are gradually accumulating in Mom&#8217;s big eyes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Unable to bear the sad look on her face, I hurriedly change the subject.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. Let&#8217;s go out to eat together later when Nee-san comes home. I found out about a great restaurant the other day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, I will pay for it, yes. For someone like me who doesn&#8217;t usually spend much of my allowance, how can I not spend it economically at a time like this?</p>



<p>When I turned on my phone to call the general, the incoming calls were a horror.</p>



<p>The voicemails were also horrendous. It was too much trouble, so I decided to pretend I didn&#8217;t see it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that Yukito would ask me out like that. …… Right. I&#8217;ll have to tell Yuuri. I think she noticed that I was acting strange too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder how anxious she was. I&#8217;ll never understand it.</p>



<p>Fear of death. Craving for life. She had been suffering for a long time until that narrow moment.</p>



<p>All I can do is to act as gently as possible to dispel her concerns.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Watch me. Let&#8217;s try some of the special moves I learned on the Internet to cheer her up!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Mom is okay. I love you, Mom! I&#8217;m going to marry mom!&#8221;</p>



<p>Gah! And then, Mom sprays a damaging effect. Eh, is she okay?!</p>



<p>Dwahahahahahahaha! Did you see the power of this?</p>



<p>I did a search on what makes mothers happy and found that it makes them happy when their children say this to them at an early age.</p>



<p>Looking back, I don&#8217;t remember saying that when I was a little boy. At my age, people may not like to hear me say it, but I would like to continue to cherish the spirit of challenge.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-I really wish you were my husband.&#8221;</p>



<p>I almost get sucked into her moist eyes. That&#8217;s not right. Did I make a mistake?</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm, Mom? Why is your face so close ……? What happens twice happens three times. I&#8217;ve been seeing this pattern a lot lat&#8212;ee&#8211;lyyy&#8212;&#8211;!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>…… It was just amazing. I won&#8217;t mention it in depth.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m so happy, I just couldn&#8217;t help it! …… but I really mean it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what to do. The colorfulness is increasing. It is like a girl in love.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was going to start over as your mother, but you&#8217;re spoiling me and I&#8217;m getting worse and worse. I can&#8217;t take it any more, because I&#8217;m going&#8212;- to get &#8212;&#8211;serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>I make a proposal to my mother, who is holding on to me tight, that I have been thinking about for a while.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, there&#8217;s a place I&#8217;d like to go with you sometime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is a journey of self-discovery. It is one of the mental illnesses that conscious young people tend to fall into, but in my case, it is a journey of self-discovery, so I don&#8217;t want people to equate me with a conscious young person.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I am Yukito Kokonoe, a man who does not suddenly go to India and wake up to a new self. I have doubts about me.</p>



<p>Until now, I didn&#8217;t care about anything. Nothing bothered me. I don&#8217;t even get hurt anymore. My mentality is as highly shock absorbent as alpha gel. No matter what anyone said or did to me, I wouldn&#8217;t get hurt. So it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t care about myself or anyone else. Just like I don&#8217;t care, no one cares about me anyway. That&#8217;s all right. That would take care of everything. That&#8217;s how I gave up everything.</p>



<p>I must not be able to go on like this. If something in me doesn&#8217;t change, I will repeat the same thing. I will continue to cause pain to someone else.</p>



<p>Why did Mom cry just now? Why did she kiss me? What was Hinagi trying to prove? What did Shiori want to do as a manager?</p>



<p>I probably know what the feelings are that are directed at me.</p>



<p>I know, I just don&#8217;t understand. I thought I had lost it. But it was definitely there.</p>



<p>A hand clutched at the answer that vaguely emerged.</p>

<br>

<p>&#8220;&#8211;No way ……, then I?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t reach Yukito! Where the hell is&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, there&#8217;s got to be a way to get in touch with&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The principal&#8217;s office was in disarray. The school teacher, Sayuri Fujishiro, was also there.</p>



<p>Just a few minutes ago, there was a call from the Board of Education here as well. It was similar to what Hideomi had heard, but the problem had grown exponentially and could no longer be contained within the school.</p>



<p>A conflagration that made people want to cover their eyes. Even Yoshinaga would not be spared from punishment.</p>



<p>After hearing the whole story from Mutsuki, Erika was in tears. Her father, Hideomi, has also lost his vitality. Erika , who tried to trick an innocent person, must also be punished.</p>



<p>In fact, Yukito Kokonoe has been suspended from school, which is equivalent to a suspension, despite the fact that he was not at fault in any way. Erika was only unilaterally involved in the ridiculous commotion caused by the Tojo family. Depending on the situation, Erika could be expelled from school at worst.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>And once this happened, it was none other than one student, Yukito Kokonoe, who held the power of life and death over Erika, Hideomi, the principal Yoshinaga, and everyone else.</p>



<p>At the very least, Hideomi Tojo has no future unless he can get Yukito Kokonoe to intercede with the Himiyama family. Even his current position might be revoked soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;Erika, what you did is unforgivable. But if it was for my sake, then I am just as guilty. It is my fault that I have not explained anything to the people around me because it is a sensitive issue. In the worst case scenario, I will leave the school with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mutsuki! It is my fault! You don&#8217;t have to leave!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuri gives them a cold stare. Her anger grows.</p>



<p>Just when she thought things were headed in the right direction, this is what happens. It&#8217;s always this kind of disturbance, as if with malice aforethought.</p>



<p>And each time it happens, Yukito Kokonoe breaks down. He had reached his limit. Just when she thought her little brother had opened his heart to her, even if only a little, the thought that he would break down again, that he would treat her like a stranger again, was unbearable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both of you need to leave! I don&#8217;t want anyone around that boy who wants to hurt him!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri …… sorry ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The air is tense, as if it&#8217;s tense. There is nothing to be done about it.</p>



<p>The only one who can fix this situation was not supposed to be here &#8212;-.</p>



<p>“Yo~o, how y’all doing?”</p>



<p>The man who holds the power of life and death in this place, Yukito Kokonoe, appears with an uncharacteristic line and the frivolity of a businessman who just happened to drop by a tavern on a whim.</p>



<p>&#8220;Judgment time&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a line no one could understand.</p>



<p>&#8220;You, why are you here……?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;When someone contacts me like that, one would think something was wrong, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I left the hospital and turned on my smartphone, the incoming calls and texts were horrendous. I thought I was getting a lot of spam as a result of my personal information being leaked.</p>



<p>However, they were from my sister and the school, and I knew that something must have happened, so I went over there. I was in my casual clothes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we get in touch with you?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I was out for a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re under suspension…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do I have to comply with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>The principal&#8217;s expression turns awkward. It&#8217;s no wonder. As long as I am not at fault in any way, there is no reason for me to comply.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clear injustice, and if it became public, the person who decided on the punishment would be in trouble.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I apologize, Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>The first to apologize was a third-year student. I had never met her before and was not acquainted with her. Her eyes were swollen. Was she crying? Next to her was a man of mature age. He bowed his head in rapid succession.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am so sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, can you explain to me what happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>I know it&#8217;s a rough spot, but I can&#8217;t explain it to you. I know it&#8217;s a hellish situation, but since there was no explanation, it was all gibberish to me. I&#8217;m Yukito Kokonoe, not Prince Shotoku, who can understand what people are saying. One of the ordinary people.An ordinary person cannot do the imitation of hearing one thing and knowing ten things.</p>



<p>After listening to the whole story, I became reluctant. That&#8217;s right. This incident really did seem to come out of nowhere, but the more I listened, the more I realized that it was far more than just an unrelated incident.</p>



<p>It just happened without my knowledge. That&#8217;s unreasonable!?</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, what&#8217;s the point of all this? I&#8217;m being forced to clean up the mess that you guys have created on your own, is that it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Too much of a nuisance! It was a complete waste of time. It was as barren as an egg-carrying quest in a hunting game. Why do they even put huge rocks on the path to obstruct it? I am not the only one who is fed up with the harassment of the development staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will take responsibility and leave the school. So please, please, please forgive Mutsuki! Mutsuki is the kind of student this school needs!&#8221;</p>



<p>The senior who identified herself as Tojo was pleading with tears in her eyes. But when I heard that, I thought how selfish she was. This person doesn&#8217;t understand anything.</p>



<p>“You’re saying that you’re going to drop out of school without thinking about it, after misunderstanding and humiliating me without any reason, assuming that is an apology for the trouble you’ve caused me?”</p>



<p>&#8220;But ……!&#8221;</p>



<p>“If it hadn’t been for me, if I had been punished by the school for spreading those rumors, I might have committed suicide, you know? Even if it wasn’t for that, you would have been greatly hurt. I’m sure you’ve been hurt a lot after all. Will your expulsion heal these wounds?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, if it weren&#8217;t for me, I might have received an unfair punishment from school and could have even committed suicide. Even without that, I would have been greatly hurt. Just because you dropped out of school, do you think those wounds will heal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Suicide!? &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Senpai crumbles as if in shock. Her father supports her in a moment&#8217;s notice, but he is no better. He is the main culprit and party responsible for worsening the situation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I have a mentality as hard as gorilla glass, so it&#8217;s not a problem, but if I were normal, I would have been in despair.</p>



<p>The school is also in on it, imposing punishment on me. I can&#8217;t help but be saddened that I have no one on my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;What would you do if I had died as a result of your malicious intent? You too. Tojo-san. Why didn&#8217;t you check the facts? What are you in that position for?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I only managed to get by because there was someone to help me, otherwise I might have continued to be treated unfairly. In that case, what would have happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Yukito, let’s file a lawsuit claiming damages for defamation.”</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay however much it costs. I am so sorry! I have been making efforts to educate people. I never thought I would do such a thing. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Father, no, it is my fault. I am the one&#8211;!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>“Kokonoe, part of the blame lies with me.”</p>



<p>It is utterly deplorable. If you regret it so much, why couldn&#8217;t you have been a little more thoughtful in your approach? As I mentioned earlier, I had nothing to do with this, and yet I was forced to be the one to clean up the mess.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve come this far, and my bad luck with women is nothing more than a gag.</p>



<p>Haa. A big sigh escapes my lips. The people around me react with a startle. I feel their eyes on me as if they are looking for my expression. Why do I keep getting into trouble like this?</p>



<p>This world is so hard on me. I want it to stop.</p>



<p>How would I have responded in such a situation? I think about that. If she wants to drop out of school, she can. What she did is unforgivable.</p>



<p>Besides, she is irrelevant and unimportant to me. I wouldn&#8217;t care if she was gone. I wonder if I would have answered in such a way.</p>



<p>President Kedou also had a pained expression on her face. She, too, was an outsider who had nothing to do with the situation. She is just a victim of this situation.</p>



<p>If Tojo-senpai was expelled from the school, would the chairman be saddened? HIPBOSS has a strong sense of responsibility. Otherwise, she wouldn&#8217;t have persistently tried to get involved with me after that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I have one thought. I have bad luck with women. That is already certain.</p>



<p>However, it was also a woman who helped me in this situation. Like Himiyama-san, my sister was also angry with me. The student council president also felt responsible for the situation here and now.</p>



<p>I had always thought it was okay to be alone. I thought I should be alone.</p>



<p>I would hurt someone. Being alone is very good for me. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at all. I don&#8217;t feel lonely. But there were people who still wouldn&#8217;t leave me. There were people who wanted to be close to me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be a &#8220;shady,&#8221; a &#8220;lonely&#8221; person, but now I&#8217;ve built relationships with people that I can hardly call myself that. I can no longer say that I am a loner, let alone a loner in the shadows. I have to admit it. I have to recognize the situation correctly and change to move forward.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to remain oblivious to the feelings that the girls are supposed to be expressing to me. I don&#8217;t want to see anyone cry anymore. And yet, someone is crying in front of me again.</p>



<p>I see Tojo-senpai&#8217;s tearful face. If I were to say it, she is my enemy. She should be someone I hate. However, I haven&#8217;t had such emotions towards someone I hate for a long time.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8220;Tojo-senpai, I will punish you. First of all, you must make public what you have done. Try to restore my credibility. Otherwise, if you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll be a shiny, demon first-year student.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>



<p>After a pause, I take her hand and look her straight in the eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;And, please be my friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any friends at all. I&#8217;ve always been a loner.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm…&#8221;</p>



<p>“It’s not like you can just drop out and run away. The only one who will be saved by that will be you, Senpai. I won’t get anything in return. How can you be allowed to leave me empty-handed after causing me so much trouble?”</p>



<p>&#8220;B-but …… are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure you apologize for the trouble you&#8217;ve caused.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much ……. I&#8217;m really sorry! Why, why did I hate you and do terrible …… things to you…..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Tojo-senpai, how did you find out about the situation? The fact that the president falsely accused me and framed me as the culprit should not have been known…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I received a letter. It said that you set a trap to frame Mutsuki.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Idiot! That&#8217;s the culprit!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who could have done such a despicable thing! Erika, where is that letter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I was so angry about the contents that I immediately threw it away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But then again, I guess that&#8217;s what you call a daily routine. I&#8217;m going on a pilgrimage to purify myself, so don&#8217;t mind me, President.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know they hated me that much. I could have easily started my life over if I was a loop princess.</p>



<p>For some reason, my sister hugs me from behind. The twin hills are asserting their presence over my back, but I look up at the azure sky through the window to cover it up. It&#8217;s so soft. …… ( far away eyes )</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Yukito, are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a feeling you were going to take something. Chills?&#8221;</p>



<p>My sister is saying something I don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Yukito Kokonoe, you were actually punished and Erika was tricked. Hideomi, we cannot just leave things as they are, can we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I agree. Principal Yoshinaga, I would like the school to be very careful in handling the information. There seems to be something suspicious about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-of course&#8221;</p>



<p>My suspension was lifted on the spot. I was now a free man.</p>



<p>It seems that a much stronger pressure was exerted on the school side compared to the prefectural assembly member Hideomi Tojo, and in any case, it was immediately lifted, but what did Himyama-san do? Terrifying. But it&#8217;s even more terrifying to hear about it.</p>



<p>I remember what happened when I went to her house last time. She&#8217;s a witch. She must be a witch. She was a bewitching woman who deceived me. I mean, why did she &#8211; oops, I almost slipped.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Kokonoe. I know it&#8217;s very irresponsible and regrettable to say this kind of thing to you. It&#8217;s all my fault. But please! Please help me connect with Himiyama-sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Himiyama-sensei, I only know Misaki-san&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Misaki&#8230;.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Besides, I don&#8217;t touch&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please! If this continues, it will be the end for me. It might even become difficult to let Erika live the same life as before! Please!&#8221;</p>



<p>A grown man was on his knees. Wasn&#8217;t he a member of the prefectural assembly?</p>



<p>He must have been given a very strong moxie by Himiyama-san, because he was being shamelessly exposed as a pathetic figure. From what he said earlier, I wonder if his life as a member of the assembly is under threat.</p>



<p>In any case, this is too mature a story for me to intervene.</p>



<p>I would just have to go along with Himiyama-san.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I understand. But the only person I know is a woman named Misaki-san. I&#8217;ll talk to her, and you can do the rest yourself. I don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, I owe you! The woman …… is she a relative of Rishu-sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She called him her grandfather, so she might be his granddaughter.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it was. No wonder Sensei moved so quickly. You really are amazing. How on earth did you get such connections ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Chest… your chest…why are you taking off your clothes…stop ……touching…..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito! What&#8217;s going one Yukito?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh!? The door to the sealed memories was about to open!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, what just happened!? What&#8217;s going on!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I almost drowned in maternal instincts.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>Hey! What kind of relationship do you have with her!? Tell me honestly!&#8221;</p>



<p>However, having lived as Yukito Kokonoe the Yankee form until now, it&#8217;s going to be tough to go back to school normally from tomorrow.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; what about me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Afterward, Principal Yoshinaga received disciplinary action and was punished with a one-month pay cut.</p>



<p>As a result, the principal&#8217;s attitude towards Yukito Kokonoe changed completely and he was frequently seen around the school trying to please her. However, Yukito was still treated as a troublesome person, even though he was unaware of it.</p>



<p>When I left the principal&#8217;s office, many students gathered around me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, are you all right? If Yuki had just disappeared like this, I……. Hey, w-w-what&#8217;s wrong? Did they do something to you? Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Crack!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Shiori&#8217;s bearhug, which boasts the strongest physical strength among women, explodes into a frenzy. Hearing his bones creak and squeak from the unusual power of the barehug, his consciousness gradually fades away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Shiori, please stop it. You&#8217;re making Kokonoe-kun not okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>The one who saved the day was Hasumura, who unexpectedly should have disliked me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a nuisance to you, too,…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Hasumura-san gives an awkward smile. She had glared at me when I had called her before, but her impression was quite different from that time. Maybe this is the real Hasumura-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Kokonoe! If only we had done a better job of communicating with her!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be more proactive from now on, Shu-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there no option but to rethink that preacherly behavior?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll nail the bard duo to the wall.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that your suspension has been lifted. I&#8217;m so happy for you, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hagure goddess senpai ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, what&#8217;s the matter? Are you overcome with emotion?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I didn&#8217;t know that Hagure Goddesses could appear in places other than the fire escape.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, this time I won&#8217;t let you get away with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I apologized.</p>



<p>&#8220;Geez. You always make me worry all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>A fresh, handsome guy blurted out. There were giggles and laughter from all over the place.</p>



<p>All of them were familiar faces. Some were classmates, some were upperclassmen.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It seems that my sister had hurriedly called out to them and gathered them together.</p>



<p>Well, I&#8217;m just impressed by her kind heart. How much virtue do you intend to accumulate in this world? Thank you, Fierce Heavenly Host Uriel.</p>



<p>I heard earlier that my sister, the president, Hinagi, and others broke a lot of bones trying to save me. I&#8217;m worried that it might be a compound fracture.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>



<p>I bowed to all of them. It is difficult to extend a hand without getting something in return.</p>



<p>No one would blame me if I ignored them. They are strangers after all.</p>



<p>Before I know it, the legend of the evil Yukito Kokonoe has faded away. Rather, the legend of the saint has begun. It is extremely unpleasant, but it is not the atmosphere in which such a thing can be said.</p>



<p>It is too heavy a load. I should write a letter of thanks to everyone who has contributed to this project later.</p>



<p>Why in the world would they go to such lengths for a mere guy like me?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Not just anyone. Because it is you, Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi stepped forward from among the group.</p>



<p>I remember that everyone is in uniform except for me. I can&#8217;t deny that I feel out of place. I feel alienated, as if I am a foreigner. That&#8217;s exactly the feeling I&#8217;m used to, and somehow it makes me feel at ease.</p>



<p>But that may no longer be allowed.</p>



<p>I was helplessly saved.</p>



<p>From so many people.</p>



<p>At times like this, the words to say are always simple.</p>






<p>&#8220;Welcome back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back.&#8221;</p>
