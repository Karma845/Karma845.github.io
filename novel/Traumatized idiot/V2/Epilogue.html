<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>&#8220;What the heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell!&#8221;</p>



<p>I fell to my knees in shock. At last, at long last, this day had come.</p>



<p>Even though I was prepared for it, I needed at least some time to prepare myself.</p>



<p>Mom and Sis, who had been sobbing for some reason, told me to get out of the house for a while, and it took a few hours. In the midst of the sadness of being shunned by my family, a cruel blow was waiting for me.</p>



<p>When I returned to my room after going out, I found that the room had changed completely.</p>



<p>What a surprise! Even Takumi was amazed at the before and after.</p>



<p>The cream-colored wallpaper is easy on the eyes. The stylish interior and carpet.</p>



<p>Even the fluorescent bulbs have been replaced with LEDs. Triple the life span, that&#8217;s eco-friendly!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The performance of the living space has been dramatically improved. Not a trace of the room&#8217;s original appearance remains.</p>



<p>Most noticeable is the queen-size bed, which is still very much in evidence.</p>



<p>It sits there with tremendous dignity.</p>



<p>The deadline for the groundbreaking has finally passed. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back. What do you think? Isn&#8217;t it nice?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I didn&#8217;t see them, I found my mother and sister relaxing in my old room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your room was too dreary, so I remodeled it. You should be thankful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, my room?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked back, unable to stop myself from asking about the disturbing comment. I didn&#8217;t get kicked out?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What else could it be? It&#8217;s your room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my room by any stretch of the imagination…….&#8221;</p>



<p>I look around again, but it still doesn&#8217;t look anything like my room.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel at ease in such a cozy-looking room.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is your place. So I just changed it to make it more suitable for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>For a moment, my sister&#8217;s face took on a melancholy look. I felt as if she could see right through me, and I gulped her words.</p>



<p>A place to stay. I was caught up in a strange feeling. Is this where I belong?</p>



<p>I had never thought of my room as my place before.</p>



<p>Is it okay for me to be here, with my family?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I played around with your room a bit without permission because it felt a little lonely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom apologizes to me. As someone who is allowed to live here for free, I have nothing to complain about, but I do have some things to worry about. Many things.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-why is the bed so big?&#8221;</p>



<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been together all the time. Therefore, I thought it might be too cramped for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; …… Uhm, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if you slept in your own room? &#8211;Aah, Mom, don&#8217;t cry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Naturally, the most honest opinions are silenced.</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s just for sleeping, a single room is too small.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what use it has other than sleeping, but I open a chest I don&#8217;t recognize.</p>



<p>I pretended I didn&#8217;t see the inside of the flamboyant lower …… and gently closed it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>With a bad feeling, I turned over the pillow with the word YES painted on it. Contrary to my expectations, it was YES.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both YES&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>



<p>I slammed it down on the bed in annoyance. Where do they sell these things ……?</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? &#8220;I am not someone who says no. Saying no is not an option for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can move around a lot in this bed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said, what are you talking about?!&#8221;</p>



<p>A heart mark appeared in her eyes. There is no way she is&#8212;&#8211;!</p>



<p>&#8220;H-huh? It&#8217;s just a contact lens.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Stop being so dexterously confusing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to sleeping with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&#8221;</p>



<p>I did not ask. I looked at the wall and saw two posters.</p>



<p>One is a B1 big-size poster of my mother and the other is a poster of my sister (not for sale).</p>



<p>They are very self-assertive.</p>



<p>They are not for sale, but obscene.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next month, I&#8217;ll be in a bathing suit. Look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is going to be renewed?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I&#8217;m starting to get a little excited. They are both beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, your poster is in my room and my mom&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>No, no, this is not the time to thank her! I&#8217;m furious. Punpun.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you put up posters like this, no one can come visit us!&#8221;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t show it to anyone I know. It&#8217;s hard to peel them off every time. What should I do!</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never brought any friends over.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I come to a sad conclusion, I notice a photo frame on the desk.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The photo shows my sister with a pouty face and my mother smiling cheerfully with her cheeks in the middle of me with no expression on my face.</p>



<p>My sister and mother are doing what seems to be a trendy pose for gals, but it fatally doesn&#8217;t suit them. My sister&#8217;s expression and my mother&#8217;s age ……. Take it easy, both of you.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sensing unpleasant waves.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Yuuri-sama is really beautiful and the best, please forgive me. …… Hehe, how about it, master, shall I give you a shoulder rub? Here, don&#8217;t be shy.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was flirting with my sister and my mother hugged us both together.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to create lots of memories with my family from now on, no, from before too. I know I&#8217;m being selfish and it&#8217;s already too late, but I want to gradually build them up while leaving them as memories and records. That&#8217;s why&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>She simply strokes my head gently. Like a mother. I mean, she is my mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me continue to be your mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>No matter what happens, she is still my mother and I can never replace her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I have never disliked her, and I will always be grateful to her.</p>



<p>A husband and wife are strangers when they divorce, but that is not the case with blood relatives. It is a very deep connection.</p>



<p>It is surely a deep and abyssal thought that goes far beyond the feeling of &#8220;love&#8221;.</p>



<p>As long as she wants, if she says this is the place to be, maybe I can stay here a little longer. With the three of us, as a family.</p>



<p>I might be allowed to hold on to such a modest hope.</p>



<p>Ding-dong. Suddenly, the chime rang.</p>



<p>Perhaps embarrassed by the hug, the slightly red-faced sister hurriedly ran to the front door. Yuuri-san, who looked like she was a bit of a scaredy-cat, was not so sure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Yuuri-chan. Let&#8217;s go out to eat together now. Huh, where are you? Isn&#8217;t this Yuki-chan&#8217;s ro&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>A familiar voice came. The visitor was Sekka Kokonoe.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our eyes meet at the entrance of the room. She looked around the room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, what&#8217;s wrong, Sekka?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is thiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssss!!&#8221;</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;We have a school observation today. Haa, I&#8217;m not looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I regret it now, I&#8217;ve gone too far. I never thought it would lead to this result. I thought it would only be about half of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you really not trust adults that much as a student like you? &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. Thank you for standing up for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I, a well-known bad boy, and the student advisor, Sanjoji-sensei, have a causal rivalry.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, surprisingly, she is not an enemy of mine, and I am close enough to her to be lectured over sips of tea like this. During my house arrest, she contacted me with her concerns and has always been on my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either way, we were in the wrong this time. I&#8217;m sorry for making you feel bad. But you shouldn&#8217;t engage in indecent behavior!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a fun and enjoyable suspension period, so don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s really okay&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The Nikkei Stock Average was once again experiencing a major plunge today. It&#8217;s been three consecutive days of decline.</p>



<p>However, it is I, Yukito Kokonoe who buys stocks when they are down.</p>



<p>The buying interest is increasing. I immediately sent an email to Sekka-san telling her which stocks I wanted her to buy. The money is my personal money, so don&#8217;t worry.</p>



<p>I am completely back to my old self, but if I were to suddenly become the serious Yukito Kokonoe now, that would be very strange. I am fine as I am. That is who I have always been, so there was no need to rush to change now.</p>



<p>I am not an imposter. The past me and the future me are connected.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>So today, I was summoned to the student guidance office by Suzuka Sanjoji-sensei.</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei is an intellectual beauty with glasses and a very popular teacher. Her sharp gaze was piercing me acutely. I am not sure why I was summoned. It&#8217;s so routine that it feels more unusual for me to be called out on a day when nothing is going on.</p>



<p>What the heck is everyday …… uggghhhh!</p>



<p>I feel like this is called &#8220;lewd&#8221; something, so I look at Sanjoji-sensei.</p>



<p>In the room, Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s fragrance is wafting in the air. She had opened her blouse&#8217;s first button, as if it was hot. Her cleavage is visible. And why did she cross her legs in a tight skirt, something that shouldn&#8217;t be glimpsed …… Fmmm, black.</p>



<p>Today is the joyous and embarrassing Black Friday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen here, you must strictly refrain from behavior that disturbs public order! I will educate&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it&#8217;s the teacher who&#8217;s disturbing public order, but I hold my tongue. It&#8217;s just a feast for my eyes, and there&#8217;s no need to put it into words. I will continue to live faithfully to my desires from now on.</p>



<p>Then, the door to the student guidance room is suddenly thrown open with great force.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you doing?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What did he do, Sanjoji-sensei?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Sister, the student council president, and others rush in with an angry expression. Sanjoji-sensei and I are left dumbfounded by their sudden intrusion.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on with you people?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you, Sanjoji-Sensei! What were you trying to do?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was giving guidance to a problematic student&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe didn&#8217;t do anything!&#8221;</p>



<p>What part of this is guidance? It looks like Sensei is harassing him?&#8221;</p>

<p>When she showed Sanjoji the pictures she had taken with her smartphone, Sanjoji&#8217;s face scrunched up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I am really troubled by my sister&#8217;s concern.</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei is a wonderful teacher who cares about her students and is not the kind of person who would seduce them. By the way, my eyes are not so bright.</p>



<p>It is an open fact that I am objectively a problem child, so it is only natural that I have been invited by Sanjoji-sensei, but in my experience, this is nothing to be concerned about.</p>



<p>&#8220;B-big problem, Sanjoji-sensei!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is the principal even here?&#8221;</p>



<p>The principal came in with a bloodthirsty look on his face. He was out of breath, perhaps in a state of panic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any proof that he did anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, but he caused some kind of commotion ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow you to give guidance based on such uncertainty, Sanjoji-Sensei. I am sorry, Kokonoe-kun. Can you please keep this matter to yourself?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Principal, it seems that you have suddenly become the complete opposite of yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>The principal was also desperate. I have the feeling that he has been trying to curry favor with the students lately, but this is not the attitude he should be taking toward a single student. It is not too much to say that the school is collapsing. It was an unpleasant reality of the educational scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, Sanjoji-sensei. If you do anything to him any more, not only me but also you may be punished at any time. Please be very, very careful! Please, Sanjoji-sensei!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange? There is no way such a student can be&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no room for debate on this matter!&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I had become a very powerful man. What do you mean, &#8220;punished&#8221;? If students had that kind of authority, it would be too scary. The Japanese education system is in serious trouble.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s get the hell out of here.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was being dragged along by my sister. In general, this kind of commotion was an everyday occurrence for me. I had lost my mental toughness with the bulk nano-metal structure, but that didn&#8217;t mean that all my past experiences had returned to zero.</p>



<p>I am not so weak as to be hurt by this.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I am what I am, and I&#8217;m here now.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>In class B, an abrupt shuraba was unfolding.</p>



<p>&#8220;I made lunch for you, Yukito. Do you want to eat it with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my mother&#8217;s lunchbox to eat……. &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought so, so I made a small portion for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, can I join you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up, you&#8217;re being so annoying. I don&#8217;t want you. I&#8217;m eating with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sis, why are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s for you to eat with me, no?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I can&#8217;t say anything to that one unclouded eye.</p>



<p>A typhoon was blowing around me. Hinagi is No. 10 and Shiori is No. 11.</p>



<p>Recently, she often comes to my class. Sometimes her friends come along with her, grinning. When that happens, she always starts to get into a fight with Hinagi and Shiori, but these two have been having lunch with me a lot lately.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe, are you there?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe, would you like to join us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, would you like to join us for lunch?&#8221;</p>



<p>When sea water temperatures rise due to heat, rising air currents are generated in whirlpools at sea.</p>



<p>The cumulonimbus clouds generated by the heat produce typhoons, and the area around me, which is known as the hot spot of this school, is always in a state of stormy weather. There is no way there can be only one typhoon.</p>



<p>The student council president, Mikumo-senpai, and Erika Tojo-senpai were calling for me. Typhoons No. 13, 14, and 15. A storm was blowing through the class.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Um, Yukito-kun, are you there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-Souma-senpai! I&#8217;ll go get him right away&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The continuous occurrence of typhoons had not yet ended. Now, it was the long-awaited No. 16.</p>



<p>A panicked classmate called out to me. Who is this Soma-senpai?</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve heard of her somewhere, but I can&#8217;t remember anything about her.</p>



<p>&#8220;When did you get acquainted with Soma-senpai? What&#8217;s going on with your friendship?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t recall anything like that either.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, you seem to be getting better, but it&#8217;s getting worse.&#8221;</p>



<p>A fresh, handsome guy who looks like he&#8217;s about to give up. We are now members of the basketball club, which was supposed to have only three first-year students, but is slowly gaining new members.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It&#8217;s all thanks to Shiori and this refreshingly handsome guy. It couldn&#8217;t have been my fault.</p>



<p>So, who is this Souma-senpai after all? I reluctantly headed that way.</p>



<p>&#8220;What the heck, isn&#8217;t that Amaterasu-sama, the great god of the sun shining down on us!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve finally gone Japanese style!? And you, do you really have no intention of remembering my name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry about it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pissed off! I&#8217;m angry at myself for having come all the way here even though I&#8217;m angry at you!&#8221;</p>



<p>So, what&#8217;s the matter, Amaterasu-senpai? Considering that Amaterasu is a loner, you have sympathy as a senpai for this generation. Hahahaha.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a loner, I keep telling you that! Why won&#8217;t you even try to listen to what I have to say!? You&#8217;ve been even more irritable than usual lately. Aah right, you&#8217;ve returned from suspension, but you haven&#8217;t come to have lunch with me at all. Are you tired of being with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>The class fell silent as if frozen.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>What&#8217;s going on? It&#8217;s supposed to be a fun lunch break!</p>



<p>I could hear a few voices murmuring &#8220;even Souma-senpai&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, umm, it&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t had many chances to go to the cafeteria lately, or rather, I&#8217;ve been under strict surveillance&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come hang out with me, it&#8217;s lonely here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go back to your class, you little fox.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, Yuuri Kokonoe? What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Garrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!&#8221;</p>



<p>If anything, my sister was a mad dog. I&#8217;m a cat person. Nyan.</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of relationship do you have with Soma-senpai?!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Everyone was making noise and shouting. Even some of the senpais had joined in, and the group around me had grown larger. The noise level had surpassed 60 decibels. It was time for some regulation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe, why don&#8217;t you come to my house today? My parents are out. Maybe we could go to my pla-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you say it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My father said to get along with you too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one here too!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Originally, Mikumu-senpai is shy and introverted, but now she is acting very differently and showing remarkable vigor.</p>



<p>I always wondered what pla&#8212;&#8211;wait what?!</p>



<p>As someone who has never had a girlfriend, I have no idea what they&#8217;re talking about&#8230; or so I&#8217;d like to say, but the looks everyone is giving me won&#8217;t let me get away with it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>What am I supposed to do in this situation?</p>



<p>Could it be&#8230;?</p>



<p>I realized something important.</p>



<p>&#8220;Elizabeth, I have a question for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; what is it, Kokonoe-kun? I have a feeling I shouldn&#8217;t be asking.&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked around the class.</p>



<p>Even if it turned out to be a mistake, it would be an everlasting shame if I didn&#8217;t solve this question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could it be&#8230; that I&#8217;m popular with girls?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a little late for that!?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The class erupted in protest.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s it, I was popular with girls&#8230;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>The hallway is lined with teachers who are out of class.</p>



<p>The principal and others stand upright. Their foreheads are covered in greasy sweat, and their expressions are tense.</p>



<p>Any failure to respond is unacceptable. They were on the precipice, on the edge of a backwater.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu, I&#8217;m sweating under my arms. I can&#8217;t stop shaking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for giving me information I didn&#8217;t want to know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sayuri-sensei was escaping from reality. I&#8217;m going to escape reality, too. Hehehe.</p>



<p>Oh my, it&#8217;s quite a spectacle, quite a spectacle. Can someone please send me back homeeeeee!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It&#8217;s a class observation day. The classroom is overflowing with parents. Hello there!</p>



<p>According to HIPBOSS, this is the highest attendance rate since the beginning of Shouyo High School.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! Yukito. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re okay!&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh my, it&#8217;s quite a spectacle, quite a spectacle. Can someone please send me back homeeeeee!</p>



<p>Classroom visit. The classroom was overflowing with parents. Hello.</p>



<p>I asked HIPBOSS about it, and he said it was the highest participation rate since the beginning of Haruyoshi High School.</p>



<p>Oh! Snowy Rabbit and you. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re all right!</p>



<p>&#8220;Mikuriya Papa-san, it&#8217;s been a long time.</p>



<p>Next to him is Mikuriya-mama-san. She greets me with a &#8220;Pekori&#8221; (a small smile). Even though they are divorced, they are both indispensable parents for Seido. Yes, the participation rate of the B class class is even ridiculous, but some children have both parents participating, so the population density in the classroom is quite high. Parents were greeting each other.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The teachers, who had already been exposed to the parents&#8217; aggressive attitude, were all out to greet them, not wanting to offend them any more than they already had. Oh, and there&#8217;s Papa Tojo, too. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmph. Yukito-kun, I haven&#8217;t forgiven you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mama! Your tsundere is out of date!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? It was still mainstream when I was young.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi, whose face turned bright red, dragged Akane-san along with her. I don&#8217;t expect her to forgive me, but maybe it&#8217;s time for me to go apologize to her with some pastries.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you the rumored kid? Heh, you seem like a good kid. We struggled with grades, so I don&#8217;t want my daughter to go through the same thing. So, please take care of her from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t say strange things to Kokonoe-chan&#8221;</p>



<p>Now that&#8217;s Mineda&#8217;s mother, isn&#8217;t it? Yeah, there&#8217;s some kind of resemblance. That means maybe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you Madame Elisabeth?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare give my mother that nickname!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara me? Ufu, it&#8217;s kind of tingling.&#8221;</p>



<p>As one would expect from Elisabeth&#8217;s mother, she is indeed a very elegant woman.</p>



<p>That tall and handsome couple over there, I met them at the hospital. They&#8217;re the Kamishiro family.</p>



<p>When I went to greet them, they thanked me a lot for the watch. They said it&#8217;s really nice.</p>



<p>Well, well, well, you must be Kokonoe-kun! Come now, An-san, come here too.&#8221;</p>



<p>The fluffy mother with an unrealistic vibe was Shakado&#8217;s mother.</p>



<p>The fresh and good-looking man is also looking uncomfortable in front of his mother, as if he is formless in front of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito how can you be so unconcerned in this situation ……?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The fresh and handsome man is more quiet than usual and lacks sharpness. The face power generation is also cloudy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are your eyes blind? What is it about me that makes you so unconcerned? Look at this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;An ……? O-oi, Yukito ……, is that a …… d-disposable diaper?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I pissed myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on with those people!? I mean, there are some unrelated people, but what&#8217;s going on!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turn my head to the back with a feeling of escapism.</p>



<p>With a big smile on their faces as if a flower had bloomed, they wave their hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan, hello!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, be quiet, Sekka.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I see that you are now a proper high school student, Yukito-kun&#8221;</p>



<p>I recognize Sekka-san and Mom, or rather, both of them came to the school visit for some reason, although they couldn&#8217;t settle their bloody battle with each other for some reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is Himiyama-san even here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s part of my re-entry into society. Besides, there are things I need to talk about, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san, the witch who has come back to life in the modern age, gives them a meaningful look. The principals shuddered, including Papa Tojo, who was pale and white in the face. I didn&#8217;t see anything. How nice.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, no time no body touch. Her fingertips were exquisitely stroking me. As usual, there is no room for carelessness, but there is no way for me to escape. I was left to my own devices.</p>



<p>In the midst of my writhing and groaning, it was my mother who unexpectedly came to my rescue.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ……. My son doesn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m sorry But you don&#8217;t mind, do you, Yukito? The other day, he was fondling my bre*sts like that.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Bre*sts!? Hey, Yukito, what does she mean with bre*st? You didn&#8217;t do anything right?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take off your underwear …… I should not look …… peachy …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufufu. Yukito, you are a boy afterall&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you, Yukito? Do it to me if you want to do it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Ha!? I thought I&#8217;d erased my black history!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always ready, Yukito-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this the witch trial…..&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not a witch trial, but an Ouka trial.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s going on here! It&#8217;s overcapacity! Cut it out already!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Mou, Yuki-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>Sekka-san is angry. I knew you were on my side, Sekka-san!</p>



<p>Tell Mom and Himiyama-san to get their butts kicked!</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan is mine!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s not! Since when did he belongs to Sekka? Yukito is my&#8212;-.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Beautiful sisters over there, can you shut up for a second?”</p>



<p>&#8216;Well, well. Yukito, is it okay if I show you my bre*st to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take it anymore …… it&#8217;s over ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never been a rebel, and I can&#8217;t disobey my mom.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Feeling the possibility of another fierce quarrel between the two sisters, they are frightened to death.</p>



<p>I was not even able to pet her, but Himiyama-san was hugging me.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not right, Himiyama-san! My appeal was not going to reach them at all, but both Mom and Sekka-san had blue streaks on their foreheads.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, quickly get away from that perverted woman!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Yuki-chan, you&#8217;re going to rendezvous with me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you saying to my child, Sekka!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan is my child, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s even more ridiculous?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t find it strange, you know? Who do you like, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>The forbidden question is released. It was as sharp as a great magic to seal the Demon King in exchange for my life. What will happen to me if I answer that question? I have to go to church. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, it&#8217;s me, isn&#8217;t it? Because I&#8217;m your mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think you can say that kind of dialogue? Of course Yuki-chan likes me the best!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you do everything you want to do, Yukito-kun ♡ uuhuhuhuhu.&#8221;</p>



<p>What is this situation? What is this chaos?!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling with this for a long time now.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of trouble in the past, but today may be the ultimate in that. Various women have been pestering me since this morning.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always thought I had bad luck with women, but this was the day I realized that even if I had good luck, it would still be a problem.</p>



<p>Everything had started from the negative. Now, it&#8217;s just zero.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My relationship with the girls will probably start from here.</p>



<p>But still.</p>



<p>Haa, why am I like this at all?</p>



<p>&#8220;So, this is the sign of bad luck with women&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I am Yukito Kokonoe, a man who has extreme bad luck with women.</p>



<p>My love life ……. may be about to begin. Perhaps.</p>
