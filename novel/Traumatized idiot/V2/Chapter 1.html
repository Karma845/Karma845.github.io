<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 1: One Step From Being Too Late</h1>  

<p>Is this what I mean when I say I&#8217;m stunned? Even if my mentality boasts a Mohs hardness of 10 and is as strong as the world&#8217;s hardest substance, Japanese ice cream, I can still be shocked.</p>



<p>If anything, my knees are laughing too. Knees &#8220;Kyahahahahahahaha&#8221;.</p>



<p>A perfect match pump that sets itself on fire and defeats itself.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s me, the fire-suited bandit, Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>In order to save my childhood friend, Hinagi Suzurikawa, I have been spreading bad publicity by my own making, and as a result, I am now the most hated person in the school. I had hoped that this would lead me to a quiet and peaceful life in the shadows, but I have been sorely misguided.</p>



<p>My goal is to be the kind of atmospheric presence that leaves a group of people who have been invited to a play date but can&#8217;t join in the conversation, realizing that they don&#8217;t need me and quietly leaving the place behind.</p>



<p>But this was also due to my lack of precision. If the rumors are to be believed, Hinagi and her sister, who should have been avoiding me, are rather shrinking their distance from me after the commotion.</p>



<p>I suggested to Hinagi to keep her distance from me, but she firmly refused.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Sato and Miyahara have also been visiting my class frequently.</p>



<p>Under these circumstances, it is difficult to make a bad reputation persuasive. The effect was halved. In the end, it was only my fault for not being thorough enough.</p>



<p>My ambition to be ostracized by the entire school was crushed. The next move is necessary.</p>



<p>However, when I think about it, it may be natural. No matter how much of a scum I am and how many bad things I do, it doesn&#8217;t matter to those who are not directly involved with me.</p>



<p>After all, I am a stranger. I don&#8217;t have the time or the value to devote all that effort to someone who doesn&#8217;t care about me.</p>



<p>So, my days are pretty much the same, but it seems that people around me are dissatisfied with the current situation. In particular, the people around me, led by Sato and the others involved in the incident, are spreading a lot of beautiful stories about how they are going to wipe away the stigma. A minstrel living in 2022?</p>



<p>I am honestly annoyed by the fact that they are the opposite of what I am trying to achieve, but unfortunately, I can&#8217;t do anything tactless to interfere with their pure good intentions, so I have no choice but to leave it at that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you take a handkerchief?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>And today, I&#8217;m back to going to school with my sister, Yuuri, holding each other&#8217; s hands in a chain.</p>



<p>Since it was revealed that I was the culprit behind the firestorm, the level of overprotection has been growing stronger by the day. I guess she wants to prove that the rumors are true by daring to show it to everyone around her.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have a lunch box, too, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>What can I say, I thought that was a disaster. She was the most furious I&#8217;ve ever seen her. I think she was so angry that she was promoted to cutthroat heavenly messenger.<br>And she hates Hinagi as if she were a snake and a scorpion. All I am allowed to do is to desperately beg for forgiveness.</p>



<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the tension?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;H i g h.&#8221; (Written in English)</p>



<p>I mustn&#8217;t let the mood get any worse. No matter what is said, I repeat my reply without any hesitation. Never make excuses or argue. Because I&#8217;m scared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you like me?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you like about me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lungs.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Embryo.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fm-fmmm. Do you really want me so bad?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All right. Give me a little time to make up my mind. I&#8217;ll get back to you by nightfall.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Hmm? Wait, wait, what are you talking about?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>While I was responding to the question live, I was in the midst of a catastrophe.</p>



<p>What do you mean? Hey, what do you mean!</p>



<p>&#8220;Sis will do her best&#8221;</p>



<p>Her meaningful smile is mysterious and beautiful, isn&#8217;t it? But this is not the time to be saying things like that!</p>



<p>The entrance. My hand that was chained up is released and my sister heads to her classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t do that! It&#8217;s for your own good, for your own gooooooooooooood!&#8221;</p>



<p>The red string that bound our pinky fingers is removed. It was attached by my furious sister, who grabbed me by the chest and said, &#8220;If you want to insulate yourself so badly with me, I&#8217;ll insulate you with it&#8221;. It is very thick and hard to be called a string. It was the familiar red and blue one used in the scene of dismantling a bomb. Not the red string of fate, but the red VVF cable of destiny.</p>



<p>The insulation is very different, but it is surprisingly difficult to peel off the sheath without damaging the core wire inside. I heard that the cable was chosen because it looked sturdy, but I wonder if that&#8217;s the problem.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Yukito Kokonoe! It seems that you and your Sister are getting along as well as ever!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I was in a hurry to chase after my sister as she was leaving, but I was stopped by a hot-blooded senpai.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, I need to talk to you about something, do you mind?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, come on&#8221;</p>



<p>I was dragged to the classroom of the third grade. Is there no peace for me in this school?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with you, Yukito? You&#8217;re on the edge of your seat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been preaching to the naive third graders.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man who is obliged to install solar panels on his face was eco-friendly today.</p>



<p>&#8220;What have you been up to all morning……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;After that, I&#8217;ve been pleading with the second graders who don&#8217;t have any common sense, but I&#8217;m worried they&#8217;re not getting the message.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man was in a strangely good mood, but there was a hint of uneasiness in him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it storming today that Yukito is telling others what common sense is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hinagi&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry! I&#8217;m not being sarcastic. I shouldn&#8217;t have said that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I corrected my childhood friend&#8217;s misunderstanding, which clouded her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be cloudy and sunny today. It&#8217;s supposed to clear up this afternoon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am talking about, Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>My childhood friend gives me a jittery, dumbfounded look, but what&#8217;s wrong?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s the inter-high school tournament soon. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You too, you fresh and handsome guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The same sparkling, expectant eyes as those of the hot-blooded, Himura senpai.</p>



<p>But the reality is that the reality is cruel. No matter what I do, nothing will come of it?</p>



<p>Even though the inter-high qualifying round is coming up at the end of next month, it&#8217;s nothing to do with the weak basketball team. Given the current situation, a first-round loss is a certainty.</p>



<p>Normally, the tournaments at this time of the year would be of little concern to first-year students, but sadly, the basketball team is so small that even first-year students can easily become regulars.</p>



<p>The team is so busy just assisting the senior to make his confession come true.</p>



<p>The reason I resumed playing basketball in the first place was just my selfish desire to respond to Hinagi and Shiori&#8217;s determination. I wanted to change. I knew I had to change.</p>



<p>The feelings I had back then have long since disappeared. Now, I cannot even remember how I felt. Only that fact remains.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I must have been happy when she told me she loved me. I wanted to love someone again. I chose this path because I wanted to regain that kind of normalcy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not interested in the competitions that hot-blooded senpai and fresh, handsome guys talk about.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like I have a goal or something I want to accomplish.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t feel any significance in striving toward the future.</p>



<p>There is a clear difference in temperature between Kouki and the others in this area. In any case, basketball is a team sport, no matter how outstanding the fresh and good-looking guy is. One person can&#8217;t do it alone, and there is not enough time for practice. Even the seniors don&#8217;t think they can win against a strong school that practices hard every day. Then what can we do?</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuku, I&#8217;ve got an idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still too straight-faced to look like you&#8217;re smiling at all, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori, who has been eager to join in the conversation since a while ago, is still not quite at the level of a manager of a men&#8217;s basketball team. I guess I have no choice but to take the initiative here again.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>After school. Today&#8217;s club activity is quite simple.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;If you take the ball away from me, it&#8217;s over. Keep going until you get it. Simple, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>The club includes not only Kouki and Iito, who are in the same grade, but also the hot-blooded Senpai.</p>



<p>The basketball club, by the way, is a weak and small club, secretly working in a corner of the gymnasium.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that all there is to it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it, Mihou, don&#8217;t say unnecessary things!&#8221;</p>



<p>While the hot-blooded Senpai and the fresh and good-looking guy are full of enthusiasm, there is also a not-so-hot group.</p>



<p>Even just this small number of people. I don&#8217;t like the difference in temperature.</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be helped. In order to motivate everyone, I&#8217;m going to ask them to cooperate with me.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I lose the ball, Shiori will do her best to do the Kitsune dance.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What did you say, Yuki?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori, the manager who had been abruptly dropped, looked astonished and astonished.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Trust me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-okay…..I mean it is still weird! Why would you make promises on your own?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it would motivate everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>The men were somehow excited.</p>



<p>As one would expect from Shiori-chan. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the manager effect.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t dance if you ask me so suddenly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of time from now on. I want to see it, too. Konkon.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned around to look at Shiori, who was eagerly checking her smartphone.</p>


<p><strong>[Shiori PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with the Inter-High? I&#8217;m going to beat that spoiled guts back into shape.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Nyahummm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an underclassman! Don&#8217;t you have a trick up your sleeve or something!?&#8221;</p>



<p>The members of the men&#8217;s basketball team were made to understand by Yuki. The overwhelming difference in ability.</p>



<p>I love Yuki&#8217;s dynamic performance on the court. Ever since then. Now more than ever.</p>



<p>I just want to keep my eyes on this moment so that I don&#8217;t miss it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;As you can see, it is very easy to break down an opponent who is physically superior to you by lifting your center of gravity.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;One more time, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuki easily rolls over the head of the basketball team, Himura senpai, and Mihou-kun rushes in with great vigor. The game is a breathless, fast-paced battle of offense and defense. But the game is won in an instant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mihou-kun, like the others, was rolled over, and the dead and dying were appearing in a row.</p>



<p>As if to prove the difference in ability, Yuki was the only one standing. It was nothing strange. Because I know him. I know that he has been working that hard and stoically.</p>



<p>After five or ten minutes of such development, the students of other club activities in the gymnasium stopped their hands and looked at the strange scene from a distance.</p>



<p>&#8220;……So cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>The words spontaneously spilled out of my mouth. It&#8217;s really too late.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p></p>



<p>I wanted to see him like this, I knew it would be annoying, I had no right to, but I followed him here.</p>



<p>This is a dream sequence, so to speak. A lost time allowed by a stroke of luck.</p>



<p>My throat trembles as if driven by an inner impulse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hang in there, everybody!&#8221;</p>



<p>It is not important to get the ball away from Yuki here and now. I am sure that everyone understands that. This is a test that has been given to them in an easy-to-understand way.</p>



<p>This is the time to decide how to accept this result and what to do from now on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, let&#8217;s support those pathetic people together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yes&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

<p>&#8220;Zaako♥ Zaako♥&#8221; [TL: A word used to describe a person of low rank or one who is insignificant.]</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not cheering, that&#8217;s agitating them!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come one, you too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zaako! Zaako! I-I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m allowed to say this……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;More naughty!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zaako♥ Zaako♥&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in trouble.……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yuki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I think you&#8217;re too well-developed to be naughty.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty clear sexual harassment!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her movements are very agile and delicate, even though she says joking things with her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa haa. Not…..yet. It&#8217;s not over, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>Dizzy, but not giving up, Mihou-kun stood up to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kouki, there&#8217;s not that much difference between you and me. If it&#8217;s simple physical ability, you&#8217;re better than me. You should start learning how to manipulate your body again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… physical manipulation?&#8221;</p>



<p>He never abandons us and cannot hide his kindness.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how you got to the inter-high school? That&#8217;s totally ridiculous. Wait a minute. What does chanchara mean? Let&#8217;s look it up.&#8221;</p>



<p>While dribbling, he was playing with his phone with one hand. It was too blatantly provocative. Still, no one can take the ball away from Yuki.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He is helplessly weak at the moment, but I have a certain premonition.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll get stronger from now on&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered to no one in particular. The frustrated looks on the faces of those who had fallen down, unable to do anything about it.</p>



<p>Everyone was being played and told what to do. Their pride must be in tatters.</p>



<p>In spite of their exhaustion, they still have a fighting spirit in their eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;….As I thought, I love him.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had once taken away his dream. Even though I know it&#8217;s a sinful wish.</p>



<p>The longing I held burns me even more strongly.</p>



<p>In this way, he changes the people around him with his actions. He makes people take him seriously.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But that&#8217;s why I think. Yuki taught me something a long time ago.</p>



<p>He devoted himself to basketball in order to get over his childhood crush, Hinagi Suzurikawa-san. His feelings for her were so big. The strength he gained at the cost of his emotions. His passion was so strong that it drove everyone around him to the heights of domination. The reality of the situation is keenly felt.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-I don&#8217;t want to lose.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wipe the tears from the corners of my eyes and run up to him.</p>



<p>For exactly thirty minutes. Yuki kept the ball in play.</p>



<p>I want to be strong like this too, I thought to myself.</p>


<p><strong>[Kouki Mihou PoV]</strong></p>


<p>I enter a fast food restaurant and quickly place my order when I find the person I am looking for.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ou, Kouki, you look well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while. Senpai also seems to be doing well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;These days, I can&#8217;t eat a large size of fries by myself anymore. I realize I&#8217;m not getting any younger. Come on, you should eat too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are only one year older than me, what are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>My face naturally breaks into tears at the sight of the nostalgic figure. He is one year older than me and was a member of the same basketball team in junior high school.</p>



<p>After entering high school, he is still a regular on the basketball team at a strong school.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;How are you doing lately?&#8221;</p>



<p>A vague question. I was enjoying these conversations and had so much to talk about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every day, We break our noses&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You do? Haa, there are some pretty amazing guys out there.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was screaming with muscle pain all over my body after he beat me. However, the pain is so pleasant that it&#8217;s unbearable. It was a craving that had long since been forgotten, a craving that was welling up inside of me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I found that guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>A common understanding between us. For us, there is only one &#8220;that guy&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;That guy? …… I see, that guy. You finally found the one we&#8217;ve been chasing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Daigo Senpai leans forward. I remember the unforgettable summer when I cried in frustration with my seniors.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>His dream was dashed and he was blocked by a guy who was a sophomore at the time, just like me.</p>



<p>A lover. I was convinced that it was an odd thing to say. After losing to him, we may have fallen in yearning for him. We had a longing for him.</p>



<p>We swore that we would defeat him and avenge our seniors, but we never got that chance.</p>



<p>&#8220;At that time he broke his arm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Broken arm huh……. I guess it can&#8217;t be helped&#8221;</p>



<p>Third year summer. The older students who had come to cheer us on must have been disappointed.</p>



<p>We made it to the nationals, but in the midst of the jubilation, the presence of that guy lingered in our minds, smoldering forever and ever. The regret of that summer.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that I resented him. On the contrary. Every day was just fun.</p>



<p>I wanted to go to the nationals. That was my goal, but above all, I was absorbed in the fact that there was an opponent I wanted to win against and a wall I had to overcome. I spent time with the seniors who practiced hard for that. The time I spent after the seniors graduated and I was in a position to lead the team.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It was fulfilling. It was a glorious time of my youth. It may sound clichéd and adolescent if I put it into words. But that&#8217;s what youth is all about, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>I could only be grateful to him for giving me that time. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t allow it.</p>



<p>The environment he is in now. He is being unfairly degraded.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to keep playing basketball? This is something to look forward to. Oh yeah, I see you&#8217;re now at the same school as him. I&#8217;ll have to talk to my advisor and see if we can set up a practice game.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not good enough to play with Senpai yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh. &#8220;yet&#8221; means that you are planning to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem too interested in the match, though. I&#8217;ll go even if I have to pull him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of a guy is he, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>After digging deeper into his personality, I couldn&#8217;t find a good description of him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He is always surrounded by people, even though his words, attitude, and actions reject others. I am aware that I am one of them.</p>



<p>If I think about why this is, perhaps it is because no matter how much he rejects others, there is no emotional hatred in his rejection.</p>



<p>People are sensitive to the subtleties of emotion. They would never approach a person they dislike without a reason. But he doesn&#8217;t hate anyone. It is as if no such feelings exist in the first place. That&#8217;s why I want to get close to him. I want to touch him.</p>



<p>Otherwise, there is no way that a wary Shakado would be attracted to him.</p>



<p>And once you touch him, you want to stay by his side.</p>



<p>The container must be huge. Tremendously, so much so that it can take it all in.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s like a guy who can&#8217;t be left alone because he&#8217;s so contrary to everything else.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s like a guy who can&#8217;t be left alone because everything is against him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What the hell? But, well, I&#8217;m starting to look forward to it too. Then I&#8217;ll be waiting for you, Kouki.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t make you wait that long.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You look excited like a schoolboy, you&#8217;re a little different too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? I don&#8217;t recognize it myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were more abrasive in junior high.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a lot more open-minded now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, oi, stop with the male tsundere, it&#8217;s not cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hey, Yukito. I wonder what I look like now. You may not be into it, but I want to chase my dream again. This time with you, in a high school environment. I finally got to meet you. I&#8217;d be happy to hang out with you for a while.</p>



<p>I think about the next three years. I am sure there will be many happy days ahead.</p>



<p>After that, I continued to enjoy a moment of rest with Daigo Senpai, reporting on recent events and chatting about trivial matters.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>



<p><strong>[Shiori PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not weird, right ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>I check in the hand mirror and tie my hair up lightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get carried away, Shiori Kamishiro!&#8221;</p>



<p>I scolded myself, and to calm my racing heart, I pulled out my wristwatch from my baggage.</p>



<p>The glass was cracked and the bezel was peeling paint. No hands move anymore.</p>



<p>It had long since lost its function as a watch. It was a gift from my grandfather to commemorate the day I became a junior high school student. I broke it within three years.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t take good care of it. I murmured in my heart and gently stroked it. I kept it for a long time without throwing it away. I couldn&#8217;t throw it away.</p>



<p>When I fell from on the bridge, Yuki protected me. I wasn&#8217;t hurt, but I must have hit the ground hard, and it was broken by the impact.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The time engraved on it is from that moment. The time when I foolishly took everything from Yuki.</p>



<p>That is why I carry it with me always. It is a reminder. To remember what I did.</p>



<p>Waiting for Yuki after club activities. I was so happy during this time. It was scary because I was happy.</p>



<p>Afraid that I would lose him again. I was afraid that I would make a mistake again.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no wonder he hates me. It didn&#8217;t matter if he hated me. I was not surprised that I was rejected and condemned, that he didn&#8217;t even want to look at me.</p>



<p>I had done that much.</p>



<p>Yuki is so kind, kinder than anyone else, and he still gives me happy times like this. And yet, I can&#8217;t allow anyone to speak ill of Yuki!</p>



<p>Many people do not think well of Yuki. This is especially evident in the riot. It&#8217;s not that it has developed into violence or bullying. It&#8217;s just that somehow, I&#8217;ve felt that kind of atmosphere more and more.</p>



<p>What I couldn&#8217;t tolerate was people saying bad things about Yuki while claiming to be concerned about me. I was struggling to hold back the urge to lash out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>……I guess that&#8217;s what they say about the outcasts. I can&#8217;t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. There is no hammer that can strike Yuki. If you do that, you will only get yourself torn to pieces.</p>



<p>Strong resentment. A black urge wells up in my chest. Because of Yuki&#8217;s help, no one else was hurt, not Suzurikawa-san, not Sato-san, not Miyahara-kun, nor anyone else.</p>



<p>Everyone is grateful to Yuki. And yet, people speak ill of him without knowing anything about him.</p>



<p>This is painful, infuriating, and unforgivable. If there is anything I can do, I will do something about this situation.</p>



<p>The only thing I can do is to repay his kindness so that Yuki will never be alone, so that he can have a good time at school.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, missed what? What&#8217;s broken?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turn around in a panic at the sound of Yuki&#8217;s voice. I hesitate, trying to hide my impatience.</p>



<p>I love you, I want to fix things up. I love you, I try to make myself look good. I love you, I want you to look at me. I love you, I don&#8217;t want to make you worry. I love you, so I deceived you, I love you, so I lied to you.</p>



<p>A series of small lies accumulated like that lead to an irreversible situation someday.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I decided that I will never lie to Yuki again, remember!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll tell Yuki about this blur in my chest and about the watch. He is always kind, and he always listens to me, no matter how ridiculous my story is. He will give me answers if I need them, hints if I&#8217;m missing something, and think with me if I don&#8217;t understand something. That&#8217;s why…</p>



<p>&#8220;This watch was broken that day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Without pretending to be someone I am not, I face him as I am. That is the answer for me as a person who has grown up.</p>


<p><strong>[Shiori PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;…..I see. It looks like it would be difficult to repair it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t fix it. It&#8217;s fine as it is. I musn&#8217;t forget&#8221;</p>



<p>The watch in Shiori&#8217;s hand was familiar. I remember she always wore it when we were in junior high school. I hadn&#8217;t seen it since we met again in high school, but I had no idea it was broken. It seemed it had also broken when she fell on the bridge. I held on to it as quickly as I could and felt relieved that I had managed to keep it from hurting her, but I guess I couldn&#8217;t even protect the watch.</p>



<p>The watch was a gift from her grandfather, and it was a very important one. I&#8217;m sorry.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I wish I had done better. …… I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way! Yuki didn&#8217;t do anything wrong!&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder if the accident was traumatic for Shiori, and no matter how many times I say I don&#8217;t care, it&#8217;s probably not something that would easily convince her.</p>



<p>But she can&#8217;t move on if she keeps worrying about it. She has remained stagnant at the time indicated by the static clock. Even Shiori has the right to enter high school and enjoy the time of her glorious youth. The limited time of only three years, which is only now.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Then I&#8217;ll buy you a watch as a gift.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Eh? Stop it, Yuki. You don&#8217;t have to give me such an expensive one!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait. The money is not a problem. I&#8217;m having trouble using it. Actually…&#8221;</p>



<p>I came up with an ingenious idea. When I was hospitalized with a broken bone, Shiori&#8217;s parents apologized to me and almost gave me a substantial amount of money for my hospitalization as well as a consolation payment. I was not willing to accept the money, so I declined, but they were not satisfied with that, so I ended up receiving a little extra in the form of hospitalization charges on top of the hospital fee.</p>



<p>I had neglected to do so, but I was sure Shiori&#8217;s parents would be happy if I used it for their daughter. If it would help her to move forward, there was no better use for the money. I was happy to explain this, but Shiori was not convinced.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever, ever do that! That money is for Yuki&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to spend it on you. Don&#8217;t complain about how it&#8217;s being used.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be happy about that. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I was proud of myself for thinking it was a good idea, but by the looks of things, it was unlikely she would accept it.</p>



<p>I think about this when I see Shiori&#8217;s anxious look on her face. Once a relationship is broken, it can never be restored. She could not remain the same, and she had to change. It was me who made her do it.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, all I can do is to make her feel a little better.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll make you a watch. Not a pre-made one, but a unique watch for you.</p>



<p>&#8220;Make ……? Yuki……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to make the parts by hand from scratch, but that&#8217;s going to take a long time and be difficult, so that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll have to work on. Better hurry. DIY&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hey, hey Yuki! I&#8217;m not that&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>Pushing Shiori&#8217;s back, who resisted, I made her walk.</p>



<p>Once again, so that she can smile carefree.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>It is early in the morning for a watchmaker. Lies, I&#8217;m just a high school studenttttttt! I teased.</p>



<p>The classroom is quiet in the early morning. For the past few days, I arrive at school about 30 minutes early and get to work.</p>



<p>Tools such as precision screwdrivers, tweezers, and three-point openers are scattered on the desk. The tool set was surprisingly inexpensive. The set can be used for repairs and battery replacement, so it&#8217;s good to have.</p>



<p>&#8220;You look sleepy. You don&#8217;t have to go out of your way to keep me company, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki is here early, and I can&#8217;t just ignore you. You know, why did you decide to assemble it at school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What if my s-s-s-sister finds out while I&#8217;m working on it at home!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My hands trembled with fear. If she finds out, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be in a bad mood. (Reference example)</p>



<p>[Ha? Why don&#8217;t you have one for me? Are you mocking me?]</p>



<p>[I am not mocking you…….]</p>



<p>[Why aren&#8217;t you mocking?]</p>



<p>[What are you talking about……]</p>



<p>[Hmm.]</p>



<p>[…………]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m gonna put honey on it.]</p>



<p>[Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This is too scary. …… If anything, I feel like she&#8217;s been in my room more often than me lately. She&#8217;s definitely going to find out. It&#8217;s impossible to fool around.</p>



<p>Anyway, it took me a long time to get all this together after I decided to make it on my own. I apologize for making her wait so long. I hope this can be forgiven because I&#8217;m a bit of an obsessive person.</p>



<p>I chose each part according to Shiori&#8217;s preferences, but I also decided that it would be boring to make compromises, so I decided on detailed specifications and placed an order, so the cost was reasonable.</p>



<p>I was lucky that I had a large budget for this project. Secretly, it was close to six figures.</p>



<p>Shiori&#8217;s birthday is in July. I made a part of the dial with pieces of ruby and sphane, her birthstone. What makes it unique is that, at Shiori&#8217;s request, the time of the accident is embedded as an in-dial, although it has no actual function like a chronograph.</p>



<p>I then decided to transplant some parts from a broken wristwatch.</p>



<p>Considering the original purpose of the project, I was worried that Shiori would feel gloomy every time she looked at the watch, but she was adamant and would not budge.</p>



<p>Since this was my first attempt, I did not equip the watch with any complicated functions. It simply displays the time. Even so, it became a special wristwatch, the only one of its kind in the world.</p>



<p>The hour, minute, and second hands were stacked so that they were parallel to each other. This process was very difficult. After carefully blowing to prevent dust and dirt from entering the case, the sapphire glass case is attached and the back cover is fitted. After all this, all that was left was to put on the belt.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s working, Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I did better than I thought I would. Congratulations.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fue, finally, a weight was lifted from my shoulders. If I fail in this, I&#8217;ll be in deep trouble. I took a deep breath and straightened my back. I was tired because I had been concentrating so hard, but it was a pleasant kind of fatigue.</p>



<p>When I turned to Shiori, she was sobbing. What the hell is going on?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Is there something you don&#8217;t like about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No! I can&#8217;t return anything to Yuki even though you&#8217;ve been so kind to me…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking for anything in return.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But!&#8221;</p>



<p>The ponytail was also crying with sadness. Pon pon, I pat her head.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, stop blaming yourself already. You should move on with your time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you……. I will treasure it forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, don&#8217;t make the mistake of valuing things. You cannot replace or repair it. If you hurt yourself, you may have a scar that will never heal, or you may be left with a disability. You are not a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;Yes&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank God you&#8217;re not hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh……gu…… sorry, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>In a classroom of just the two of us, she cried like a little girl.</p>



<p>She was crying like this when I was injured.</p>



<p>But I wanted to think that the tears she is shedding now are different from the tears she shed that day.</p>


<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up! Don&#8217;t give up, hot-blooded senpai! Is that good enough for you? Didn&#8217;t I say you&#8217;d confess to her? You said you wanted to show her your good side, didn&#8217;t you? Are you lying? Did you have such half-hearted feelings!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa…… haa…… Kokonoe, go easy on me a little……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop making excuses! You&#8217;re going to tell her, right? What the hell did you come all this way for? Imagine that! You can&#8217;t make her like you by making you look so pathetic! Are you sure you want to do this? Another guy is going to take her away from you. Do you want to see Takamiya in another man&#8217;s arms?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suzuneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Uooooooooooooooooooooo!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, give it your all right from the start! Nobody&#8217;s ever died from trying!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you, Suzune!&#8221;</p>



<p>Today, I, Yukito Kokonoe, the instructor of the basketball club, continue my hard work.</p>



<p>Physical fitness is the most important thing in basketball. In order to win, one must have the skill, but also the physical strength to be able to move at full capacity for a total of 50 minutes, including the 40 minutes of the four periods and half time.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>To be able to handle that amount of exercise, the team needed to start with a basic fitness program such as running, but the Senpais were soft.</p>



<p>There was no way we could win with them. But isn&#8217;t it strange that first-year students are shoving third-year students around?</p>



<p>What the hell is going on in this club? The Copernicus in me is turning.</p>



<p>&#8220;The only one who seems to be okay is Kouki. It looks like Ito won&#8217;t make it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are they already throwing the towel in the ring?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, after 5 laps let&#8217;s have a match.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, don&#8217;t be so casual about it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuahahaha&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So stop laughing with a straight face, you&#8217;re scaring me!?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>I run out of the building as if I were flying ahead of the others. The basketball team is now running around the perimeter of the school building. It&#8217;s part of the physical fitness menu, but I&#8217;m the one who decides what the basketball team practices. It was unanimous. I don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>Originally, the school did not put much effort into the weak basketball team, and the advisor, Andou-sensei, was not a specialist in the field, so the whole thing was thrown to me.</p>



<p>I was in a position of power.</p>



<p><strong>[Shiori PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Toshiro, you idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuki was stirring up the seniors to get them excited. Next to me, Suzune Takamiya, a senior who was the love of his life, was cheering for him with a red face. She seemed to have come to observe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come now, Toshiro! Don&#8217;t be embarrassed to lose to a first-year student!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mouth naturally broke into a smile. It was unimaginable just a short time ago.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Everything was moving in a slightly better direction, or so I thought.</p>



<p>That is why I have a past that I want to clear up.</p>



<p>Another stain that remained in my chest.</p>



<p>The environment surrounding Yuki is harsh. The price he paid for sacrificing himself to protect me was too great.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I, us. I can&#8217;t just be saved by him forever.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to face …… too.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>[Shiori PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming, Suzurikawa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, something wrong? It&#8217;s about Yukito, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>The next day. I called Suzurikawa-san into an empty classroom.</p>



<p>It was a very important story for me, but it was a story that Suzurikawa-san had never heard before, and by telling her, I was sure I would cause her distress again. Even so, I wanted to tell her.</p>



<p>This is the first time we have had a serious conversation together like this.</p>



<p>We are rivals ……, or rather, we probably don&#8217;t like each other very much.</p>



<p>But that didn&#8217;t matter now. I handed the box in my hand to Suzurikawa-san</p>



<p>Inside was a beautiful amber brooch. It was my treasure, and I had kept it with great care. But I have never worn it. Even though I wanted to put it on, my emotions would not allow me to do so.</p>



<p>I gently patted the watch. This was also because Yuki had pushed me to do so.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is beautiful. But what about this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki gave me this.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;……I see. Are you bragging about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No! This was actually supposed to be yours.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzurikawa-san tilts her head in doubt. Of course she would.</p>



<p>She does not know what this is. But the truth is that she is the owner of this brooch. I have it. I told Yuki I wanted it.</p>



<p>So he gave it to me. But I&#8217;m not the real owner.</p>



<p>This was two years ago. When Yuki confessed her feelings to Suzurikawa-san, he was supposed to give it to her.</p>



<p><strong>[Hinagi PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;This is ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The brooch given to me by Kamishiro. I never thought there was anything left.</p>



<p>I heard from Ouka-san, Yukito&#8217;s mother. She said that after his confession, he threw everything away. Memories, feelings, thoughts. He got rid of everything related to me.</p>



<p>I remember breaking down in tears when I heard that. I was so stupid that I was in a state of excitement. I thought that if I left Senpai, we would be together soon. If I had pursued him then, even forcefully, none of this would have happened. My fate after that would have been different. In the end, it was heaven&#8217;s punishment.</p>



<p>I was just a fool and got what I deserved. When I realized it, it was too late and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>



<p>I recall two years ago with loathing. I remember that day and what Hiori said to me.</p>



<p>&#8211;I would never have made Onii-chan sad.</p>



<p>Yes, she is innocent and honest, and unlike me, she would never make the wrong choice.</p>



<p>Hiori can make him happy. Hiori can do it.</p>



<p>They would be the ideal couple who would be blessed by everyone.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hiori was longing for it. No, it is the same for me. I know that there is indeed such a beautiful dream story that everyone envies, in which two young children who have been in love with each other since childhood are united.</p>



<p>When Hiori found out that I was going out with Senpai, we got into a fight.</p>



<p>Rumors started circulating that we had sex, and Hiori got mad at me for repeating incoherent and unintelligible excuses, and we didn&#8217;t speak to each other for a week.</p>



<p>My mom and dad also took me apart and asked me if I was on birth control.</p>



<p>I was miserable. I wanted to disappear right now.</p>



<p>My mom and dad know that I love Yukito. He used to come over to our house a lot. These days, he doesn&#8217;t come to our house much anymore, but Mom and Dad love him.</p>



<p>He was like family, and I had no doubt that we would be together.</p>



<p>I had a big fight with Hiori until recently. Since then, Hiori has become harsh towards me. When I first heard about her feelings for him, I was astonished.</p>



<p>She had been supporting me by keeping her first love to herself, but I had trampled on her feelings. I had no say in the matter, and I had no right to say so, even though my sister put my love before her own.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Even so, Hiori made a move to help me. She is a sister who is too good for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kamishiro-san, I&#8217;m not qualified to have it. If you received it, it&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori Kamishiro. When she called me up, I wondered what kind of story she was going to tell me, but the content was unexpected. The brooch in her hand. Was it the one that Yukito was going to give to me at that time?</p>



<p>But I was the one who rejected him. I had no right to receive it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that all right with you, Suzurikawa-san? Yuki wanted you to have this…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I can&#8217;t take it from you, I rejected him once. Besides, he gave it to you because he thought you deserved it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault that I didn&#8217;t get it. But that is why I will never make a mistake again. I will not lie about my feelings. I will make Yukito turn his head.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was determination. For nearly two years, I had been walking in the dark, unable to see the way out. I wandered around in a tunnel, in a hell with no way out. But I kept walking because there was something I could not give up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I could not compromise even with Hiori. It was because there were words I wanted to tell him again.</p>



<p>Kamishiro-san&#8217;s eyes widened. Perhaps she could sense my feelings as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t lose either!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are my rival.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, I think I have too many rivals. You know, Suzurikawa-san, would you be my friend if you like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay with that? I&#8217;m not going to give up on Yukito&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about Yuki, I want to be friends with Suzurikawa-san!&#8221;</p>



<p>The friendly and heavenly smile. The original Kamishiro&#8217;s charm is overflowing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the way she was when she first entered the school. The reason for this is that the presence of Yukito is so significant to her that it clouds her vision.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Fine by me. From now on, let&#8217;s fight fair and square as rivals in love.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>As a friend. If Yukito chooses her, will I be able to honestly congratulate her?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think so. My priority would be none other than Yukito. That&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;ve lived my life from that day. But it&#8217;s the same for Kamishiro-san.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I have neglected the idea of friendship since then.</p>



<p>I had no time to worry about such things. I was so absorbed in my life that I didn&#8217;t look around me.</p>



<p>Because there wasn&#8217;t a single day that I enjoyed. But maybe now I need to broaden my horizons just a little bit more. So that I don&#8217;t lose him again.</p>



<p>I grasped the hand that Kamishiro-san held out to me.</p>



<p>I see. For the first time since that day, I have a friend.</p>

<p>Sunday. A little earlier than the appointed time, Sakurai and the others had gathered in front of the station.</p>



<p>The members of the group were all different, and there was a wide range of faces, both male and female.</p>



<p>In Class B, the school caste had collapsed early on, and the group consciousness had become diluted. Of course, it was because of that man.</p>



<p>Many of them were taken care of in the test. For example, Akanuma and the others in the Otaku group became good friends while Yukito was working on the 1/8 Yuuri-san figure (Archangel Ver 6 wings), a vessel of faith, as a gift to his sister in return for her help with past questions.</p>



<p>All the others are involved in some way, large or small.</p>



<p>On the surface, it was the launch of a test, but the original purpose was something else.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Let&#8217;s cheer up Yukito Kokonoe&#8221; meeting. The initiators were Sakurai and Mihou, but the fact that so many of their classmates had gathered showed the popularity of the Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Although he seems to be completely unconcerned about it, the environment in which he is currently placed is by no means a good one. Deep down inside, he must be hurting.</p>



<p>Sakurai and the others found out what was going on when Hinagi Suzurikawa, revealed it to them. What were they trying to protect and why? It was too painful a choice.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>They also understood that it was because they had easily relied on Yukito Kokonoe. They did nothing, they forced him to solve the problem, and he was left to bear the consequences alone. He did not hold a grudge against anyone, nor blame anyone.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe protected many, but he did not save himself. He sacrificed himself alone.</p>



<p>It was them who made him do so. They pushed him into a corner. Feeling unbearably frustrated by that.</p>



<p>This opportunity was a godsend for everyone who shared these feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Miki-chan, are your bangs okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, they&#8217;re cute and adorable. I&#8217;m starting to get nervous too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with this subtle weirdness in the air ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because ……you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mihou and Takahashi with a bitter smile. Ito is also there. Since Suzurikawa and Kamishiro are also present, they form a very conspicuous and glamorous group, but there is a sense of tension in the air.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Despite expectations, the air was tense. It is no wonder. Today, Yukito Kokonoe had decided to take the invitation and go out together with them. That was a big deal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-chan, is he really coming? I can&#8217;t believe it, or rather, I can&#8217;t really feel it, but how is Kokonoe-chan normally?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you ask me that,…… I think Yuki is being normal…..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the same as normal, does that mean we&#8217;re going to make it out of here alive today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Kokonoe-kun a natural disaster or something?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man who keeps causing disturbances in the ordinary life, Yukito Kokonoe, is now the most famous student in the school. In both good and bad ways. Even when it comes to playing together, one never knows what will happen.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder what kind of fashion he wears?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he&#8217;s wearing camouflage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;On the other hand, is there any chance he&#8217;ll be extremely fashionable?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I guess so. But we can&#8217;t rule out the possibility that he wears strange T-shirts or something like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri-san is beautiful and looks like she has good taste……&#8221;</p>



<p>The group was still waiting and waiting, when suddenly, Mihou&#8217;s phone rang.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Yukito&#8211;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>The chatter stopped immediately. Everyone was listening.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa!? What are you saying…….Aah. And. Are you okay with that? Are you injured? Police!? Are you serious… And? ”</p>



<p>&#8220;All I hear are disturbing words…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What did you do, Kokonoe-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fue……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Mihou hangs up the phone. He had a mysterious look on his face. Mihou pondered for a moment what to tell them, but in the end he decided to tell them straight away.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but Yukito can&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He was hit by a college student who was riding a bicycle with headphones on and a phone in one hand. The police are there and they are checking the scene.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Yuki going to be okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kamishiro rushed to the scene. Mihou reassured the worried group.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, he&#8217;s fine. He&#8217;s not badly hurt. The police have told Yukito file a damage report, and they&#8217;re also talking to the college girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad there are no injuries…….&#8221;</p>



<p>The awkward atmosphere prevails.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Uhm, is that really the case? It&#8217;s not because he doesn&#8217;t want to play with us, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>This is something that everyone in the room has been feeling for some time now.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s as if they forced ourselves to prepare this place today. They may have cared too much. Concerns grow as to whether they have made him feel like a burden.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s too big an excuse, but whatever he does, Yukito Kokonoe is important to them. Either way, as long as the Yukito Kokonoe doesn&#8217;t show up, they can only speculate.</p>



<p>&#8220;Surely he wouldn&#8217;t be the kind of person who would lie about something like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito wouldn&#8217;t lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;While Mineda was apologizing, Mihou&#8217;s phone once again received a call from Yukito</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it this time? ……Yukito called. He wants everyone to have fun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Have fun, …… even if it&#8217;s said in this atmosphere.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is he always doing this on his days off?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not his choice. It&#8217;s just his nature.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What kind of days has he been having ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to ask, but I&#8217;m too afraid to.&#8221;</p>



<p>The air was heavy with gloom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be helped! It&#8217;s a good opportunity, so let&#8217;s switch it up and play!&#8221;</p>



<p>It is unfortunate that the main character is not with them, but there is one thing everyone has decided to do.</p>



<p>That is to never isolate him and never let him be alone.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Suzurikawa and Kamishiro had a strong feeling, a feeling akin to a sense of mission, that this time they would protect him.</p>



<p>In fact, he had no way of knowing that this was the exact opposite of what Yukito Kokonoe had in mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ll ask him about the details at school. Well then, let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hihihi …… still mysterious life ……. Hihihi. Mysterious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, Shakado, when were you here?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The group begins to walk around. Incidentally, Mineda and the others&#8217; concerns were quickly put to rest.</p>



<p>The bicycle accident involving Yukito Kokonoe was reported on the evening and night news that day, and in the newspaper the next day.</p>



<p>By the end of the week, the school was alerted of the situation.</p>
