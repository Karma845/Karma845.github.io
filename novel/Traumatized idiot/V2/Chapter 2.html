<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 2: Finding Lost Things and Everyday Life</h1>  

<p>I&#8217;m a standard shock absorber guy, and last week I had a terrible, terrible time.</p>



<p>Without fat, I would have died. No, seriously.</p>



<p>I was invited to play by a group of cheerful people, but I was run over by a cyclist and went out with a bang. I am not sure if I was lucky or unlucky, though it might have been better that I wasn&#8217;t hit by a car.</p>



<p>The police and my sister insisted that I file a damage report, considering the viciousness of the incident, but I settled out of court. The other party was half Japanese, and apparently was not familiar with Japanese common sense. She came with her parents to apologize, but after she cried and apologized so much, I felt like I had done something wrong. Fortunately, there were no injuries. I was just hoping that she would be more careful in the future.</p>



<p>After receiving some money in the form of a settlement, I decided to treat my classmates to sushi and pizza as a way of apologizing to them for turning down their invitation to join the group. I asked the school to deliver the food, but the life guidance teacher, Sanjoji, was absurdly angry with me.</p>



<p>However, she was also very concerned about my accident, so she is a kind-hearted teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>I had lunch with Artemis-senpai, who is now suspected of being the earthbound spirit of the emergency staircase, because she is always there.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, the other day, you were kicking the crap out of the other kids at club activities, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I have an idea of what she was talking about, but the question that popped into my head was the first thing that came out of my mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is Artemis-senpai, a loner, in the gymnasium?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How many times do I have to tell you that I am not a loner? Hmm? Fufu. I&#8217;m a member of the badminton club, even though I look like this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in the bandwagon club? What&#8217;s so interesting about a life that&#8217;s just riding a winning horse?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the badminton club! Don&#8217;t make me join some strange club without my permission!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The only place where yakisoba bread becomes a battleground is in the world of creative writing. I don&#8217;t really like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Why do Yankees prefer yakisoba bread, the demon possessed by carbohydrates?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Stop ignoring me! Then why did you buy yakisoba bread? Besides, I&#8217;m not lying. I&#8217;m really in the badminton club, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha!&#8221;</p>



<p>I laugh through my nose.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is that frivolous feeling? Believe me! B-e-l-i-e-v-e m-e. Even because of you, I&#8217;ve been treated like a rare character lately, like I&#8217;ll bring good luck if I&#8217;m seen, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>I took out some coins from a clasp with a deformed frog on it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… what are you doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving you some coins for my good fortune…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need it! The more you do that, the more everyone will imitate you and spread my character in the wrong direction. W-well? I&#8217;ve had more conversations in class than before, and I&#8217;ve been told that people have a different impression of me lately, and that I&#8217;m easier to talk to now that the younger students are talking to me more easily.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that why you are always here?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;No that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m here all the time! &#8220;</p>



<p>Artemis senpai was embarrassed as she tweezed her finger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rare characters …… run away from …… in a blur …… favor …… benefit from being liked …… …….&#8221;</p>



<p>Then a flash of inspiration hit me. Apparently, it wasn&#8217;t a spirit bound to the earth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Stray goddess-senpai, please give me experience points.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you a blow to the heart!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hiiiii!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kokonoe died.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Oh, Yukito. You&#8217;re dead, you wretched thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m alive.&#8221;</p>



<p>Swollen and exhaled. Then, the stray goddess-senpai&#8217;s expression clouded over.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s hard for you. I&#8217;m devastated that there are people around me who don&#8217;t even know you well enough to speak ill of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no use if I did it in such a grand manner. But that doesn&#8217;t mean any direct harm was done to them. And even if the senior students, such as the stray goddess senpai, found some of the underclassmen to be an eyesore and an unwelcome presence, they would not take the risk of getting involved.</p>



<p>&#8220;Their reaction is the correct one. Then, isn&#8217;t stray goddess senpai the odd one out, then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou! I&#8217;m still on your side, you know. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of things said about you, but you don&#8217;t speak ill of people at all. I think that&#8217;s wonderful. Somehow I feel like I&#8217;m being toyed with.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I respect you. And from my point of view, crawling around at the bottom of the human race, I only look up at those around me with envy. It&#8217;s called being a low-ranking official.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for that laughable self-deprecation, you would be a nice and different boy. …… Oh, that&#8217;s right. By the way, are your parents coming to school next time, Yukito?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Why? I haven&#8217;t done anything yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you plan to do anything yet? I think you have done enough. ……………….it&#8217;s not that, it&#8217;s time for class visits. Haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… class visit?&#8221;</p>



<p>The disturbing word that was suddenly tossed at me by stray goddess senpai replaced by experience was forever running through my mind.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>



<p>&#8220;As you may know, there will be a class visit next month. Please make sure to fill out the attendance sheet. Don&#8217;t circle your own non-participation just because you&#8217;re embarrassed.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was true what stray goddess senpai had said. And she had already nailed me to the wall.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have good news and bad news for you today.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the mouth of the very melancholy Fujishiro sensei, a line that would be one of the top three lines I&#8217;d like to say in real life, came out her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;The high-ups will be visiting soon, and you should be glad. This is the class that will be in charge of the first year. I wonder why? Do you know why, Yukito Kokonoe?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re beautiful and intelligent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>The question was easily cleared up. Good, good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s that then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to end it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s a fact that you&#8217;re a very good-looking, intelligent woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a first-class test for flattering me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s very kind of you to say. By the way, what&#8217;s the good news?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Being selected for an inspection tour.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the bad news?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Being selected for an inspection tour.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This guy got me there. Well, that&#8217;s that then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not over! Because the last test made our class the most anticipated star of the year. Thanks to that, I&#8217;ve been very busy …… We&#8217;ve had a lot of trouble recently, but this is our chance to make a comeback. Please do me a favor.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Sensei, there&#8217;s nothing we can do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s statement was the most plausible. When we are told that there will be an inspection, it does not mean that we need to do any preparation here; the only thing we can do is to be prepared.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an important job. Keep an eye out for anything the man might try to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Everyone was nodding their heads in agreement. Elizabeth and Mineda are looking at me and nodding, and the fresh handsome guy is also nodding. Shakado is grinning and secretly looking at her pet reptile on her phone, and of course I am nodding too.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Why do you have the most convincing look on your face ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>While Shiori laughed bitterly, only Hinagi seemed to be annoyed.</p>



<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s class visits going? Are they coming, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s recess time. A fresh handsome guy asks me in a troubled manner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Mom won&#8217;t be coming because she&#8217;s busy. Is it normal for her to come in the first place?&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking back, my mother has only visited my class twice in the past.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t remember any of them, because I was so nervous that I didn&#8217;t want to show her that I wasn&#8217;t happy to see her.</p>



<p>Mom&#8217;s younger sister, Sekka, came a few times as a substitute for Mom who was very busy, but in any case, as a high school student, there was little need for her to come.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. I kind of understood until middle school, but it&#8217;s high school.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Elizabeth naturally joins in the conversation. Her sunshine communicative ability is amazing.</p>



<p>It is a common practice for shady people to pretend to be secretly asleep while listening in on the conversation. Incidentally, I was late to bed because I was waiting for the mirror coating on my face to start talking to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do not forgive the fresh, good-looking man.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>“It seems like there are a lot of third-year students taking exams, but it would be embarrassing if nobody came and it was just their parents.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm. Eli-chi, I&#8217;ve heard that schools for advanced studies have a high participation rate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you just call me something that you shouldn&#8217;t say?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, crap!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mineda was looking up on her phone and Elizabeth was shaking her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I think my mom is coming.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, Akane-san is coming?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi&#8217;s comment sent a chill down my spine as she spoke to me softly. Just the other day, when Hinagi was sick, I made her angry by carrying her luggage. It was beyond awkward.</p>



<p>&#8220;She said she wanted to thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At last, thank you for all you&#8217;ve done for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I gulped and swallowed my spit. I know it was the best thing I could have done, but it is an undeniable fact that I have slandered and hurt Hinagi. From a parental standpoint, I must be someone she hates to the point of wanting to kill. The gulf between us has deepened even further.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why? Mama knows that you helped me. You saved me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The more she knows, the more I must have done something that she hates me for.&#8221;</p>



<p>And even though Akane-san had banned me from coming to her house, I had broken my promise. There is no excuse for this. Would she forgive me if I drank a thousand needles in front of her? I have a feeling she would call an ambulance before that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I had no intention of breaking my promise. I thought we would never see each other again, that there was no need for us to be next to each other, and that everything would be in the past.</p>



<p>So, this is my responsibility for having engaged with Hinagi again. It is a reprimand and a punishment that I must accept.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not going to be like you think. You know, as an apology, my mom gave me movie tickets. Do you want to go with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About shark?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not about shark.&#8221;</p>



<p>The smile that Hinagi gave me was as beautiful as the day it happened.</p>



<p>As the saying goes, it is time to review the Seven Wonders of School.</p>



<p>Now that the school has long since abolished the duty of housekeeping, no one would notice a model human body wandering around the school late at night. Rather, it is the person who witnesses it who is suspicious. Who are you?</p>



<p>The transition from Japanese-style to Western-style toilets is underway, but in this case there is no way to get your hand out of the toilet, and even the hardworking Kinjiro Ninomiya, now considered a walking smartphone user, might rather be considered to be encouraging dangerous behavior. There is no such thing as a ghost chasing you down the corridor at a hundred kilometers an hour. Then, how fast is the guy that ghost is chasing running away? Maybe he&#8217;s not even human. Please, go to the Olympics. The corridor is not that long. The speed setting is too much.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The Seven Wonders, which are not appropriate for the modern age, should be brushed up flexibly.</p>



<p>So, this is one of the seven wonders advocated by me, Yukito Kokonoe, a mystery hunter living in modern times. &#8220;The Shameless President Sitting in the Student Council Room&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am glad you are relying on me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I realize I&#8217;ve failed. There is no stopper. Where did Mikumo-senpai go?</p>



<p>In case you don&#8217;t know what a high school class visit really is, just ask someone who does know, lesser cuckoo. Incidentally, it is said that the lesser cuckoo lays its eggs in the nest of the bush warbler, and the additional eggs are counted by dropping the eggs of the warbler on the ground.</p>



<p>The outrageous egg-laden act, this is exactly what the original cuckold is, a sleeping bird.</p>



<p>That aside, I came to the student council room to borrow the wisdom of an experienced third-year student, but the essential person of common sense, the healing Mikumo-senpai, was not there.</p>



<p>Now, there is only my natural enemy, the infamous president of the Student Council. Without Mikumo-senpai, who is the infusion of vitality, I, a weak man, am on the verge of a crisis comparable to a heroine who has been seduced by a hero.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yumi went to the staff room. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be back soon, but since you came all this way, I hope you can wait&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve suddenly lost your accent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What were you saying?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing …….&#8221;</p>



<p>It is not good to go in too deep. I am welcomed with open arms, but I can&#8217;t stay in this danger zone forever! Sensing the danger to myself, I quickly did my business to get out of here as fast as I could.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. ……. I think it was about 20% of the class when we were in the first grade. I guess it&#8217;s different in schools with a strong focus on education.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that how it is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. The Boy must be embarrassed, after all. Parent attendance was probably higher for the girls.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kedou-senpai is somehow dependable. As expected of the student body president. I&#8217;ve got a better opinion of her!</p>



<p>But still, if it&#8217;s only 20%, it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter if Mom doesn&#8217;t come. I&#8217;m sure the trend won&#8217;t suddenly change this year.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It&#8217;s not right to ask a busy mother to come and visit me for the sake of a foolish son like me. And it&#8217;s not worth it to have Sekka-san visit me as a substitute for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, why are you sitting on my lap?&#8221;</p>



<p>After the matter was settled and I felt refreshed, I asked her a question that was bothering me. For some reason, the president was sitting on my lap.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I may have jumped the gun a little too much. I thought it might be easier to do that after we&#8217;d gotten to know each other a little better. So what do you think? How about calling each other by name or nickname in order to shorten the distance between us? I recommend Mu-chan, which means &#8220;the moon is getting closer&#8221;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting too close all of a sudden, Mu-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah, I knew it, this person is no good. My evaluation has dropped dramatically!</p>



<p>Calling the chairman by her name is a hurdle. She&#8217;s a senior, and I&#8217;d like if possible to dispense with the nickname Mu-chan. The student body president is the boss of this school. I think it&#8217;s appropriate to call her by a respectful name, but it&#8217;s hard to decide what to call her.</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, we need to shorten the physical distance between us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you move? You&#8217;re heavy&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What should I do? Aren&#8217;t you happy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered honestly. I&#8217;m happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is my butt really bothering you that much? Fufu. To tell you the truth, it&#8217;s actually getting bigger these days. Yukito Kokonoe, this is a secret, but it&#8217;s easy to give birth to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too insignificant for me to get it out of my head!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was told an unexpected secret. What am I supposed to do with that!</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t be shy. I thought it would make you happy. Yes, I know. For the future, for the future. I&#8217;m thinking about the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it really the future?&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s the student body president, so she sees the world differently than I, a shallow, uneducated person.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8221; You could tell me some secrets too, if you wanted to, you know? Yes, because I know you, and you don&#8217;t seem to do things like that for no reason. Tell me. What the hell was that thing? It&#8217;s like it doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Before I knew it, you were the only one who had been wronged. I swear I won&#8217;t let anything bad happen to you. What in the world is the truth, Yukito Kokonoe?&#8221;</p>



<p>The president, who had suddenly taken on a serious expression, dropped to her knees and turned to face me.</p>



<p>The truth is that there is no truth to be told at this point. What you see is all there is.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just a piece of sh*t.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not! You are again someone&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mutsuki, sorry to keep you waiting. &#8211;Is that you, Kokonoe-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mikumo-senpai, it&#8217;s the HIPBOSS!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t nickname her like she is a director in the northern land.&#8221;</p>


<p>I respect my mom. I have respect like no other.</p>



<p>I heard that even monkeys can reflect on their actions, but what about respect?</p>



<p>Orangutans are called the wise of the forest, but I hear that chimpanzees can be surprisingly violent. As long as there is a leader of the pack, perhaps the animal kingdom is more strict about such things than one might think. But think about it.</p>



<p>My mother bought the apartment. I didn&#8217;t pay a penny for it. I should at least pay the rent. I don&#8217;t even pay school fees, and my mother pays for my food. She even gives me an allowance. I told her I didn&#8217;t want it, but she was adamant that I needed it.</p>



<p>Her merciful spirit is worthy of being called the Mother of Saints. I should mention that my mother&#8217;s name is Ouka, not Maria. Just in case.</p>



<p>This happened a while ago. When I first entered the school, I was a loner with few friends and a blank address book, so a smartphone was a waste of time and money.</p>



<p>So, I came up with the theory that &#8220;Yukito Kokonoe doesn&#8217;t need a smartphone&#8221;.</p>



<p>I tested to see if it was actually unnecessary. As a result, the only people I communicated with during the experiment were refreshingly good-looking guy and Himiyama-san, and that was only a very small fraction of the total number of people. I presented this result to my mother at home at night and told her how unnecessary a smartphone is, but instead of being pleased, she cried. That&#8217;s strange. It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be like this.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My mother is paying for the phone. I just thought there was no need to waste money on such an unnecessary expense, but I guess I was wrong.</p>



<p>I have a reputation for making my mother cry in any way I can, and I am sure I would have won the championship for making my mother cry early.</p>



<p>After that, she wouldn&#8217;t let go of me, and we ended up sleeping together in her bedroom as the night went on. I was so nervous that I couldn&#8217;t sleep at all, but she was sleeping peacefully. I can&#8217;t understand …….</p>



<p>I always wonder. Is it worth it? In other words, I&#8217;m just a parasite on my mother. I don&#8217;t have any value that she would invest in me.</p>



<p>I intend to pay back the full amount of my investment in the future, but even so, living like this day in and day out seems to prove that I am worthless, and I feel somewhat sorry for it. I can never indulge myself in the present. I am determined to keep my dignity.</p>



<p>The universal wisdom in this world is &#8220;ingratitude&#8221; and &#8220;devotion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But I am only indebted to her, and I do not serve her in any way. That is not mutually beneficial. I am only exploiting her kindness.</p>



<p>&#8211;That&#8217;s why I think, &#8220;Why am I here?&#8221; I wonder if it&#8217;s all right for me to be here.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. The reunion shouldn&#8217;t be that late.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve seen each other, so you should go have fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mom has a high school reunion next week. Hooo. I wonder if I&#8217;ll be attending a reunion in the future. ….Just kidding, won&#8217;t happen. There&#8217;s no way. In fact, I don&#8217;t think they will even contact me. And then I would find out later that the event was held. It would be better if it was the case, but the most likely scenario is that the person is unaccounted for and treated as deceased.</p>



<p>&#8220;If there is anything you need, let me know. I&#8217;ll get it for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just leave it to Yukito.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, she threw it all in my face. Is that really the right thing to do, Yuuri Kokonoe, even for a maiden? I was inwardly chiding myself, when my sister&#8217;s eyes widened. Hii! I always wonder how she can read my mind! Is there some kind of radio signal?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Is there a bug?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting a little weird signal.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wave my hand, but there&#8217;s no way I can see it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, is there anywhere you want to go on vacation this week? Let&#8217;s go out together.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do so much. You should at least rest well on your days off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. …… How&#8217;s school? Is there anything that&#8217;s troubling you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. Thanks for the food. I&#8217;m going to take a bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dinner with all three of us together is always quiet. I thought that my presence would be a distraction for my mother and sister, who are of the same sex, so I put away the dishes and left early.</p>



<p>I made my mother, who was probably tired, feel uncomfortable. I told her to have a good time at the reunion.</p>



<p>I hope everyone can take a break from worrying about me and get some rest. I can&#8217;t call this much of a dedication, but I still have to do as much as I can.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably what my mother would want me to do.</p>



<p><strong>[Mother PoV]</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;You got what you deserved.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p>



<p>The horrifyingly cold words of my daughter are not enough to refute them. I tried to call out to my beloved son as he walked away, but the words fizzled out and lost their shape. At the dining table, where the lights seemed to have gone out, only my gaze wandered about in search of a figure.</p>



<p>Lately, my daughter has been in a very good mood. Unlike me, the relationship between Yuuri and my child is slightly improving. I look at my daughter with envy and resentment.</p>



<p>After all those cracks and ruptures. I thought there was nothing I could do.</p>



<p>But I managed somehow. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t the power of Yuuri alone.</p>



<p>Still, it was a faint hope presented to me that made me want to cling to it.</p>



<p>I am trying to increase our conversations, but it is difficult to say that it is bearing fruit. If I talk to him, he answers. But that is all. He never speaks to me.</p>



<p>I want to ask him about any topic, any trivial detail.</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s not it. What am I doing, shifting the blame for this on him! I scolded myself for being a feckless fool. I bit my lip. There was definitely a time when he was like that. There was a time when he tried her best to tell me various things.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But I was the one who didn&#8217;t listen. Instead of listening and taking him seriously, I stepped on his toes again and again because I was busy. Blindly believing that there would be another opportunity.</p>



<p>It was not until much later that I realized that I had long since lost that opportunity.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first graders are going to have a class visit soon. I wonder if he&#8217;s going to talk to Sekka-san about it, since she&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s attending the class. I think he won&#8217;t say anything to Mom because there are only a few people attending. He probably doesn&#8217;t even want you to come anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……So, it&#8217;s that time of the year already.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sound of it stung my heart. The class visit. THow many times have I had the opportunity to do so, counting from elementary school? And yet I have been able to attend only twice. I wanted to see him more, I wanted to know him at school. Such a big lie, just a mouthful.</p>



<p>He was already a high school student. Considering how many more opportunities I had left, the time limit was approaching. Not a single moment more could be wasted. Time was running out for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. He&#8217;s not really interested in it so just go have fun&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop. I wouldn&#8217;t! I would never do that!&#8221;</p>



<p>I refuted Yuuri&#8217;s taunting words, but I had brought that on myself as well.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>My sister, Sekka, said to me, &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you participate again, sister.&#8221; My son also told me. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to come anymore.&#8221;. I should have asked for forgiveness sooner. I should have talked it over with him. I was afraid to face it, so I ran away and continued to avoid it.</p>



<p>There was no way my children would understand my flimsy words now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will risk everything I have to get him back. I don&#8217;t have half-hearted feelings like you do. So&#8211;don&#8217;t get in my way.&#8221;</p>



<p>I, his mother, was overwhelmed by the fiery passion. The gushing willpower rushes over me like a muddy stream, and I shudder at the resolve. I almost shy away from it.</p>



<p>This girl will not hesitate to do anything for Yukito. Even if it means getting her hands dirty, even if it means making enemies of the world, or even the constraints of ethics.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8212; You are a very bad and good sister&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-I am not sure about that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuri got up, put the dishes away in the sink, and went back to her room. There was no moving. The tension loosens and a big sigh is let out. The harshness of youth. I could never imitate it.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Really?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I asked myself because I didn&#8217;t want to admit it. I can&#8217;t accept that my thoughts, feelings, and determination are not as good as Yuuri&#8217;s. I can&#8217;t accept that. There should be no inferiority complex.</p>



<p>I am his mother. I love my son the most.</p>



<p>&#8220;What can I do……&#8221;</p>



<p>I covered my face with my hands and sobbed.</p>



<p>There was no time to spare. The time that I can live with him as a mother is not that long anymore.</p>



<p>When he graduates from high school, Yukito will probably leave this house right away. On the contrary, if I tell him to leave at this very moment, he might just do it. My son is always ready to do so.</p>



<p>Maybe I should discuss my parenting issues at the reunion. I come up with such an idea and immediately fall into self-loathing again. There is no way I can tell. I can see that I will be blamed by my friends for being the one to blame.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sick and tired of spinning my wheels. I thought I could do a little better, I thought I could spend more time at home like this, I was happy to be able to face my son.</p>



<p>But I had done nothing so far, and this was only a second-hand experience for me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I could not reach him. Yuuri may have been able to reach him, but I am still smoldering, unable to find even a foothold. I am definitely different from Yuuri.</p>



<p>Yuuri has been facing her sins since the day she almost killed Yukito, without running away from it. She has been facing unimaginable days that no one can ever understand.</p>



<p>When he is not at home, Yuuri often sits alone in his room and watches the scene in horror. To never forget what she had done.</p>



<p>The resolve that Yuuri showed me torments me. The reason she went out of her way to ridicule me like that is because I am being tested by Yuuri. &#8212;-being a mother, and being prepared to do so.</p>



<p>I take the cup in my hand and sip it without effort. I was left alone. No children around. This is what I have done. There was no way I could ever hope for an ideal reunion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what should I do, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>I ask my beloved son who is not here.</p>



<p>The only sound in the living room was my sobbing voice.</p>



<p><strong>[Yukito PoV]</strong></p>




<p>As I soak in the bathtub, my thoughts wander aimlessly.</p>



<p>My sister, Hinagi, and Shiori taught me firsthand that I was wrong. So I decided to make a different choice. But that didn&#8217;t solve everything.</p>



<p>I was wrong. Then when and what did I do wrong? I know I was wrong, but I don&#8217;t know what I did wrong.</p>



<p>If I don&#8217;t understand it, there will be no solution. I will always remain like this and will never be able to respond to anyone&#8217;s thoughts.</p>



<p>A little duck floating in the bathtub stares at me with dull eyes. After getting out of the bath, all I have to do is do some light stretching, study, and sleep.</p>



<p>After drying my hair, I walked through the living room and found a pair of shorts that my sister often wears. I picked them up and put them in the laundry basket.</p>



<p>In front of my room, I found a tank top that I thought my sister would wear often. I picked it up and put it in the laundry basket.</p>



<p>When I entered my room again, I found a woman&#8217;s underwear on the floor next to my bed. I don&#8217;t know if it looks like something my sister often wears …… or not. Because I haven&#8217;t seen that many of them.</p>



<p>I tried to pick it up and put it in the laundry basket, but the bed was unnaturally bulging. It was obvious that someone was hiding in there.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What if it&#8217;s a burglar? …… No, a bandit?&#8221;</p>



<p>The tension suddenly increases, but a wry smile spills out. Looking around the room once again, there is nothing valuable in here. The room is somewhat empty and plain, with blank walls and only a few personal belongings and a few pieces of furniture.</p>



<p>Calling myself a minimalist sounds good, but in reality, being a minimalist is not such a big deal.</p>



<p>I live here by courtesy of my mother, and if she says she doesn&#8217;t want me or asks me to leave, I&#8217;ll just leave immediately.</p>



<p>In other words, for me, this place is like a room in a hotel or inn. I don&#8217;t want to leave a trail of birds in my wake. I have already prepared myself, and there is no room for unnecessary things.</p>



<p>I always try to keep things tidy, and try not to make a mess or dirty as much as possible.</p>



<p>As long as I could study, it was enough as long as I had the space to do so. I promised them not to worry about my studies. It is my top priority to keep my grades up at all costs. I must not add to my mother&#8217;s worries any more than I already have.</p>



<p>Think about it. How would I feel if Mom, who has caused the family so much trouble in the past, where she sits in her room and plays video games in a carefree mood, not even studying? I would feel infinitely uncomfortable. I don&#8217;t want her to feel that way. I am just grateful that she lets me stay with her and even gives me a room like this.</p>



<p>How tolerant and kind the people of the Kokonoe family are! Normally, I would be in a position where I would have to go to my mother&#8217;s bedroom twice a day to worship. Thank you, thank you.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Hence, there is nothing in this room. There is not a single thing of value in this room that has been stolen by the bandit. I am sorry to the culprit who is still hiding, but let him give up.</p>



<p>The circle continues to go round and round in search of the answer to what is wrong and how long I have been wrong. I don&#8217;t even know if there is any truth in it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Bandit, what do you have here that you want?&#8221;</p>



<p>There was a fear that he might get upset. In order not to provoke him as much as possible, I spoke to him carefully.</p>



<p>With a thud, the culprit poked its head out of the sheets.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is you that I want!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Moooooootttthhhhheeerrrr! There&#8217;s a naked Zashiki-doujuuuuuuuuuu!&#8221; [TL: protective household deity in Tōhoku, appearing as a red-faced child spirit with bobbed hair]</p>



<p>I run away from the room with the brigand who starts talking like a wolf in Little Red Riding Hood. She looks like my sister, but it&#8217;s just my imagination, right?</p>



<p>I even put her underwear in the laundry basket as a getaway. Clean up the clothes that have been taken off.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>I met up with Hiangi in front of the station. The movie we were going to see was a crime suspense in which a boy detective cyborg, who has been implanted with an adult brain through brain remodeling, is trying to avenge the organization while eradicating criminals in the crime infested Mad City.</p>



<p>According to advance information, this is a problematic film full of spectacular explosion scenes and splatter scenes, but why did Akane choose this film over all others? I can only say that it was a nice decision! It looks super interesting!</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank goodness you found it right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any two-dimensional beautiful girls, so you&#8217;ve got the wrong per&#8212;-Huh Hinagi?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give me a fresh surprise!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was so surprised that my eyeballs popped out of my head. ※It&#8217;s a metaphor.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was close. I thought a beautiful girl had accidentally popped out of a two-dimensional space.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You praise me too much!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know. How much cuter can you get? I&#8217;ll throw a spacha&#8221; [TL: &#8220;Spacha&#8221; is a term used to refer to the function of throwing money to a live distributor.

<p>&#8220;Even if you say that…&#8221;</p>



<p>She went beyond the dimension lightly. Who is this super beautiful girl, Hinagin?</p>



<p>Hinagin, you&#8217;re so beautiful! Right, everyone? Yukito B~F &#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>



<p>A few minutes earlier than the meeting time. Thinking about it, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen her in her casual clothes like this. The impression is very different, although preferences have not changed that much.</p>



<p>Her clothes were much more mature than when she was in junior high school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I tried my best. Do you think it looks …… good on me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Turn around.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E-Eeh!? L-Like this?&#8221;</p>



<p>The skirt flipped around. It&#8217;s the same kind of thing you see at idol shows.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">

</div></div>




<p>The reason why I know so much about such things is because when my mother and sister buy new clothes and hold an unveiling party at home, they get sulky if I don&#8217;t call out to them. Are they children?</p>



<p>&#8220;Honorable Hideyoshi. My vocabulary is dead, so I&#8217;m just going to say pretty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-thank you. Come to think of it, you&#8217;ve always complimented me in the past. You&#8217;ve always told me how you felt, but I couldn&#8217;t always be honest with you. …… I&#8217;m an idiot, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi turns her head down with tears in the corners of her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………. you&#8217;ve changed, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those days when she was innocent, a few years ago when she was spiteful. And now she&#8217;s honest and a crybaby.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t forgive me for that anymore. Shall we hold hands&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a date.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a date. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do this.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Without hesitation or shyness.</p>



<p>There was no shyness or hesitation. She slowly opened her tightly clenched palm and turned it toward me. I hesitated and took her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I wanted was right in front of me from the beginning, but I didn&#8217;t realize it. All I had to do was reach out my hand and it was there. It was always right next to me. I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if to remind herself, Hiangi spun the words one by one. It was like a confirmation process, and she was trying to move forward while making sure that she would not make a mistake again.</p>



<p>I still can&#8217;t remember how I felt when I used to love Hiangi and had hidden my intention to confess it to her. If I don&#8217;t find it, I&#8217;ll never be able to respond to anyone&#8217;s feelings.</p>



<p>That would surely be cruel. The people who have expressed their feelings to me so far have all summoned up their courage. No matter what kind of answer I gave to their feelings, I was expected to have feelings to match theirs.</p>



<p>Knowing that my wish had not come true and that I could not have them, I stopped asking for these feelings.</p>



<p>I thought to myself as my headache returned.</p>



<p>I wondered how I should respond to her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for going out with me. It was fun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, do you still have time ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>I slipped out of the crowded multiplex and checked my watch. It was around 3 pm.</p>



<p>The sun was still high at this time of the year, the time of the summer solstice. I had nothing to do. It was too early to go home. Besides, I had something on my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, ……, I just want to be with you for a little while longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine……&#8221;</p>



<p>The face that changes from time to time is never boring to look at.</p>



<p>But I wonder if Hinagi has noticed that her expression fades from time to time.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not good right……. I&#8217;m sorry, but I still&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you scared of? Come on.&#8221;</p>



<p>I look around, and when I discover the object I want, I pull her hand forcefully as it is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Where are we going, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be punished.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-At this time?! Outside, not in the dark?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Look.&#8221;</p>



<p>A few meters further on, I found the season&#8217;s most colorful flowers in full bloom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hydrangeas……?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Beautiful, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes …… but why hydrangeas?&#8221;</p>



<p>I put my hands between Hinagi&#8217;s cheeks and kneaded them.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Whyat are you doying&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have a clear view?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi&#8217;s cheeks are soft. This is a memo.</p>



<p>I took my hands away from her chewy cheeks and turned to the hydrangea.</p>



<p>Hydrangea changes its color according to the pigment called anthocyanin. The beautiful indigo hydrangea now will change to a different color in a little while.</p>



<p>&#8220;The language of hydrangea is &#8216;pride&#8217;, flirtatiousness, and cold-heartedness. That fits me perfectly.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Hinagi laughs darkly, self-mockingly. It is true that there are negative connotations, but the language of hydrangea flowers differs depending on the color, and many of them imply deep affection.</p>



<p>&#8220;No one has ever said that. I have heard stories like this. Someone who was struggling with debt said that when the repayment was finished, he suddenly had a clearer view and felt the four seasons.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s …….&#8221;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t become a narrow-minded person. Hinagi. If you take a deep breath and look around you, you will find that there are so many beautiful things in abundance. You never know when or where you might meet someone wonderful. Take a look. That couple is kissing on the street in the middle of the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t point at them!&#8221;</p>



<p>Today, Hinagi kept looking at me. Even when we were watching a movie, she was only looking at me. Before she could enjoy the movie, she was trying to drown out her anxiety.</p>



<p>If this continued, I was afraid that she would miss something else, something important this time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;re in high school. Enjoy it more. Have more fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. ……. Because if only I hadn&#8217;t done what I did &#8212;&#8212; no. If I had never pursued Yukito, if we had never met again, I would never have ruined Yukito&#8217;s life!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Finally, I understand what was bothering Hinagi. She can&#8217;t stand the situation I&#8217;m in now. She regrets that she is the cause of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really care about anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But!&#8221;</p>



<p>This childishly familiar meddlesomeness hasn&#8217;t changed since she was a little girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, next time I&#8217;m in trouble, you&#8217;re the one to help me out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… me, Yukito? Yes, yes! I&#8217;ll definitely, definitely do something about it. I&#8217;ll help you. If you&#8217;re in trouble, you can talk to me about anything!&#8221;</p>



<p>The distance between the two of us becomes so zero that I can almost feel even her breaths.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why&#8211;thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I gently wipe Hiniagi&#8217;s tears. The language of flowers of pink hydrangea is &#8216;cheerful woman.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>A depressed appearance does not suit her.</p>



<p>&#8220;But let me correct one thing. I already had a wonderful encounter. A long, long time ago, when I was still a little girl. That&#8217;s the one thing I&#8217;ll never change, no matter what.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8221;</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t be so boorish as to ask back who that encounter was. I hope that one day I will be able to remember the feelings that I have let go of, the feelings that I have lost.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s before dinner, so let&#8217;s split it 50-50.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was past 6 pm. Akane-san would get angry at me again if I kept taking Hinagi around forever. If I don&#8217;t avoid building up the voltage of her anger any further…….</p>



<p>The specialty of autumn and winter is also eaten all year round in recent years. I split the baked sweet potato I bought in half and handed it to Hinagi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. It feels strange. A baked sweet potato this time of year.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It lacks a sense of season and sentiment.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;I guess so. It&#8217;s …… delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>I realized my serious blunder as I looked at Hinagi eating the baked sweet potato with a relieved look on her face. Am I an idiot? A baked sweet potato for a girl? There is no limit to insensitivity. I can&#8217;t complain even if I am disappointed.</p>



<p>Sh*t! What a mess I&#8217;ve made! Yukito, the greatest blunder!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-s-s-s-sorry, H-H-H-H-Hinagi&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s wrong, Yukito?!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I couldn&#8217;t hide my upset, Hinagi couldn&#8217;t hide her confusion, either.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rest assured, I don&#8217;t care how smelly your farts&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was smacked on the head.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;No, that can&#8217;t be true. Listen, it&#8217;s just an urban legend that idols don&#8217;t go to the bathroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m saying, I said I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a physiological phenomenon and there&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of. You can do it as much as you want. Go ahead, be my guest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so quick to make me out to be a smelly person! It&#8217;s misinformation!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s low in protein, so it doesn&#8217;t smell that bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a relief! I mean, it&#8217;s not going to happen!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s high in fiber, which is good for your health. Rich in vitamins.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Or what, do you want to sniff? Do you want to sniff my farts? Hey!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hinagin&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What? If you insist, I&#8217;ll do it. That&#8217;s all I have to do! Come on, smell it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to say this from the heart of an old woman, but it&#8217;s better to hide that propensity.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8221;t&#8217;s your own fault! You really are an …… idiot. But &#8212;-I really love you …….&#8221;</p>



<p>As if the tension has been broken, she starts to laugh carefree.</p>



<p>She laughed until she was satisfied, and there was no more fading in the expression that came to her face.</p>
