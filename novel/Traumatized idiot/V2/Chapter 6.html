<h1 class="entry-title">Chapter 6: Glassboy part 2</h1>   


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad at you. But it is wrong to steal from others. You know that, don&#8217;t you? So let&#8217;s apologize honestly. Okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her words, spoken softly as if instructing him, almost made her nod my head. The alluring and luscious sound of her words shocks the ear canals, but the Yukito Kokonoe denies it without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why was it in Kokonoe&#8217;s desk?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since he really did not know, he had no choice but to answer in that way.</p>



<p>The face of the trainee in front of her is bewildered.</p>



<p>It was a story that would have ended immediately if the boy, Yukito Kokonoe, had just apologized.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In fact, she was not angry at all; she was happy that he had taken an interest in her.</p>



<p>So, the trainee, Misaki Himiyama, was beginning to feel remorse for having questioned him in the classroom without consideration.</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough already! Kokonoe-kun. Why don&#8217;t you tell us honestly? What you did was theft, just like shoplifting. It&#8217;s a crime. You did something that the police would arrest you for if you grew up!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. But it wasn&#8217;t me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-suzuka-sensei, calm down. I am not angry, and as long as he hears me say it, I am sure even Kokonoe-kun will understand. Right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, but I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Admit it! I&#8217;ll call your parents!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>Susuka sanjoji&#8217;s voice was raised, but the boy in front of her was completely unperturbed.</p>



<p>He did not seem to have any awareness that he had done anything wrong.</p>



<p>It is necessary for children to make a clear distinction between right and wrong. A teacher is not a person who only has to teach learning.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji believes that it is the duty of a teacher to guide and lead children so that they can grow up to have a better life and a brighter future.</p>



<p>And the first step is elementary school.</p>



<p>In a sense, elementary school teachers need to treat their students like family.</p>



<p>Unlike in the upper grades, where students are becoming more aware of living in a group and of hierarchical relationships, this is more the case in the lower grades.</p>



<p>Personal belongings of Misaki Himiyama, who was assigned to this class as an educational intern, were found in Yukitko Kokonoe&#8217;s desk. It was discovered during cleaning time when a student was carrying a desk and found it spilling out of Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s desk. It was not an expensive item. It was not something that he would be in trouble if she did not have it. It was a small compact with a mirror that could not even be called a makeup kit.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The motive was probably that he was curious about Misaki Himiyama and ended up picking up some of her personal belongings. Just as they sometimes call their teachers &#8220;mothers,&#8221; teachers are special to boys and girls at the impressionable age of early elementary school. It is not surprising that he has a faint liking for her.</p>



<p>That is why, at first, both Susuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama had such a light perception of it.</p>



<p>At the end of class, he would have to say one sentence, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; and they would laugh and pat him on the head, telling him not to do it again. That was the end of it.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be such a trivial little incident that was easy to dismiss with a smile.</p>



<p>However, contrary to his eye-rolling, he denied it outright. He would not admit any fault of his own. The story changes in this case. As an educator, she must guide her students in the right direction. Unless the boy, Yukito Kokonoe, recognizes that stealing from others is wrong, he may repeat the same thing in the future.</p>



<p>If that happens, his life will become dark and backward. As his homeroom teacher and an educator, Suzuka Sanjoji had a sense of duty not to let that happen, and Misaki Himiyama felt the same way.</p>



<p>She tried to convince him of this, but no matter how many times she repeated her words, he would not apologize.</p>



<p>In fact, he would not even admit his guilt. Gradually, she became frustrated and raised her voice, but Yukito Koknoe still took it in stride and kept a blank expression on his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really going to call them! Are you sure?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so persistent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suzuka-sensei, you don&#8217;t have to go that far ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If we can&#8217;t make him listen to us, his parents will have to scold him. What Kokonoe-kun did is a crime. If this continues, he will surely have a hard time in the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Misaki-sensei, your gentleness is a virtue, but it is not enough to be a teacher. You want to be a great teacher, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,……. I love children.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then you have to be a heartthrob here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess …….your right, I really didn&#8217;t want to take care of it like this, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>They were still in the middle of their homecoming meeting. All of their classmates were still there. In the midst of the protracted meeting, Hinagi Suzurikawa who had finished first, was waiting outside the classroom with an anxious expression on her face.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Have you finished your story? Hi-chan is waiting for me and I want to go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t finished! Admit it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, Kokonoe-kun. Stealing someone&#8217;s things is wrong. What you did was stealing. It is a very bad thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard that before, and it&#8217;s not me, so I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Misaki-Sensei, let&#8217;s call his parents.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suzuka-sensei,……. Is that the only way……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you done? Hi-chan is waiting for me, so I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>



<p>The farewell party, which was supposed to end soon, was beginning to take a turn for the worse.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Some of the people, perhaps bored with the party, began to shout, &#8220;Thieves, thieves!&#8221; and some of them started to make a loud noise.</p>



<p>By now, Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama were beginning to regret having told this story here. It was a complete blunder that could not be undone.</p>



<p>Elementary school students are always sensitive. What should have been a minor incident that should have ended here and now was deeply etched in the memories of their classmates because it had gone on for so long.</p>



<p>If such a mindset prevails in the class, there is a danger that it will lead directly to bullying.</p>



<p>He should have been called to the staff room or an empty classroom and dealt with individually.</p>



<p>There is no way that he would not be hurt by being exposed in this manner. Despite his expressionless face, he must have been deeply hurt. It was a mistake to press him to admit it in front of his classmates. If he had asked the question to just one person elsewhere, he might have admitted it. He was probably just being stubborn. Perhaps he was just embarrassed.</p>



<p>It was their own lack of response that made it happen.</p>



<p>Even Suzuka Sanjoji is still just an inexperienced teacher. There was no way she could have handled everything. She was inwardly tongue-tied at her own lack of awareness.</p>



<p>She had no choice but to decide that it was not a good idea to continue pursuing the matter.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, go home and ask your parents what went wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is not that she hates Yukito Kokonoe. He is an important and precious pupil. It&#8217;s a boy with a future. In fact, this is out of concern for that boy.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama watched anxiously as Yukitko Kokonoe walked out of the classroom, hoping that their feelings would be conveyed to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi-chan, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem, don&#8217;t worry. But how awful! Yu-chan would never do such a thing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Although she was not aware of all the events, she was still watching them from the hallway, and her left hand, opposite her right hand on the chain, was moving up and down, angrily. She was expressing her anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi-chan, do you believe me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course I do! Yu-chan and I are childhood friends. I know that Yu-chan would never do such a bad thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, Hi-chan.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Ehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>The smile on her face lightens Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s heart as well.</p>



<p>Then again, how did it end up in my desk ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know. Maybe the person who picked it up thought it was Yu-chan&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hnmm. But only girls have those things, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom has one, too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was always just the two of them going to and from school. Chatting about trivial things as they walked, they would soon arrive at their destinations. It was just a normal day. But even so, Yukito Kokonoe liked this time. He thinks it is important.</p>



<p>Suddenly, he feels something tugging at his heartstrings and stops walking.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yu-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Himiyama-sensei said it disappeared after school yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. but something is not right. I went home with Hi-chan right after school yesterday, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We played together at the park.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then again, I can&#8217;t steal anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>If the compact was stolen after school yesterday, it is impossible for him to do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Yu-chan was with me!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;When I was going home with Hi-chan, we passed by the usual store. And I also met Yamamoto&#8217;s grandfather.&#8221;</p>



<p>If one walks along a busy street, one encounters so many different people. Neighbors walking their dogs, shopkeepers, strangers, and acquaintances. If so, all the people he met yesterday would prove that he was not the culprit.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I get home, I&#8217;ll make a record of my activities!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yu-chan, did you come up with something again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8221;Yes, I did. Hi-chan, I can&#8217;t play with you today.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Hi-chan. I don&#8217;t think it will take that long. It&#8217;s getting late today, so let&#8217;s play another time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Her twin tails drooped down as if to show her emotion. Hinagi was a very easy girl to understand.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>When he arrives home, the hands that had been holding each other&#8217;s hands parted, as if regretting the absence of the other.</p>



<p>A faint feeling of loneliness comes over him. The warmth of his slightly warmer hand seemed to tell him that it was okay for him to be here, that he didn&#8217;t have to leave, and that&#8217;s why he loved this time.</p>



<p>&#8220;See you tomorrow, Hi-chan&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;See you tomorrow. Yu-chan, bye-bye!&#8221;</p>



<p>The only thing he could do was to think that he wished they could keep their hands linked forever.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Around 8 pm the phone rang.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe knew what it was about. It was her mother, Ouka Kokonoe, who had also returned home.</p>



<p>While receiving the call, Ouka Kokonoe&#8217;s expression gradually becomes one of bewilderment.</p>



<p>From the conversation that leaked out, there was no doubt that the person on the other end of the line was her homeroom teacher, Suzuka Sanjoji . Her older sister, Yuuri Kokonoe, was also looking at the situation with a suspicious expression.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>After the phone call was over, Ouka opened her mouth in a probing manner.</p>



<p>Originally, there was not much conversation in the household. In fact, they rarely spoke to each other except on a need-to-know basis.</p>



<p>And it was all because of Ouka Kokonoe, and she was aware of it. Perhaps that is why she does not know how she should treat or talk to her beloved son, Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t know how to deal with her child. That is why she makes mistakes.</p>



<p>She never really meant it, and she never wanted to say it that way.</p>



<p>Yukito, you know. Did you steal something from an intern teacher who was on a teaching?</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuri muttered, wrinkling her brow and not even hiding her annoyance.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t steal anything.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>But the teacher said so. What happened today? Tell me. If there&#8217;s something you want, just tell me. I&#8217;ll buy you anything you want. But don&#8217;t steal anything, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuri tried to stop her in a panic, but it was no use.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. You don&#8217;t believe me after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito mutters to himself. It is just a confirmation of the fact.</p>



<p>There was the usual Yukito Kokonoe there, without any emotion, without any inflection.</p>



<p>However, when Ouka and Yuuri hear those words, they clearly understand that it was a mistake. They realize that they made another mistake.</p>



<p>Obviously, she had misplaced the first word she should have said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to cause you trouble. But I didn&#8217;t steal anything and I don&#8217;t want anything. I&#8217;ll fix it right away.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>He got up from the living room to go back to his room.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Wait! You got it wrong. I just want to talk to you, I didn&#8217;t suspect you…!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe you, Yukito! You would never do such a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to believe me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not forcing myself ! I&#8217;ve always believed in you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The attitude was contrary to the words. The back of the departing boy refuses to say any more words. Only a sense of emptiness remained.</p>



<p>Without knowing what had happened, all that remained was a stunned blank stare.</p>



<p>Maybe if they had been able to trust him from the beginning, he would have told them something. Maybe he would have asked for help. He said he didn&#8217;t steal. What does that mean? Different stories.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>That is exactly what the parents should have asked their son, and it was their role to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, she assumed that her son had stolen the item.</p>



<p>As a mother, she should have been on her son&#8217;s side, but instead, she betrayed him again.</p>



<p>It was too late to repent. She muttered to herself, &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me after all&#8221;.</p>



<p>From the beginning, as his mother, he never thought that she would believe him.</p>



<p>And, as it turned out, she did not believe him. Ironically, her son knew better than she did, or so she thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is it always, always, always, always!&#8221;</p>



<p>Angry, Yuuri also went to her room.</p>



<p>Yuuri&#8217;s frustration is unbearable. Yuuri, too, has a great deal of hurt. The family relationship is broken.</p>



<p>She is the one who has created it, there is no family reunion, she is always unable to express her true feelings, and she is always spinning out of control despite her deepest feelings.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you going to do …… when you say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it right away?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her son is always ready to do what he says he will do. Without knowing anything, without understanding anything, surely he will end up taking it all on his own again</p>



<p>He will not rely on his mother, whom he doesn&#8217;t believe in anyway.</p>



<p>If that is the case, what is the purpose of being here? What can she do for him?</p>



<p>&#8220;What can I do for him when I can&#8217;t even trust him ……&#8221;</p>



<p>What is a mother to do for her children if she can&#8217;t even trust them?</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito….&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no one here anymore to answer when she uttered the name of her beloved son.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright!&#8221;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but strike a weird pointing pose.</p>



<p>I made a record of yesterday&#8217;s activities by writing them down as I remembered them on a spare sheet of construction paper.</p>



<p>I wrote down in detail what I was doing, where I was, and who I was with, not only after school but also throughout the day yesterday.</p>



<p>This would show that I was not the culprit, and if I asked the people I met at that time, it would be obvious that I could not have stolen after school.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know who put it in my desk and for what purpose, but as long as I know it wasn&#8217;t me, that&#8217;s all that matters to me, thought the nine-place heavy snow hare.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to thank Hi-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>The only reason I decided to make something like this was because my childhood friend, Hinagi Suzurikawa believed in me. She was the only one who believed in me. That is why I wanted to prove my innocence.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>This world is always full of enemies.</p>



<p>But if there is just one person who believes in me, I can survive.</p>



<p>A precious partner like a jewel that exists only one grain in the desert.</p>



<p>The warmth of the hand that holds hers is the only reason why Yukito Kokonoe has not given up living like this. Only one reason for existence.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe, who tries to go to sleep feeling good that he has solved the problem, does not know.</p>



<p>&#8211;He is always unaware of the malice that is going on, and it never lets him off the hook.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>He heads off to school with Hinagi Suzurikawa.</p>



<p>Even though they go to the same school, he does not go to school with his sister, whom she hates him.</p>



<p>In the morning, his mother, Sekka, wanted to say something, but she nodded her head and did not say a word. Yukito Kokonoe didn&#8217;t want to hear it either.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>After passing through the school gate and arriving at the lowered box box, he noticed something unusual.</p>



<p>&#8220;No shoes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yu-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>The first to arrive at the shoe box was Hinagi, who had put on her school shoes and was peeking out of the corner of her eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like someone hid it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!? W-W-W-W-What should we do, Yu-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi Suzurikawa, her twin-tailed hair shaking in a flurry of panic, calls out to him worriedly.</p>



<p>A pair of slippers was missing from the shoe box with a sticker of his name on it. The shoes that should have been in the empty space were not there.</p>



<p>It could not be that they were missing. They must have been hidden.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>This is a common occurrence at school. If he lost it, he would have to ask his mother to buy it again. He did not want to cause that kind of trouble to his mother.</p>



<p>It was one of his classmates who did it. It was too obvious harassment.</p>



<p>Once this kind of thing starts, there is no end in sight. The person who does it may be doing it for the fun of it, but the hatred swells without limit for the person who is harassed. And every day, the students have to go to school, fearing what they might do to them. That is hell.</p>



<p>However, Yukito Kokonoe felt comfortable.</p>



<p>Because he knew. Rejection and denial are always the same.</p>



<p>That is the way it should be, that is the way it is everyday.</p>



<p>Always, always, everyone will malign you in such a way.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why what he does is always the same.</p>



<p>If no end is in sight, just end it yourself.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>Just cut everything off.</p>



<p>In this troublesome world, everything…</p>



<p>&#8220;Yu-chan!</p>



<p>He wondered when he had closed his eyes, but when he came to, he saw the face of Hinagi Suzurikawa right in front of him. The eyes gazing at him were shaking with sadness and tears in them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>He did not know why, so he just whispered her name.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yu-chan, you&#8217;re not going away, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, but ……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand, but I don&#8217;t want Yu-chan to go away!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It is not that Hinagi Suzurikawa understands what that feeling is.</p>



<p>Still, she clutched his hand tighter and tighter, as if following her instincts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look for it together, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p>She held his hand as if to make sure he was there, to make sure he didn&#8217;t go anywhere, to make sure he didn&#8217;t disappear, to make sure he didn&#8217;t disappear from her life as a young familiar face.</p>



<p>Why is this?</p>



<p>Why is she so&#8211;?</p>



<p>Why won&#8217;t she let me disappear?</p>



<p>Something was screaming in my heart.</p>



<p>Something was trying to appeal to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>However, Yukito Kokonoe could not understand what it was. Compulsive thoughts overshadow emotions like a haze. The link between thought and emotion is still disconnected and unchained on the chain.</p>



<p>Why am I so drawn to her words?</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Hi-chan. My mental health is as good as Red&#8217;s on Sunday morning superhero time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yu-chan, that&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>With big, round eyes, Hinagi Suzurikawa was amazed.</p>



<p>Abandoning the feelings trapped in the prison of his thoughts, Yukito Kokonoe let out a sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to look for it. I&#8217;ll have him bring it back to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How can you do that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Not wanting to leave his socks on, he goes to get slippers for the guests.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It will all be over soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>The same words as last night, this time to his childhood friend, and then Yukito Kokonoe headed to the classroom.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>When I arrived at the classroom, I quickly found an anomaly there as well.</p>



<p>There was graffiti on the desks. The words &#8221; thief,&#8221; &#8220;criminal,&#8221; and so on were written as they pleased. When I took out my textbook from a drawer, I found that it too had been scribbled on and torn to shreds. It was mid-May. It had only been two months since the new textbooks were delivered, but they could hardly be called new.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know who did it?&#8221;</p>



<p>I ask Akari Kazahaya , who is sitting next to me.</p>



<p>Akari Kazahaya is a girl who usually speaks to me aggressively, perhaps because we sit next to each other, and I have often taught Kazahaya when she asked me questions in class when I didn&#8217;t understand something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stealing from people is disgusting! I hope you die. Please don&#8217;t steal mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>She spit at me with disgust and contempt in her eyes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Amidst the giggles and sneers, words like &#8220;idiot,&#8221; &#8220;Uwaa he&#8217;s a thief,&#8221; and &#8220;what am I going to do, he&#8217;s going to steal my stuff,&#8221; were thrown at him from everywhere.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe sits down without saying a word. Perhaps amused by this, the voices of the agitators grew in volume and density.</p>



<p>After a while, when the homeroom teacher, Suzuka Sanjoji and an intern teacher, Miaski Himiyama, arrive, the voices stop and it becomes quiet as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>Before the morning assembly, without waiting for Suzuka Sanjoji to speak, Yukito called out to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Kokonoe-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>The eyes seemed to be annoyed, as if they were looking at someone who was in the way. Misaki Himiyama also gave him a similar look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, my slippers were missing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Then, she looks down at him for the first time. Yukito Kokonoe is wearing slippers.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama frowned when they saw this. They intuitively felt that the bullying had started because of their own thoughtless behavior. It was too late to regret it. They should have been more considerate. But it was all in hindsight.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji sharpened her expression and looked around the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who hid Kokonoe-kun&#8217;s shoes?&#8221;</p>



<p>A giggle and a mocking laugh echoed in the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think he was robbed because he is a thief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A thief is a liar, so isn&#8217;t he lying?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji tried to stop it, but like a dam that has collapsed, like a river that has burst, the malice that began to flow became a muddy stream like a flood, engulfing the place.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Who is saying this, or is it all of them?</p>



<p>The malice is amplified and diffused.</p>



<p>This is a being that can be bullied.</p>



<p>He is an existence that can be hurt or mocked.</p>



<p>Such a common understanding is spreading.</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama&#8217;s face was pale and white.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji also had a bitter look on her face.</p>



<p>She believes that bullying is an unavoidable part of being a teacher. She think it is a problem that everyone has to face. If one avoids such things, he or she is not qualified to be a teacher.</p>



<p>Would it be an admirable teacher to pretend not to see it and play it safe? Is that an educator to be proud of?</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>As an educator, Suzuka Sanjoji, and as a future teacher, Misaki Himiyama cannot overlook the problems that are happening right now. They cannot let the classroom collapse. That was the common understanding of both of them.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji was about to speak out to calm down the clamor, but it was none other than Yukito Kokonoe who stopped her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait until lunchtime. If you have hidden my slippers by then, please bring them back to me. Those who have scribbled on the desks and textbooks must come and apologize. If you know who did it, please tell me. I will say it again. Lunchtime is the time limit.&#8221;</p>



<p>He tells all his classmates, but the taunts become even stronger when they hear him.</p>



<p>&#8220;yOu hAVe it UNtil lUnchTime&#8221;</p>



<p>Gahahahaha,&#8221; Takayama make fun of him. The group of yankee around Takayama took advantage of the momentum and let loose with their wild jokes. The boys and girls laughed as if they had found a funny joke.</p>



<p>Of course, not all of them would be tainted with malice.</p>



<p>However, such individual resistance was powerless in the face of the atmosphere prevailing in the class at this very moment. Violence in the name of peer pressure. And those who pretend that they have nothing to do with such a situation are, in the end, the perpetrators.</p>



<p>In such a situation, Yukito Kokonoe looked with eyes that showed no emotion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;We are all enemies, jointly and severally.&#8221;</p>



<p>An even louder laugh echoed throughout the classroom, wondering what was so funny.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>First period was a self-study.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe was in an empty classroom when Suzuka Sanjoji called him out. Misaki Himiyama was also with them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe, are you alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About what……&#8221;</p>



<p>It was hard to know what to say to him. He may look fine, but there was no way he wasn&#8217;t hurt. The fact that they had thoughtlessly blamed him in front of the students had triggered the bullying. Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama felt the responsibility of this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Kokonoe-kun. I will protect you properly. When I&#8217;m done talking to you, let&#8217;s search for it with the whole class.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cooperate with you. Okay?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to look for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. You don&#8217;t have to be stubborn. Trust your teacher.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, you don&#8217;t trust me. You can&#8217;t ask me to trust you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>The two twisted their faces as if they had been hit by the bull&#8217;s-eye.</p>



<p>Ignoring them, Yukito Kokonoe turned to Misaki Himiyama.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Himiama-sensei, when did you lose your personal belongings?&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama was upset, perhaps not expecting to be asked again on this occasion, but she answered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it was after school the day before yesterday. What about it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Are you sure about that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not wrong…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki had no idea what he was going to say, so she had no choice but to answer as she was asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange, isn&#8217;t it? The day that I was there, I was playing with Hi-chan,…… Hinagi Suzurikawa , right after school. So how could I have stolen it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? …..I-Is that so? Then it must have been around the end of fifth period&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you just say it was after school? Were you lying, Sensei? Please don&#8217;t say anything irrelevant.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m not lying!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ryoka Sanjoji, who couldn&#8217;t help but notice the situation, interrupts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, you, you are still saying such a thing! Don&#8217;t be stubborn, just admit it and apologize. Your parents must be angry with you.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;There is no reason for them to be angry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is true that it was wrong of me to say such things in front of everyone and blame you for it. But you know what? The teachers are the only ones who are here now. YBe honest, Kokonoe-kun. Listen, if you apologize properly here, that&#8217;s the end of it. Then the teachers will be on your side. We will properly scold the child who hid the shoes and the child who painted doodles. We will never discriminate or abandon you.&#8221;</p>



<p>So you get it, don&#8217;t you?</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji continues, as if admonishing a child who has no sense of hearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, I&#8217;m not angry with you, and the teacher is on your side. If you like me, that would make me very happy. But you can&#8217;t steal without telling me, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>The kindly words were irresistibly horrifying to Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahahaha. I don&#8217;t need any allies.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always acting like that, that&#8217;s why they hide your shoes! Why can&#8217;t you understand that!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ignoring the agitated Suzuka Sanjoji, Yukito Kokonoe takes out a drawing paper he had brought and unfolds it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Himiisan-sensei, I&#8217;m going to ask you again. When on earth was it stolen? Look at this. This paper describes everything I did the day before yesterday. By looking at this, you will know that the culprit is not me&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;Enough already!&#8221;</p>



<p>The slap of Suzuka Sanjoji slapped his cheeks.</p>



<p>The drawing paper in his hand was easily torn by the spur of the moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama quickly supported the staggering Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji instantly came to her senses. Reflexively, she wielded corporal punishment.</p>



<p>They say it was the norm in the past, but in today&#8217;s educational world it is unacceptable. There is no excuse. It is a fatal blunder that could affect a teacher&#8217;s life if he or she is sued.</p>



<p>She is overly emotional. For some reason, her mind wanders when she is confronted with the boy in front of her, Yukito Kokonoe. The ephemeral atmosphere of his work is captivating.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Aah. I worked so hard to make it yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>Picking up the cruelly torn piece, Yukito Kokonoe crushed it into a crumpled mass and threw it away.</p>



<p>I see. I finally understood. It was my fault, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Finally, he said the words of apology.</p>



<p>At these words, Suzuka Sanjoji felt that she, too, had to apologize on the spur of the moment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only natural. No matter what the reason, there is no forgiveness for physical punishment to a student. But now, before thinking about social responsibility and self-preservation, she could not call herself an adult if she did not apologize for what she had done.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was overly emotional too. Sor&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;So Sensei don&#8217;t care about the truth, I see. If that&#8217;s the case, please say so from the beginning. In other words, it&#8217;s not convenient for you if I&#8217;m not the culprit.&#8221;</p>



<p>A chilling, bottom-chilling voice echoes through the empty classroom.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Originally, the student named Yukitoi Kokonoe was somewhat elusive. It was difficult to see his thoughts and feelings, and it was hard to tell what he was thinking. On the contrary, he was good at studying and athletics. Suzuka Sanjoji had such a perception of a mysterious student, and Misaki Himiyama, who had been in contact with the students for a short time, also had a similar perception.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like an idiot for preparing this. Ah, I see. I was an idiot when I thought I could get my message across by talking about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing his eyes, she gulped.</p>



<p>Deep, deep, dark, dark, and just falling away forever. The eyes, pure and yet so murky, caught Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was simple. It was my fault. It was my mistake to think of you as teachers. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>The apology that he had been refusing to give for so long was spoken in a matter-of-fact manner by Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>But those words, after&#8212;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You were my enemies, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was unmistakably a farewell.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji tries to stop Yukito Kokonoe, who is heading back from an empty classroom without a care in the world, but she doesn&#8217;t know how to call out to him, and while she is in such a state of hesitation, he walks off at a staccato pace.</p>



<p>&#8220;How could I have let this happen ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama was heartbroken. It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be like this.</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, she had been having a good time. She had felt fulfilled in her profession as a teacher. She felt that it was her true calling. The longing she had felt for such a profession, guiding children, had been shattered in the past two days.</p>



<p>Suddenly, she saw a piece of paper that Yukito Kokonoe had thrown away. She had not even looked at it earlier.</p>



<p>She walked toward it with unsteady steps, wondering what the hell it was all about, and picked up a piece of discarded, crumpled up drawing paper and unfolded it.</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama immediately realized what it meant.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;S-Suzaka-sensei! Look at this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzaka Sanjoji was also mentally exhausted. Even though it was only mid-morning, her fatigue had reached its peak. The heartache had greatly reduced her physical strength. The fact that she had administered corporal punishment and what he had said to her at the end were stuck in her brain.</p>



<p>She looked down at the paper that Misaki Himiyama had spread out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this …… what he did the day before yesterday? W-wait! It can&#8217;t be!&#8221;</p>



<p>The day before yesterday was clearly written on the paper.</p>



<p>It was everything that could be called a day in the life of Yukito Kokonoe. Who was with him when he came to school in the morning? During classes, recess, and after school, who he was with, who he met, and where he was. It is so neatly written that it is easy to tell at a glance.</p>



<p>However, is it possible to remember one&#8217;s own actions that clearly?</p>



<p>It was written in so much detail that it was so complete that it could only be a lie.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It could not be compared to a poorly written summer vacation schedule.</p>



<p>However, the majority of what was written on it overlapped with the memories of both of them.</p>



<p>This meant that there was no doubt about the authenticity of what was written.</p>



<p>A trembling hand traces the paper.</p>



<p>After school. On this day, classes lasted until the fifth period.</p>



<p>It says that at 14:45 he left school with a girl named Hinagi Suzurikawa. It was frightening that it even gave details of her leaving the school, just in case.</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Kokonoe-kun? Wait a minute. If that&#8217;s the case, then who stole it? What I did, what I said to him&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Misaki-sensei, please calm down!&#8221;</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t want to see it. The only thing left to do was to hope the worst, that it was a lie. If what was written on this paper was true, he could not steal it no matter what.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;T-this! Look, Misaki-sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji pointed at a spot on the paper.</p>



<p>It said that he had met and greeted Takigawa, an office staff member, before leaving school.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have to make sure! Let&#8217;s hurry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>Unable to stand still. Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama had finally come to the conclusion that they had made a fundamental mistake, as if they were being strangled by a cotton ball.</p>



<p>The class is now a self-study. If they did not return to the classroom soon, there might be another commotion. Still, it was important to confirm the truth now. That was the first priority, and unless they were sure, they would never be able to stand in front of him again.</p>



<p>Normally, one who is supposed to warn students running in the corridor is running in the corridor.</p>



<p>Even as she mocked herself for doing so, Suzuka Sanjoji sensed that a definite doom was approaching.</p>

<br>

<p>&#8220;Takigawa-san, is Takigawa-san here!&#8221;</p>



<p>A young female teacher rushes into the office. Takigawa is taken aback by the determined look on her face. He wondered if something untoward had happened to her, and called out to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takigawa-san. Did you see a student near the lowered box after school the day before yesterday?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Students? That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;ve met a number of them. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Takigawa gives a vague answer to Suzuka Sanjoji&#8217;s vague question.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, uhm. It is not that, it is this child.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji shows the class roster with his picture on it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s him, huh? He was walking home with the girl, hand in hand, chain-smiling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what time was that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember it was right after the doorbell rang. It was just before 3pm. He said hello and left.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No…..way……&#8221;</p>



<p>The sentence is like the scythe of the god of death. The sharp blade is thrust at the throat.</p>



<p>In the face of the cruel reality, Misaki Himiyama collapsed and sobbed. Suzuka Sanjoji felt the same way. Even so, she was supported by her experience and pride enough to realize that she was not allowed to do so.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>Takigawa, who did not know what was going on, hurriedly helped Misaki up.</p>



<p>Everything, everything was wrong.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>From the very beginning, he had been right and we had been wrong.</p>



<p>Why? Why didn&#8217;t we listen to his side of the story, even if only a little?</p>



<p>Why didn&#8217;t we try to consider other possibilities besides him?</p>



<p>He flatly denied it. He adamantly refused to admit it.</p>



<p>He even went to the trouble of preparing a paper with a detailed record of his actions.</p>



<p>But I still didn&#8217;t believe him.</p>



<p>So he abandoned us and parted ways.</p>



<p>It was too late for me to realize it now and regret it.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Lunch break.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The time arrived when no one had spoken to Yukito Kokonoe since morning.</p>



<p>Naturally, he was still in his guess slippers and no one brought back his slippers.</p>



<p>The fact that Yukito Kokonoe had specified that lunchtime would be the deadline, conversely, created an atmosphere of trying to ignore them until then. With a grin and a sticky smile on his face, he was receiving mocking glances from all over the place.</p>



<p>Kazahaya and Akari, sitting next to each other, had shifted their desks to create a larger distance between him. If anything, he was the enemy.</p>



<p>&#8220;The time limit is up. Then let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe muttered a few words and headed for the shoe box.</p>



<p>Taking out a garbage bag from the janitorial closet.</p>



<p>At this hour, no students are likely to come to the front door. Yukito Kokonoe haphazardly stuffs all the classmates&#8217; outdoor shoes into the garbage bag. One bag is not enough, so he ends up with two, but it can&#8217;t be helped. Walking with a garbage bag on his shoulder, he looked like an out-of-season Santa Claus.</p>



<p>He arrived at the courtyard. It was not that big, and there was not enough space to enjoy playing with all your might. The purpose of Yukito Kokonoe visit was the pond.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hmmm… I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to work as it is. Yes, let&#8217;s fill it with stones.&#8221;</p>



<p>He picked up stones from the curb and put them in a garbage bag. The amount of rocks was so large that they weighed a lot.</p>



<p>He lightly tied the lid of the garbage bag and threw it into the pond. The bag easily sank with a large number of shoes. The garbage bag was not airtight, and the contents were soon soaked with water.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwa. How miserable!&#8221;</p>



<p>No one wants to wear shoes soaked in water. The slimy feeling is unpleasant.</p>



<p>Thinking about this, he never worries about how his classmates are going to get home today. Not interested, nor concerned.</p>



<p>Because they are not his classmates, but his enemies.</p>



<p>The glass boy reflects.</p>



<p>Malice against malice. Nothing else matters.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always good to have only enemies.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was the only correct answer he knew.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>&#8220;Yu-chan, can we play today?&#8221;</p>



<p>On the way to school in the morning. A boy and a girl were walking side by side.</p>



<p>The young girl, Hinagi Suzurikawa, asked the boy next to her with her rounded eyes. The boy noticed that his hand was slightly tightened in hers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Hi-chan. I was busy yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hio-chan wants to play with Yu-chan, too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe I can play today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaay!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her twin tails bounced. Hio-chan is the younger sister of Hinagi. If Hinagi is a childhood friend of mine, then I guess you could say that Hiori is also a childhood friend of mine.</p>



<p>Hinagi walks with a big smile on her face. She looks very happy. Her words are sincere and honest. Her warmth of heart, without any hidden meaning. The girl who expresses her feelings so honestly is genuinely on the boy&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe thought to himself. Why am I bothering with all this crap? And. Enemy and ally. The priority should always be on your side. And yet, I&#8217;m constantly dealing with the enemy and losing time to play with Hi-chan, who is on my side.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not worth it to play with the enemy. What a waste of time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to finish this as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The words reached the ears of Hinagi Suzurikawa. She did not understand the meaning. Even so, Hinagi did not ask him back. The boy next to her always sees things differently from herself.</p>



<p>Even though they were childhood friends, there was no need for the girl to understand every aspect of the boy who was essentially a stranger. What mattered was that their hearts were connected. As long as she believed that they both thought of each other, there was no need to be anxious.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The expression on Hinagi&#8217;s face clouded when she saw Yukito Kokonoe going to get slippers for the guest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yu-chan, didn&#8217;t you find your slippers?&#8221;</p>



<p>The fact that Yukito Kokonoe was wearing slippers meant that they had not yet returned his hidden slippers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Don&#8217;t worry about it. It will be back by today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I see. Yeah, it&#8217;ll be back, right!&#8221;</p>



<p>The large eyes stare at the boy. The expression on the boy&#8217;s face is always the same. Still, there are some things she can tell. If he said it will come back today, then it will.</p>



<p>Hinagi does not doubt Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s words because she believes in him. Because he has never lied. So it will be all right.</p>



<p>She wanted to search for it right now, but if he said it will be back, she would trust him.</p>



<p>That is&#8212;&#8211; trust.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Yu-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>She will not let go of this hand. Hinagi understood that not letting go was the only thing she could do. At this time, she certainly sensed it. Whether this was not by logic, but by the purity of being a child, or by instinct, she did not know.</p>



<p>But for sure, she knew that her heart was connected to the boy, and she had found the right answer.</p>



<p>It would be a little later that she would lose sight of that.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>When Yukito Kokonoe stepped into his classroom, he was immediately confronted with an enormous amount of hostility. When he looked at his desk, it looked even worse than yesterday.</p>



<p>The writing on his desk and in his textbooks were no longer graffiti, but slander and hatred. The cloth bag his mother had made for him had been torn to shreds with a blade, probably a pair of scissors.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, you! How dare you drown our shoes in the pond?&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re bothering my mother again. As he was thinking this, someone was yelling something. A group of three boys were approaching.</p>



<p>Takayama, was it? I had never had any deep contact with him before, so I was only aware of him to that extent, but he seemed to be very angry about something.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You did it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t go home soaking wet!&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe had forgotten all about it. The reason is that he was very busy yesterday.</p>



<p>He got home late, but there was a lot going on after that. In such a hectic schedule, he could not remember what he had done.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who put our shoes in the pond!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Aah! Did that happen? I didn&#8217;t know. Maybe it was the work of thieves?&#8221;</p>



<p>I remember doing that, but I shrug it off. It was the thief who did it. If it was the thief who hid his own slippers, it must be the same this time. It had to be so.</p>



<p>There was nothing strange about it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Stop joking around!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The thief hid it, no? I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed that it was not only the group of boys who were not pleased with this reply.</p>



<p>Boys and girls alike looked at him with disgust and contempt.</p>



<p>The hostility became even sharper, and like a glass of water just before it spills, the equilibrium maintained by surface tension was about to collapse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Beat the hell out of him!&#8221;</p>



<p>Someone said these words. It was a woman&#8217;s voice. But even if the woman had not said it, someone would have said the same thing sooner or later. Or perhaps the boys in front of him reached their limits sooner. That was the only difference.</p>



<p>&#8220;You little! Die!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takayama, Hashimoto, and Kitagawa all hit him at once. No one tried to help.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Yukito Kokonoe was beaten up without any way to help. His classmates are watching the situation with amusement. There is an expectation. The basic principle of getting rid of the offenders and foreign substances. It was absolutely right for the boys and girls.</p>



<p>Because it was he who soaked their shoes, it was all his fault.</p>



<p>It was Yukito Kokonoe who was to blame, Yukito Kokonoe was evil, and Yukito Kokonoe was the enemy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop it! It wasn&#8217;t me! You&#8217;re hurting me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe pleads. But the violence did not stop.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up! You are not needed!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Die, thief!&#8221;</p>



<p>The violence of several people attacked him.</p>



<p>The group of boys, including Kousuke Takayama , are elated by the sight of the small, irresistible Yukito Kokonoe, shielding his head. The adrenaline secreted from the body destroys the brakes and chops away at one&#8217;s rationality. Once in motion, it cannot be stopped. There is no control.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>What they are doing is righteous. Even their classmates are cheering them on.</p>



<p>Kousuke Takayama was amused. He was up against a criminal, a bad guy who had dumped their shoes in the pond. Even the five-man squadron that plays Super Hero Time on Sunday mornings lynch their enemies in groups. Justice is done on him, and the bad guy, the criminal, is Yukito Kokonoe. There is no obstacle to reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not me! You&#8217;re hurting me! Stop it!&#8221;</p>



<p>The classmates laughed and shouted mercilessly at him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Keep it up! Beat the s**t out of him!&#8221; Perhaps they were so angry at getting their shoes wet that no one stopped the assault. Takayama and the others could no longer stop themselves.</p>



<p>Some of them were just too angry to get involved. But in the thick air, that was also meaningless.</p>



<p>Kousuke Takayama felt his heart fill up with a sense of cruelty. He was the absolute strong man. He is the one who oppresses others. A king who reigns over those who are weak. I am strong. I am powerful. He was intoxicated with this sense of omnipotence as he beats the crap out of the guy crouching in front of him.</p>



<p>He is the dominant one. In the early grades of elementary school, the concept of school caste had not yet been fully established. Nevertheless, it was definitely on the verge of being born.</p>



<p>People are not equal, and the weak are not allowed to challenge the strong. That is the strict rule of this world.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hurting me! Stop it! It wasn&#8217;t me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, he felt something strange. Something like a broken record. ……</p>



<p>However, such a trivial feeling of discomfort was drowned out by an overwhelming sense of euphoria.</p>



<p>The only thing he can think of right now is to make the miserable trash in front of him crawl in a state of helplessness, make him weep, and mock him.</p>

<br>

<p>&#8220;What are you guys doing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone stop!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji and Himiyama Misaki rush into the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this guy&#8217;s fault!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji was heartbroken that her bad premonition had come true. Misaki Himiyama had also been growing more and more tired of this situation over the past few days.</p>



<p>Yesterday after school, there was a bit of a commotion. The reason was that students&#8217; shoes had been drowned in the pond. At first, one student reported that his shoes had been hidden.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just one student who reported it. The shoes of the entire class were missing. It was too big a scale to bully someone. The target was too broad.</p>



<p>So if it wasn&#8217;t bullying, what was it&#8212;-</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The students, Suzuka Sanjoji, and Misaki Himiyama ran around the school to find out. However, they find it not inside the school. It was found in a pond in the courtyard.</p>



<p>Among the students who were searching around, there was no sign of Yukito Kokonoe. There was no doubt that it was Yukito Kokonoe who did it. It reminded her of what KYukito Kokonoe had told her. They were all enemies, that&#8217;s what he had said for sure.</p>



<p>Normally, she would have had to call him immediately. It was impossible not to report to his parents after all of this.</p>



<p>But even so, even if she was sure it was Yukito Kokonoe, Suzuka Sanjoji hesitated.</p>



<p>They had just accused him of a crime he did not commit and framed him as the culprit.</p>



<p>She had just told his mother of a crime he did not commit and advised her to tell him about it.</p>



<p>No matter how sure they were, no matter how obvious it was that Yukito Kokonoe was the culprit, they, who had caused the false accusation, could not treat him as the culprit again without any proof. That is why she hesitated.</p>



<p>The next day, they postponed the meeting to hear the story first from Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Despite this attempt to persuade the students, they were not convinced. Once again, she had made a mistake in her handling of the situation. This naive judgment led to the assault this time.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It was not a fight. It was a one-sided assault. He was crouched down weakly.</p>



<p>Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama could not believe what they were seeing, but what they were seeing was the truth.</p>



<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t me! Stop it! You&#8217;re hurting me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takayama and the others did not stop the assault even when they saw the teacher. No, they could not stop. It was way beyond the point where they could restrain themselves.</p>



<p>Ah, it&#8217;s fun. Why is it so much fun to hurt weak people? Punching, kicking, and bringing them to their knees is the most enjoyable thing ever.</p>



<p>It is the greatest entertainment in this space.</p>



<p>One could even call it an instinct as a human being. The bare animal nature.</p>



<p>No matter how mature human society becomes, it will never disappear.</p>



<p>Everyone always wants to make the other person fall down, beat him up, and bring him to his knees, if only there is an opportunity!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>So, yes.</p>



<p>To resist such violence.</p>


<br>


<p>To stop such violence.</p>



<br>


<p>It was always&#8211;.</p>






<p>It was always violence that only surpassed it.</p>






<p>For a moment, Suzuka Sanjoji felt her gaze meet that of Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>At that moment, as if nothing had happened, Yukito Kokonoe stood up and kicked Kousuke Takayama away. The impact of the kick scattered the desk and chair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama does not understand. No, &#8220;?&#8221; was floating above the heads of everyone present.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The classroom that had been so noisy was instantly enveloped in silence.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe grabbed him and bent Hashimoto&#8217;s fingers back as he was punching him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyaaaahhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hashimoto, who had been grabbed and punched by Yukito, quickly let go of his hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What are you doing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kitagawa, unable to hide his agitation at the sudden outburst, comes at him, but even as he swings his punches, the lower half of his body is not following suit.</p>



<p>In the first place, Yukito Kokonoe was used to fighting. The boy, who was unlucky in some way, had his fair share of experiences of being involved in such things. It was nothing special, and he felt it was just a part of his everyday life. In order to face up to it, he does not miss his daily running and muscle training.</p>



<p>He never thought that he would be able to take on an opponent who would just rush at him with momentum, letting his exhilarated mood take over.</p>



<p>When he dispelled his unsteady foot, Kitagawa&#8217;s position was easily disrupted.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>Dragging him down as it was, he kicked him away like a soccer ball.</p>



<p>&#8220;……ggh!&#8221;</p>



<p>Desks and chairs scattered again with a loud noise.</p>



<p>Takayama gets up with an expression of not knowing what just happened.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe came at him with the euphoric feeling that he had just had.</p>



<p>&#8220;You littttlleeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&#8221;</p>



<p>When Takayama&#8217;s knee is kicked vertically, he falls to the ground. The knee slammed right into his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pugyah.&#8221;</p>



<p>He screamed unbearably to be heard and collapsed. His nose was bleeding. He grabbed Takayama by the hair and pulled him up, then slammed him face-first into the wall.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;…… gah!&#8221;</p>



<p>No one could move. No one knew what was going on.</p>



<p>And it was the same for Takayama and the others.</p>



<p>I should have been the strong one. I should have been a hero. Trampling over them, bringing them to their knees, dominating the weak and overrunning them, that kind of overwhelming presence!</p>



<p>So why, why is it that I am the one being beaten now?</p>



<p>No matter how much he refused to understand, nothing would change, and the heat that should have been so aroused in him was rapidly receding. Once he became calm and the adrenaline stopped flowing, the only thing that awaited him was the reality of pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, I don&#8217;t have my slippers, do you know where they are?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what are you talking about….&#8221;</p>



<p>The cold, horrifying words reached his ears.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It is strange. A moment ago, you were pleading so miserably, so ineptly!</p>



<p>And yet, with a nonchalant air, as if that had never happened, the man slammed his face into the wall again.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8211;S-stop!&#8221;</p>



<p>There is a dull crunching sound.</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t stop me when I said that, did you? And my slippers were stolen by the thief, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>He slammed him again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Takayama. Do you know where they are?&#8221;</p>



<p>Again he smacked him.</p>



<p>The lechery in Takayama&#8217;s eyes had faded away. Now, the fear in his eyes is frightened.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The reality of the unknown fear and pain has painted over his exuberant mood and caused it to shrivel up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bring it.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all he says.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kousuke Takayama ran out of the classroom crying and moaning.</p>



<p>He turned his face to his classmates, who had just been shouting at him.</p>



<p>And then, he walked toward them, determinedly. Everyone wanted to escape. And yet, their legs were shaking and they couldn&#8217;t move. The world had changed in an instant, and their perception could not catch up with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Beat the hell out of him, right? If that&#8217;s the case, I can hit you too, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh ……, ah, no…….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div></div>




<p>He grabs Akari Kazahaya by the chest.</p>



<p>She was frozen in fear and couldn&#8217;t speak. She was horrified to see the guy who had soaked her shoes being beaten. She wanted more.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I was cheering. I did nothing wrong.</p>



<p>It should be that way, but why, why is this happening?</p>



<p>As if she had been freed from her bondage, Susuka Sanjoji came to herself and shouted,</p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t hit a girl!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We live in a world of gender equality now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s not what I meant!&#8221;</p>



<p>She rushed to approach Yukito Kokonoe to restrain him. He was holding on to her chest with frightening force. She tried to pull it away, but it didn&#8217;t bother him at all.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;She is equally guilty. One way or another, I was being beaten up. And she was encouraging it. Don&#8217;t you know? That&#8217;s violence, too. You saw that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s …….&#8221;</p>



<p>It was here that Suzuka Sanjoji finally realized. It was too late to come to that thought. The assault by Takayama and the others had begun before they came to the classroom. And it continued after they arrived. This boy had gone to great lengths to show it to them.</p>



<p>To justify his actions, even though he could have bounced back from the beginning.</p>



<p>And he was not wrong in anything he said.</p>



<p>Aiding and abetting. No one was going to help him anyway. Which could only mean that, to him, they were all equally guilty.</p>



<p>&#8220;What they did to me was also verbal abuse.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ……!&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no room for argument. He was right. Everything that had caused this situation was her own fault. She didn&#8217;t listen to anything he had to say.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to beat the s**t out of all these guys.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;HII, ……! I didn&#8217;t do anything!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had nothing to do with it! They did it on their own&#8212;&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>Evasion of responsibility, self-preservation. The atmosphere is abuzz. That&#8217;s what anyone would do if they heard such words. He did it right in front of them. He would do it without any reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;No! No more violence!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then what will you do? My textbooks and the bag my mother made for me are in tatters. Isn&#8217;t this violence?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did they do such a terrible, terrible thing ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama was holding the tattered cloth bag in her trembling hands. Her eyes could not look away as if she were being told that this was her sin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please contact the parents of all these people. You can do that, right? I called my mother, even though I didn&#8217;t do anything. But everything they did was true.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>In any case, it was impossible to conceal the fact. She had no choice but to contact the parents of the Takayama family. But the boy in front of him had no intention of letting it go that far.</p>



<p>What he was saying was that he wanted all the parents to be informed of their foolishness and to come and apologize to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-wait! Please, just give me a minute! I won&#8217;t pretend it didn&#8217;t happen. This time, tell me your story properly&#8212;-!&#8221;</p>



<p>Confused, dismayed, bewildered, and perplexed. Unable to think of anything, not knowing where to begin.</p>



<p>The only thing she can do now is to pile on the words in a desperate attempt to somehow contain the situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-What&#8217;s all the fuss!&#8221;</p>



<p>What interrupted Sanjoji&#8217;s train of thought was the vice principal, Toyama.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sanjoji-sensei, what&#8217;s this all about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, this is …….&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>The vice principal, Toyama, asked Susuka Sanjoji. But Susuka Sanjoji was at a loss for words, not knowing how to reply.</p>



<p>Why is the vice principal here? She thought so, but if she was making so much noise, the other classes would have heard her, and the vice principal might have happened to pass by and noticed it. In any case, it was bad luck. She would have to wait until the situation had calmed down a bit before she could give an explanation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been waiting for you, vice principal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are ……. You&#8217;re the one who caused all this trouble?&#8221;</p>



<p>But for some reason, it was Yukito Koknoe who spoke to the vice principal, Toyama, in a friendly manner. Both Suzuka Sanjoji and Himiyama Misaki intuitively realize that this is a bad idea. If this boy does anything, it can only go horribly wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. It was a one-sided beating.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What did you say? Explain yourself from the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy may be calm, but the fact that he was beaten so much has left him in a bad way. Even the casual observer could tell that it was not a lie. The eyes of Toyama became stern, but as if that didn&#8217;t matter, Yukito Koknoe continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, vice principal, can I ask you to repeat what you told me yesterday?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Tell me what happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It will all become clear when the vice principal tells us. Please. Let me hear it again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that ……&#8221;</p>



<p>The poison was drained out from him as he saw Yukito bow his head obediently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa. …….Okay, then what do you want to ask?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Somehow, Susuka Sanjoji was beginning to understand what was about to begin.</p>



<p>In front of the podium, Yukito Kokonoe continued to ask questions to the vice principal, Toyama.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vice principal passed through the corridor of this classroom after school three days ago, right?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I needed to check the equipment in the storage room down the hall.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What time was that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe it was after 4 pm….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Was there anyone in this class at that time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, there was only one student left. I remember because I told him to go home and be careful not to have any accidents.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The one who spoke up was Misaki Himiyama.</p>



<p>The day&#8217;s classes ended before 15:00. It was rare for a student to remain in the classroom until around 4 pm</p>



<p>&#8220;Who is that student?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Hmm? Well, …… ah. It&#8217;s him.&#8221;</p>



<p>The vice principal, Toyama, looked around the class and pointed to him.</p>



<p>That student the vice principal pointed to, Kazuhiro Okamoto , looked down and was trembling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, vice principal. My last question. Where was he at the time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? He was sitting right there, getting ready to leave&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That settles it all. As expected of the vice principal. You are handsome, kind, and admirable. Yo, Kagami, you are a true teacher! I respect you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I appreciate you saying so, but what the hell do you expect to learn from a question like this ……?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe approached Kazuhiro Okamoto and punched him in the face.</p>



<p>Gasp!</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>With a loud thud, Kazuhiro Okamoto was blown away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha! What are you doing! Stop it!</p>



<p>Toyama rushed to stop him, but Yukito Kokonoe dragged Kazuhiro Okamoto up and threw him down to the podium.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vice principal, that seat right there where Okamoto was getting ready to leave. It&#8217;s my seat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okamoto, you. What were you doing in my seat?&#8221;</p>



<p>At this moment, Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama are just bystanders. The same is true for the audience of a play.</p>



<p>It is as if, yes, they are being shown off like spectators in a play. This means that what he is doing, in other words, is absolution.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything! I just happened to be sitting there&#8211;&#8220;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;You were getting ready to leave? What were you getting out of my desk? No, what were you going to put in there? You stole that woman&#8217;s compact, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no! I was&#8212;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;You stole her compact!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t! I was going to give it back to her afterwards&#8212;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even the frightened blackmail may be an act, or it may be an expressionless face like a Noh mask that doesn&#8217;t even twitch.</p>



<p>A quiet classroom. His confession confessed his guilt more eloquently than anything else.</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough already! What is going on!&#8221;</p>



<p>Toyama, numb to the situation, raised his voice.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe looked around and said.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It&#8217;s easy. In other words, these guys worked together to frame me as the culprit. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying.</p>



<p>The words &#8220;these guys&#8221; used by Yukito Kokonoe made Suzuka Sanjoji and Himiyama Misaki feel like they were included.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unexpected.&#8221; For Okamoto Kazuhiro, that was all he could say. Frightened by the escalating situation, Okamoto was unable to even confess that he was the culprit and could only watch from the sidelines.</p>



<p>But that was, after all, only a crime.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a mess ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Toyama looks pained. Yukito Kokonoe told everything from the very beginning.</p>



<p>And neither Suzuka Sanjoji nor Misaki Himiyama could lie in such an occasion.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Takayama, who had cried his eyes out, returned with Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s shoes, but Yukito Kokonoe struck him again on the spot, causing another agonizing incident, and the three who had been hit were moved to the infirmary for now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fortunately, the vice principal was there to witness the incident and saved the day, but I was planning to consult a lawyer.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;L-Lawyer….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I never touched the compact. So the compact must have the criminal&#8217;s fingerprints on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that happened, ……&#8221;</p>



<p>The fact that the word &#8220;lawyer&#8221; came out of a child&#8217;s mouth is unsettling.</p>



<p>If that had happened, the uproar would have spread outside the campus and expanded dramatically.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t Yukito Kokonoe who came up with the wisdom to do so. He had asked his mother&#8217;s sister, Sekka Kokonoe, for advice on how to find the culprit.</p>



<p>Sekka Kokonoe also merely mentioned it in passing as a means to an end, and did not instruct him to say it. It was just that Yukito Kokonoe took it to heart and said it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand the situation. Sanjoji-sensei, how did things get so complicated? You could have done better, couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. I know that, but ……&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>That was exactly what Suzuka Sanjoji had asked herself over and over again. There had to be a time to turn back again and again before things got to this point.</p>



<p>And annoyingly, Yukito Kokonoe was the one who had given her that chance.</p>



<p>He had reached out to her many times before reaching this point today. To themselves, to their classmates. It was a reprieve. Until lunchtime, he said. But no one wanted to help him. He gave proof that he was not the culprit. But no one believed him.</p>



<p>The worst result of all. It was their fault for pushing his hand away.</p>



<p>It was a mistake for which there was no excuse. She couldn&#8217;t imagine how much it had hurt him, how much it had angered him.</p>



<p>&#8220;But you shouldn&#8217;t hit people. You know that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was something that really bothered Suzuka Sanjoji.</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to go that far with Takayama and the others, no?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;What are you even saying? Oh, I am sorry. I misspoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look. I was being one-sidedly beaten. I was just desperate to fight back. I couldn&#8217;t spare the time to go easy on him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lies!</p>



<p>Everyone thought so. But there was no way they could accuse him of lying.</p>



<p>After all, it was Takayama and the others who made the first move, and they were looking at the one-sided beating of Yukito Kokonoe. Unless he admits that he lied, it will never be reversed.</p>



<p>The condemnation continues solemnly.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe turns his gaze toward them. What dark eyes. His eyes are so cloudy that they do not reflect any emotion.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a memory comes back to me. I remember that he has not called me &#8220;Sensei&#8221; even once today. Not once. I remember what he said yesterday.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I see, he. In his mind, we are no longer teachers&#8212;</p>



<p>&#8220;You told me a thousand times that I should apologize if I did something wrong. But no one has apologized. Not you, not Takayama and the others, not this sh*tty classroom, not that thief over there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama looks up.</p>



<p>In other words, they too are confronted with the fact that they have not done any of the things that they have been saying to Yukito Koknoe and the others.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you who are liars&#8221;.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>From then on, the days of hell continued for Suzuka Sanjoji and Misaki Himiyama-san. It took several days just to get the situation under control. Days spent apologizing to the parents. The parents, who were furious that their own child had come home beaten, had no choice but to lower their raised fists when they heard what their own child had done. They only had themselves to blame.</p>



<p>Above all, the atmosphere in the class was terrible.</p>



<p>Takayama and the others were scared to death, and they looked like different people. All they could do was to watch the expression on Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s face. They had to pay for all the textbooks that had been scribbled on. Takayama and the others were the ones who had slashed the cloth bag with a knife, but Yukito Kokonoe had no mercy and hit them again.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible of him to treat Kokonoe-kun like a criminal!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me, you&#8217;re annoying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Akari Kazahaya tried to flatter him, but it was too late for her. Okamoto, the source of all this, was becoming more and more isolated and out of place, but no one could do anything about it, not even his homeroom teacher, Suzuka Sanjoji. After all the commotion, the other classes knew about it, and it was difficult to even move from one class to another. And Okamoto, who could no longer tolerate the environment, would be transferred to a different school at a later date.</p>



<p>Misaki Himiyama was at her limit. It was too much for a single intern.</p>



<p>Still, her pride and joy told her that she could not go on like this. She knew that she could not allow things to end like this, so she desperately endured the little time she had left.</p>



<p>How could she be forgiven? How could she get her message across? Even if she could escape from this situation, Suzuka Sanjoji would not be able to escape from it. She would have to continue as a homeroom teacher in a broken class. That is also a concern.</p>



<p>Now the relationship with Suzuka Sanjoji is more than just that of senior and junior. A strange friendship has developed. Or perhaps they are accomplices in the same crime. They kept in close touch and talked about many things.</p>



<p>Why did I want to become a teacher?</p>



<p>What did I want to do with my time as a teacher?</p>



<p>I love children.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I believed it was my calling.</p>



<p>I never wanted to step on anyone&#8217;s toes.</p>



<p>I never wanted to hurt anyone.</p>



<p>And yet, the reality was so heartless.</p>



<p>I was too stupid.</p>



<p>The only way she could support herself was to believe that improving her relationship with him, even if only a little, was the last thing she could do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today is the last time that Misaki-sensei will be with us. Let&#8217;s have a round of applause.&#8221;</p>



<p>Crackling and coarse applause echoes. There is no sense of fulfillment, no sense of accomplishment, no sense of being spared. Of course. All I did was bring discord and disintegration to this class. I wish I had never come here. It&#8217;s probably better that they don&#8217;t say so to my face.</p>



<p>Greeting the students. I look at him and see indifference.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>I don&#8217;t think he is listening to me at all. But it couldn&#8217;t end like this. There was no way it could end.</p>



<p>So Misaki Himiyama went to him.</p>



<p>And she bowed deeply.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am truly sorry. I should have believed you. I should have listened to you. I know it is unforgivable to apologize now. Still, please let me apologize. I have put your parents through a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether he understood or not, she could not read anything from his expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;These are my feelings. I want you to read them when you get home.&#8221;</p>



<p>She handed him the letter. It was the one Misaki Himiyama had written yesterday after staying up all night.</p>



<p>She rewrote it over and over again. It was important to apologize in words, but she wanted to leave something tangible. Despite the fact that this had happened, Misaki wanted to believe that everything she had done up to that point had meaning.</p>



<p>The letter was filled with all of her feelings.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="inpost" id="pw-inarticle-container">
    <div id="pw-inarticle-placeholder"></div>
</div></div>




<p>It was a sin that Misaki Himiyama was willing to atone for, but at the same time, it might have been an indulgence that she wanted to be forgiven for.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe ignores her and heads straight for the classroom exit, carrying his school bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, goodbye.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus, Misaki Himiyama&#8217;s heart was broken and she gave up her career as a teacher.</p>
