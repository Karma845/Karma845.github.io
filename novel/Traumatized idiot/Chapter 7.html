<h3>Chapter 7 - The Lights of thr Shimmering Flames.</h3>

<p>I see, Yuuri-san is a b*tch!”<p>I had found the answer to my question. I had spent the last night trying to figure out why my sister had kissed me out of the blue. But since I couldn’t come up with an answer, I kept pondering it at school, and finally I found the answer. The Yuuri Kokonoe is a b*tch theory.</p><p>I have never heard of my sister dating anyone, but she is such a beautiful woman. She must be popular. She must have had one, two, ten or twenty boyfriends in the past. She might be a “pure, innocent, neat and tidy” type of b*tch. I’ve learned something about my sister’s background that I didn’t expect, but don’t worry, it won’t change my attitude!<p>“I’m afraid that our class is the only one who got a really high average score on this test.”<p>A bewildered Sayuri Sensei said that. With Golden Week coming up, the tests had begun to be returned.<p>It was no surprise that the average score was so high. The study sessions were a great success every day and the number of participants was increasing day by day. Even Kamishiro seemed to have a very good understanding of the test this time. As for me, it was business as usual, but the test was nothing more than a child’s play to me. Sorry, lie. I just said it was nothing more than a child’s play. It’s cool, right?<p>Not surprisingly, I came in third overall in my grade. Let me tell you, I’m not the smartest guy in the world. I was a sad Lonely Wolf student with no hobbies and nothing to do but work out or study at home.</p>

<p>“You can even study, huh”<p>“Don’t talk to me like a usual person, you fresh and handsome guy.”<p>Why is he talking to me like usual? Then, what was that match all about? It was a complete waste of a bone. I’m not a bone-jointed person.<p>“Don’t say like that. That’s awesome, Yukito. I’m in 10th place.”<p>“That’s just plain awesome.”<p>“It sounds like sarcasm to me.”<p>“If you’ve got time for me, you’ve got time for Kamishiro.”<p>“I’m starting to get angry.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t have enough serotonin? You need to eat more soy and dairy.”<p>“That’s how people talk as a lord, Miki-chan….”<p>“Aren’t those two crazy? I was about to get a red mark. ……”<p>“Forget about the test! You know what, why don’t we all go out and have fun during Golden Week?”<p>Elizabeth is smiling as she speaks to me. Golden week? There was no need to restate it. In short, it is a period of consecutive holidays. As a pattern of my behavior, I am kidnapped to Sekka’s house during this period every year. If I don’t go, she cries. I can’t help it. And I was welcomed like Urashima Taro invited to the Dragon’s Palace at Sekka’s house.<p>“Look, Kouki. You’ve been invited. That’s why people are so full of life.”<p>“You too, apparently.”<p>“Haa? I’m a loner, a gloomy person, and my classmates would never invite me out to play with them, you know? You, stop talking nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You too, Kokonoe-kun!”<p>“Are you for real ……?”<p>“Why are you so surprised? And I don’t exclude someone like this with such impunity!”<p>“Aah, I see! So if you’re going exclude me, you’re going to do it in the shadows! As expected from the quintessential Elizabeth. Hahahaha.”<p>“I would never do that?!”<p>“It’s okay! I’m used to it! You can keep on excluding me!”<p>Elizabeth was taken aback. That’s funny. I thought I was being considerate, but did I do something wrong? The presence of someone like me only makes the atmosphere worse. This very situation proves it. Whenever I say something, the air is usually like this. That’s me, the PM9 Yukito, not PM2.5. It is no exaggeration to say that I am the house dust in this class. An air purifier is needed, and a HEPA filter must be installed in front of me.<p>“Kokonoe-chan, don’t you want to go play with us?”</p>

<p>“It’s fun to think about it!”<p>Miki Mineta is a gal. She looks, talks and acts like a gal herself. That means she might be a b***h. If so, I wonder if she has anything in common with my sister. I’m a loner. I am not a b*tch<em>. There is no way I can understand the principle of </em>b*tchy behavior but Mineta might be able to understand why my sister acted the way she did.<p>“By the way, Mineta. You’re b*tch, right?”<p>“H-Haa!? That’s terrible, Kokonoe-chan. I’m not such a cheap woman!”<p>“What, you’re not? I said something rude. I’m sorry.”<p>“U-uhm,…… I don’t like it when you apologize so honestly,……, but what is it?”<p>“I wanted to ask you something.”</p>

<p>“Could that be ……?”<p>In a small voice, she asked, “Does that mean you asked me if I was a b***h?” I could hear Mineta’s face turning red as she muttered and mumbled, but I could hear her all the way through. But what did she mean by that! I had no idea what she meant, so there was nothing I could do about it even if I could hear her.<p>“Just the other day, Yuuri-san—- my sister kissed me out of the blue, and I was wondering what this means. I thought Mineta might know something about it.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, a scream echoed through the class.<p>Eh, what’s wrong?! Did something happen?!</p><p>Jiiii, gazes pierce my body. I wonder if animals kept in zoos feel like this?<p>The man who is treated as a pet in the second grade classroom is me, Yukito Kokonoe.<br>At noon, Yuuri-san gave me an order to come to her classroom. I was summoned half-way by force, but there was no right of refusal. Yuuri-san is a permanent member of the board of trustees, and I am a non-permanent member. The world is so unreasonable.<p>I was made to sit next to Yuuri, and in front of me were two female students who appeared to be my sister’s friends.</p>

<p>However, the whole classroom was listening in. Ah, but this is the same in my class!<p>“So you’re Yuuri’s younger brother, the one I’ve heard so much about. You don’t look much like her.”<p>“I agree. I’ve always had my doubts.”<p>“You made your mother cry before, and you haven’t stiffened up about it yet?”<p>“That’s right, senpai. Please don’t be rude!"</p><p>Ah, my sister, this is the one who is really pissed off. I have no belief in self-assertion, so I’m not afraid to change my tune.<p>“You’re too sensitive, you know. ……. So, I had a lot of questions. First of all, there’s that one. How much of the student body president thing is true?”<p>Isn’t this a great chance to dispel the rumors?</p>

<p>The second year students have much more influence than the first year students. If I said something in Yuuri’s presence, it would be known as fact. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<p>“For crying out loud, It’s a total lie. The information has to be correct. Listen to me. President Kedou did not get down on her knees to become a s*x friend, but she got down on her knees and said she wanted to become friend with–“<p>“Haa?”<p>Yuuri’s anger peaked immediately. Is that a devil’s face?<p>“Listen, little brother. Is …….. there any different?”<p>“There are some differences. Uhm………….. mainly in the order and so on.”<p>“Almost all of it is true!”<p>Isn’t there some kind of buzz in the classroom? I can hear voices like, “Serious….”</p>

<p>“That woman! I’m recalling her. Prepare for a vote of no confidence immediately. ……”<p>“Wait a minute? Come to think of it, I don’t think the president said a word about that.”<p>“T-That’s right! He was so harassed for nothing, but that president would never say something so outrageous, right? What the heck. I’m relieved that rumors are just that, rumors!”<p>“I remember now, too. The president told you to embrace her.”<p>“It’s not a rumor! You’re saying it! It’s all black, there’s not even room for misunderstanding!”<p>“You’ve got a shocking revelation at lunchtime ……. What are we going to do about this air ……”<p>Instead of listening, many of the seniors are sitting facing me. Greetings, audience members.<p>“So what do you think, little brother?”</p>

<p>“To be honest, I think I have about a 50-50 chance of winning against the president. And she’s beautiful.”<p>“Ha?”<p>“Temptation is not an option for me.”<p>“You have me, don’t you?”<p>“Yes.”<p>I had no freedom of speech. The Constitution doesn’t guarantee it.<p>“Hey. Then. How about Yuuri at home? Do you know? She’s very popular.”<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“….I’m not happy about it.”<p>“There you go, appealing that you are not interested in that kind of thing. disagreeableness.”<p>Nihi, Yuuri’s friend was grinning at her and stirring up trouble.</p><p>“It makes me happy that you’re so well-liked and popular, Yuuri?”<p>“—! That’s right. I am very popular. You can expect more from me in the future.”<p>“I think…. Yuuri’s weak point is her younger brother.”<p>The senior is dumbfounded, but there is no such thing as a weakness in an older sister.<p>“So, how are things at home?”</p>

<p>“Yuuri at home? Yes, right. She is often in her underwear.”<p>“If you tell them any more about it, I’ll sleep in your bed today. If you don’t like that—-“<p>“She often drinks milk in her underwear.<p>“?!”<p>Yuuri is astonished. She looked like she couldn’t believe it.<p>If Yuuri wants to sleep in my bed, I’ll just sleep on the sofa in the living room. There was no way I could refuse. I’m sure she’d like to sleep with a fresh feeling once in a while.<p>“Hahaha! Is that why Yuuri is so well-developed? You’re funny, little brother!”<p>Actually, I think it’s genetic.</p>

<p>“No way you wanted to sleep with me …….Understood. I’ll get ready and we’ll go.”<p>“Yeah?”<p>I feel like we’re not on the same page, but that’s the way it’s always been.<p>“Right, there is no doubt that SNS will be crowded for a while again. Even though there is a lot of talk about the little brother these days.”<p>“Is that so?”<p>“Don’t you know? You have been getting a lot of attention.”<p>“I don’t do SNS, group chat, egosearch, etc.”<p>“This kid doesn’t even look at his phone much.”</p>

<p>“Heh. That’s rare nowadays, isn’t it? But maybe it’s better that way. It is also possible that he may be shocked by the content. Well, your brother seems to be bold, so I guess he’ll be fine.”<p>“He’s just saying whatever he wants, for better or worse. It was interesting and I want to hear more about it.”<p>“By the way, do you prefer with pajamas? I don’t have to”<p>“I don’t understand the question at all.”<p>People like to gossip. It is a pastime that has existed since time immemorial.<p>And yet, it is not uncommon for gossip to become a tail and for the content of the gossip to change.<p>What is true and what is a lie? They spread and spread without any room for explanation.<p>Rumors are uncontrollable monsters. Perhaps that is what it is.</p>

<p>Is it curiosity or malice? Whatever the emotion, it is fear.</p><p>–For those who are targeted, it is enough to cause deep wounds.</p><p>In reality, schools are surprisingly boring. There is no student council with immense power, no newspaper club that writes weekly-like scoops, and no armband-wearing disciplinary committee that pours its heart and soul into enforcing school rules. Nor is the vice principal behind it. There is no such thing as rumor mongering. Mastermind of what?</p><p>However, the daily routine, in which no such incident should have occurred, was different on this day.<p>When I arrived at school, rubbing my sleepy eyes, I found that the classroom was abuzz.<p>The air was heavy, and all eyes were on me at once. Scary!<p>“Ah, kokonoe-chan. Good morning.”</p><p>“Yukito, I’ve been waiting for you!”<p>The unusually fresh and handsome man was hesitating and holding back.</p>

<p>The other members of the group, including Mineta, Sakurai, Takahashi, and others, gathered around the desk.<p>“Kokonoe went to the same school as Suzurikawa, right? I thought you might know something about her.”<p>“Suzurikawa-san doesn’t talk much about herself in detail. That’s why I was waiting for Kokonoe-kun.”<p>“Is something wrong?”<p>“As I thought, Yukito doesn’t know about this. Look at this for a moment.”<p>The content of the frown involuntarily frowned.<p>“A caste subversion?”<p>“Yesterday, all of a sudden, it just poured in.”</p>

<p>The list of unbearable slanderous words targeted at Suzurikawa. The story of her junior high school days is also exposed. Perhaps it is a past that she does not want to be touched. Some of the information is obvious at first glance, but there are also things I don’t know about.<p>“Suzurikawa is two-timing? But she said she broke up with her senpai. ……”<p>“Do you know anything about that?”<p>“I heard her say so herself. It didn’t seem like a lie to me.”</p><p>“I knew it was a hoax.”<p>Some of the posts included childish posts that were clearly personal. Was it an intentional fake or does a shred of truth exist? Although no one but the author knows the truth, at the very least, the person who wrote this has a grudge against Suzurikawa. That much is certain.<p>“…… I wonder if she is alright, Suzurikawa-san”<p>“This kind of lame stuff isn’t popular nowadays.”</p>

<p>“So the author is bored. What are you going to do about it, Kokonoe?”<p>“What am I going to do…… It’s up to Suzurikawa.”<p>Guys, aren’t you asking the wrong person? I don’t want you to ask me about Suzurikawa ……<p>Although the way they are doing it is malicious, it is also poor harassment. I don’t know what Suzuriakwa thinks about it, but as long as they haven’t directly touched her, it’s not impossible to ignore it if I want to.<p>There is no guarantee that this will end well, but on the other hand, if they do anything more than this, they will be taking a considerable risk. If the culprit is revealed, there is a possibility that disciplinary action will be taken. Is there someone who would go to such lengths to bring down Suzurikawa? How serious they are about this is not clear from this.<p>However—-</p>

<p>“The culprit is here!”<p>I declare in a high voice, and the whole class reacts with a jolt. That’s right, I’m sorry.<p>“Eh, eh, Is it true, Yuki!?”<p>“I just wanted to say it personally, but it doesn’t seem to be in this class.”<p>“Ha? What do you—-“<p>In the first place, the most suspicious people are those in the same class. However, Suzurikawa is not the type of person who would be the target of bullying, and there is no group that would be hostile to her.<p>The group of people gathered here, led by a refreshingly good-looking guy, is the center of the class, the natural enemy of the yokai. If they did a poor imitation, the culprits might be ostracized.<p>“Well, I guess we’ll just have to ask Suzurikawa.</p>

<p>“I know, right …… Please, Kokonoe-chan.”<p>“—-Hmm? So why me? Eh, am I going to do that?”<p>I twisted and turned my head, but was slapped on the back. So why me!<p>But such concerns ended in vain.<p>It was because Suzurikawa was absent from school due to illness.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p>“I’m counting on you, Kokonoe.”<p>“Seriously, I can’t do it.”<p>I was called into the teacher’s office and given a printout of an assignment by my homeroom teacher. It was for Suzurikawa, not mine.<p>“You have free time after school anyway, so you can work that much. You guys are in the same junior high school, so you must be close.”<p>Two days off is a fair amount. But that doesn’t seem to be the reason I was called here.<p>“Please do me a favor. I understand the situation to some extent, but you are the only person that Suzurikawa is actively talking to, and I don’t think it can go on like this. If the situation persists, I will of course take care of it.”<p>The opinion of Sayuri-sensei was the most reasonable, but even so, I did not nod my head in agreement.</p>

<p>“It is impossible for me to do something even if you say so.”<p>“Why are you so adamant in your refusal? I don’t know about your relationship, but is there a reason for it?”<p>“I’m banned from the Suzurikawa’s house.”<p>“Banned?!”<p>Yes, that’s right. I was banned by Akane, Hinagi’s mother, when I was in the eighth grade. In the past, there were some family exchanges, but now she has flatly refused me, telling me not to come back. Even with this, I used to be invited to Christmas, but now it’s a nostalgic memory. So, as much as I’d like to do the teacher a favor, it’s realistically difficult. I swear, okay?<p>“What did you do, you ……?”<p>“It’s a difference of opinion.”<p>The reason I was banned was because I didn’t live up to Akane’s expectations.</p>

<p>And neither Hinagi nor her sister, Hiori, knew about it. It was a secret between me and Akane-san.<p>“Aah mou! It is only a meeting. I don’t know what you did that got you banned, but at this point, go apologize. And while you’re at it, go talk to Suzurikawa and see what she has to say. Here, let me buy you a cup of coffee.”<p>The teacher pushed a piece of printout in my face. I was paid off with 100 yen. Sensei, you’re ten yen short.</p><p>I came here with a bad feeling. That selfish teacher.<p>“I haven’t been here for two years.”<p>I stopped in front of the entrance with the nameplate “Suzurikawa” on it. The last time I went back here, I had to turn around and go back.<p>I don’t like it,……, I don’t know what to do. I’m not at all interested in it, to be honest. I might as well just shove it in the mailbox and go home. No? Please, I press the chime, hoping that Hinagi will answer.<p>“…… Yes. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m soooooooorrrrryyyyyy!”<p>As soon as I saw who opened the door, I got down on my knees. When it comes to this, the first move is the only one that counts. I will push through with force!<p>“It’s been a while, Akane-san! You look so beautiful today, too. No, it’s not that. I refuse. However, I only came here because my homeroom teacher insisted on it, and I did not neglect my promise to Akane-san. I am fine. I will make sure that this kind of thing will not happen in the future. So, please forgive me for this one time. And you are always so beautiful. Ah, this is an assignment for school and an assortment of jellies. My classmates are worried about her. Well, the crows are cawing now, so I’m going home.”<p>“Yukito-kun”<p>That’s strange, I can’t move forward? I greeted her and hurried to retreat, but she gripped me from behind by the collar of my uniform. I fearfully turned around. Akane-san was smiling, but there were blue streaks floating on her face.<p>“What are you doing?”<p>“I-I thought I might be disturbing you if I stayed too long. ……”<p>She seemed to be angry. I tried to flirt with her a little, but it had no effect.</p>

<p>Akane is young. At a quick glance, she looks like the eldest of the three Suzuriakwa sisters, but she is an admirable mother who cares about her daughter. It was only natural that I was banned.</p>

<p>“You know, …….Haa. At any rate, I appreciate you bringing it. Thank you. But still—–I wasn’t expecting you.”<p>“Me neither. I’m really sorry, I think it’s just for today.”<p>Once again, I bow deeply. I’ve made her feel bad. Suddenly, Akane-san’s eyes sharpened.<p>“Was it your intention to come here?”<p>“No. As I said before, I was forced by my homeroom teacher to come here. All I did was say no properly. I had no intention of coming. That was the deal.”<p>“………I see. I guess you don’t want to come after all.”<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“……–Why are you! ……No, it’s nothing. I’m sure she’ll be fine tomorrow. Next time she takes a day off or something, you don’t have to bring it.”<p>“Thank you for your time.”<p>“Bye-bye, Yukito-kun.”<p>Akane-san’s expression distorts for a moment, then quickly returns. This is good. I cannot be antagonistic.<p>Silently, the front door closed without being seen off.</p>

<b >[Hinagi’s Mom PoV]</b>

<p>I feel the urge to vent my outrage. Hateful things haven’t changed.<p>It’s ridiculous. The promises never existed. I know that.</p>

<p>If he had told me that he had come to see me for my daughter’s sake, or because he was worried about her, I would have welcomed him with open arms. I could have invited him to dinner and had a nice conversation with him.<p>I was really happy that he came today. I was sure he would be fine.<p>And yet… It wasn’t his own choice? Is that really true? He was such a good friend to her, but he doesn’t think anything of it? I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s really thinking.<p>There is no doubt that my daughter is at fault. It doesn’t help that she got what she deserved as a result.<p>That’s why I wanted him to tell me. I wanted him to say that he would save her next time, that he would protect her, and that he would never let go of her hand again.<p>Even if it was the parent’s ego, I wanted to hear it from his own mouth. Perhaps I wanted to be reassured. I asked him a question as if testing him, and he accepted my request without any rebuttal and gave up on everything.<p>After that, he never came to this house again. Just as I had said.<p>Hinagi, who had recently been getting brighter and brighter, was not feeling well and was shut up in her room. Finally, she started to smile. I thought things had blown over. Just then.</p>

<p>“–Oh, wait! Hiori.”<p>Perhaps noticing him, Hiori slips aside and runs out.<p>Not good. If Hiori finds out that I told Yukito not to come to my house, she will be furious.<p>I think Hinagi is with me on that, but the sisters’ quarrel is smoldering in a lull. It might ignite again. At that time, Hinagi was scared. Even my husband, who was trying to calm her down, was dismayed because he didn’t know what to do. I pressed my forehead against the dull pain. It was a very troublesome thing.<p>It seems that everyone in this house, including me, is somehow concerned about him, who looks so familiar to me as a young child.</p><p>“Onii-chan!”<p>“Is that you, Hiori-chan?”<p>For a moment, the figure I caught in my field of vision as I turned around looked like Hinagi Suzurikawa.<br>But it couldn’t be. There is only one person who calls me Onii-chan.</p>

<p>The younger sister of Suzurikawa, Hiori Suzurikawa, who came running to me, hugged me. She is a beautiful girl with a strong resemblance to Akane-san, but she is not in 2P color, and she is full of her own charm. Yet, she still retains the innocence of a junior high school student.<p>“I missed you, Onii-chan!”<p>“It’s been a long time. I’ll give you candy canes.”<p>“Yeey!”<p>The neighborhood auntie system. I took the candy out of my pocket and handed it to Hiori-chan.<p>“Have you been chasing me?”<p>“Yes. I felt Onii-chan’s presence.”<p>“Are you a martial arts expert?”</p>

<p>Something like a martial arts master. ……….. What presence?<p>” Are you visiting my sister? Why didn’t you come to her room?”<p>“I can’t go into a girl’s room. Besides, I just brought a school assignment.”<p>I’m not going to mention the fact that I’m banned from the house. I think Hiori-chan is going to get angry.<p>“If it’s Onii-chan, you’re always welcome, you know?”<p>Eventhough we are on the street, albeit a small one. Please don’t hug me.<p>“Ah, that’s right. Hiori-chan, are you in a fight with Hinagi?”<p>“Eh,……, ah, yes,……. Haha. Did you ask my sister about it?”</p>

<p>“I heard she was worried about it.”<p>‘It’s my sister’s fault, she deserved it. –and I still can’t forgive her.”<p>Hiori’s expression, which had been smiling, darkens.</p><p>And that’s not all. She seems to be suffering again.<p>“That much?”<p>“Yes, since yesterday, she hasn’t come out of her room. Do you know anything about that, Onii-chan?”<p>“I can predict. Probably.”<p>Hiori’s hug became tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>“You know. I think my sister is the worst. She’s an idiot, really. But, Onii-chan. Will you help her? You’re the only one I can trust. I just want you to look at her one more time.”<p>“I don’t think that’s what she wants.”<p>“Why? That can’t be true. Onee-chan has always waited for Onii-chan. Because Onee-chan has always been Onii-chan’s…..”<p>Her serious gaze shot through me. Come to think of it, she said the same thing.<p>And I denied her words—- let just hear her out.<p>“Of course, me too you know?”<p>She is a little devil. The straightforward Hiori-chan may be a much more formidable foe than her older sister.</p><p>Aah mou, no choice! The only reason I did this was because Hiori-chan asked me to do it. I’m such a kind Onii-chan.</p>

<p>After taking a bath and finishing my studies, I check the clock. It was too early to go to bed, and Suzurikawa should be awake too.<p>I made up my mind to call him. I never thought I would have to call him twice in such a short period of time.<p>[“….Yukito?”]<p>Unexpectedly, the connection is immediately through the line, although I had heard that he was in a quiet mood.<p>But from the sound of her voice, she’s terribly tired. My mentality is stronger than adamantite, but not everyone can be like that. It is normal to feel shocked, depressed, and exhausted after being exposed to bare malice like that.<p>“You need help right now. Are we clear?”<p>[“…… Eh? What are you ….”]<p>“I’ll be straight to the point. I’m going to get this sorted out in a week. So come to school tomorrow.”</p>

<p>[“Why …… Yukito …… why are doing this?”]<p>“I told you before, Suzurikawa. If you are in trouble, if you need help, you have to tell me. Don’t take everything on yourself. You have family and friends. Everyone is worried about you.”<p>The tone of her voice lowers and sobs begin to mingle with her voice.<p>[“I don’t know why I’m doing this ……. I made up my mind. I decided that this time I wouldn’t make a mistake…….”]<p>I just listen silently to the words that begin to spill out.<p>[“The other day he confessed to me. I …… but I turned him down properly ……. I didn’t want to betray myself again. …… I wanted to be strong. To be able to stand next to you without pretending, to be able to support you. I wanted to be with you. And yet……”]<p>Suzurikawa reveals the feelings she has been harboring.<p>The thoughts begin to turn to the exposed emotions as they are.</p>

<p>[“Can I ask you one question?”]<p>“Sure”<p>[“If …… I am what the rumors say I am, will you still help me, Yukito?”]<p>“Does it matter?”<p>Wishes don’t come true and hopes don’t bear fruit.<p>It is always that repetitive, and I gave up seeking something.</p><p>Still, if someone wanted me, I should at least be willing to comply.<p>I wanted to believe that I was worth that much.</p>

<p>[” …….I hate it. I don’t like being looked at like that anymore. I don’t want to be tied to the past…….I don’t want to be away from Yukito. I don’t want to be the fake me! I will be strong. Watch me. So, please. For the last time,…… I’ll end my weakness. That’s why one more time……Yu-chan”]<p>She gasped for breath. As if to say —- she released the words.<p>[“—-Save me!”]<p>“Get yourself in shape and get some sleep.”<p>I hang up the phone. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.<p>It was strange. I had always thought that we would never cross paths again.<p>Ever since the moment she shook my hand that day.</p>

<b>[Third person PoV]</b>

<p>“This cannot be true!”<p>“How terrible …… For Yuki to do this …….”<p>Mihou was indignant. But it was not only Mihou.<p>The whole class is frowning in unison. The expression on the face of Hinagi Suzurikawa, who was also involved in the incident, was completely blue.<p>It was last night that the accusation was circulated.<p>They rushes to contact him, but receives no reply. The same is true of the case against Suzurikawa, but it is indeed unforgivable. The viciousness was beyond the limit. No matter what it takes, they will cooperate with him and find the culprit.<p>As Mihou firmly vows to do so, the person in the middle of all this arrives at school, looking as usual aloof and unperturbed as ever. Whether he knows or not, it is impossible to read from his expressionless face.<p>“Yukito! Look at this.”</p>

<p>A number of students gather around Yukito Kokonoe. Yukito froze at the screen shown to him.<p>“Look, this was messaged to me yesterday. This is absolutely unforgivable! I can’t believe they did to Kokonoe-chan!”<p>“What are you going to do about it, Yukito? Do you want to talk to the teacher?”<p>No one believed it. It’s too ridiculous.<p>—-Yukito Kokonoe spreading the Suzurikawa hoax.<p>It was a shocking accusation. When he was in junior high school, he spread a false rumour about what had happened to him because he was angry at being rejected by Hinagi Suzurikawa. The whole slander and hatred against his childhood friend was the work of Yukito Kokonoe.</p>

<p>Not only that. —-Yukito Kokonoe was insulated by his sister, Yuuri Kokonoe.<p>Sensationalist words leapt to the surface. It was nothing but malice itself.<p>It is a despicable and blasphemous method that only seeks to bring down the person Yukito Kokonoe.<br>Its credibility is not even worth mentioning. Because it is nothing more than a very poor lie.<p>Obvious, vulgar gossip that can’t even keep up appearances.<p>“Yukito …… no …… why …… this, this is not how—–!”<p>The red-eyed Hinagi Suzurikawa approaches the Yukito Kokonoe, dizzy, perhaps from tears and swelling.<p>There is no one in this class who doesn’t know that Suzurikawa has feelings for Yukito Kokonoe. That is why they cannot tolerate false rumours that tear them apart.<p>They have to move immediately. No one would keep quiet after having gone to such lengths.</p>

<p>This was the general consensus, and no one took the accusations seriously.<p>“W-why is this…. No! I didn’t do it!”<p>“W-what’s the matter, Yukito?”<p>The unfamiliar and dismayed appearance of Yukito caused a murmur to spread out like a wave.<p>“Yukito, no! This is not what I–! “<p>“Believe me, Suzurikawa! I didn’t do this!”<p>Interrupting Suruzikawa’s words, Yukito Kokonoe runs out of the classroom as if to escape.<p>He disappears, brushing aside a few onlookers who were watching him from afar in the corridor.</p>

<p>As they followed the scene with their eyes, Mihou was annoyed by a feeling of discomfort that he could not shake off.<p>“That idiot ……, What are we going to do now?”<p>“I’ve never seen Yuki like that …….”<p>“Kokonoe-chan was shocked, wasn’t he?”<p>“I see! That’s it, Mineta!”<p>The nature of the discomfort. Mihou notices this and turns to Suzurikawa.</p>

<p>“That man with the strongest mentality who doesn’t look at social networking sites at all shouldn’t be shocked. What a whitewashed imitation. Isn’t that right, Suzurikawa?”<p>The question made her body tremble.<p>At this moment, only Hinagi Suzurikawa was aware of this. What Yukito Kokonoe is trying to do.<p>She clenched her fists tightly. When she thought about it, all her life, she had only been protected.<p>(…… Yukito, you told me. You told me not to hold it all by myself —– to rely on everyone else. I’m sorry. Because of me, you are suffering so much. But I can’t let Yukito be the only one who has to deal with it. ……)<p>She asked him to help her. Such weakness on her part disgusts her. By taking advantage of his kindness, she is only using him in a one-sided way. It makes her angry at her own inadequacy in letting him take such measures.<p>Even Hinagi Suzurikawa did not fully understand. However, there are still things that she does understand.<p>The writings contained facts known only to Hinagi Suzurikawa and Yukito Kokonoe.</p>

<p>Hesitation. It would destroy what Yukito Kokonoe was trying to do for her own sake.<p>To do nothing is to deny even such resolve. And yet -.<p>(…… I will be strong. I’ve learnt my lesson. I can’t let the past haunt me, I can’t accept it.)<p>That is why she tells herself, It’s going to be okay. He’s well-liked by everyone.<p>“I’m sorry, guys. I want you to listen to me.”<p>“Suzurikawa?”<p>That is the determination of Hinagi Suzurikawa.<p>The girl who kept making mistakes is the glimmer of will to reach out to get back.</p>

<p>She continued to regret and repent. She kept wishing to return.<p>Finally, she arrived at a realisation. Instead of going back, she said, she had to go on.<p>The whole class froze when the truth was told.<p>Yukito Kokonoe is a celebrity on campus. His fame is incomparable to that of Hinagi Suzurikawa<p>Even just recently, his name was widely known. The situation spread quickly.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

“Fuhahahahaha!”<p>“Don’t laugh so high with a straight face, it’s weird.”<p>The fresh, handsome man makes a rude comment, but I forgive him because I am in a good mood.</p><p>A week has passed since then. Every day, a new story about Yukito Koknoe was being told.<p>Yes, the culprit of all this was really me. However, towards the end, I had nothing to write about and the content was quite lax. I guess that’s the limit of my imagination.<p>“He has a friendship with the president of the student council” “He treats his classmates as pets and bites them like dogs”.<p>“He is earning money from his older partner” It was still good enough up to about this point however “Unacceptable scum who use tacks to make holes in posters.” “Sweet-toothed scum.” “When buying goods at a convenience store, he always get a plastic bag.” As a result of such steady efforts, however, I am now the biggest scum in the school.</p>

<p>Day after day, night after night, I’ve been on fire, always with a full tank of high-octane petrol.<p>On the surface, the rumour that I left work early because I was so upset by the revelation of my crime is true. In reality, after going to the infirmary, I left early and spent the rest of the day working on my own performance, which is an unbecoming behaviour for a student.<p>Perhaps horrified by my scrappiness, my classmates hardly spoke to me during the week. I can say that I have returned to the way I should be as a loner, though it is only fresh and handsome.</p><p>You can probably tell by now. So I took advantage of their anonymity to snatch the culprit’s crime.<p>By overwriting the rumours, I was able to make the slanderous accusations against Suzurikawa disappear. That was the objective.<p>And that will come to an end today. Last night, the last rumour was spread.<p>A rumour that Yukito Kokonoe is threatening Koharu Sato .<p>“Kokonoe!”</p>

<p>A male student from a neighbouring class shouts into the classroom. He grabbed me by the bosom with his momentum.<p>If I get at least one punch here, everything will be resolved amicably.<p>The evil of Yukito Kokonoe has been destroyed and justice has prevailed. [Finished] ← Keep the sticker on here.<p>It is truly a gripping good and bad story. Everyone must feel refreshed.<p>His name is Yuichi Miyahara. He is a childhood friend of Koharu Sato.<p>To tell the truth, the problem was solved on the second day.<p>It was a female student called Koharu Sato who first spread a hoax about Suzurikawa on social networking sites.<p>She came crying to apologise. For her, it must have been terrifying to see how someone, who was supposed to be targeting Suzurikawa, had somehow framed me, a completely unrelated person, as the culprit, and then persistently and thoroughly humiliated me.</p>

<p>Even if she had attacked Suzurikawa further, as long as she remained anonymous, it would all be my crime.<p>In the first place, Koharu Sato deeply regretted it and did not continue after the first time. She was so riddled with guilt that she was thinking of apologising to Suzurikawa. It was at that time that this disturbance happened.<p>When I heard her story, I was troubled. I wondered whether it was really okay for it to end like this.<p>Koharu Sato and Yuichi Miyahara were childhood friends, but Yuichi Miyahara’s heart was far away from Koharu Sato.<br>In junior high school, Yuichi Miyahara was a member of the track and field team, but felt the limits of his talent and quit track and field because of his monstrous illness.</p>

<p>Koharu Sato was unhappy about this. To her childhood friend, Yuichi Miyahara is a hero. It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t become a great athlete. She just admires his dedication to track and field, and this has gradually sublimated into a love affair. She wanted him to be the cool Yuichi Miyahara.<p>However, Yuichi Miyahara gradually begins to distance himself from Koharu Sato, who urges him to return to athletics. Then, in an attempt to find a new encounter, Yuichi Miyahara confessed his feelings to Hinagi Suzurikawa.<p>It was Yuichi Miyahara who had confessed to her on the day I was peeping in with the goddess senpai.<p>When Koharu Sato researched Suzurikawa and found out about her past, she took action to prevent Yuichi Miyahara from being stolen from her.</p>

<p>But the cost was high and she was also hurt.</p><p>So here’s a revolutionary solution. First, I spread bad news about myself. It got interesting halfway through and I ended up doing it thoroughly, but it was a good thing I did it afterwards.<p>Then, when my bad reputation had spread, I spread the rumour that I was blackmailing Koharu Sato.<br>The effect was extraordinary. Yuichi Miyahara, who feared for Koharu Sato’s safety, stood in front of me like this in an attempt to rescue her.</p><p>The two must have been childhood friends after all. Even though their paths may have crossed, deep in their hearts, both of them still cherish the other. Yuichi Miyahara never wanted to abandon her.<p>There is no need for truth in this farce. It is not too late for Yuichi Miyahara.<p>With unaccustomed amusement, I whispered ugly words in Yuichi Miyahara’s ear as if to stir him up.<p>This is good. This is the right answer. The next step is for me, the root of all evil, to receive the retribution of karma.<p>“Shu-chan, stop! I knew I couldn’t do this!”</p>

<p>The one who desperately stopped the furious Yuichi Miyahara in a pathetic voice was Koharu Sato.</p><p>“Kokonoe, I’m sorry! I know it’s not something that can be forgiven even if I apologise. But I’m really sorry!”<p>“Suzurikawa-san and Kokonoe-kun, I’m sorry too!”<p>Huh? How did this happen …….<p>The sloppy plan collapsed, and the eye-witness account disintegrated.</p><p>Contrary to my expectations, the end of the project was not as tight as I had hoped, but it can’t be helped.<p>The objective was generally achieved. Koharu Sato’s attempt to apologise to Suzurikawa was stopped entirely for the sake of this moment. It was necessary to pull Yuichi Miyahara out.<p>If the conversation had ended at that point between Suzurikawa and Koharu Sato, who was about to be crushed, might not have been able to face Yuichi Miyahara. If she had tried to hide what she had done from Yuichi Miyahara, she would have carried guilt and regret with her for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>“So. Is it finally over? Explain everything from the beginning, Yukito”<p>In the end, it was all about the revenge of Yukito Kokonoe on Hinagi Suzurikawa.<p>“Isn’t that good enough?”<p>“Of course not. We heard it from Suzurikawa.”<p>“From Suzurikawa?”</p><p>“You don’t trust us that much? Are we that helpless? Don’t think that you can always manage everything on your own.”<p>“It’s properly beneficial to me too.”<p>Arrogant, haughty and selfish to any extent. It may be a means that Kouki and others cannot tolerate. Nevertheless, I think I did the best I could.</p>

<p>If I pretend that I spread Suzurikawa hoax because I was angry about being rejected, the credibility of the posts will be lost. No one will know what the truth is. The past will become ambiguous and no one will want to mention it again.<p>The past of Hinagi Suzurikawa has become inviolable, known only to her.<p>But that is not all. This plan contains tremendous advantages.<p>“Miyahara, I have one favour to ask of you.”<p>“W-what is it? Tell me anything! Anything that I can do, I will do!”<p>“Join the athletics club.”<p>“It’s ……. Is that it…..!”<p>Ugh ……. I am sorry to Miyahara-kun, who is looking at me with sparkling eyes, but I actually have no good intentions or anything.</p>

<p>There have been a series of invitations from sports clubs, but the most persistent of these has been the athletics club.<p>That’s when I came up with the idea of using this sure-footed Yuichi Miyahara as a scapegoat!<br>Eh? What’s going to happen to the refreshingly good-looking guy and Kamishiro? I don’t know. They can take care of that on their own.<p>With this, not only Suzurikawa, but also Koharu Sato and the smoldering Yuichi Miyahara can all be put to rest in a positive direction.</p><p>And above all, the number of people who approach me, a man of ill repute, will decrease, and with this I should be able to regain my ideal quiet and peaceful life as an insidious loner. I can also say goodbye to the recent school life, which has been quite noisy.<p>But still, it was extremely difficult to appease Yuuri, who had lost her temper. I can’t say now that it was actually an act of my own making, even if it’s not possible to say so.<p>At any rate, in the end it all went down the drain, but it was an epoch-making plan that killed not two birds with one stone, but five.<p>This was also possible because my mentality is as strong as an orichalcone, so I can say that everything fell into place as it should have, with no loss to anyone. It’s perfect. Nyahahahahahaha!<p>This is the closing of the show. —- but she won’t allow it.</p>

<p>“Suzu-chi, why don’t you go home?”<p>“Don’t call me that! I have someone waiting for me …….”<p>After school, when I returned after the hearing and thankful sermon of Sayuri, there was only one person left, Suzurikawa.<p>The classroom was dyed red in the evening sun, and her eyes were shining scarlet.<p>I felt nostalgic. Come to think of it, I feel like something like this happened a long time ago.<p>Yes, I’m sure she was like this that day too…<p>A throbbing headache. Fatigue had set in. I need to refuel with something sweet.<p>“Hmmm. Meeting up, huh? Get home before it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Why? I was waiting for Yukito”<p>“—-Me?”<p>“You know….Thank you”</p><p>“All I’ve done is make you hate me.”<p>“Fufu. Yeah, you’re right. Really. I hate Yukito”<p>Silence falls. Somehow, we no longer share the same time like this.<p>Or perhaps it was a misunderstanding that such a time existed.<p>“I did a terrible thing to you. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“…… Yeah.”<p>“No one can touch your past anymore.”<p>“…… yes.”<p>I do not know what Suzuriakwa was afraid of in the past.<p>When I was devoting myself to basketball with all my heart, I didn’t look at Suzurikawa.<p>If Suzurikawa was suffering, I had the chance to notice it. But in the end, I abandoned her.<p>I am not like Yuichi Miyahara. That’s why Akane-san won’t forgive me. I think that is a natural thing for a parent to do.<p>She will find a wonderful partner from now on. A partner who will meet Akane-san’s expectations.</p>

<p>“…………”<p>Suzurikawa will be safe now. She can now go on her way in the sunshine with her chest out.<p>She can’t have a hater like me around. She deserves a place of her own.<p>“— Hmmm—-!?”<p>The vision darkened and for a moment my thoughts blanked out.<p>Suzurikawa’s face is so close that even our breaths are in contact with each other.<p>I couldn’t even try to speak out. ―――― My lips are blocked.<p>“…… so far away. We used to be next to each other all the time, but now we can’t reach each other this far.”</p>

<p>Slowly our lips drift away from each other. My lungs were repeatedly contracting for fresh air.<p>“……What….”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/k5LX1Zz/afbeelding.png" alt="afbeelding" border="0"></a>

<p>“—- That day, the light that was inside me went out and I walked down a dark road. It was cold, freezing. I followed you, you who are warm. Why do you think I chose this high school? Yukito’s mother told me. —I wonder if Yuuri-san wouldn’t have told me.”<p>With a wry smile, Suzurikawa spoke in a torrent of words. The scarlet shimmering eyes were shining brightly.<p>“Please. I want you to come to my house now.”<p>–The person in front of me is Hinagi Suzurikawa, whom I don’t know.</p><p>[Hinagi Suzurikawa PoV]<p>“Onee-chan, if you don’t hurry up, we won’t have time. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes”<p>“Onii-chan will be fine. Because he promised me.”<p>How many times have I been pushed back by my sister, Hiori? At one point, things got really nasty. It was because I had betrayed Yukito. Not only my sister, but also my parents were angry with me.<p>Yuktito was well acquainted with my parents and they loved him. I have a sister, Hiori. Papa wanted a son as well. For him, Yukito was like his son. That’s why Papa used to play catch with Yukito. That’s how close they were then, and they always played together.<p>The whole family knew that I liked Yukito.<p>I think that’s why they couldn’t forgive my betrayal. The situation caused by it made me suffer in hell.</p><p>My parents had never been so angry with me before. But even that was necessary for me, someone had to be angry with me to make me feel better.<p>“Onii-chan, it’s all over the news at our place. There’s a first year in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yukito you mean. It has to be him”<p>The first year of junior high school, She intends to enrol in the same high school as me.<p>The only freshman who would be bad enough to be known to such a lightweight would be Yukito. Not much time has passed since we entered high school, but the name of Yukito Kokonoe is well known anyway. There were even people who went to the trouble of coming to see him in class.<p>“Onee-chan you really haven’t done it, have you?”</p><p>“No, I haven’t! I wound’t dare!”<p>“If that’s a lie, I’ll break it off with you. You betrayed Onii-chan yourself, and you gave yourself to that lousy, incomprehensible man.”<p>“I know that better than anyone!”<p>“Because of you, Onii-chan is hurt. I also want him to teach me how to study and stuff, but he’s changed. I feel he is further away than he used to be. If things continue as they are, Onii-chan will become an irrelevant stranger.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how it feels be be childhoodfriend again, Hiori…..”<p>I really hate myself. Selfishness and stupidity make me feel anti-heroic. I always bother him, annoy him, hurt him, betray him. And yet you try to help me.<p>And then —– a miracle happened. I couldn’t believe it.<p>Because like magic, he saved me in an instant.<p>With his lie, my past became ambiguous and dissolved into time.<p>But I couldn’t watch. I hurt myself and spouted mindless dialogue lines.<p>Day by day, Yukito’s bad reputation is spreading. It’s a needle in a haystack.<p>He bared his own heart and cut it to pieces himself.</p>

<p>That’s something I wouldn’t normally stand for. And it is he himself who is doing it.<p>He spreads his own slander and libels and humiliates himself. I don’t know what that means.<p>I am sure that only he knows. ……<p>At that time, I was only thinking of myself. I didn’t know or try to know what kind of state Yukito was in.<p>When I asked Ouka about his path, she told me a few things.<p>She couldn’t stop crying. She had been with him for a long time, but she didn’t know anything about him.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just my fault that Yukito became like that. But that doesn’t exonerate me. It doesn’t make me feel lighter.<p>Instead, I felt more guilt for hurting him more, and I was afraid to see him so close to breaking down. I thought I had no more remorse, but now he’s suffering more than before. I’m one of the people who was part of it. One of the ones who hurt him.<p>I don’t care what the consequences are. If I don’t face him, I will never be able to move on from this. I want to tell him, even if he hates me or rejects me.</p><p>“—– I will change. I won’t change my mind. I will be who I want to be. This time I will save you.”<p>I have not turned my back on him. Nobody has forgiven me, neither my heart nor my body.<p>It is too self-punishing. If this continues, surely one day he will be gone from everyone’s sight.<br>I mutter quietly. I’m going to stop running away. I’m afraid he won’t like me, so I’ll stop using that as an excuse to keep avoiding him.<p>–I’m not going to be able to do it again.<p>“Be honest, Hinagi Suzurikawa. I don’t need malice just to hurt people. A childhood friend is a defeated heroine. Even so, I–“</p>

<p>I’ve been waiting for you, Yukito.”<p>“She just got pissed off the other day. ……”<p>“What’s wrong?”<p>“……, it’s nothing.”<p>Here I am again. This is my second visit in a short period of time. Akane-san’s reverse reaction to this visit.<p>If she really begs me to come to her house, I have no choice, do I?</p>

<p>It was the first time I had seen Suzurikawa so desperate. I couldn’t ignore it.<p>I am a member of the home-school club, so after school is free time for me. It’s not like I have anything to do. It’s no problem for me.<p>Well, today was tough. I’m hungry and my head hurts.<p>In the past, we used to play together. I used to come to this house a lot. Until I moved to my current apartment, I used to live near here, and we used to interact with each other as a family.<p>It is a nostalgic memory now, and a time I can never get back.<p>I was told to wait a little while for preparations, and after waiting for about 30 minutes, I received a call from Suzurikawa. By then, it was past 19:00.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I called you.”<p>“Here, I’ll give you this.”<p>I gave her the Big Busy Bear (named after Yukito Kokonoe) that I had found while killing time at the arcade. I also reserved one for Hiori-chan and Akane-san. I was selling a lot of flattery.<p>“T-thank you! …… you have always been good at this kind of thing, you know.”<p>“I’ll call the clerk right away and have her adjust the position.”<p>“I-I see. Hiori will be very pleased.”<p>The expression on the face of Suzurikawa was very stiff. She didn’t seem to be in good shape.<p>“If you don’t feel well, can we do this another time?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I’m fine. Don’t worry.”<p>Through the living room, I was invited directly to her room. It was very different from Suzurikawa room in my memory. I sat on the cushion she had prepared for me.<p>“When was the last time I came to this room?”<p>“It’s been about three years.”<p>“How nostalgic it is. It hasn’t changed a lot.”<p>“I-Is that so? I think I’ve changed a lot, but if the Yukito says so, then I guess so. Fufu”<p>Perhaps it is because she is relaxing at home, or perhaps it is because the problem has been resolved, but it is a very natural smile that I have not seen for a long time.<p>Taking a deep breath, Suzurikawa straightens her posture.</p>

<p>“Three years, so it wasn’t that long ago. Are your parents not here?”<p>…… especially Akane-san. Is it okay for me to be here?<p>“It’s okay. But for the time being, they’ve entrusted me with everything.”<p>“It’s not okay!”<p>No good! I don’t care if you’re in charge. ……eh what?<p>I would like to ask her, but I’m sure that’s the reason why she called me here.<p>Let’s wait for her to tell me. It will make things a little easier.<p>“…..It really is just like back then.”</p>

<p>Unusually, what I was thinking in my head matched what I was saying.<p>This is extremely rare for me. Maybe it’s because I’ve been hit by nostalgia and I’m feeling a little more open-minded than I used to.<p>“Thank you for coming today.”<p>“After all that request. What do you want?”<p>“There’s something I want you to hear. And look. Look at me.”<p>As if she had made up her mind, Suzurikwa began to take off the clothes she was wearing.<p>Without any time to stop her, she took off her school uniform, and without hesitation, she even reached into her underwear, leaving her completely untouched. The sweet smell filled the room and stimulated my brain.<p>All I could do was watch. An action that could be described as delirium.</p>

<p>But all I could see was that her body was trembling.<p>“Come back to your senses, Suzurikawa”<p>Utterly ridiculous lines fly out of my mouth. It is me who is crazy. I am the one who is broken. Perhaps what I just said was wrong. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew it must be so, although I did not know what was wrong.<p>A girl is naked in front of me, and what I’m being asked to do is not to speak in such an off-color and blunt manner. But what should I say?<p>“You got it wrong. I was wrong back then! I am normal now.”<p>“What are you saying?”<p>“I have regretted it for a long time. Since that day, I cried and cried myself to sleep every day. My sister was disgusted with me, my family was angry with me, –and I hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, did you do something wrong? But that has nothing to do with me. My contact with Suzurikawa has been almost nonexistent since then.”<p>“No, it’s all my fault. Unable to be honest about my feelings and trying to know how you felt,Yukito. I unilaterally asked for you without telling you anything. A mistake I cannot regret enough.”<p>It was incoherent. Even though I understood the meaning of the words, I could not understand even a fragment of what she meant . We had not had any contact for nearly two years.</p><p>Despite appearances, I am bilingual and speak English. My test scores in both English and Japanese exceeded ninety-five. If I could not understand the problem, it was beyond the scope of what a single student could solve.<p>However, I could see in her eyes that she had not lost her senses. That is the decisive difference between me and Suzurikawa. her obsidian-colored eyes were looking straight at me.<p>“Yukito, I did not have s*x with Senpai.”</p>

<b>[Hinagi PoV]</b>

<p>“Yukito, I did not have s*x with Senpai.”<p>Expose your mind and body. I have nothing to hide. I’m done being unfaithful.<p>I have taken such a detour. I have come such a long way.<p>Now I just want to close the distance and tell him everything about myself.<p>I don’t even want to feel embarrassed.<p>” Please don’t look away. I am here. In front of you. So look.”</p>

<p>“Why are you doing this?”<p>“Because I don’t want to be misunderstood anymore.”<p>“Misunderstood?”<p>“I’ve always loved Yukito”<p>Why couldn’t I say something so simple?<p>It was just this one thing, and it had become so complicated.<p>Back then, I was impatient and irritated. I thought I was trying to be approachable.<p>But Yukito’s reaction was always blank, maybe he didn’t like me at all. I had never seen him smile even once.</p>

<p>Is it boring to be with me? I felt uneasy when I thought like that.<p>I was a cowardly person, and all I could think about was knowing how the other person felt, without telling them how I felt.<p>It was right around that time that my senpai confessed his feelings to me. I decided to take advantage of the situation. When I told him that Senpai had confessed his feelings to me, he replied, [Is that so], as if it was nothing, like he always does.<p>I wanted to scream out. Are you sure you want to go out with a senpai? Don’t you think anything of it? Would you be okay with me being stolen from you? Shocked and saddened, I clung to the last hope I had. If I went out with senpai, he might be jealous of me.</p><p>If so, there was still a chance, I thought, and foolishly took the wrong path.<p>If I had been as honest then as I am now, this would not have happened. I should have faced the situation honestly and put my feelings into Yukito’s face.<p>What I did was the worst thing I could have done. I did not tell senpai anything, I just tried to take advantage of him. I had no feelings for my senpai. I didn’t even know what kind of person he was. It was just convenient for me to know how Yukito felt about me.<p>That mistake soon turned into regret. When I told him that I went out with senpai, he told me that he was going to confess his feelings to me. I froze.</p>

<p>Why, why didn’t you tell me just a little bit sooner?<p>I wanted to throw it all away and respond. The words I had always wanted to hear. My wish.<p>But now I can’t respond to them unless I settle my relationship with my senpai.<p>I felt like Yukito’s eyes were getting darker and darker, as if he was stagnant.<p>It had been two weeks since I started dating Senpai. There was nothing like being a lover.<p>Of course not. I had no such feelings. I had no interest in senpai.<p>He was an unimportant person. Now that I knew how Yukito felt about me, it was just too much trouble. If only I had paid a little more attention to the man and investigated him, I would have never thought of going out with him. It was all my own fault.<p>Perhaps he was annoyed with me, but he was very aggressive in kissing me.</p>

<p>It was disgusting. It was impossible! How could I be with such a person? I only have Yukito! Horrified with goosebumps and refusal to be defiled, I pushed Senpai away with all my might and ran out of the place when I realized.</p><p>When I got home, I sent a text message to Senpai saying let’s break up.<p>From then on. Rumors began to circulate that I had had s*x with him.<p>He was so angry that he told everyone that he had a physical relationship with me.</p><p>Rumors like that spread quickly. For an adolescent junior high school student, it is just good entertainment. I tried my best to deny it, but my denial was only accepted by those around me.<p>There was no way I could do such a foolish act as going around talking to strangers and telling them that I was not having s*x with him and most people don’t care about the truth or falsehood of rumors.<p>After that, the rumors became more extreme, and the relationship with an older student, who never existed, had deepened considerably.<br>The lowly stares of the boys that I was exposed to crawled all over my body as if they were licking my skin.<p>A relationship is a contract. It is concluded under the mutual consent of both parties. It was the same with the breakup.</p>

<p>I received a confession from senpai, but I didn’t do anything that would be considered a lover, I didn’t even acknowledge him as my lover, and I unilaterally broke up with him. I just pushed him around. I got what I deserved.<p>I guess Senpai had his pride. He did not immediately say that he had broken up with me.<p>They say that a rumor lasts 75 days, but after 75 days, it is no longer a rumor but a fact. I cursed my senpai. Why had he lied so terribly?</p><p>But the worst part was the same for me. I was a lousy b*tch who had accepted a confession from someone I didn’t even like and was trying to use it for my own convenience.<p>A horrible senpai and a disgusting me. It could be said that we were a perfect match.<p>Such rumors reached my sister’s ears and then my parents. My sister was fond of Yukito. I don’t know if it was because of that, but I had never seen her look at me like that before. She looked at me with contempt, as if she was looking at me like I was a piece of filth, as if I was dirty.<p>My parents called me out. I denied it. I denied that I had ever had any physical relations with him.<p>My sister and parents were furious at my behavior, my thoughts, and how it happened.</p>

<p>–Then I asked the question.<p>“Does Yukito know?”<p>He is my beloved. I don’t want him to know. I want him to believe that this is a lie.<p>Such a convenient delusion. But the rumor had spread too far. It was impossible for him not to know. The rumor must have reached the ears of Yukito.<p>And even if it was nominal, even if I was using it for my own convenience, senpai and I were supposed to be in a relationship. It is no surprise that we were engaged in such an act. This fact made the rumor stronger.</p><p>I had to clear up the misunderstanding in a hurry! Despite my impatience, I was afraid that Yukito might look at me the same way he looked as my sister, and I cowered and couldn’t move.<p>I can’t bear it if he looks at me with such eyes.<p>If he looked at me as if I were a filthy, disgusting thing, I would–.</p>

<p>I chased after him. But he was so absorbed in his club activities as if he didn’t care about anything. That fact torments me even more.<p>Does he not care about me anymore? –Please help me!<p>The heartbreaking cry never made it out of my voice, and by that time, my emotions were falling apart.<p>Yuuri, who holds Yukito in the highest regard, was furious and ordered me to never come near him again.<p>I realized too late that I had betrayed many people.</p><p>And before long, the rumors became an open fact, our relationship spontaneously disappeared, and he became a bit distant and detached again.<p>“It was my fault ……. I was the one who tried to use him for convenience. I was selfish and vicious. You must be laughing. A really helpless piece of crap. It’s all my fault. ……”<p>But I can see it now. I am sure that even without what happened with my senpai, my arrogance back then would have surely hurt him someday. Just as I have always done, because I was unable to be honest.</p>

<p>He was silently listening to my regrets. If I had talked to him right then and there, things would not have gotten so complicated. He had always listened to me. It was my fault for not facing him.<p>I pursued him all the way to high school. I had a vague but certain premonition.<p>This must be my last chance. If I missed it, our relationship would be completely over.<p>I resolved to change, but the ghosts of the past grabbed my feet again and dragged me down.<p>I didn’t know what to do, but there he was, Yukito. With his usual expression, he extended his hand to us as if it was nothing.<p>On the day of the summer festival, I was the one who shook off his hand.<p>That’s enough, Hinagi. Let’s put an end to regrets.<p>Therefore–</p>

<p>“—Let me prove it to you. I’ll give you everything I have.”</p><p>I embraced Suzurikawa, who fell straight asleep on the bed.<p>I was facing her, as if she was covering me up.<p>I was trapped in her eyes, and I could not move a single fingertip, as if I were in bondage.<p>“Suzurikawa……?”<p>“—I’ve been waiting for a day like this for a long time. I was actually dreaming of something more romantic, but I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t think I had the time for it.”<p>Aah, you have learned to laugh so beautifully.<p>It was neither the innocent smile of my childhood nor the sullen expression of those days.</p>

<p>” …… you don’t have to be in a hurry. Be calm. …… You don’t have to prove anything to me. ……”<p>“You’ve always been on my side, so I want you to be mine. I’m not going to let anyone else touch you. I’m not lying. I don’t want to lie anymore. So make sure — feel all of me.”<p>It must be something important to Suzurikawa.</p><p>I can’t do that just to prove that nothing happened.<p>“—No, you got it wrong. Touch me. I’m so happy in this moment.”<p>Laying my hands on top of each other, bringing it to her chest. Her body was hot and her heartbeat was rising.<p>“I see. I finally remembered ……. How could I have forgotten–when I was little, we were always connected to each other like this ……”.<p>Tears began to well up in her eyes.</p>

<p>I remember, too. When we were much younger, we were connected by heart, we didn’t need words. Like a broken thread that needs to be reconnected, we are now faintly connected.<p>The story of Suzurikawa was surprising, but it was also understandable.<p>At the time, I thought that was the way it was supposed to be, but there were plenty of opportunities to notice that her attitude was strange. Suzurikawa said she didn’t want me to know about it. If I couldn’t get close to her, maybe it was something that could have been resolved at that point if I had walked up to her.<p>But at that time, I was no longer looking at Suzurikawa.<p>But now that I have heard her story, all I can think about is.<p>Why, why—-<p>“W….hy, today….?”<p>“Because I was a coward, I couldn’t be honest with you. ……”</p>

<p>“Why are you telling me this now?”<p>“Because it would be too late.”<p>Why now? Why right now?<p>“Back then, I would have been able to accept your feelings. But now I’m ……”<p>The scene I remember is always tinged with scarlet.<p>I was convinced that day. I was convinced that I would not be rewarded.<p>I wanted something, I knew I couldn’t have it, and then I gave up–and lost it.<p>I can’t accept her feelings even though she wants me so much.</p>

<p>Misery does not suit such a beautiful woman.<p>A throbbing headache hits me. It is worse than ever.<p>No, don’t break. Don’t try to break. The struggle repeats itself. If I break like I always do, I won’t think about it. All this pain will disappear.<p>Come on, let’s break. As usual, when the Demon King asks me to give him half of the world, I reply without hesitation that it’s me, the heavy Yukito …… If I break down like that, I won’t care anymore. I am, I am, I am …….<p>Who is this Yukito? When did I become like that?<p>I want to break. Let’s break fast. I feel the hollow trying to expand.<p>I’ve always been broken. But if the feelings I’ve been mistaken about for so long aren’t mistaken, then what a terrible …… thing I’ve done.<p>It’s an illusion. It’s a lie. Don’t think about it. Abandon it. Let it break.</p>

<p>Maybe it is a defensive instinct. I don’t understand the feelings that others direct at me. Don’t try. I have repeatedly misunderstood. But was that really the case?<p>The feelings, hearts, and emotions of Suzurikawa flowed in as an enormous wave.<p>It was warm. It was so warm that I didn’t want to let go of it, even though it was about to spill over.<p>“”Yukito, are you all right!? You’re blue!”<p>She is worried about me, not hiding her own body, but exposing it unsparingly.<p>What is she doing this for?</p><p>Is it so easy for her to expose her body naked?<p>Why is she telling me this now?</p>

<p>Because she wants to make me suffer? If so, why is she so painfully worried about me?<p>I am about to break down, but something is putting the brakes on me, telling me not to break down.<p>Something is holding me back from letting go of this struggle.<p>I don’t want to break, I don’t want to be wrong anymore. If I go any further, it will be too late.<p>No, it’s probably already too late. Still, I don’t want to hurt anyone, and I don’t want to be hurt. The conflicting impulses swirl around me. Why do I have to suffer so much because of something like the phase of woman trouble, a ridiculous curse?<p>I don’t understand. Why don’t I try? I don’t understand. Just don’t try to understand? Everything is so empty and it tries to erase me. I wish I could just disappear and be at ease, but I feel like I’m being controlled by this fascinating desire. It was so sweet, so tempting.<p>Yes, if only I could make myself disappear—<p>Softly, my lips were sealed. It was the second time I had felt that sensation.</p>

<p>A slightly different taste. The sweet, melting sensation melted my thoughts away.<p>“It’s okay! I will never hurt you again!”<p>Suzurikawa was crying. Why is she crying? What is she sad about?<p>Is there some physical pain somewhere? Or is Suzurikawa’s oversized—-.<p>Haha, I see. I see…she’s naked, so she must have a cold tummy or something, right?<p>I shake off the haze that tries to cover my thoughts.<p>That’s not it…… stop it, that’s not how it’s supposed to be.<p>Why are you trying to mistake me? Knowingly make a mistake. She’s …… in front of me now.</p>

<p>When did this happen? When have I been led to think this way? By whom? Why?<p>I’m Yukito Kokonoe , and Yukito Kokonoe is me …….<p>“Su-Suzurikawa ……, no, Hinagi……?”<p>“You called me by my name. Hehe. My first and second kiss. Glad I gave it to them right.”<p>Can I turn it off? Really this smile. Her crying. I can erase it from my mind, and<br>I’m going to act as usual, as Yukito Kokonoe, and then–.<p>The headache intensifies. I want to erase, I want to erase.</p>

<p>I am embraced. Human skin is in direct contact.<p>I don’t know what caused it, if anything, it was everything.<p>The malice that tries to break me. The situation that tried to make me break. I kept losing it. And it was okay. It was fine. I didn’t care about anything.<p>But there must have been things I shouldn’t have lost. There must have been something I had to realize. Even if it was too late to know what it was, there was something that must not be lost.<p>“…… Hinagi, did you have such a personality?”<p>“I am a childishly naive person. I’m done being unfaithful. I didn’t want to lose as it is. I don’t want to end up hurting you.”<p>My childhood friend is a losing heroine. That’s what they say.<p>“Because I love you so much!”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to believe that her smile and words were lies.</p><p>“–! –!”<p>I heard someone’s voice. I didn’t pay attention to the voice, but was mesmerized by the sight in front of me. The spectacular view that could be seen for a long distance. The sky and the earth that seemed to absorb me forever. Just one more step, just one more step, and I could be a part of it. Subconsciously, my body is pulled in.</p><p>I was going to disappear anyway. There is no place for me. It doesn’t matter if it is now. I am worthless and unnecessary. So why not give in to this impulse? It doesn’t bother anyone. No one will be sad because of it. How endlessly it attracts me.<p>That’s why I–.<p>The rain that had begun to fall cooled my head. I was idly gazing at the puddles of water that had formed on the black asphalt. By the time I returned home from Suzurikawa’s house, the sun had completely set, and only the streetlights illuminated the darkness.<p>I continued to walk alone, wandering along the night road.<p>Suzurikawa’s body temperature was warm. However, we were not embracing each other in a frenzied embrace.</p>

<p>We were just together. I am unable to accept her feelings.<p>I could not return the same amount of feelings. That is why I did nothing.<p>But we held each other’s hands and talked. As if to make up for all the time we had spent together.<p>We were childhood friends, and our paths crossed for a change.<p>Hinagi made a mistake and lost me. Our relationship ended there.<p>But in that moment, we certainly connected.</p>

<p>That is the distance between me and Hinagi now. I keep asking myself the same question.<p>Is all that right? When did I become like this?<p>The doubts I felt at Suzurikawa’s house are still swirling around inside me.<p>With one out and a runner on first base, I, Yukito Kokonoe, would without hesitation set up an end-run, and so on. When did I become like that? I question my own thinking.<p>I feel a sense of discomfort, as if they are skewed, distorted, or twisted in some way.<br>Why didn’t I notice it? Why didn’t I question it? That was also strange.<p>A strange maldistribution of thoughts. My mentality is as strong as super-aramid fiber, but I can’t remember when that started, or even if I could, when it became so.<p>–I’m …… no, who is the Yukito Kokonoe?<p>“Fuu….”</p>

<p>I let out a big breath in front of my sister’s room.<p>If I don’t get an answer to that question, I can’t move forward. I would continue to break down and stagnate.<p>I was okay with that. I didn’t think anything about it, and it didn’t bother me.<p>But I thought that if I didn’t change, someone would probably be sad. I don’t care how much I’m hurt now, but I don’t want to hurt anyone.<p>And perhaps I have hurt someone in the past like that.<p>I knock. It’s around midnight, but I’m sure she’s still awake.<p>I mock myself. That’s enough, isn’t it? She hates me anyway, so there’s no reason for her to hate me any more than she does now. I’ ve become the worst scum of the school. Yeah, never mind. I have to find out who I am. The real me. I have to find the real me, the Yukito Kokonoe, whom I have lost sight of.<p>To do so, a different approach will be needed.</p>

<p>The opposite of what I’ve been doing, the answer may lie in what I’ve been avoiding.<br>That’s why I’m going forward. No matter how much it hurts. I am used to getting hurt.<p>But I don’t want to make anyone cry.<p>“What are you doing here at this hour?”<p>My sister in pajamas comes out. She doesn’t seem to be sleepy at all. I wondered if she had done her homework. Unlike me, she is extremely talented.<p>I wonder why there is such a big disparity between siblings.<p>However, my sister must be like my mother. She is proud of her threatening chest circumference. Hee hee.<p>“Can I talk to you for a moment, Nee-san?”<p>“You want to talk to me? That’s unusual. Come in.”</p>

<p>She lets me into her room. When was the last time I entered her room?<p>It must have been more than ten years ago. Since that day, our relationship has been like that. We didn’t interfere with each other, we didn’t look at each other, and I avoided her.<p>But did she? I think back. And why did she do it? I thought she didn’t like me. I forcefully interrupt my thoughts to try to come up with an answer that is probably wrong. Suddenly, my sister’s movements stopped.<p>“—- Eh? Wait a minute. What did you just say?”</p><p>“Nee-san? Oh, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.”<p>“Yukito ……? Yukito! Yukito—-!”<p>She hugs me. What is up with you today? It’s been a day of hugs all day long. Is it a free hug day or something? If my reason wasn’t the unsinkable battleship Yamato, I’d be in a lot of trouble, wouldn’t I? No, I’m sinking. The jokey thoughts are still accelerating. Still, let’s move forward. I can’t just end up here!</p>
