<h2>Interlude: Murderer: Yuri Kokonoe </h2>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yuri PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8211;I killed my younger brother.</p>



<p>The room, without a lock, accepted me without any resistance as I turned the doorknob.</p>



<p>It felt as if it reflected my brother&#8217;s pure and untainted heart, beautiful and unblemished. This made me feel happy.</p>



<p>With utmost care to make no noise, I closed the door quietly.</p>



<p>In the late night, amidst the darkness, the only sound I could hear was the ticking of the second hand, marking the passage of time.</p>



<p>In the center of the large bed, my brother slept peacefully, appearing comfortable and content.</p>



<p>Even my mother, who usually sleeps clinging to him, seemed to have restrained herself for three consecutive days, as if she finally exercised some self-control.</p>

<p>I also want to sleep with him, but I have to restrain myself to two nights a week. As for my mother, she gets three nights. It&#8217;s too selfish. Somehow, it has become a five-day schedule without my realizing it, but even this child needs privacy.</p>



<p>After all, he is a boy. There must be things he wants to do alone. My mother is oblivious to that.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a word for being spoiled, and the most spoiled child in our family is my mother. It&#8217;s beyond ridiculous. Is this what a mother is supposed to do? It&#8217;s truly pathetic.</p>



<p>There was a time when my mother was severely depressed, but now she&#8217;s become very lively. It&#8217;s all thanks to Yukito.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t do anything. Absolutely nothing. I can only be grateful for easing my mother&#8217;s anxiety. However, I wish she would stop being so clingy with my brother because of that.</p>



<p>My mother behaves innocently, but I know it&#8217;s all calculated.</p>



<p>Is it shameful of me to think this way? I have to protect my brother from my mother&#8217;s sinister hands.</p>



<p>Perhaps because the basketball tournament is approaching, she has been going out often on weekends. I sometimes accompany her, but overall, there didn&#8217;t seem to be any issues.</p>



<p>Although there were some irregularities at school, things are generally heading in a positive direction. It&#8217;s different from when he was in elementary and middle school, constantly exposed to malice.</p><




<p>I might be worrying too much, but I want him to enjoy his high school life without any concerns. So I quietly sit on his bed, being careful not to wake him, and gently stroke his head.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you afraid of me, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>Whispering such a question, I couldn&#8217;t gather the courage to ask for a direct answer.</p>



<p>Even though our relationship has improved a little, there are still lingering tensions.</p>



<p>My brother gives me gifts of any kind, but that is proof that he is afraid of me. He is trying to see if I am in a good mood, and acts as if he does not want to offend me. He is afraid that one day he will be betrayed again.</p>



<p>Just the other day, he gave me a piece of woodwork in my likeness. I treasure it and display it in my room, but I froze at the sight of its expression. The stern expression on its face is one of hostility. It was a glare, as if it was looking at something hostile.</p>



<p>In his eyes, I must appear that way. It&#8217;s not an exaggeration.</p>



<p>In fact, I usually have such an expression. Even my friends say I&#8217;m a cold-hearted girl.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t even need to think about when it started. Yukito stopped smiling.</p><




<p>Surely, since then, I couldn&#8217;t smile either. It&#8217;s natural. How could I have a smiling face in front of my brother so carelessly? I can&#8217;t smile with such an ugly and tainted face.</p>



<p>My brother&#8217;s empty, inorganic room has been redecorated and transformed.</p>



<p>I know that Yukito doesn&#8217;t want it. It was just me and Mother&#8217;s selfishness pushing through. I couldn&#8217;t bear to watch anymore. Even so, he accepted it without saying a word.</p>



<p>Yukito possesses a greater kindness that I, being narrow-minded, lack.</p>



<p>I leaned forward and covered Yukito with my arms.</p>



<p>I slowly put my trembling hands on my brother&#8217;s neck as it were.</p>



<p>If I were to exert force like this, would Yukito reject me? Would he unleash his anger upon me, hating me so much that he would never forgive me?</p>



<p>An ugly and bittersweet desire that can never be fulfilled.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for being your older sister&#8230; Taking things away from you without being able to give anything in return&#8230;&#8221;</p><



<p>If I were told to strip naked, I would do it right now. If I were told to peel off my nails, I would remove every single one. If I were told to press a hot iron against my body, I would gladly burn myself.</p>



<p>No matter how much punishment I seek, Yukito would surely accept me without resistance, just like this room without a key. But his forgiveness would rot me from within.</p>



<p>I search under the bed. I knew there was nothing there. Yes, nothing. What should have been there was absent. There is only a hollow void that consumes everything.</p>



<p>By his age, it&#8217;s natural to have an interest in sexual matters. It would be fine to have a few erotic books. Nowadays, even videos would be acceptable. But there is none of that.</p>



<p>When I try to entice him, he always shyly averts his gaze. He has normal interests, just a weak desire.</p>



<p>He is popular. If he can find someone and be happy with someone, that would be enough. It doesn&#8217;t matter who that person is, even if they are someone I despise. I will endure it if that person can make Yukito happy.</p>



<p>However, even those childhood friends must be struggling. No one can reach the depths of Yukito&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>It is something deep rooted in Yukito&#8217;s heart that they can&#8217;t control.</p>



<p>I just want him to fall in love. That&#8217;s all.</p>


<p>What a sinful wish it is.</p>



<p>My chest tightens, and I calm my erratic breathing.</p>



<p>On that day, because I tried to kill my brother, he subconsciously fears women. He&#8217;s putting the brakes on deep within his heart. By chance, by luck, he survived when he was accidentally pushed off the playground equipment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just a matter of outcomes. I didn&#8217;t succeed in killing my brother, that&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>I foolishly rejoiced in my brother&#8217;s survival without realizing my own guilt.</p>



<p>It was I who denied the possibility of affection, who made it impossible to love.</p>



<p>I killed his love.</p>



<p>&#8212; That was the second murder.</p>



<p>No matter how much I approach him, Yukito doesn&#8217;t make a move. He won&#8217;t touch me. Everyone is waiting for it. And Yukito knows that too, yet his subconscious continues to avoid it.</p><




<p>It&#8217;s not about patience or having a strong mentality. It&#8217;s the inherent distrust and fear that sleep within Yukito.</p>



<p>If he allows himself to develop affection, he believes that it will eventually become a sharp blade that will kill him. He understands that it&#8217;s the law and common sense of this world.</p>



<p>My brother is intelligent, and he&#8217;s excellent. He is the opposite of dullness.</p>



<p>Yet he will never be involved with anyone.</p>



<p>I robbed him of the future where he could be with someone he loves and live a happy life.</p>



<p>I erased even the emotions of falling in love and loving someone with my own hands.</p>



<p>And thus, I commit another sin.</p>



<p>I rejected him, saying &#8220;I hate you,&#8221; and those words brutally killed his heart.</p>



<p>&#8212; That was the third murder.</p>



<p>I killed his body, his love, and even his heart.</p>



<p>Thrice. Three murders is enough to warrant the death penalty. I deserve to be on death row.</p>



<p>I spend my days awaiting the execution of the sentence my brother imposes. I am not punished enough.</p>



<p>Yet I also know that the punishment will never be imposed. The sheer wretchedness makes me want to vomit.</p>



<p>I tightly clench my fists. If my brother forgives me, I will never forgive myself.</p>



<p>Forever and ever, I will continue to hate myself.</p>



<p>Today as well, I am kept alive by my brother&#8217;s mercy. Therefore, I will dedicate everything of myself, my life, my heart, my body, all of it, and live for that purpose alone. Otherwise, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair.</p>



<p>But for my brother, such things are unnecessary. Even if someone like me, burdened with sins, were to receive everything from people, it wouldn&#8217;t even be compensation. Even if I hold the power of life and death, it holds no value. Still&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you&#8230; I love you so much&#8230; I&#8217;m in love with you.&#8221;</p>


<p>I kissed him gently. Like a knight who swears allegiance, like an ancient witch who casts a curse.</p>



<p>To overturn that one &#8220;hate&#8221; just once, I whisper &#8220;love&#8221; hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of times.</p>



<p>My own emotions don&#8217;t matter. My feelings are irrelevant. I don&#8217;t need a future for myself.</p>



<p>What I, a murderer, can do, what I must do. Living solely for the happiness of this child, for my brother&#8217;s sake, that is the price I must pay.</p>



<p>I have no hesitation in breaking the taboo, in committing sacrilege. I am already a murderer who has touched taboos.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, I don&#8217;t want you to be pointed at with scorn&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>If there was a fourth murder, it would be killing this child socially.</p>



<p>This child brings happiness to those around them. There are always many people around, filled with smiles.</p>



<p>Even our mother, as if a weight had been lifted off her, has become calm. She smiles more often now.</p>


<p>It was this child who saved our mother when she was on the verge of despair, knowing the possibility of b****t cancer.</p>



<p>Warm. Just being by his side fills me with happiness.</p>



<p>Unlike me, who brings disaster. I can&#8217;t drag him down.</p>



<p>I am tormented by a great contradiction. I&#8217;m prepared to die for this child. I alone will pay the price.</p>



<p>To allow him to fall in love with women again, to not be afraid, I will interact with this child.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s one-sided. It&#8217;s fine for me to love him unilaterally. I don&#8217;t expect anything in return, not even a shred.</p>



<p>I have no qualification to receive affection from my brother. All a murderer needs is punishment.</p>



<p>I bring my face close to my brother&#8217;s chest. Strong heartbeat. His heart is beating.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad&#8230; That you&#8217;re alive today too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though I am an atheist, in this moment, I can&#8217;t help but thank God as always.</p>



<p>Confirming that my brother is alive has become a habit without me realizing.</p>



<p>Listening to the sound of his heart is my only solace.</p>



<p>Drowsiness gradually weighs down my eyelids. I doze off in my brother&#8217;s embrace.</p>
