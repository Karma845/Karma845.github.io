<h3>Afterword.</h3>

<p>Thank you very much for reading this work.<p>It is thanks to all of you who have supported me that what was originally published as an Internet novel has now become a book. I would like to thank you again from the bottom of my heart.<p>This work was originally intended to be a “hero’s story.”</p><p>However, in the book version, I focused more on the heroines to make it a “story of the hero and heroine.”<p>There are many different heroines in the book, so if you have a favorite heroine, please let us know!<p>We have also reviewed the length of each episode, as the format is different between the web and the book. Overall, the book has undergone major revisions, so we believe that readers of the web version will enjoy it with a slightly different feel.<p>Last but not least, I would like to give my acknowledgments.<br>I would like to thank Chisakiwata-san for drawing such fascinating and wonderful characters despite the large number of characters in the book, the editorial staff who worked on the book, and the many people who were involved in the publication process. Above all, I would like to thank all the readers.</p><p>The “romance” of this work has not yet begun.<br>This is the starting line. Stay tuned for further developments!<p>We look forward to seeing you all again in this way.</p>
