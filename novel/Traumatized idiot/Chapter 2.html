<h2>Chapter 2: Watching the Infection</h2>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Suzune Side]</h4>



<p>&#8220;Yay! They have done it, Takamiya-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding, right&#8230;? I never expected them to win&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzune Takamiya was staring blankly at the court from the cheering seats. Next to her, Shiori Kamishiro was hopping around in excitement, but Suzune couldn&#8217;t share the same joy. Despite the supposed happiness, she couldn&#8217;t accept the reality in front of her. She couldn&#8217;t have imagined this would happen just a few months ago.</p>



<p>As she directed her gaze towards the figure of Toshirou Himura, who was raising his arms in a victory pose towards them, her cheeks flushed red.</p>



<p>She couldn&#8217;t help but think it was unexpectedly good. Unexpectedly. Truly unexpected.</p>



<p>Suzune wasn&#8217;t the only one feeling bewildered. When she looked in his direction, she saw the club advisor Kyougaku Andou with wide eyes filled with astonishment. He had been in charge of the struggling basketball club, adopting a laissez-faire approach that could be seen as both positive and negative. Perhaps he couldn&#8217;t keep up with the transformation of the now-strong basketball club.</p>



<p>The school&#8217;s perspective and expectations would surely change. It was certain that their budget would be increased for the next term. It was the Inter-High Preliminary Tournament. The boys&#8217; basketball team of Shouyo High School, led by Toshirou Himura , advanced to the third round. They were going to the B Block fourth round. Their achievements as a boys&#8217; basketball team were impeccable.</p>


<p>Considering that they had struggled to even make it past the first round before, this was a major upset, an undeniable feat. If they won the next two matches, including the fourth round next week, they would reach the finals league. And beyond that awaited the Inter-High.</p>



<p>Originally, it had been a laid-back club where basketball enthusiasts gathered to have fun. Participating in tournaments was just for commemoration.</p>



<p>But now, there was no trace of that. The passion they had invested in this tournament was not inferior to that of other schools.</p>



<p>It could be seen in their demeanor. There was not a single member who didn&#8217;t have the face of a fighter. The sense of fulfillment was evident on their faces. It was not a coincidence. It was a result backed by their efforts.</p>



<p>Things had changed. They had been changed. And no one would feel it more than the members of the boys&#8217; basketball team. Toshirou Himura&#8217;s decision had brought about an immense transformation in the basketball club. Like a red dye mingling with scarlet, their boiling passion and overflowing sweat spread through them.</p>



<p>The dream didn&#8217;t end today. Last summer was still ongoing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, let&#8217;s go to everyone! Captain Himura is waiting too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Kamishiro-san, don&#8217;t pull me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Chasing after her junior who dashed ahead, Suzune&#8217;s heart was filled with both joy and lingering anxiety.</p>






<p>The game ended, and they finished preparing to leave. Suzune Takamiya was also amidst the circle of joy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming to cheer, Suzune. Your presence became my strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Toshirou.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just a little longer, just a little longer. I will definitely become a man worthy of you!&#8221;</p>



<p>While she thought warmly of Toshirou speaking so passionately, her expression clouded at his words.</p>



<p>She forced a smile, not wanting him to perceive her swirling emotions.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Um, it looks like Chigusa Academy won against Kuwa-senpai&#8217;s team. Tei-Wang, where Daigo-senpai is, also won. But they&#8217;re in Block D. It&#8217;s a shame we won&#8217;t meet until the finals league.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better not to face them if we can&#8217;t win for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true, but don&#8217;t say things without dreams.&#8221;</p>



<p>The voices of Kouki Mihou and Yukito Kokonoe, conversing behind them, reached her ears.</p>



<p>Suzune had an uneasy feeling towards Yukito Kokonoe. It wasn&#8217;t that she disliked him. On the contrary, she thought favorably of him. Since entering school, Yukito Kokonoe, a first-year student, had risen to prominence numerous times, and there was not a single student who didn&#8217;t know about his eventful school life.</p>



<p>While some disliked him, many admired him, and he had countless fans among the third-year students as well. Even in Suzune&#8217;s class, there was a classmate who had approached him for love advice.</p>



<p>While the legends surrounding him were uncertain, there was no doubt that at least a part, if not all, of the rumors were true, based on the incident that had stirred the entire school through the intercom announcement.</p>



<p>Above all, Suzune had nothing but gratitude for the fact that Toshirou Himura had invited Yukito Kokonoe to the basketball club. And yet&#8230;</p>



<p>(Why, Toshirou? Did you forget our promise&#8230;?)</p>



<p>Her chest tightened. In the end, it was ugly jealousy. Selfish, self-centered, and spoiled.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t expect the kind of confession that Toshirou imagined. For the two who had harbored feelings for each other since middle school, there was no need for special words to understand each other&#8217;s feelings.</p>



<p>For Suzune, as long as she could spend this last time of their highschool third year with Toshirou, it would be enough.</p>


<p>She didn&#8217;t desire any changes. There was no need for things to change. That was her sincere and honest sentiment.</p>



<p>They had decided to attend the same university. For the two of them, this summer was the deadline.</p>



<p>The university that Suzune Takamiya aspires to is a high hurdle for Toshirou Himura . After the summer tournament, he had promised to retire from the club and start studying seriously together for university entrance exams. But now, Toshirou and the others are immersed in basketball even on their days off. It felt as if it was robbing Suzune of their precious time together, and she found it unbearable.</p>



<p>(What&#8217;s the point of working hard now when they&#8217;ve been weak all along? It doesn&#8217;t matter if Toshirou and the others try their best now!?)</p>



<p>Those feelings should be entrusted to the underclassmen. Fortunately, the first-year students are exceptional. Leading the transitional phase of the basketball club is not the role of the third-year students. It&#8217;s an unspoken feeling that she could never utter.</p>



<p>Even if they had lost in the first round, it would have been fine. Regardless of their performance, her answer wouldn&#8217;t have changed if Toshirou had confessed. They had spent enough time together for that.</p>



<p>Suzune continues to struggle with conflicting emotions, torn between wanting to support him sincerely and her ugly feelings of jealousy.</p>



<p>&#8220;We still have a long way to go. Suzune, we can become stronger and stronger!&#8221;</p>



<p>Toshirou&#8217;s passionate words sounded somewhat hollow. It was too late for the third-year students to say such things.</p>



<p>Suzune had met Toshirou Himura in her second year of middle school. At first, she simply thought of him as a hot-headed guy.</p>



<p>But it was different. He was overflowing with a sense of justice, earnest to the point of clumsiness.</p>



<p>At one point, he had reprimanded a girl who was subjecting others to unpleasant teasing, not quite bullying. Looking back, that might have been the first time she had ever been conscious of someone of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for Suzune Takamiya to be drawn to his way of life. Time passed by quickly.</p>



<p>Strangely enough, they ended up in the same class from then on. It&#8217;s more accurate to say it was an unusual connection. As their relationship deepened, she recalled how people around them often said that they were mismatched.</p>



<p>Perhaps Toshirou had been conscious of that all along.</p>



<p>If that is the reason why Toshiro Himura is so obsessed with the outcome, then Yukito Kokonoe has done a very cruel thing. He has given him hope. The hope of a dream. But it is poison.</p>



<p>Looking back, Yukito Kokonoe was looking at the tournament bracket with a stern expression. He opened his notebook and muttered something to himself. Kouki Mihou, who was next to him, peeked into the notebook.</p>



<p>&#8220;――!&#8221;</p>


<p>Yukito Kokonoe abruptly closed the notebook and started walking towards Suzune.</p>



<p>&#8220;Takamiya-senpai, I want to talk to you about something later.&#8221;</p>



<p>Under the intense gaze, Suzune found herself nodding unintentionally.</p>


<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</h4>



<p>When it comes to detectives, I am a purist, but when it comes to art, there is no shortage of the XXX school.</p>



<p>From classical to impressionist, and realism, there are various styles. However, in the presence of artistic beauty, I switched to the Yuri-san school. The completion of modern art that earnestly pursues Yuri-san&#8217;s beauty is the mission entrusted to me.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel guilty about it, but I think it&#8217;s pointless to feel guilty.</p>



<p>No matter how strong my mental adaptability is like a bear bug, there are limits. Especially, the graceful and beautiful thighs, calves, and ankle with the golden ratio can be called the three principles of beautiful legs.</p>



<p>That being said, after school, I head to the art club with Hinagi, who seems nervous.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s understandable that Hinagi is nervous since it&#8217;s an awkward time. Although I confirmed with classmates, there were no art club members in Class B, so the atmosphere of the club is unknown. I&#8217;m just accompanying her, but Hinagi wants to observe once and then officially submit her application.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Thank you for coming with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing this because I&#8217;m worried about you. Listen, Hinagi, if they try to force you into being a nude model, refuse firmly or run away immediately. Don&#8217;t forget to seek help from adults. The phone number for the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology&#8217;s Children&#8217;s SOS Counseling Hotline is—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you worrying about me so much!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan&#8217;s face turns bright red, but school is always filled with danger. It&#8217;s important to stay vigilant. Anticipating the unexpected is the necessary ability to survive in the school&#8217;s survival space.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I want to give you. Take this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a painting knife for use in art. Listen, if something happens, use this to stab the person and run away. Don&#8217;t hesitate if you feel danger. Above all, prioritize your safety.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you think the art club is!?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;You never know what might happen!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only for you, Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>The word knife stabs deeply. Hinagi-chan&#8217;s sharpness in putting the lesson into practice was impressive. She becomes the Jackknife Hinagi, who hurts anyone she touches. It&#8217;s kind of cool. I&#8217;m quite satisfied.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hinagin, try saying, &#8216;Approach me and you&#8217;ll get hurt.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? Approach me and you&#8217;ll get hurt. Is this okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lame.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, you made me say it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan is pouting, but it seems it&#8217;s not constipation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Feeling relieved by the unreasonable demands, I let out a deep sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to worry that much. Sanjoji-sensei is the advisor&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou, why didn&#8217;t you mention that earlier?&#8221;</p>



<p>If Sanjoji-sensei, who could be considered the conscience of this school, is the advisor, then I can relax.</p>



<p>Entering the art room, they begin preparations for the club activities.</p>



<p>Among them, there were familiar faces. The most troublesome monster in this school.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oya, what are you doing here? Do you need something from the art club?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Strange bird?&#8221; [TL: It is pronounced as Kaichou]</p>



<p>&#8220;She is the student council president. Why are you treating her like a monster?&#8230; Um, today I came to observe before joining the club. Nice to meet you, and I hope to get along with you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are Suzurikawa-san, right? Welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether Sanjoji-sensei had heard about it in advance from Hinagi, they greeted her with a smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re a first-year student hoping to join the club. It&#8217;s appreciated since, as you can see, we have few members.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is the president here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am the club president.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this art club really okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this art club really okay?</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, your true thoughts are leaked out&#8221;</p>



<p>I find it amusing how harsh Hinagi-chan is like the student council president.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Yukito-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mikumo-senpai, is it okay for this person to be the president?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, she is usually decent, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Next to President Kedou, there is Vice President Mikumo, who is said to be the person always by his side, as a matter of course.</p>



<p>I feel bad for Mikumo Senpai, but I must admit that she is not very convincing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vienna?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the capital of Austria&#8230; It&#8217;s famous for its art museums and such, so it would be nice to visit there someday. I&#8217;ve always admired it since I&#8217;ve never been on a trip abroad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually into art these days. It&#8217;s called the Yuri school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… Yuri School?&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems my sister wants to visit Schönbrunn Palace. I wonder why? [TL: During the reign of Maria Theresa, as an imperial summer residence, Schönbrunn Palace became <strong>the glittering focus of court life</strong>]</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito Kokonoe, aren&#8217;t you in the basketball club? Are you here as an escort?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Something like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I deeply regret it. No matter how much I regret it, I can&#8217;t regret it enough. I feel inadequate. I haven&#8217;t even thanked you properly last time, and although it was due to Erika&#8217;s rampage, I ended up causing trouble for you again. This time, it&#8217;s a clear case of unfair punishment. It&#8217;s only natural that Yuri is furious. Just apologizing won&#8217;t make it forgiven.&#8221;</p>



<p>With tears welling up in the corners of her eyes, President Kedou was overwhelmed with thoughts. Her clenched fist trembled on her knee.</p>



<p>The school had officially apologized, and thanks to the efforts of Hinagi and the others, I still had a place in this school.</p>



<p>That alone was enough. I didn&#8217;t think I had such worth, but I couldn&#8217;t thank them enough.</p>



<p>But whether I could forgive her or not was up to me. Just because I forgave her didn&#8217;t mean it was okay.</p>



<p>In fact, I was surprised when Tojou-senpai said &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut my hair&#8221; in an attempt to show her sincerity. I hurried to stop her, but it would have been a problem if she had done so in an apology. I felt sorry for him. Incidentally, Himiyama-san had said to Papa Tojo, &#8220;When you apologize, you should at least cut off your hair&#8221;. Scary. She seemed to be very angry. By the way, I stopped him, too. For the Tojo family, I am the guardian of their hair, and it is no exaggeration to say that I am their hair master.</p>



<p>The Student Council President, who stood up abruptly, grabbed my shoulders. Her eyes were spinning around.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is enough, but Yukito Kokonoe. I&#8217;ll become a nude model!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mutsuki-chan!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing more than a crude gesture, but it&#8217;s the only thing I can do! It&#8217;s okay Yuumi, let me go!&#8221;</p>



<p>As President Kedou tried to take off her uniform, Vice President Mikumo grabbed her from behind and restrained her.</p>



<p>&#8220;What nonsense are you talking about! Kedou-san, calm down!&#8221;</p>



<p>Nonsense? Was it nonsense? I couldn&#8217;t help but feel annoyed at Sanjoi-sensei admonishing President Kedou.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, Sanjoiji-sensei, can you take over?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you saying!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oya oya, what&#8217;s the matter, Sensei? There is nothing wrong with it. I can leave it to the Student Council President as it is. In that case, I won&#8217;t hold President Kedou responsible for anything that happens.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8230; Are you trying to threaten me? But to sacrifice the student&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh well, should I ask President Kedou then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, Yuumi. Even Yukito Kokonoe is saying the same thing. There&#8217;s no problem at all! Let go!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s true!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;President Kedou understands. This is what responsibility means. And in comparison&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I understand. I understand! I&#8217;m doing this to protect the students. I will take over, so please don&#8217;t touch Kedou! I will become the nude model!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That depends on the teacher&#8217;s attitude, doesn&#8217;t it? &#8230;Nicha.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you forcing her?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was suddenly hit on the head by Hinagi-chan—huh!? What the heck? I snapped back to my senses. It seems I was hypnotized after looking into Kedou&#8217;s eyes. It must be her Mystic Eyes after all.</p>


<p>But still, Sanjoji-sensei, who willingly goes along with such playful jokes, is truly an exemplary teacher. It&#8217;s hard to believe that someone entrusted with student guidance is being disliked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, are you not satisfied unless you have done something mischievous?&#8221;</p>



<p>I averted my gaze from Hinagi-chan&#8217;s stern look and whistled silently.</p>



<p>After the series of commotions, the art room finally regained its calmness.</p>



<p>In a way, this could be considered a light warm-up before club activities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cough. Let&#8217;s start our activities soon. We&#8217;ll discuss the matter later.&#8221;</p>



<p>No, it won&#8217;t be good to leave it for later.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Yukito Kokonoe, are you joining us today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have the intention to. I even brought my crayons.&#8221;</p>



<p>I took out the 100-color crayon set that my mother bought for me a long time ago.</p>


<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QrqNtuK3frOUWMoMBSmlZVnvY-j2wrGQrXVYVPt3jGMWJbENTgjfMx_LoNM-8Jn1hfszulyZrTqySXG3LepQTlxAD98tXxgE9Bn-JiYo_y_7vUf3cdH-Esto4vRNmIYp59AQeYz4epFkqTU61i5tP_Q"/>


<p>This item, which had been sleeping in the closet without any particular use for a long time, has seen a significant increase in its frequency of use recently. It has become an indispensable item for me, who has awakened to the Yuri style.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today is a fine day, shall we go outside for some sketching?&#8221;</p>



<p>Following Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s decision, I grab my belongings and head outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to it! What are you going to draw, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right, maybe you, I guess&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Me?&#8221;</p>



<p>Blushing, Hinagi-chan lowers her head. While a landscape painting would be fine, as a Yuri enthusiast, I naturally lean towards drawing people.</p>



<p>As if remembering something, Sanjoji-sensei speaks up.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, participation is optional, but would you two like to consider entering the art competition? &#8216;Summer of Art&#8217; can be a wonderful experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;An art competition?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you think, Yukito? I want to participate!&#8221;</p>



<p>The art club participates every year as part of their activities, but students outside the club are also free to enter.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s summer vacation, a great opportunity to try new things. Let&#8217;s give it a shot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please do your best. Fufu, I&#8217;m glad you showed interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apart from the president, the art club is a warm and wonderful club. I wish Advisor Sanjoji-sensei, who is kind and hasn&#8217;t bothered me at all while leaving everything to me, could be a role model for Advisor Andou-sensei of the boys&#8217; basketball club. Hinagi should be able to thrive here without any worries. There&#8217;s no need for concern.</p>



<p>Thinking about the motif, we step outside. Bathed in the dazzling sunlight, we start drawing our pictures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While enjoying a famous confectionery called &#8220;Shingen Mochi&#8221; on the riverside, there was a troubled student sitting alone. That student is me, Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>Going back home feels like an unbearable chore. I fall into a delinquent-like thinking, where my family environment is in disarray.</p>



<p>I thought my mother had no interest in me. I thought my sister hated me. That&#8217;s how it was supposed to be. And it was fine that way. Everything was going smoothly. There were no problems. I believed that causing trouble and disappearing would bring peaceful days. That was my understanding of filial piety. That was my norm.</p>



<p>But suddenly, everything that was normal and ordinary for me changed completely.</p>



<p>Why did they suddenly become kind?</p>



<p>I wipe off the black honey that got on my lips with a pocket tissue.</p>



<p>No, there&#8217;s no way that my superior beings, my mother and sister, could be wrong. They are different from me, a lowly creature.</p>



<p>My mother and sister have always been kind. It was me who didn&#8217;t understand.</p>


<p>I came all this way without knowing. Kindness, the meaning of it. Contrary to the clear blue sky, my mood is gloomy, and I delay going home, lingering in this dusk.</p>



<p>One day, when I returned home, my mother and sister were wearing reverse bunny outfits.</p>



<p>Due to the outrageous act of Sekka Kokonoe, the Kokonoe family was swept up in an unprecedented reverse bunny craze.</p>



<p>I feel like I&#8217;m already dead.</p>



<p>Unable to hide my confusion, I gather my courage and ask my sister about the intention behind it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? It&#8217;s the Year of the Rabbit, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s absolutely right, but I lack the intellectual capacity to understand the correctness of her response.</p>



<p>I seek help at the Himiyama residence, but even Himiyama-san is wearing a reverse bunny outfit.</p>



<p>Like Alice lost in Wonderland, the collapse of common sense.</p>


<p>Perhaps I have wandered into a world not of another dimension, but a world of reversed values.</p>



<p>So now, I am a stranger wandering, searching for an exit in this unfamiliar land.</p>



<p>My mother is currently in the midst of her &#8220;Mother training,&#8221; and she mistakenly sees me as an infant or a baby.</p>



<p>After all, she sometimes talks to me in baby language. All I can manage is babbling in response.</p>



<p>When did common sense get so distorted? Will the days when I can be at ease ever return?</p>



<p>Once I return home, it&#8217;s immediately a battlefield.</p>



<p>I am spoiled as quickly as the wind, as quietly as the forest, as fiercely as the fire, and as unmoving and spoiled as the mountain. Of course, they are also pampered as if with shadows and thunder.</p>



<p>With the strategies of my mother and sister, using the &#8220;Kōyō Gunkan&#8221; military tactics, I am undoubtedly being conquered.</p>



<p>A message arrives on my smartphone. It&#8217;s Hīmizan-san, a master strategist known for corrupting me.</p>


<p>As I read the content, I spew out a mouthful of roasted soybean flour and start running.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&#8220;A wedding?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. My brother wants you, Yukito-kun, to participate too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m taken aback by this unexpected request.</p>



<p>Involuntarily, my hand stops as I&#8217;m about to eat a plateful of cherries. They&#8217;re in season and delicious.</p>



<p>I received a shocking email from Himiyama-san saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant with a baby♪,&#8221; and I hurriedly came here, but now that I think about it, I had no reason to panic.</p>



<p>Dangerous, dangerous. What was I getting all worked up about&#8230; Safe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;..these cherries&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yukito-kun? Don&#8217;t you like cherries?&#8221;</p>



<p>I start sweating. My mind is in complete chaos. I can&#8217;t comprehend anything that&#8217;s being said.</p>



<p>The vital signs indicate abnormalities in my breathing, pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and level of consciousness.</p>



<p>I may have the strongest mental fortitude to watch horror movies with an expressionless face, but when it comes to genuine paranormal phenomena, I&#8217;m utterly defeated. My gaze wanders in empty space, suffering a merciless defeat.</p>



<p>I never had a sixth sense before. But now, I&#8217;m trapped in a situation where I can see things that even a sadistic clown would be shocked by. I pick up a cherry with trembling hands.</p>



<p>I can see it. From the slightly open collar, I can see something that I shouldn&#8217;t be seeing, something belonging to Himiyama-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cherry boys are easily stimulated&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you really want to eat cherries that badly? It&#8217;s okay, you can have them anytime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu&#8230; fufufu&#8230;Looks like you finally pissed me off. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>She leans over and talks to me with her sweet breath in my ear.</p>


<p>The performance of semiconductors doubles every one and a half to two years. This is known as &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law.&#8221; However, unlike Moore, this Himiyama-san has no upper limit to the increase in her likability.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a sense of crisis. From the moment I met her until now, the pace of increase in likability has been twice as fast as before. It just keeps going up. I beg you, please stop!</p>



<p>If things continue like this, me eating cherries, may end up being devoured by Himiyama-san.</p>



<p>So, the strategist, Yukito Kokonoe, came up with a plan while being blown by the south-eastern wind.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Operation Lower Himiyama-san&#8217;s Likability.&#8221;</p>



<p>Upon researching, I found that sexual harassment is the most off-putting characteristic of men for women. It includes things like unwanted physical contact and sexually suggestive remarks.</p>



<p>Even though Himiyama-san is nothing but kind and well-meaning, I have to put this into practice. I&#8217;m sorry, Himiyama-san!</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehehe. You seem to have quite an impressive thing there. Don&#8217;t underestimate me. Shall I play with that beautiful cherry of yours and turn it into an American cherry?&#8221;</p>



<p>I swiftly lift Himiyama-san&#8217;s chin with my right hand, barely brushing my left hand against her ample cleavage. I look into her eyes from above as if I were showing her a hypnosis app.</p>



<p>A moment of silence. The only sound that echoes is the gulp of Himiyama-san swallowing her saliva.</p>



<p>Her eyes glisten. Her luscious lips slowly part.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are&#8230;.you serious&#8230; I am marked as a defective product, a woman disqualified from being a woman. Do you really desire someone like me? Why are you so&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Huh? That&#8217;s strange. Even though I&#8217;m engaging in sexual harassment, her likability is increasing. It feels like the level-up sound is playing in succession, just like when defeating an experienced metal monster.</p>



<p>Wait, could it be that I fell for false information!?</p>



<p>Somehow, Himiyama-san has firmly held my left hand without me realizing it. Let go of me!</p>



<p>What are you planning to do with my hand? Hey, the sensation of cherries!?</p>



<p>&#8220;GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&#8221;</p>


<p>I met my demise. I&#8217;ll leave the rest to the next generation of Yukito Kokonoe. I&#8217;m counting on you, buddy!</p>



<p>&#8220;You gave me a coin before, right? The person was deeply moved by it. And Yukito, I know school has been tough for you. That&#8217;s why he was so concerned about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one who should be grateful.&#8221;</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png?fit=612%2C864&amp;ssl=1"/>


<p>I don&#8217;t know the details, but I heard that she made a great effort to have my suspension lifted.</p>



<p>Although I am truly grateful to Himiyama-san, but I can&#8217;t shake off my discomfort towards her.</p>



<p>Oh, pink ……. I&#8217;m talking about cherries, right? I don&#8217;t have any other intention. I&#8217;m just saying that I don&#8217;t!</p>



<p>&#8220;They had been together for a long time, but they couldn&#8217;t have children, so they couldn&#8217;t make a decision about marriage. However, when the pregnancy was confirmed, everything changed. My brother was delighted, but the concern of being an older parent weighed on him. That&#8217;s when he received courage from you, and he was really happy about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had heard that they were getting married before, but I had no idea how it happened.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, Himiyama-san also said that she broke off her engagement due to infertility.</p>



<p>As a woman of the same sex, she may have had some feelings about it.</p>



<p>But I am a complete outsider, and I don&#8217;t even know them.</p>



<p>Himiyama-san&#8217;s brother holds an important position, and the scale of his wedding is quite large.</p>



<p>The number of guests invited is also far removed from a typical wedding.</p>



<p>The actual number of guests invited to the wedding ceremony is also far from the norm.</p>



<p>The wedding ceremony is a big event, and the number of guests is quite large.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Yukito, you&#8217;ll be sitting with me in the family section.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Family section?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Eh, I&#8217;m a relative of Himiyama-san? I&#8217;m too scared to mention it any more.</p>




<p>&#8220;I heard that if you can tie the stem of a cherry in your mouth, you are a good kisser.&#8221;</p>



<p>The stem was elegantly tied on the mischievous tongue that playfully flicked. It had turned into a beautiful six-pointed star.</p>



<p>&#8220;Too much skill!&#8221;</p>



<p>How skilled is she in kissing? What depths of technique does she possess, mysterious person?</p>



<p>&#8220;Wanna give it a try?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think I might lose all strength, so I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, what a pity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Considering the current state where I&#8217;m already being figuratively &#8220;weakened&#8221; by my mother, becoming even more like a spineless creature is undesirable. Being completely crushed is the least of my concerns.</p>



<p>Now that my attempts to lower her affection have all failed, I feel powerless.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve tried various things, you know. When asked about fashion preferences, I provocatively said, &#8220;How about naked suspenders? Well, it&#8217;s probably too much for you, Himiyama-san (laughs).&#8221; But when she actually went and changed clothes, I realized it was impossible to lower her affection.</p>



<p>Why did I make such a foolish comment? Regret knows no bounds.</p>



<p>In other words, Himiyama-san&#8217;s current appearance and good behavior is (self-regulation).</p>



<p>For some reason, I try to ask a question that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to ask. It may be a good opportunity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you so kind to me, Himiyama-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The air felt frozen. The seductive atmosphere from earlier dissipated, replaced by a bitter and pained expression on Himiyama-san&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>There was something familiar about that expression&#8230; I managed to gather my thoughts and spoke.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, I&#8217;m not kind. &#8230;.I am a liar&#8221;</p>



<p>She weakly laughed. Her body trembled uncontrollably. Her lowered figure seemed fragile, as if it would break under the slightest pressure.</p>



<p>I was at a loss for words. Insensitively, I had hurt Himiyama-san, who had shown me such kindness.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mother said that doing this would make you feel at ease.&#8221;</p>



<p>I lightly embraced her, as if touching something delicate, so as not to break her fragile body.</p>



<p>I was nothing more than a stranger to her, and this was my limit. Even if I were accused of sexual harassment, there was no helping it.</p>



<p>Still, I felt it was necessary. My mother&#8217;s teachings were absolute.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;! Right&#8230; Your words were true. But I didn&#8217;t believe them&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Himiyama-san&#8217;s choked sob escaped. She buried her face in my chest and simply cried.</p>



<p>I realized that I didn&#8217;t understand the meaning behind those tears. Our relationship remained vague, based on what I didn&#8217;t know. It was unstable and fragile, on the verge of breaking.</p>



<p>Was it because of built-up stress? Being a working adult is harsh.</p>



<p>As long as it&#8217;s my chest, I&#8217;ll always lend it to her. That&#8217;s the only thing I can do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After some time had passed and Himiyama-san had freshened up her makeup a bit, we were once again eating cherries together. I felt like my fondness for her was growing even stronger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about the gift or attire. It was a sudden request, so we&#8217;ll take care of everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a very kind gesture. Then I suddenly remembered.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Yukito-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember now. My mother mentioned that she would also be attending the wedding&#8230; and the venue is the same.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a moment. Let me confirm.&#8221;</p>



<p>I quickly dialed my mother&#8217;s number, and she answered almost immediately.</p>



<p>[Oh, Mom. I have something to ask. No, not about measurements. Eh, I&#8217;m not dating anyone, so I&#8217;m free? What are you talking about? I&#8217;m the type of guy you like? What are you&#8211;]</p>



<p>My mother kindly told me things I didn&#8217;t ask about. She truly is a saint.</p>



<p>I managed to finish the conversation. Can you believe such a coincidence?</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems that Himiyama-san&#8217;s brother is marrying one of my mother&#8217;s friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really? That&#8217;s quite a coincidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What will sister do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I definitely won&#8217;t go. I wasn&#8217;t invited, and it would just make me uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess that makes sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coincidences can be scary. I was talking to my sister in my room about being invited to the wedding.</p>



<p>In the end, it was confirmed that my mother would attend as a guest of the bride&#8217;s side, while I would attend as a guest of the groom&#8217;s side. My mother was surprised but seemed happy. Having my mother there made me feel more at ease.</p>



<p>In this situation, it&#8217;s Yuri-san who will be left out. I asked her about it, but she flatly declined. It would be complicated to be invited to the wedding of a complete stranger and it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, why are you closing your eyes? you can&#8217;t measure me like that.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my spiritual eye.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>I never expected that I would actually measure her every week. Yuri-san, who embodies beauty and has honed her physical perfection, is truly deserving of being humanity&#8217;s greatest masterpiece.</p>



<p>Facing the pinnacle of contemporary art, it&#8217;s impossible to directly gaze without a light-blocking panel.</p>



<p>I am Yukito, the blind measurer!</p>



<p>&#8220;Kusu&#8230; Kusukusu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230; Hahahaha.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s rare for something like this to happen. My sister started laughing, so I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh along.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s so funny!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kyain.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a dog-like yelp, being kicked away.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to act like that, I won&#8217;t hold back either.&#8221;</p>



<p>An ominous line sent shivers down my spine. The sound of clothes rubbing against each other, slipping.</p>



<p>Crap! Because my vision is sealed, my hearing has become more acute!</p>



<p>Maintaining the measurement posture, my sister collapses onto me. Her body temperature feels unusually warm.</p>



<p>My other senses have also become sharper. My sense of touch and smell are also sounding red alerts.</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be true, it can&#8217;t be true!</p>



<p>Speaking of Yuri-san, she is immensely popular at school, and I also have immense popularity with her.</p>


<p>No matter how you look at it, if we do that, it won&#8217;t be the Davos Conference, it&#8217;ll be a family meeting!</p>



<p>I slightly open my eyes and confirm――I widen them in shock.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is your lower body also naked!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Blind measurer, defeated!</p>



<p>&#8220;As long as we&#8217;re at it, I thought you could measure my three sizes. My other sizes must have changed too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As long as we&#8217;re at it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to measure them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one but you, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible! Am I a Stand user</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get tired from averting your gaze like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;An unreasonable pursuit by the culprit!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuri-san stretches herself slightly, her figure even more divine, then places her heels firmly on the ground. I&#8217;m filled with question marks at her mysterious actions, but soon her intention becomes clear.</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t say what it was, but it jiggled. I really won&#8217;t say what it was.</p>



<p>My eyes quickly follow that movement. Naturally, my gaze is drawn to it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh. This is a technique for directing your gaze. Remember it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beneficial for studying psychologyyyyyyyy.&#8221;</p>



<p>I fell right into the trap. Yuri-san is triumphing. Stomping around!</p>



<p>Let me make an excuse. If you keep reptiles and amphibians as pets, you will notice that some of them only eat live food. When feeding them, they only recognize live insects as food.</p>



<p>This means that capturing moving things in your field of vision is one of the animal instincts. It&#8217;s not like I was lured by perverted feelings. Hey, are you listening?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? It&#8217;s not something that will decrease, so feel free to look.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be satisfied with that!&#8221;</p>



<p>I avert my eyes from the VIO private zone. I can&#8217;t even stare at it in anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right, let&#8217;s take measurements once a week here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that too much!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my growth period.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The growth period is really something.&#8221;</p>


<p>The persuasive power of the growth period is truly impressive.</p>



<p>I manage to endure the hellish time, but Yuri-san still remains there.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there to cheer you on at the tournament.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. I think the seniors will be happy too. And if possible, could you wear clothes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be so happy I&#8217;ll jump for joy. Also, could you please put on some clothes soon?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Dance for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh!?&#8221;</p>



<p>While wishing for her to quickly put on some clothes, I dance.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of the basketball club having good results until now. Making it to the fourth round is already amazing. You&#8217;ve achieved that much, so you should be more proud.&#8221;</p>



<p>Am I being praised right now? It feels strange. It must be the same for Yuri-san.</p>



<p>We awkwardly continue to exchange words, still unfamiliar with each other. It&#8217;s awkward. But we&#8217;re undoubtedly taking steps forward. My sister and I are both navigating this unfamiliar distance. It will still take time for it to become natural.</p>



<p> My sister and I have endured without fleeing from this moment. We are sharing this time together.</p>



<p>More than anything else, that is important, and for now, this is fine. This is our best effort at the moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you enjoying club activities a little?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. But I don&#8217;t dislike it, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>If we continue like this, will we eventually return to being ordinary siblings?</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you enjoying school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; It might be enjoyable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since entering high school, everyone around me has been supportive. The teachers, seniors, and classmates.</p>



<p>It has always been lively, and they have protected my place and reached out to me.</p>



<p>I am convinced that this feeling is what they call &#8220;enjoyment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>She gently strokes my head and gives me a light kiss before returning to her room.</p>



<p>She kissed me as a greeting, as if she thought Kokonoe&#8217;s family was the only European culture, but when she left, she looked sad and I remembered the past.</p>



<p>In the past, my sister was always smiling. Her smile disappeared after I caused a great commotion.</p>


<p>My sister who used to smile and my sister with a gloomy expression are like completely different people.</p>



<p>It feels like she has changed into someone else. I haven&#8217;t seen her smile for a long time now.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s usual for me to have an expressionless face, I loved her charming smile.</p>



<p>She always played with me and reassured me that I wasn&#8217;t alone. She was my prideful big sister, and I loved that about her. Precious memories that I held onto without discarding them.</p>



<p>She stopped smiling, just like me. But she is someone who can smile. She is a wonderful person who can enchant others with her smile. I can&#8217;t let her remain without her smile. I can&#8217;t let her lose it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; Yuri-san is still&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She is trapped. Trapped in a deep prison of guilt.</p>



<p>After the serious injury, my sister has repeatedly apologized on various occasions. Forgetting my anger, I have continued to forgive her. What significance did this exchange hold for her?</p>



<p>The injury was my fault for clinging to her without considering her feelings.</p>

<p>There is no need for my sister to atone for any sins. The key to the prison is always unlocked.</p>



<p>And yet, my sister chooses to remain in that prison of her own volition.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve kept my distance from them because she hates me. But if that&#8217;s not the case, then that&#8217;s&#8211;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri-san, Nee-san&#8230; Onee-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>A hint from Mom. She said to start over. If that&#8217;s the case, maybe I need to start over not with Yuri-san nor Nee-san, but with Onee-chan.</p>



<p>No matter how close we get, there&#8217;s still a distance between our hearts.</p>



<p>I yearn for a future I want to make a reality. Just strongly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8212;-once again, so that Onee-chan can laugh.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yuri PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;…… that boy is alright now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Returning to my own room from the comfortable room of my beloved little brother, I collapse onto the bed, feeling powerless.</p>



<p>My heart feels warm. That child, Yukito, is already okay.</p>



<p>The question I once asked. Previously, he said that club activities and school were boring, not enjoyable. Has he noticed that his answer has changed?</p>



<p>It reached him. Yukito realized it. The kindness that surrounds him.</p>



<p>He is not alone. Exciting days and youth are waiting for him from now on.</p>



<p>I naturally come to understand. Ah, I see. My role&#8230; is finished.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no longer needed by him&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>On that day, I made a vow. I was determined to protect Yukito. But now, it&#8217;s over.</p>



<p>In the first place, his problem-solving ability is outstanding. Every time something happens, every time someone tries to hurt him, he becomes stronger. He becomes someone who won&#8217;t lose. He has developed an unbreakable strength of spirit.</p>



<p>There was never a moment for me to take the stage. He solves everything on his own.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been pretending not to notice, or rather, pretending not to notice anything at all.</p>



<p>Because, as a murderer, there was no other way for me to be by Yukito&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>Mother, who is the pillar of our family, supports us financially. Yukito supports us emotionally. I&#8217;m the only one with no role. I&#8217;m the only one who hasn&#8217;t done anything. I&#8217;m not just worthless, but also a vengeful presence. A murderer who only brings suffering to my little brother.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a cruel truth. A hole seems to open up in my chest, filling me with emptiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is ridiculous&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>What on earth am I doing? I know I&#8217;m a nuisance, yet I&#8217;m interfering with my little brother.</p>



<p>Being by his side, it&#8217;s excessive meddling. It&#8217;s unlike me to approach him in such an intrusive way and cause him trouble.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a woman who has outlived her usefulness. Unable to accept that fact, I was in a state of panic. Ugly-hearted.</p>



<p>Although I claimed not to seek anything in return, in reality, I wanted to be needed. I wanted to be relied upon.</p>



<p>But such a thing is impossible. Who would need and depend on a murderer?</p>



<p>What exists is resentment and hatred, fear and animosity. There is no reason for anyone to approach me, no reason to exchange words. It&#8217;s impossible for anyone to fall in love with me.</p>



<p>I have been averting my eyes from this obvious reality.</p>



<p>That child, Yukito, is steadily improving. This is a good opportunity. I will fulfill that child&#8217;s wish at the end.</p>



<p>On the desk, there is a single printout: &#8216;Career Preference Survey.&#8217;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the time to gradually start thinking about the future path after high school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Yukito, for everything up until now.&#8221;</p>


<p>I had already decided to go to university, but now I make a new resolution.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that Yukito will disappear. That child is desired by everyone. It&#8217;s me who should disappear.</p>



<p>A university in another prefecture. The farther away, the better. If possible, even studying abroad might be an option. It will be lonely not being able to see Yukito. But I need to take responsibility for what I&#8217;ve done.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure that child will allow me to at least meet during the New Year. Because he is kind. I can&#8217;t let myself become a further burden to him. Above all, I can&#8217;t bear it anymore.</p>



<p>Is this what it means to detach from being a sister? I&#8217;m disgusted by my foolishness.</p>



<p>The reason I never tried to distance myself was not only out of guilt but also because I couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I love you. But let&#8217;s end it here.&#8221;</p>



<p>To avoid any unresolved feelings, from now on, we will be a normal sister and brother.</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Suzune Side]</h4>



<p>The ball traces a parabolic trajectory, burning its path into my vision as if in slow motion.</p>



<p>A world devoid of sound. The surrounding noise doesn&#8217;t reach my ears. Unconsciously, tears escape.</p>



<p>In the silence, I lean over the railing and shout at the top of my lungs, regardless of appearances.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please!—Go in!&#8221;</p>



<p>The outcome has already been decided. Only pride remains. I give it my all for the final shot.</p>



<p>Sound returns to the world. With a thud, the ball bounces off the backboard, and Toshirou Himura&#8217;s shot misses the rim. The timer hits zero, and the buzzer sounds.</p>



<p>Toshirou Himura, crumbling down, is helped up by his fellow third-year teammates.</p>


<p>Shouyoukou High School boys&#8217; basketball team&#8217;s summer journey comes to an unexpectedly abrupt end in the fourth round.</p>



<p>What words should I say? What words are the right ones?</p>



<p>Neither the manager, Shiori Kamishiro, nor Suzune Takamiya, who has been supporting us since the first round, can figure it out. &#8220;You did well,&#8221; &#8220;Just getting this far is amazing.&#8221; Such words are inadequate, as anyone observing the boys&#8217; basketball team can see. No one seeks consolation. Frustration is evident on their faces. They didn&#8217;t want it to end here. They wanted to go further.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an emotion that the boys&#8217; basketball team hadn&#8217;t experienced before. Once you catch a glimpse of hope, you can&#8217;t help but desire it. You can&#8217;t help but believe in the possibilities. So they fought relentlessly, dirtied their feet.</p>



<p>Yet, they couldn&#8217;t reach it. They knew that. Other schools are also diligently polishing their skills.</p>



<p>They are different from Toshirou and the others, who recently changed their approach. It&#8217;s the result of their desperate efforts since their first year.</p>



<p>Still, they didn&#8217;t think the barrier in front of them would be impenetrable. Their fingertips were barely brushing against it. If only they had a little more time, maybe they could have reached it. The regret of the third-year students weighs heavily on the basketball team.</p>



<p>They quietly begin to leave the comprehensive gymnasium, with few words spoken.</p>



<p>In the midst of a heavy, oppressive silence, Suzune Takamiya&#8217;s gaze falls upon Yukito Kokonoe, who acts as if nothing has happened, just as always.</p>



<p>Suzune knows the reason behind it. The match results were clearly communicated to him in advance.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t win this game,&#8221; Yukito Kokonoe had told Suzune. It wasn&#8217;t an abstract statement; it was based on solid evidence. Yukito had calmly assessed the strengths and weaknesses of both teams and arrived at that conclusion.</p>



<p>Why did Yukito feel the need to tell Suzune this?</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe operated with a different purpose and principle than the rest of the boys&#8217; basketball team.</p>



<p>Upon hearing the conversation, Suzune&nbsp; felt a deep sense of embarrassment for her own insecurity. Moreover, she was unsettled by how accurately Yukito had pinpointed her emotions and couldn&#8217;t contain her feelings any longer. She wanted someone to listen to her, to know her thoughts, so she poured them out like a release.</p>



<p>Yukito quietly listened to her words by his side.</p>



<p>And he said to Suzune, after losing the game, that there were two choices.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not over yet! This isn&#8217;t the end. We still have the Winter Cup. Suzune, I want you to wait a little longer. I&#8217;ll show you how much higher we can reach. We will definitely achieve results next time. So that I can become worthy of you, this time, for sure, I—&#8221;</p>



<p>As Yukito had predicted, Toshirou Himura chose to make the decision, and the result was not desirable for Suzune Takamiya.</p>


<p>Yukito had conveyed to Suzune, &#8220;If you continue to postpone the confession any further.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzune knows what will happen next. A single scenario has been presented.</p>



<p>A ridiculously absurd farce, and it was even a recycled one. Yet, at that moment, everyone was captivated by such a farce. It seized the hearts of those who were watching, refusing to let go. They were struck by its nobility.</p>



<p>Both Toshirou and Suzune were present in that scene. They could only watch, unable to do anything else.</p>



<p>The sight of Toshirou wanting to stand on the court together, his determination reached the multitude present. Suzune was one of those who shed tears at that resolve.</p>



<p>Toshirou and Suzune were both cowards. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Toshirou sought out Yukito Kokonoe.</p>



<p>At the very least, Yukito and those who gathered around him all possess strength.</p>



<p>They do not fear pain or being hurt. They are unafraid to collide with each other, with their emotions laid bare.</p>



<p>One day, Suzune casually asked Shiori Kamishiro about it. Shiori smiled and answered that she, too, was a coward.</p>


<p>She admitted that she was still a coward, scared to death. However, Suzune respected Shiori, who said that she no longer wanted to have regrets. It didn&#8217;t matter if she was a junior. She was undeniably stronger than Suzune.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe looked at Suzune Takamiya. He nodded slightly. It seemed that the grand farce was about to begin.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, Suzune will fulfill her role as the chosen prima donna.</p>



<p>He should be free of us both by now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Toshirou Himura, I hereby expel you from the basketball team!&#8221;</p>



<p>[Yukito PoV]</p>



<p>In front of the gathered crowd near the exit of the gymnasium, I made a loud declaration.</p>



<p>The sudden coup caused a stir among the surrounding people. Well, that&#8217;s to be expected.</p>



<p>Even she didn&#8217;t anticipate something like this. But there&#8217;s no helping it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Expulsion? What do you mean, Yukito Kokonoe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s gotten into you, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Are you saying I&#8217;m a burden?&#8221;</p>



<p>I delivered the statement coldly, causing confusion among the others. The hot-blooded senpai still have room to grow.</p>



<p>The more he trains, the better he will become. But there&#8217;s no meaning in that alone.</p>



<p>Whether he accepts the expulsion or not, the passionate senior must make a choice—for his future.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait! It may be true for now. But we still have a few months until the Winter Cup. With that time, we can aim higher. I can&#8217;t just end it here. Please, Yukito Kokonoe, give me one more chance&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How long will you keep Takamiya-senpai waiting!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;&#8211;!&#8221;</p>



<p>I grabbed the collar of the passionate senior. The sudden outburst caught the attention of students from other schools.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve been starting from the wrong point altogether. It doesn&#8217;t matter if his motivations for playing basketball are different.</p>



<p>Even the intensity of his passion varies from person to person. Some play for enjoyment, others play competitively.</p>



<p>If you genuinely want to play, that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll support you for that.</p>



<p>However, among them, only the hot-blooded senpai was pure. He was more pure than anyone else and devoted himself more earnestly than anyone else, but he kept spinning his wheels, wondering what he was doing to get better and what he needed results for. A divergence between means and ends.</p>



<p>Above all, he is completely oblivious to Takamiya-senpai. Even though she is so deeply saddened&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of it. Personalizing the club for yourself is a nuisance. How long are you going to drag us along? Cut it out already! It&#8217;s not all about you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, please stop! Even the captain thinks the same.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry for Shiori, who tries to stop me in confusion, but I can&#8217;t let it end here.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m saying this because you don&#8217;t understand. This guy has no interest in Takamiya Senpai. He only thinks about himself. It&#8217;s a nuisance if someone like him keeps lingering around.&#8221;</p>



<p>I exert force like a vice, pushing it to the limit.</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, that&#8217;s not it. I wanted to&#8230; have the qualification to stand by Suzune&#8217;s side&#8230; because I have nothing else.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By her side? Don&#8217;t be foolish. Takamiya Senpai has long given up on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8230;? S-Suzune&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turn my gaze towards Takamiya Senpai, barely holding on.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, Toshirou. I can&#8217;t keep up with you anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Takamiya Senpai stands beside me. She releases his hand, and the hot blooded senpai falls to the ground with a thud.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie! Why&#8230;?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t understand, that&#8217;s why they call you incompetent!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Toshirou&#8217;s fault! I never wanted this to go on forever!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not true! Suzune, I truly&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough! I don&#8217;t care about you anymore, Toshirou.&#8221;</p>



<p>The heated argument between the hot blooded senpai and Takamiya Senpai grows louder. They say even dogs won&#8217;t eat a couple&#8217;s fight, but it&#8217;s actually more concerning if there&#8217;s an animal that would. It seems nutritionally poor and harmful to the body.</p>



<p>I apologize for being absorbed in their quarrel, but am I standing out too much?</p>



<p>Among the students from other schools, there are some who are anxiously watching, ready to intervene if things get out of hand. They&#8217;re too kind-hearted.</p>



<p>Oh, there&#8217;s a refreshing and handsome acquaintance, Daigo-senpai. Ooi, over here! Long time no see!</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s unexpected for me to stand out to this extent. What should I do&#8230;?</p>



<p>I might seriously end up being disciplined by Sayuri-sensei. It&#8217;s also the right season for it, so I should send her a gift.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, I have something! I take out the Bunnyman mask from my bag. Kapoof!</p>



<p>&#8220;Mihou-kun, this is&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see! This flow, Yukito, could it be—&#8221;</p>



<p>The perceptive and refreshing handsome acquaintance and Shiori have noticed. After all, they were involved last time.</p>



<p>Yes, I borrowed and copied the idea from the perceptive and refreshing handsome acquaintance.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s boring to just borrow and copy. Let&#8217;s make it flashy!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ussassassa. Suzune will become the wife of this Bunnyman, usa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! Suzune, is it over between us? Is it too late&#8230;?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Ku&#8230; Bunnyman is more wonderful than a loser like Toshirou. He has potential for the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take good care of her, usa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Toshirou is such an idiot. It&#8217;s my first time being with bunnyman&#8212;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With a much deeper despair in her expression than when we lost the game, the hot blooded senpai sits down.</p>



<p>It seems like Takamiya Senpai has crushed his last hope.</p>



<p>What do you mean by &#8220;for the first time&#8221;!? This is going too far! If you break the hot blooded senpai&#8217;s spirit, there will be no turning back.</p>



<p>This plan is a two-stage plan, the traditional art of &#8220;expulsion&#8221; → &#8220;awakening,&#8221; which has been handed down since ancient times.</p>



<p>I intended to motivate the hot blooded senpai, but my argument is on the verge of falling apart.</p>



<p>If he doesn&#8217;t have the will to compete with me from here, it won&#8217;t start. He has become a passive senpai, lacking determination.</p>



<p>Realizing that the plan needs adjustment, the perceptive and refreshing handsome acquaintance offers a lifeline.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, Bunnyman. If I can steal the ball from you, you have to withdraw the exile!&#8221;</p>



<p>This guy is a good person! Although he&#8217;s strangely overbearing, he&#8217;s a good person!</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so naive, usa. Do you think you can steal the ball from this Bunnyman?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it this time. Captain, let&#8217;s regain Takamiya Senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mihou, you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay with just being pushed around forever? Do you want to end it without burning out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Suzune is&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such an incredibly uncool and bad guy. Why did I ever like someone like him?&#8221;</p>



<p>Takamiya Senpai provokes him. She doesn&#8217;t seem to reflect at all on going too far earlier and breaking his spirit.</p>



<p>However, strangely enough, her words reach the hot blooded senpai&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like&#8230; I see, you really liked me&#8230; And yet, I&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The hot blooded senpai hits the asphalt with his fist. In his eyes, the fighting spirit has returned.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lacked confidence&#8230; I was scared. But that was selfish of me, and it caused you pain. Without realizing it, I stopped seeing what was most important to you&#8230; I&#8217;m such an idiot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late now, Toshirou.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But still!&#8221;</p>



<p>I apologize for interrupting the exciting moment, but may I proceed?</p>



<p>&#8220;You, a pathetic loser like you, think you can win Suzune back? Don&#8217;t make me laugh, Usa. Then I&#8217;ll take on all those people who are watching from a distance. They&#8217;re all a bunch of losers, making me yawn.&#8221;</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve been constantly getting my picture taken and asked for handshakes since earlier. Could it be that what Hyaku-senpai said is true, and I&#8217;ve actually become a sensation without me knowing?</p>



<p>The serious atmosphere has disappeared, replaced by a heartwarming one, but I regain my focus. This comedic act is completely inappropriate for the finale of the tournament, but it&#8217;s too late to stop now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kouki, you&#8217;re doing something interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Daigo-senpai? Congratulations on winning the block.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t face each other in the finals league. Don&#8217;t you think so, Gai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Daigo, it&#8217;s been a while. And Kouki too. So you&#8217;re still playing basketball.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, because I found him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Him, huh? He&#8217;s infuriating. I didn&#8217;t want to see him again. When I saw Bunnyman&#8217;s moves in the video, I thought, &#8216;Could it be?&#8217; It was surprising to find you next to him, and I planned to ask when you met him. But after watching today&#8217;s match, I&#8217;m convinced. That man, he&#8217;s our&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you say, Kuga-senpai? Shall we seek revenge?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it was foolish to challenge the dojo in this current era, but I see, it&#8217;s interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>The charming handsome guy was getting excited in his own way.</p>



<p>The hot-blooded senior stood up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it, Yukito Kokonoe. No, Bunnyman!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, everyone around me was excited. The tension of the moment is terrifying. These people are shamelessly calling me Bunnyman, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll regret it later. I was the first of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, isn&#8217;t this gathering too crowded?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They brought it upon themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Mihou Side]</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn it! What&#8217;s with his stamina, Kouki!&#8221;</p>



<p>Breathing heavily, Daigo carefully observed Bunnyman&#8217;s movements. There must be a gap. His stamina is not unlimited. He sharpened his senses to find a breakthrough.</p>



<p>As the participants swelled in numbers, with players from powerful schools challenging one after another, Bunnyman continued to keep the ball in his possession.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only played one match today. We still have plenty of stamina left.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the issue.&#8221;</p>



<p>Like Daigo, Kuga also stepped back to regroup.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you crying, Kouki?&#8221;</p>



<p>Without replying to Daigo&#8217;s question, Kouki touched his cheek. It&#8217;s definitely not sweat.</p>



<p>After the match, a sense of frustration swirled within Kouki&#8217;s heart. He clenched his fist in regret.</p>



<p>Defeated in the fourth round. He had no complaints about the match result. He gave it his all and lost. It was a fulfilling day. If he continued practicing like this, he might reach an even bigger stage someday. That&#8217;s what he thought. Just a vague thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;It feels nostalgic, doesn&#8217;t it, Kuga senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For us, it&#8217;s a bitter memory. Wipe your tears. Why do you look so happy?&#8221;</p>



<p>Daigo, Kuga, and Kouki were all part of the same middle school and basketball club. Kouki was a year younger, but they were comrades who polished each other through fierce competition.</p>



<p>And on that day, experiencing the humiliation of defeat, Kouki inherited the feelings of his seniors.</p>



<p>In Kouki&#8217;s gaze, stood the man who became a barrier between them and their seniors.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is still our wall.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t act so cool after losing so easily in the fourth round.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can say that only for now!&#8221;</p>



<p>Toshirou Himura boldly rushed in, but Bunnyman easily dealt with him.</p>



<p>In a swift exchange, Kouki also charged forward, but he couldn&#8217;t maintain his balance and lost his posture.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t reach him, it was never supposed to reach! We made you lonely!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with this high-tension, refreshing handsome guy? Scary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kouki thought. That he, at least his current self, couldn&#8217;t match up.</p>



<p>Kouki realized it. It was because he accidentally saw Kokonoe&#8217;s notebook.</p>



<p>It was filled with detailed data on their opponents. The specifics of the regular players, their dominant hand, the type of players they were, their preferred tactics. It wasn&#8217;t something that could be gathered quickly.</p>



<p>Kokonoe had been diligently collecting this information. Probably even during their training camps. He researched, devised tactics, and improved their overall strength.</p>



<p>But he never shared it. It remained an unused trump card.</p>



<p>If you want to win, you should use it. If such a thing exists, it should be utilized. So why?</p>



<p>But that is a shameful mindset. If you want to win, why isn&#8217;t anyone else doing it?</p>



<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s not something a first-year newcomer should consider. Their efforts are overwhelmingly insufficient.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was left to others. Anyone could have done the same thing. Yet no one did, not even propose it.</p>



<p>Why, then, should only Yukito Kokonoe have to do it? Irresponsibly burdening him with responsibility.</p>



<p>If someone had just mentioned it, Kokonoe would have presented the notebook.</p>



<p>He repeatedly questioned himself. Was he really serious about winning against the opponent?</p>


<p>His teammates, none of them were genuinely committed to winning, merely fantasizing about the future. At this very moment, they made the man who was always serious about winning feel lonely.</p>



<p>Until now, Kouki and the others had put in effort to become better. The acts of challenging stronger opponents, even going as far as defeating dojos, were part of that effort. It had an effect. They were steadily gaining strength. Including Toshiro, the basketball club was rapidly improving. But it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>



<p>Efforts to win. Overcoming the opponent. What was necessary and how to achieve it.</p>



<p>They had remained vague and never pursued it further. Except for one person.</p>



<p>They had the opponent&#8217;s data. With that, they might have advanced past the fourth round.</p>



<p>However, in the end, only Yukito Kokonoe made that effort. It was an inevitable defeat.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, it was nothing but the &#8220;spoiled spirit&#8221; Yukito Kokonoe had previously mentioned.</p>



<p>They couldn&#8217;t even mention something like the Inter-High. They couldn&#8217;t say they were serious, even if their life depended on it.</p>



<p>It was clear that their mentality hadn&#8217;t reached the same level as their skills.</p>



<p>Their passion, the quality of their efforts, the relentless pursuit and yearning for victory, everything was lacking.</p>



<p>Kouki remembered. He had also put in such efforts in the past. After losing in his second year of high school, he spent days practicing, imagining and preparing to win next time with his senpais.</p>



<p>During that intense period, Kouki was aware of his significant growth.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why, in this moment when it was thrust upon him, and with his senpais who had spent the same amount of passion by his side, he felt joy, happiness, and reliance, while chastising his own inadequacy.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s frustrating. Remaining in defeat, content in such a place.</p>



<p>Participants who were satisfied with their attempts gradually began to decrease.</p>



<p>The spectators held their breath, eagerly watching to see the outcome.</p>



<p>Amidst this, Toshiro, who couldn&#8217;t give up, continued to challenge again and again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Toshiro?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Himura-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>Toshiro&#8217;s strength drained from his knees, and he fell down heavily.</p>



<p>Kamishiro quickly rushed to Toshiro, who was crouching down, holding his ankle in pain.</p>



<p>She took out tape from her bag and swiftly started wrapping it around the injured area.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up! Toshiro, there&#8217;s no way you can win!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll win, Suzune. I definitely will. Just for now, just for today, I will win!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How are you going to do that with your foot like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing Toshiro struggling to stand, Kouki firmly made up his mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, will you cooperate with us? I want to help the captain win.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on board. Today, I&#8217;ll strip off that mask of his.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me even more tired at the end of the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>Daigo smirked while Kuga let out a frustrated complaint.</p>



<p>(Someday, I&#8217;ll stand beside you, right next to you, and together we&#8230;)</p>



<p>Obtain the medal. It would become an irreplaceable part of his youth.</p>



<p>With unwavering determination, Kouki and the others dashed forward, cutting off their past regrets and lingering attachments.</p>



<p>Believing that glory awaited them at the end.</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Himura PoV]</h4>



<p>It&#8217;s only natural to exhaust oneself when the offense and defense continue for such a long time.</p>



<p>Even Bunnyman, Yukito Kokonoe, seems to be struggling, as if his physical strength has been reduced.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, he still refused to let go of the ball. His skills and determination are truly formidable.</p>



<p>Kouki and the others are keeping up just as well. It&#8217;s an intense battle of attrition.</p>



<p>The first-year students are reliable and promising. The future of the basketball club looks bright.</p>



<p>It was them, the upperclassmen, who held them back.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I knew it. I&#8217;ve been wrong from the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>I recruited Yukito Kokonoe to join the basketball team in order to show my performance to Suzune, but in retrospect, that was a mistake.</p>



<p>The purpose of the game was switched and without realizing it, I was causing Suzune to suffer.</p>


<p>For the sake of foolish me, they prepared this ridiculous grand stage.</p>



<p>They stood before me in the end, as my greatest enemy. It was all for the sake of my pride.</p>



<p>Memories rush through my mind. It was an exhilarating few months. I could feel myself growing every day.</p>



<p>Last summer we challenged with great anticipation and ended in defeat in the fourth round.</p>



<p>To say that I have no regrets would be a lie. I wish I had committed myself more seriously earlier, but the result I can be proud of. We, the pathetic upperclassmen, were changed by the first-year students.</p>



<p>I relied on everything, and in the end, I was expelled, and everything was perfectly orchestrated.</p>



<p>But I can&#8217;t let it all go to waste.</p>



<p>I was the one who made Yukito Kokonoe pull this farce, and I was the one who pushed Suzune into such a farcical situation.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve challenged countless times, dragging my feet, only to be mercilessly crushed.</p>



<p>In the end, I couldn&#8217;t win a single time. The title of captain is weeping.</p>



<p>I confirm the feeling of the taping. It&#8217;s been about fifteen minutes since I fell, and it has blended in seamlessly without any discomfort.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve long surpassed my physical limits. I probably won&#8217;t be able to stand up again.</p>



<p>The same goes for Yukito Kokone and Kouki. I apologize for dragging them into this mess.</p>



<p>The ending was approaching. This was my one and only chance. Failure was not an option.</p>



<p>I am the only one qualified to end this game.</p>



<p>For that reason, Suzune, Yukito Kokonoe, and Kouki are giving it their all, fighting tooth and nail.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m crawling on the ground, covered in wounds. But he&#8217;s the same.</p>



<p>I recall the past few months since Yukito Kokonoe joined the team. We were shown a distant height, a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>Setting goals, moving forward with determination, we have grown. And now, we are condemned for our dependence, tasting despair, and collapsing on the ground like rags.</p>



<p>Every day felt like riding a roller coaster, with exhilarating ups and downs.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have to thank Yukito Kokonoe for bringing me this far.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have to respond. To the days that have passed. And to Suzune.</p>



<p>If I listen carefully, I can hear voices. Voices that believe in and cheer for me, despite my pitiful state.</p>



<p>I rise from my heavy body and take a deep breath. To inspire myself, I weave my words.</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just a game. It&#8217;s a battle. I&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to win. So&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A strange sensation, as if I have become the protagonist of a story, standing at the center of the world.</p>



<p>I see, I am the protagonist of my own life. I realize this obvious fact only now.</p>


<p>Others don&#8217;t matter. Yet, I let the surrounding noise bother me and hurt Suzune.</p>



<p>Enduring the pain, protecting my injured leg, I awkwardly challenge the battle.</p>



<p>As I start running, the Bunny Man immediately tries to intercept me, but my feet get tangled, and I stumble.</p>



<p>My knees lose their strength with a thud. For a moment, the Bunny Man freezes in motion. A fleeting hesitation. Perhaps he briefly considered the possibility of my victory and reached out his hand to prevent my fall.</p>



<p>My junior who is kind no matter how far it goes. Impudent, stoic, reckless, yet strict.</p>



<p>With my taped foot, I step forward forcefully, putting all my strength into it.</p>



<p>With an explosive image in my mind, I throw my body forward.</p>



<p>&#8220;At least show us a good look for the last time, you idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>Encouraged by Suzune’s voice, I reach out with all my might for the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reachhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>The Bunny Man wears a surprised expression. Come to think of it, Yukito Kokonoe always had an expressionless face.</p>



<p>And how about that! Take that! It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m always being beaten by you!</p>



<p>I embrace the ball as if holding it tightly. I won&#8217;t let it go. Neither the ball nor Suzune.</p>



<p>With the momentum, I roll and dash towards the gallery.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, the foot injury was a fake, huh?&#8221; (Yuki)</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have to do something like this if I want to defeat you. It&#8217;s a once-in-a-lifetime showdown.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well done.&#8221;</p>



<p>I raise the ball high above, like a medal of honor.</p>



<p>The thunderous applause envelops me, as if it&#8217;s about to shatter.</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Yukito PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;I love you, Suzune! I want to marry you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Marriage?! We&#8217;re not even dating, isn&#8217;t that jumping ahead too much?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you, Suzune! I don&#8217;t want to give you to anyone else, I don&#8217;t want to be apart from you. I want you by my side. I&#8217;ve hurt you. I foolishly cared about appearances and protected my meaningless pride. But I won&#8217;t repeat it ever again! I will make you happy, no matter what! I want you, Suzune!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Idiot. I love you too, Toshiro! I&#8217;ve been waiting for you!&#8221;</p>



<p>They embrace each other. It&#8217;s a touching scene. The summer doesn&#8217;t end in sadness.</p>



<p>&#8220;You still have to study hard, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>The hot-blooded senpai turns to us. I have already taken off the Bunnyman mask. It&#8217;s hot.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m retiring from the basketball club. There&#8217;s nothing left for me to regret. So, Yukito Kokonoe, I&#8217;m counting on you from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I refuse.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t refuse, it was such a good atmosphere!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still a first-year.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t a conclusive ending, but with such a large gallery present for our public confession, cheers and applause of celebration resound from all around. We also prepared party hats and crackers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, congratulations!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Takamiya-senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kamishiro-san, when did you prepare all this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki took care of it in advance&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Be prepared for anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mihou, I won! I won!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations! Your determination reached her, senpai!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s your turn. Defeat this guy in a grand manner!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though we&#8217;re supposed to be teammates in the same club, I felt like I was left out.</p>



<p>Finally, I can take a breather. This ridiculous farce is finally over. I&#8217;m completely exhausted.</p>



<p>The relentless attacks from the refreshing handsome group, who seemed determined to crush me, were excessively obsessive.</p>



<p>These people must hate me, right? Someday, they&#8217;ll seek revenge. Definitely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito Kokonoe, thanks for everything. Thank you for exiling me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The one who did the exile is the villain, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, that&#8217;s right. Absolutely! You&#8217;re a bad guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The hot blooded senpai laughs heartily. Beside him, Takamiya-senpai also laughs with joy. Applause continues to echo as if celebrating their new beginning.</p>



<p>Little did anyone know that this commotion would later become known as the &#8220;Miracle of Bunnyman,&#8221; spreading across the nation.</p>



<p>The rabbit, now an icon of love prayers, would be cherished for a long time.</p>



<p>The urban legend of the monster Bunnyman, a preacher of love, became more and more confusing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>[Kamishiro PoV]</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great that they made it through!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They were quite forceful, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>Walking together with Yuki, eating ice cream we bought from the convenience store on our way back from the tournament.</p>



<p>The chocolate is beginning to melt in the heat, and I hastily stop it from spilling out of my mouth. It&#8217;s a peaceful, happy time as I struggle to finish the ice cream. My heart remains fluffy and dreamy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder what will happen to those two.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take responsibility for what comes next.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; After all, it&#8217;s their story now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I can only intervene and assist up to this point. The two of them needed help.</p>



<p>It was like a deeply moving experience, as if becoming an extra in a movie. Witnessing a miracle.</p>



<p>The happy ending of two people who overcame difficulties and found each other. It&#8217;s romantic and aspirational.</p>



<p>Many of the people present at that moment must have felt the same way I did.</p>



<p>Even though I should have been down after losing the game, Yuki saw something different.</p>



<p>That fact is a little frustrating. I feel pathetic for not facing the same direction as Yuki.</p>



<p>I became the manager of the boys&#8217; basketball club. Yuki accepted me, but it feels unsatisfying.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t notice that Himura-senpai was feeling anxious or that Takamiya-senpai was struggling.</p>



<p>I wanted to be of help to Yuki, to be useful, but I couldn&#8217;t accomplish anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope they can be happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s Hot blooded-senpai, he&#8217;ll be fine. He awakened, after all.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuki brings happiness to those around them. It&#8217;s a stark contrast to me, who only inflicts pain.</p>



<p>I can only take from Yuki.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so powerless&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t grown. The only thing that&#8217;s grown is my height. No matter how much time passes, I can&#8217;t consider others&#8217; feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re doing well, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. I haven&#8217;t done anything—&#8221;</p>



<p>Kindness tightens my chest. No, I&#8217;m still unable to give anything back!</p>



<p>I caress my wristwatch. Since the day we met until today, I&#8217;ve only received things.</p>



<p>Yuki helped me. Protected. Saved me. Forgave me. Above all, I received so much happiness. More than I can ever repay.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been selfishly enjoying that kindness all this time.</p>



<p>Yuki made me happy, but I can&#8217;t make Yuki happy.</p>



<p>Who will make Yuki happy? Where does Yuki&#8217;s happiness lie?</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, what do you want to do from now on?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>What I want to do has always been clear. I want to support Yuki. That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>&#8220;The basketball club will continue self-training until the Winter Cup. I&#8217;ll be attending the art club for a while. I have prepared training menus, and thinking about what they lack is also part of the practice. Besides, now that the issue with the hot-blooded senpai is resolved, I don&#8217;t have a next goal set yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuki is busy. Attending the art club must be necessary for someone.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve probably noticed, but the boys&#8217; basketball team doesn&#8217;t really need a manager. There&#8217;s nothing specific for you to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I feel like I haven&#8217;t contributed anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No one is saying that. Your presence is only a positive influence in terms of motivation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Am I really making a contribution? Am I being helpful?</p>



<p>There are few members in the boys&#8217; basketball team, and there are hardly any miscellaneous tasks. In the first place, it&#8217;s more common for a club not to have a manager. In that sense, the boys&#8217; basketball team was unique. I have a place here because Yuki provided it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, join the girls&#8217; basketball team. I&#8217;ve talked to the captain about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? But I want to be with&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, you can stay registered as a manager. Just show up and support us during the matches. Shiori, why did you come to this school?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; to chase after Yuki&#8230; I didn&#8217;t want it to end like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the undeniable truth. I ran relentlessly without looking back, with only that goal in mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that enough for you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not denying it. I told that to Hinagi too&#8230; You guys are too blind. Try to have a broader perspective and be greedy for happiness. Show the determination to obtain everything you desire. We have plenty of time. Aim for a 100% completion rate in the CGs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blind&#8230; Even if I&#8217;m told that, I can&#8217;t help it. I was desperate to catch up to Yuki, only focusing on his back. I didn&#8217;t have the luxury to think about anything else. Impatience and anxiety were driving me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, I&#8217;m not going anywhere. I&#8217;ll be right here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-!&#8221;</p>



<p>I see, I don&#8217;t need to chase after Yuki&#8217;s back anymore. I understand it smoothly.</p>


<p>Yuki&#8217;s words slowly soak into my heart. One love has come to an end.</p>



<p>It was a painful love, always chasing after him. From now on&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You should go to the place where you are needed and enjoy yourself. It&#8217;s okay to have as many things you want to do. I&#8217;m already short on time and panting, as it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because I only focused on Yuki, I didn&#8217;t notice the impatience of Himura-Senpai or the anxiety of Takamiya-Senpai. I still have a lot to learn. In that case, I should gain more experience.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Yuki always does!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll become a more wonderful and charming person and make Yuki fall in love with me even more.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s my next goal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, I&#8217;ll make the girls&#8217; basketball team win the championship!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem to have a lot of energy. You&#8217;re a high school student. Sing and celebrate your youth.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuki was also looking at me properly. That made me happier than anything else.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have somewhere to stop by now. This is where we part ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Then, see you at school!&#8221;</p>



<p>At the level crossing where we part ways, the alarm bell rings and the barrier comes down.</p>



<p>Unable to stand still while watching him leave, I shouted.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-Am I not good enough!&#8221;</p>



<p>Did my voice reach him? Yuki stops abruptly.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8212;-I wonder if I can make Yuki happy!&#8221;</p>



<p>I love you. I love you so much. But above all, I want to give something back. Give form to these feelings.</p>



<p>As if hesitating, he turns around.</p>



<p>The train passes, blocking my line of sight.</p>



<p>Time passes, fleeting yet eternal, and my field of vision opens up.</p>



<p>Yuki was not on the other side of the tracks.</p>
