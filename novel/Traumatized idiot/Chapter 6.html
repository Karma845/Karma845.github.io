<h2>Chapter 6: Don&#039;t Forget That Summer</h2>

<p>The web commercial that shook the world quickly garnered millions of views, surpassing two million views in no time.</p>



<p>Despite being targeted towards high school students, the bold and thrilling approach was met with great acclaim.</p>



<p>My SNS was flooded with &#8220;Endaaaaaaaaaaa&#8221; on the day the commercial was released.</p>



<p>The secret content that my sister had kept hidden was based on the theme of &#8220;Beauty and the Beast.&#8221;</p>



<p>After my sister&#8217;s kiss, sparkling effects enveloped me, and just before the curse of the Bunnyman was broken, the commercial ended. The viewers were left wanting more! The second installment is already in the works!</p>



<p>In the end, my true identity was not revealed, but it didn&#8217;t really matter anymore. The setting was too elaborate, claiming that I and the princess were once in love before I became Bunnyman. It was an overly complicated setup.</p>



<p>My sister&#8217;s smile captivated the hearts of the viewers and charmed a large audience. Offers for her appearances are pouring in, but she casually said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to accept any of those. No way.&#8221;</p>



<p>The reservations for the Bash shoes are doing great. We already received a pair, and they are the latest model with excellent performance, incredibly comfortable to wear. You can check the site here. Click the URL below→</p>



<p>Due to the sponsorship deal, we receive a new pair every six months throughout our three years of high school.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re flaunting it in front of a single person like me&#8230; Damn lovey-dovey couples! I told you, Yukito Kokonoe, didn&#8217;t I? Don&#8217;t make this situation any bigger. I told you, right? You should have listened, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t responded.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would you hold a limited-time shop event?! Can&#8217;t you be quiet for once?! The school office is flooded with inquiries because people know about it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Sensei. We&#8217;ve already prepared a hoodie and a T-shirt for you. Wear it as loungewear. You can even choose other merchandise according to your liking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, fine! Make it a free size. I might resell it if I need to.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some wise person once said that summer vacation is short, but I don&#8217;t think so. It can be considered one of the privileges of being a student to have over a month of holidays. At least, once you become a working adult, it&#8217;s challenging to have such an extended break unless a state of emergency is declared.</p>



<p>As I thought about how funny Clammbon looks when it laughs, I half-listen to Sayuri-sensei as she goes over the notices for summer vacation.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m in serious study mode right now. I&#8217;m completely focused on the task at hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Especially you, Yukito Kokonoe, make sure not to cause any trouble during summer vacation! I&#8217;m already fed up. I don&#8217;t want to be called to the school during my break either. Seriously, I&#8217;m counting on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll talk to the principal and make it easier for you to take paid leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That would be really helpful for the other teachers too. Having unused paid leave is such a waste. Whenever my favorite artist&#8217;s concert is on a weekday, I feel like killing my grandma.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, was last month&#8217;s memorial service a staged murder?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have eight grandmas, you know. Just let it be like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paid leave is a right for workers, and there&#8217;s no need to explain the reason for taking it.</p>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s black school rules or paid leave, such negative customs in Japan need to be improved as soon as possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, my well-being depends on you!&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not causing trouble on purpose, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like I go looking for trouble; it just comes my way, and I can&#8217;t do much about it until I encounter it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I know that… Anyway, let me have some peace. I&#8217;m tired too, you know? Do you know that other teachers have been oddly nice to me lately? They&#8217;re being considerate of me. I&#8217;m still in my late twenties. I&#8217;m still in my late twenties!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a bad thing, no?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your fault, you know? Do you understand? Well, never mind. Just make sure everyone spends the break peacefully. I don&#8217;t want to see suddenly wild girls after the summer vacation. You&#8217;re free to go wild and have fun, but make sure to be responsible with contraception. Okay, dismissed.&#8221;</p>



<p>With the least amount of trust and the most vivid warnings, Sayuri-sensei leaves the classroom. My lack of credibility is priceless. But by that time, I was almost done with everything.</p>



<p>Mineda, the gal girl who became my seat neighbor after the seat change, starts talking to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-chan, what have you been doing? You&#8217;ve been in such a rush.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing. I just finished my summer vacation homework.&#8221;</p>



<p>I show Mineda the completed printout. I had been bracing myself for how much homework we&#8217;d get as high schoolers, but it turned out to be quite manageable.</p>



<p>There were printouts, exercise books, and a standard composition.</p>



<p>&#8220;But summer vacation hasn&#8217;t started yet! It&#8217;s tomorrow!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I write a dozen or so book reports. I always have ten book reports in stock.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really did… You&#8217;ve already finished them all…&#8221;</p>



<p>During long vacations, there aren&#8217;t many variations in assignments. It&#8217;s rather uncreative that every year we have to write book reports, but if you just write something like &#8220;I empathized with the author&#8217;s feelings&#8221; or something similar, you can write the report without even reading the book.</p>



<p>Some people like to take jabs at the younger generation, claiming they don&#8217;t read books anymore, but with the rise of web novels and such, the younger generation is probably reading more than the old folks. Tell them that, those old-timers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you busy during the summer break?&#8221;</p>



<p>He gives me a wry smile as he approaches. Surprisingly, the refreshing and handsome man seems a bit childish.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? I&#8217;m an introverted loner. I&#8217;m not busy at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you getting a bit defensive there?&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, I tried saying I&#8217;m an introverted loner, but it seems it doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. It&#8217;s a lost cause.</p>



<p>&#8220;To be honest, during summer breaks, I&#8217;ve mostly been hospitalized. So, spending it alone is better than before. It&#8217;s not like I have anything else to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you talking as if you&#8217;re scared of your own past? Also, why do you keep forgetting about my existence? I&#8217;ve been looking forward to the summer break. Let&#8217;s hang out together! We&#8217;ve all talked about it. Let&#8217;s go to the beach!&#8221;</p>



<p>The gleaming white teeth of the refreshing and handsome man sparkled. I&#8217;ve been thinking this for a while, but does he like me a bit too much? And yet, he&#8217;s so popular, but I don&#8217;t hear any rumors about him having a girlfriend.</p>



<p>&#8220;The beach? I just went there with Shiori.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going fishing, we&#8217;re going for a swim! Come on, Yuki, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>



<p>A beach trip? Honestly, I don&#8217;t remember ever doing that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito&#8217;s coming too, right? It&#8217;ll be a wonderful memory.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems that Hinagi will be going as well. The beach, huh… This kind of summer might be fun.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s give it a try.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, Sayuri-Sensei, just after you called me a damn Riaju.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to become a real Riaju!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&#8220;Part-time job? You?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Watching you and the others made me want to try doing something during summer vacation too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it because you got addicted to gacha and need money desperately? I&#8217;ve told you not to waste money on it, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that. I just want to experience different things like you, Yukito.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the break time, while happily drawing a complicated maze in her notebook, Hinagi-chan comes to me for advice on her summer vacation plans. It seems she&#8217;s considering getting a part-time job.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cafes or convenience stores, maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that bothersome?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>Haa, this is a problem, this is a problem. Hinagi-chan&#8217;s thinking is sweeter than Tokyo Hiyoko&#8217;s. [TL: Some kind of sweet]</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen carefully. The service industry nowadays is becoming increasingly complex. Even something as simple as payments has various options like cash, credit cards, IC cards, and electronic money, making it incredibly troublesome. Working part-time just during the short summer vacation won&#8217;t give you enough time to learn the whole process. Besides, companies are reluctant to hire students for such a short period, despite the manpower shortage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I see. Now that you mention it, it might be like that. I didn&#8217;t really think about it, but being a store clerk must be tough. So, what kind of part-time job do you think suits me, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan is raising her eyebrows in thought. Her enthusiasm for work is something I&#8217;d really like to appreciate.</p>



<p>A part-time job for Hinagi… Hmm, is there anything suitable…?</p>



<p>&#8220;Clinical trials… MLM… information products… acting as a middleman… resale… scam promotions…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait! What are those ominous words for!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>



<p>I try to calm her down by showing three fingers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Stay more relaxed. It&#8217;s the &#8216;Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s Rule of Right Hand.&#8217; The thumb means &#8216;courage,&#8217; the index finger stands for &#8216;hope,&#8217; and the middle finger is &#8216;toilet.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Geez&#8230;.you are really&#8230;.. Fine, I&#8217;ll listen to you, just say it.&#8221;</p>



<p>See, it&#8217;s easy to remember because it forms &#8216;Yukito.&#8217; Got it?</p>




<p>Hinagi-chan lets out a deep sigh, furrowing her brows.</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, if you get a stomach ache and need to go to the bathroom during class or on your way to school, you should be brave enough to take immediate action. Then there is hope. Patience is poison to the body. The feeling of despair you get when you can&#8217;t go to the bathroom is so great that you can&#8217;t even relax your mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about!&#8221;</p>



<p>I got sidetracked. What was I talking about? Oh, yes, yes, I&#8217;m talking about money.</p>



<p>&#8220;I sealed that rule, though… It&#8217;s the &#8216;Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s Rule of Left Hand.&#8217; The thumb means &#8216;kidnapping,&#8217; the index finger stands for &#8216;threat,&#8217; and the middle finger is &#8216;escape.&#8217; It&#8217;s perfect for quickly making cash—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>I get scolded by Hinagi-chan for suggesting such absurd ideas.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Hinagi, do you still love reading books?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Yeah, of course. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been kind of dreaming about working at a bookstore or something. The aprons are so cute, right? Hehehe.&#8221;</p>


<p>Her face lights up with a big smile. I see, she enjoys reading.</p>



<p>&#8220;You said you wanted to experience various things, and it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re in desperate need of money for a part-time job. Is that right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah. What&#8217;s up? Did you think of something again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leave it to me, Hinagi. This will suit your pace, fulfill your thirst for knowledge, and it&#8217;s all up to your motivation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there such a convenient part-time job?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not exactly a part-time job, but how about trying to write a web novel?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…? I do like reading, but… I&#8217;ve never written a novel before…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone starts somewhere, right? Alright, let&#8217;s do it! Monetize your passion!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, you&#8217;re suddenly saying this, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;First, let&#8217;s start by studying recent trends, Hinagi. Check the rankings and learn from popular works. As Sanjoji-senpai said, it&#8217;s the summer of art. So, let&#8217;s make it your summer of knowledge. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m counting on the expert, Natsume.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it with you, Kokonoe-san? Why are you suddenly on your knees?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Here, I&#8217;ll give you Tokyo Hiyoko.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make blatant bribes! …… it&#8217;s too sweet and I&#8217;m getting thirsty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Here you go, melon soda.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-san, let&#8217;s think about the taste lineup a little more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Yukito. Am I really going to write a novel?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Trying everything is important. You can&#8217;t gain experience without taking action.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;True. Yeah, it sounds interesting! I&#8217;ll give it a try too.&#8221;</p>


<p>Hinagi-chan seems to be getting excited about the idea.</p>



<p>And so, the aspiring author, Hinagi Suzurikawa, took her first step into the world of writing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Kokonoe-Sensei! Can I see your homework?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t just give it to you for free, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>After school, a traditional scene on the last day of summer vacation unfolds, a scene that has been going on since before the vacation started.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to ask for money from your classmates, right…?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looks up at me with pleading eyes, shaking me precisely. As expected of a gal, she&#8217;s well-versed in these negotiations.</p>



<p>Kukuku. But you&#8217;re too naive, Mineda. I&#8217;ve been learning how to deal with gals.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, how about showing me your panties?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha…!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukito, what are you saying!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do something like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>They hurriedly try to stop me. The whole class is buzzing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ku! Better to be safe than sorry. Today&#8217;s my favorite pair, and if it&#8217;s just a peek, it should be fine… It&#8217;s for the sake of summer vacation, after all. I&#8217;ll endure it if you want to see that much, Kokonoe-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mineda-san, don&#8217;t take what he says seriously!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, what&#8217;s gotten into you!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you two? Calm down a little. Listen up, okay? To avoid being manipulated by gals, I need a preemptive strike, like a preemptive punch—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you mean a preemptive punch, not panties!&#8221;</p>



<p>Huh? Did I get something wrong? According to my sister, &#8220;Since you&#8217;re unlucky with girls, if a gal starts bothering you, go for a preemptive panty strike,&#8221; but maybe I misheard her.</p>




<p>Right, a punch, not panties…</p>



<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t want to see them, okay? Seriously, I don&#8217;t!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I returned home, my mother was waiting in the living room with a serious expression. The atmosphere was heavy, and I wondered if something had happened. I searched my memory, but there were too many possibilities, and I couldn&#8217;t pinpoint anything specific. Who am I, really?</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something very important I want to talk to you about. Will you listen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>She took out a pamphlet with a serious look on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since the &#8216;GoTo Travel&#8217; campaign has started, how about our family of three going on a trip together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In this mood, seriously?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Because it&#8217;s our first time. We&#8217;ve never gone on a family trip before.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about going to a hot spring? Maybe for two nights and three days?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sounds good to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? You&#8217;re really going to go? No second thoughts?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be so insistent…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m so happy—&#8221;</p>



<p>Her eyes became teary. It&#8217;s true; our family of three has never gone on a trip together before. I had always declined the idea, thinking I would only spoil the fun for my mother and sister.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to make them uncomfortable. So whenever they went on a trip, I stayed home, and I never questioned it.</p>



<p>But the past doesn&#8217;t have to dictate the present.</p>


<p>My mother and sister no longer hide their goodwill. I don&#8217;t understand their true intentions, but if they invite me to go on a trip with them, it means they are willing to accept my presence.</p>



<p>Even though we&#8217;ve never been on a family trip before, if they&#8217;re inviting me now, maybe it&#8217;s a chance for a fresh start.</p>



<p>I was still a little unsure about the idea of going on a trip with them, but if they genuinely want me to be there, then maybe it&#8217;s worth giving it a try.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to it too, Mom… Wawawa?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Once again, my mother hugged me tightly. Do the people in this house have a habit of hugging?</p>




<h4 style="text-align: center;">[Mother PoV]</h4>



<p>I never expected my son to agree to come along! I&#8217;m so glad I invited him. I thought he would refuse again. I wonder what caused this change in his feelings. But for now, I&#8217;m just filled with joy. I can&#8217;t help but feel excited like a young girl.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve never been able to have a proper family trip before. He always hesitates and holds back.</p>



<p>Why? Even when I asked, he never gave me an answer.</p>



<p>The reason is probably very sensitive, and it&#8217;s my fault that he ended up feeling that way. I couldn&#8217;t love him properly, and because of that, he carried the burden of guilt.</p>



<p>His bad luck with relationships and always getting hurt, it&#8217;s all because of me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been sixteen years since he was born. It&#8217;s been too long.</p>



<p>Our complicated and twisted relationship hasn&#8217;t been fully repaired yet. I don&#8217;t know how much more time it will take to untangle everything.</p>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s a faint hope that we might be able to be normal from now on.</p>



<p>But I know it&#8217;s going to be a difficult journey. To return to a normal relationship, I have to make up for sixteen years&#8217; worth of time.</p>



<p>I, trying to start over from the beginning, am still halfway there. I don&#8217;t have enough time to regain the time spent as a family, as a mother; there&#8217;s too little time left.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t afford to spend another sixteen years. By then, he will no longer be with me. So, doing things the way we used to won&#8217;t be enough.</p>



<p>The only way is to pour an overwhelming and intense amount of love.</p>



<p>Day by day, I&#8217;ll give him all the love that I should have given him for the past sixteen years. Family love, parental love, and even the kind of love you would give to someone you are romantically attracted to. I don&#8217;t care about the form it takes.</p>



<p>Any kind of &#8220;love&#8221; is fine. The distinction doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve decided that I will love him with all of myself, in whatever way it may be.</p>



<p>Even if it means going through great pain, even if it seems abnormal,</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to regret anymore—.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Summer vacation means radio gymnastics. The standard time for radio calisthenics is early in the morning, but that is only due to the broadcast time.</p>



<p>In my case, I have purchased a CD of radio exercises, so I can do them any time of the day. (After the exercises, I ask my sister to stamp my name on the CD.)</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think high school students should be doing radio calisthenics in the first place, but it is a promise of summer vacation. I was a man who loves to do the exercises.</p>



<p>After waking up in the morning, I did the third version of the fantastic radio calisthenics to loosen up my body, but now my body is tense and stiff. If this were a date, my heart might be in high spirits, but it&#8217;s not.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d rather have a chance encounter with someone who might be a cynical jerk to me in school. A familiar figure arrives right on time.</p>



<p>&#8220;The day is fine today&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are your greetings so stiff?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we rivals?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We are not! Geez, you&#8217;re just the same as always, aren&#8217;t you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what can I do for you, Sanjoji-sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outside of school. You don&#8217;t have to be so conscious of it. I don&#8217;t think teachers and students can be neatly separated in and out of school, but at least I didn&#8217;t call you here to lecture you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei was wearing a blouse, a tight skirt, and heels, and she wasn&#8217;t wearing a jacket, which made her look slightly more casual than usual. To the casual observer, she could easily pass for a competent office worker.</p>



<p>Earlier in the morning, when I was called to the station by Sanjoji-sensei, I was anxious about what she wanted to talk about, but her expression was gentle. Her gaze through the glasses didn&#8217;t seem as strict as usual. The real Sanjoji-sensei was quite charming.</p>



<p>When I received a message from Sanjouji-sensei, I was surprised, but secretly, I felt a little happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s not easy to talk here, please come to my house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>Me, going to her house? During summer vacation? A once-in-a-lifetime experience!?</p>





<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it big?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Sanjoji family has been a lineage of teachers for generations. My father, mother, aunt, and uncle, all of them. I&#8217;m not boasting, but it&#8217;s quite impressive. It can be pressurizing at times, but please don&#8217;t worry and come on in.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a single-family house in Tokyo, and quite a large one at that. Unexpectedly, Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s roots became clear.</p>



<p>As we passed through the entrance, a large Golden Retriever came trotting up to us. It didn&#8217;t bark, but instead rubbed its body against us. Taking advantage of its momentum, I petted it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s rare for Inukichi to warm up to someone.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;What about that naming sense?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I patted Inukichi, it let out a contented sound.</p>



<p>There was a time when the idea of getting a pet was discussed in the Kokonoe family, but at the time, my mother was busy and my sister wasn&#8217;t the type to take care of it, so the idea was abandoned. I wanted to have a pet…</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, she&#8217;s a female.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Poor Inukichi…&#8221;</p>



<p>Inukichi&#8217;s sad eyes seemed to be pleading something to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s go to my room. Wait here, I&#8217;ll bring some drinks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E-Excuse me for disturbing?&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no specific indication of who else might be present, and there was no response either.</p>


<p>In ordinary cases, a home visit would involve the teacher visiting the student&#8217;s house. So why was I, the student, at Sensei&#8217;s house, and that too, at the house of Sanjoji-sensei, who wasn&#8217;t even my homeroom teacher?</p>



<p>In a sense, it was like enemy territory. I didn&#8217;t know when I might step on a landmine.</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s room was about ten tatami mats in size, spacious and comfortable. It reflected her personality, as it was neatly organized. I couldn&#8217;t touch her personal belongings, so I sat quietly on the provided cushion and looked around.</p>



<p>Ignoring my nervousness, Sensei brought cake and drinks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you like sweet things?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Sweets hunting is my only hobby.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu. You&#8217;re like a girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensei, who usually scolded me for various things, had a refreshing smile. She took out an album and placed it in front of me. Then, she looked straight into my eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, do you remember me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, I&#8217;ve been called out by you quite often recently, so I guess I see you a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not what I mean. We met back in elementary school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Elementary school? Ah, I see. We had a promise to get married, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop lying! Don&#8217;t make up things! That&#8217;s not it at all! Stop teasing with me! There&#8217;s a considerable age gap between us…&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensei&#8217;s enthusiasm was waning. The situation had taken an unexpected turn.</p>



<p>However, even if she mentioned our elementary school days, I had absolutely no memories of it. Perhaps due to the fact that I had always encountered nothing but hardships, I&#8217;ve become quite adept at forgetting things. Even if I remembered, it would only bring pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t remember at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see… Well, I must have made memories you wouldn&#8217;t want to recall. It was my immaturity that made you feel that way. Take a look at this, Kokonoe-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensei opened the album, and there were many photos of elementary school students in their uniforms.</p>



<p>Among them was a boy with an extremely stoic expression, looking very serious.</p>



<p>That boy was alone in the photo, with no one else around.</p>



<p>Was that me? And the name of the homeroom teacher written there was &#8220;Suzuka Sanjoji.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was your homeroom teacher when you were in elementary school. I&#8217;m truly sorry for that time.&#8221;</p>



<p>With teary eyes, Sensei stood up and deeply bowed.</p>



<p>Elementary school and the homeroom teacher. Just hearing that much, even I, as expected, started to remember.</p>


<p>――Speaking of the early years of elementary school, that was when I got involved in my first &#8220;false accusation&#8221; incident.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the personal belongings of a woman who was here as an educational intern is missing. And somehow it turned up in my desk. I was innocent.</p>



<p>The education trainee, with a gentle smile, calmly advised me, &#8220;When you do something wrong, it&#8217;s best to apologize sincerely, you know?&#8221; But no matter how much she said that, if I didn&#8217;t know anything about it, I couldn&#8217;t admit to it. I continued to deny any involvement.</p>



<p>While the education trainee remained calm, the homeroom teacher, on the other hand, was furious at my refusal to admit guilt and scolded me relentlessly.</p>



<p>&#8220;What you did is theft. Do you understand that this is a crime!&#8221;</p>



<p>Naturally, I found myself isolated within the classroom. My classmates distanced themselves from me, leaving me alone.</p>



<p>This situation couldn&#8217;t continue. So, I decided to resolve it myself.</p>



<p>On the day the personal belonging went missing, I meticulously listed all of my actions during the presumed timeframe. I detailed who I was with, where I was, and what I was doing at every moment, and submitted it as a comprehensive report.</p>



<p>Through this process, I narrowed down the list of suspicious individuals and identified the culprit.</p>

<p>He was a male classmate. Though we didn&#8217;t really interact, he had a crush on the education trainee. Apparently, he impulsively stole her belongings and, when he heard a noise, hastily stashed them in my desk. It was beyond ridiculous. I gathered all the evidence and presented it to the teachers, including the homeroom teacher and the education trainee. They seemed to say something, but I didn&#8217;t really care.</p>



<p>It was a trivial incident with a trivial resolution. By that time, my mental fortitude had grown as sturdy as an acacia tree, and I didn&#8217;t really feel much about it.</p>



<p>I had no intention of getting along with the classmates who had treated me like a criminal. After that, I moved on to the next grade and went through a class change, spending my time without saying a word to the homeroom teacher and my former classmates.</p>



<p>During that time, nearly half a year had passed, and an awkward atmosphere continued to linger within the class.</p>



<p>It almost escalated into bullying, but I resisted fiercely and crushed them. Violence seemed to be the only way to resolve everything.</p>



<p>Perhaps, in addition to feeling guilty for their own actions, my classmates were hesitant to approach me because I excelled in both academics and sports. Moreover, if they tried to harm me, I would fight back without hesitation. That&#8217;s just how I was.</p>



<p>It feels quite nostalgic. It was indeed a dark period of my elementary school days.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, the homeroom teacher at that time was Sanjoji-Sensei. I completely forgot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I apologize for that… I should have created many happy memories for you, but I erased them all. I don&#8217;t think I can be forgiven even if I apologize. Still, please let me apologize.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei kept bowing deeply, refusing to lift her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. Thanks to that, I learned how to deal with unfair situations.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, you are truly…&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked so sad, and I wondered what I should do. But the truth was, I really didn&#8217;t mind.</p>



<p>In fact, I couldn&#8217;t afford to be bothered by every little thing.</p>



<p>However, telling Sanjoji-sensei that would only make her feel worse. I didn&#8217;t want to make her overthink it.</p>



<p>What should I do? What is Sanjoji-sensei expecting from me?</p>



<p>Why did she apologize now and what purpose does this apology serve?</p>



<p>Should I forgive her…? But I&#8217;m not angry.</p>



<p>So, how do I forgive her? That&#8217;s right, just like I kept tormenting my sister.</p>



<p>How can I make Sanjoji-sensei return to her usual self?</p>



<p>I have to think. I won&#8217;t throw away my thoughts anymore. I won&#8217;t give up. There must be an answer.</p>



<p>So, I&#8217;ll express myself. I won&#8217;t run away. I&#8217;ll speak my mind as it is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, let&#8217;s sit down and have cake together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have any memories from that time. There were no recollections. All I knew was that such an incident had occurred. I even forgot the name of that one person. But seeing Sanjoji-sensei sitting there, looking pained and avoiding eye contact, made me feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p>



<p>I see, in that case—</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, please tell me, Sensei. What was it like back then? What kind of class was it? Who were my classmates? Since we&#8217;ve met again like this, won&#8217;t you share those memories? You have this album here. Please, tell me. Now that we&#8217;ve met again, it&#8217;s the perfect opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s simple. If there are people who know, people who remember, then you just ask them. I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it if I had stayed alone. The fact that there&#8217;s someone to rely on, someone to ask. The answer is straightforward, clear, and concise. I just need to lean on someone.</p>



<p>&#8220;—Is that alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember anything at all, so I won&#8217;t know unless you tell me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I- I understand! There are more albums. Please wait a moment!&#8221;</p>



<p>While still on all fours, Sanjoji-sensei headed towards the bookshelf in the back.</p>



<p>However, I realized. Crap! This is bad, really bad, Suzuka-chan!</p>



<p>Sanjoji-sensei is wearing a skirt. And not just any skirt, but a short tight skirt.</p>


<p>Even if she&#8217;s wearing stockings, being on all fours like that, with her backside facing this way, inevitably results in that.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Sensei, your panties.&#8221;</p>



<p>They were purple. I saw something lovely!</p>



<p>And thus, I stored that image in the memory of my heart.</p>





<p>&#8220;By the way, Sensei, why did you become a high school teacher?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I looked through the album, Sensei told me various things. Choir competitions, sports days, field trips—back then, I boycotted all of those events, but in hindsight, it was childish. A result of youthful indiscretion.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got afraid.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For a whole year, I was at a loss and unable to do anything. I struggled and struggled, but it didn&#8217;t lead anywhere. Time just passed by. What if the negative influence I had on the students affected their character formation or led them down the wrong path? Thinking that way, I became afraid to stand in front of the class. It was also shocking when a student openly asked to be transferred to another class.&#8221;</p>


<p>Sensei&#8217;s expression turned somber. It hinted at the depth of her struggles.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lost my confidence, my passion faded, and I thought I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore. I even resigned at one point. But I realized that in high school, a teacher&#8217;s influence on students might not be as significant. So, I took the teacher recruitment exam again. And that&#8217;s how we met again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was because of me… I&#8217;m sorry, Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt compelled to lower my head in the face of her heavy past. Even though I had completely forgotten about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not your fault! It was my immaturity. I couldn&#8217;t fully become an adult. The year after resigning, I spent every day reflecting on myself. The students probably see me as the worst homeroom teacher, either erasing me from their memories like you or trying to forget that past entirely. Either way, I can&#8217;t face them.&#8221;</p>



<p>She offered a troubled smile, but her expression carried a sense of sadness and pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, I managed to pull myself together somehow, but this reunion feels like fate. You might have already sensed it, but she had her spirit broken and gave up on her dreams. Just by being associated with me, her career was ruined. Please help her. Suzurikawa-san told me a lot about you. I believe you can make a difference.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leave it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. You truly are a kind person.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensei smiled with relief. It was a small favor, but I didn&#8217;t mind. It was an easy task.</p>



<p>However, as cruel as it was, there was one thing I needed to bring up.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, don&#8217;t you think a favor should come with a reward?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Hahi?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, a foreboding atmosphere swept over Sanjoji Sensei, and she began to break into a cold sweat.</p>



<p>Rustling sounds came from my bag as I pulled out a sketchbook with a flourish.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could it be, Kokonoe-kun? Is this about that request? Definitely, it&#8217;s about that request, right!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to this. Now, shall we begin?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible! R-rethink this, please! There&#8217;s no charm in this messy body. Isn&#8217;t that right? You&#8217;ll be disappointed anyway!&#8221;</p>



<p>I shook my head as if to say &#8220;give me a break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there something wrong with being messy? You said earlier that apologizing doesn&#8217;t automatically mean forgiveness, right? Well, I haven&#8217;t forgiven you yet. Ah, I remember being so humiliated in front of the class. It was tough, and it hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuuuuu… I deeply regret being so thoughtless! However, that doesn&#8217;t mean…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re genuinely regretful, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I teased her relentlessly. I was really getting into it, as I&#8217;m usually on the defensive.</p>



<p>&#8220;But even so, it&#8217;s embarrassing, and…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At this point, it&#8217;s a bit late for excuses.&#8221;</p>



<p>I continued to rile her up. Despite the usual one-sided struggle, I was quite enjoying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s embarrassing, it really is…&#8221;</p>



<p>She was still making excuses while poking her index fingers together.</p>



<p>&#8220;Think about it this way. If you, as a teacher, accidentally witnessed a female student entering a love hotel with some old man, and then you questioned them later, would you believe it if they said nothing happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s unlikely. Even though we should not punish someone solely based on suspicion, entering a place like that together would be sufficient evidence to conclude something happened. Even if it turned out nothing happened, it wouldn&#8217;t change the initial assumption.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly. So, today, you called me to your home, and do you think people around us would believe there was nothing going on if you say so? No way!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, we haven&#8217;t been caught, and I didn&#8217;t call you over with that intention.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not for us to decide. Don&#8217;t worry; we&#8217;re at your home, so there&#8217;s no way anyone would find out. However, if nothing happened, it would be suspicious, and something happening would be natural.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t use logical arguments to persuade me like that! It&#8217;s almost convincing! You know, you&#8217;re always like this, making an old woman like me…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine then, forget it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I pouted and acted like I was upset.</p>


<p>&#8220;Wait, why the sudden change? Don&#8217;t give me the cold shoulder like that. Are you planning to ask Kedou-san for help? Is that what you&#8217;re going to do?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t say anything in particular. I was just sulking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll undress! You just want someone else to do it, right!? But please give me some time… I&#8217;ll go shave my armpits. No, better yet, I&#8217;ll get laser hair removal! I can&#8217;t bear this as it is!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope, that won&#8217;t do. It&#8217;s a form of art.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At my age, there&#8217;s no chance of meeting anyone new! So, even if my grooming is a bit sloppy, it can&#8217;t be helped! And what do you mean by &#8216;art&#8217; anyway? It&#8217;s just your personal interest!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You say that with such a pure, untainted gaze!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, look, even Inukichi here says the same thing, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Barf barf]</p>



<p>&#8220;When did Inukichi get so attached to you!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Inukichi entered the room quietly and climbed onto my back. He&#8217;s heavy…</p>



<p>The battle of words and wits between me and Sanjoji-sensei would continue for the next thirty minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passcodes, fingerprint recognition, face recognition—security measures are becoming stronger day by day. While there are people out there who claim that losing their smartphone would be the end of their lives, I&#8217;m just too lazy to bother with any lock at all. Besides, I don&#8217;t really use my phone much, and there&#8217;s hardly any important data stored in it. So, even if someone were to see it, it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem—or so I thought, until now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess my biggest enemy is my sister…&#8221;</p>



<p>I was in my room, alone, holding my head in my hands. What am I going to do about this situation?</p>



<p>After returning from Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s house, I had once again done something stupid. I had stored the forbidden image of something purple in my mental memory and thoroughly enjoyed it. Feeling guilty about it, I honestly confessed to Sanjoji-sensei that I saw something I shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>I thought that would be the end of it, but for some reason, she replied, &#8220;I apologize. Um, since you&#8217;re also a high school student, if you&#8217;re curious, you can take a picture too. But it absolutely must not be discovered, okay?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t understand. Let me say it again—I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>So now, instead of being stored in my mental memory, the forbidden image is saved in my smartphone&#8217;s memory, specifically in the storage. It&#8217;s a picture that can never be shown to anyone; it&#8217;s way too dangerous. If someone were to see it, it could cause trouble for Sanjoji-sensei too.</p>




<p>However, I think the one at fault here is Sanjoji-sensei, not me, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;…Do I have no choice but to bury it?&#8221;</p>



<p>I search for a hiding spot, but in my room, which is filled with more of my mom&#8217;s and sister&#8217;s belongings than mine, there is no safe place. If I want to hide it, I&#8217;ll have to look outside.</p>



<p>How about burying it underground like a time capsule and retrieving it after several decades?</p>



<p>Maybe this is how erotic magazines that are found outside are created, through similar circumstances.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where were you today, running around like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, my sister, who has no concept of knocking, comes straight to my room after taking a bath.</p>



<p>She might be the only one who would commit such a reckless act of peering into my smartphone without hesitation. How can I hide it from her…? Wait a minute!</p>



<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you wearing pants!?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a preemptive underwear move.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough with that joke! It&#8217;s not something you keep pulling out like that!&#8221;</p>



<p>Enough already! My sister, who is in an outrageous summer style with just a tank top and shorts, casually drinks milk.</p>



<p>My gaze was going all over the place. And I was right about the preemptive underwear! I&#8217;ll have to complain to Shiori about it later.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, right? You like it too, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t decide things on your own.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your favorite color? I&#8217;ll wear it for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think your kindness is going in the wrong direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? You do like it, right?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Why on earth am I making such declarations? It was the declaration underwear.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a good and honest kid. As a reward, I&#8217;ll show you the Summer Triangle.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her supple waist and slender curves were alluring.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just to be sure, which side is Vega, which side is Deneb, and which side is Altair?&#8221;</p>



<p>The Summer Triangle in the sky, or should I say astro-pants? This must be what they call perverted stargazing.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, where have you been since this morning?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I went to Sanjoji-sensei&#8217;s house…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why were you invited to a teacher&#8217;s house during summer vacation?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t scolded or anything, so there&#8217;s no need to worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the issue here. I&#8217;ll listen to everything, so tell me everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lately, my sister has been oddly curious about everything. Maybe she&#8217;s trying to make up for the lack of regular conversations we used to have. It doesn&#8217;t bother me; in fact, I&#8217;m happy to have her around.</p>



<p>However, she&#8217;s started to hang out in my room again, just like old times.</p>



<p>I want to go back to the carefree and easy-going relationship we used to have. Other than that one aspect, there&#8217;s nothing I need to hide, so I decided to be honest with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember something from when we were in elementary school. It&#8217;s quite a coincidence that she was your homeroom teacher.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thing of the past, and I had forgotten about it, so it&#8217;s unnecessary to apologize now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. It&#8217;s your virtue to be kind, but it makes me worried in situations like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I learned a lot about the past, so it was meaningful.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, okay then. By the way, you&#8217;re going to the hot springs, right? That&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s summer, so you should also go swimming. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already achieved my swimming quota for this season.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? You&#8217;re not planning to go with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me accompany you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s amazing how low I am in the hierarchy in this household.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. You&#8217;re totally mistaken, Kokonoe-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mineda was visibly annoyed, and everyone else&#8217;s reactions were the same. What&#8217;s going on?</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you were taking so long to change, but what&#8217;s with the marine suit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wetsuit.&#8221;</p>



<p>All eyes were on me as I walked out of the changing room in a full-body black wetsuit. That&#8217;s when I realized.</p>



<p>Ah, I see. They must have misunderstood me, thinking it&#8217;s a kinky choice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I took a proper lifesaving course, so there&#8217;s nothing to be concerned about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s there to be not concerned about!?&#8221;</p>


<p>A marine blue sea. A glistening white sandy beach. The scorching sun beating down on us. A sharp retort.</p>



<p>We had come for a beach outing. On the last day of school, Elizabeth and others invited me, and surprisingly, more than half of the class decided to join. It was an unprecedented large group. We&#8217;re way too close as a class…</p>



<p>To ensure there are no accidents, I decided to take a lifeguard training course.</p>



<p>You can take the course from the age of fifteen, but you need to have already acquired Water Safety and BLS qualifications. Furthermore, gaining practical experience from here allows you to obtain further specialized certifications, but unless you&#8217;re aiming to become a professional in this field, that shouldn&#8217;t be necessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan sighed, exasperated. Her stylish bikini caught everyone&#8217;s attention, and words of admiration slipped out unconsciously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hinagin, you&#8217;re so cute!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan blushed and played with her hair. Should I continue the pursuit? YES/NO</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, how do I look?&#8221;</p>


<p>Shiori was monopolizing the male attention with her bouncing assets. It&#8217;s way too big… Oh, did she mean her height? Seriously, she&#8217;s so tall.</p>



<p>Shiori has a healthy and fresh vitality. She&#8217;s like the princess of the beach, the beach princess. Maybe the resistance has lessened in her dancer outfit, as her swimsuit is quite revealing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, naughty&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Again!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ignoring Shiori, who was still in shock, the others cheered again at the sight of the female students in their swimsuits. It was a stimulating view of the girls that they never got to see at school. It was the true taste of summer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice, looking good for summer. Let&#8217;s have fun today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed, but I&#8217;m not very good at swimming, actually…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, should I teach you?&#8221;</p>







<p>Takahashi and Natsume were engaged in a friendly conversation. The lively atmosphere returned as everyone chatted.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since I last came to the beach. In junior high, I was busy with club activities. How about you, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time in a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What an unexpected answer…&#8221;</p>



<p>Sorry, refreshing and handsome guy. Unlike you, the embodiment of popularity, I&#8217;m enjoying my summer to the fullest. I&#8217;ve already finished my homework, and I feel invincible. In fact, I&#8217;m itching to study more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shakado and I came to the beach yesterday too. Alright, Shakado, let&#8217;s dig it up right away!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hihii… I&#8217;ve been waiting for this! Fufu… Fooooohhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a mischievous grin, Shakadou headed towards the deserted sandy beach, grabbing his nape. Some of us followed curiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukito. Were you really at the beach with Shakadou-san?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Just so you know, it&#8217;s not like we came here to swim. It&#8217;s for insect collecting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Contrary to appearances, Shakadou was quite active. He would even catch insects as food for his pet reptiles. So, we decided to come to the beach early yesterday and buried about thirty plastic cups in the sand.</p>



<p>The cups were filled with bait, and when insects actively moved around at night, they would fall into the cups in search of food and get trapped in a classic trap. We began taking out the cups one by one. Some were empty, but others had black insects inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay yay! Hihi……kuhihihi……kihihihihihihihihihihihi! ”</p>



<p>To Shakado&#8217;s excitement, the reaction of the girls were not good, perhaps reminiscent of G. People who don&#8217;t like insects quickly flee from this place. (G = cockroaches)</p>



<p>Although rhinoceros beetles and dung beetles may look similar, Shakado could easily distinguish them.</p>



<p>Even so, isn&#8217;t the name of insects such as ground beetles and dust beetles too terrible?</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be terrible if there were a &#8220;Fake Yukito Kokonoe&#8221; or something? It would probably have sharp eyes and all.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was worth setting a trap.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Thank you… I&#8217;ll never forget this favor…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too heavy. Just forget about it already.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s way too much gratitude for just accompanying them for insect collecting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mission complete. Let&#8217;s go back and swim.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait… I&#8217;ll put them in the cage…&#8221;</p>



<p>The cage is filled with soil, and after spraying water with a mist sprayer to moisten it, they carefully place the insects inside along with insect jelly, then gently close the lid of the cooler bag.</p>



<p>In the scorching summer, leaving the insects exposed to direct sunlight would be harsh on them, but Insecter Shakado takes perfect care of them. Truly a princess of Lepser.</p>



<p>Once again, they walk back to where their classmates are gathering, firmly holding the cage.</p>



<p>The plastic cups used for traps have already been properly collected, so there&#8217;s no need to worry. </p>







<p>Just like the Japanese supporters during the Soccer World Cup, I, Yukito Kokonoe, am picky about cleaning up the trash.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, didn&#8217;t you apply sunscreen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I already did. Could it be you wanted to do it, Yuki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel embarrassed having Yukito apply it for me…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Idiot…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi and Shiori blush, but I&#8217;m moved by their unexpected response.</p>



<p>&#8220;If it were Mom or Sister, they would hurry me to put it on… You guys are so pure… Please stay pure like that. It&#8217;s a request from Yukito Kokonoe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the right response to that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, what&#8217;s wrong, Yuki!?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Mom… I mean, you should do it yourself there… So why are you… taking off your swimsuit…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wawawaw! It&#8217;s still too early for us, Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;――Haa!? It&#8217;s a daily memory that&#8217;s too frequent and can&#8217;t be forgotten no matter how much I try to forget!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing on a regular basis!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, you&#8217;re having a hard time…&#8221; (Mihou)</p>



<p>It was worth setting a trap for.</p>



<p>Thank you ……, I&#8217;ll never forget what you did for me. ……</p>



<p>It&#8217;s too heavy. Forget it in moderation.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s too big a favor to pay for just accompanying him on his insect collecting trip.</p>







<p>Mission accomplished. We&#8217;re going back and swimming.</p>



<p>Wait, ……. I&#8217;ll put it in the basket. ……</p>



<p>The basket is filled with soil. After spraying water with a mist and moistening it sufficiently, I put in the insect jelly and gently place the insects, then put them directly into the cooler bag and put the lid on.</p>



<p>It is harsh for the insects to be exposed to direct sunlight in the middle of summer. Insector Shakado also provided perfect aftercare. The princess of the repoussé.</p>



<p>Once again, I grabbed it with a munch and returned to the place where my classmates were gathered.</p>



<p>The plastic cups used in the trap have already been collected, so don&#8217;t worry.</p>



<p>Like a Japanese supporter of the World Cup soccer team, I, Yukitoshi Kokonoe, am very picky about cleaning up trash.</p>



<p>By the way, don&#8217;t you need to put sun cream on?</p>



<p>I already did. Did you want to put it on, Yuki?</p>







<p>It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing for me to have the Snow Hare apply it for me. ……</p>



<p>That&#8217;s stupid …….&#8221;</p>



<p>The first time I saw the two, I was impressed by their unexpected replies.</p>



<p>&#8216;Mom and sis would have urged me to apply it as soon as possible,……. How pure you guys are. …… I want you to stay pure as you are. This is a request from the Nine-Fold Snow Hare.&#8221;</p>



<p>How do I reply to that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… sister,…… that&#8217;s not the place to paint,…… why don&#8217;t you take off your swimsuit,…… and let&#8217;s see what you can do with it. I&#8217;m going to …… suck your dick. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, what&#8217;s wrong Yuki?</p>



<p>&#8220;…… mother,…… I&#8217;ll paint it myself,…… so why don&#8217;t you take off your swimsuit,…… …… between ……&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not ready for this yet, Yuki! We&#8217;re not ready for this, Yuki!&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8211;Ha! It&#8217;s too frequent, too mundane a memory to forget!&#8221;</p>



<p>What are you doing with your life?</p>



<p>&#8220;Snow Rabbit, you&#8217;re having a hard time ……&#8221;</p>



<p>When did you buy it? The Tesla coil face chewed on the yakisoba noodles and wept a hollowness. Eh, where&#8217;s my portion?</p>



<p>&#8220;The first question. What is the most important thing to be careful about during a beach outing?&#8221;</p>



<p>Lifesaver Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s safety class is now open.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you there, the refreshing handsome one, go ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Warm-up exercises. It&#8217;s important because sudden cramps while entering the sea can be troublesome.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Quite close! Panic is indeed scary. It&#8217;s the second important thing. Okay, next is Shiori.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Uhm, not going beyond the tetrapods?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Close, but in the first place, it&#8217;s unnecessary to go all the way to the breakwaters. Let&#8217;s enjoy ourselves closer to shore.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki-chan, what&#8217;s the correct answer?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good question, Mineda. The answer is sharks. Be cautious of red sharks as they can explode due to radiation. If you spot one, evacuate immediately. Also, shark ghosts may attack people. This ghostly shark appears anywhere there&#8217;s water, so it&#8217;s called a ghost&#8212;-&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, alright. We&#8217;ll do the warm-up exercises, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>The school is closed after just one question by Hinagi-chan. The Yukito Kokonoe safety class is now closed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, you there, would you like to play with us?&#8221;</p>



<p>The beach in summer is crowded with people. Elizabeth was approached by someone for a chat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s the 3G group!&#8221;</p>







<p>“Gee, you—no, you’re Kokonoe-san!”</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, no way, we haven&#8217;t done anything yet. Please spare us from becoming an online sensation! We&#8217;ll be good from now on!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We had a hard time after that! So please, forgive us and overlook it!&#8221;</p>



<p>They seemed so afraid. It&#8217;s strange, as I only have a good impression of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito, do you know them?&#8221;</p>



<p>They were the group of three college students we met before at the night pool with Mio and Tristy.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 3G&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 5G now, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>He seems to imply that the generation of flip phones is outdated. A bit sarcastic, that handsome guy.</p>







<p>&#8220;3G, are you by any chance just the three of you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We want to hang out with girls too, but we&#8217;re from the engineering department. It&#8217;s hard to meet new people.&#8221; (3G)</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, you&#8217;re amazing. Don&#8217;t you always hang out with different girls?&#8221; (3G)</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate it! I hate those people who are always in relationships!&#8221;(3G)</p>



<p>Hmm. We have a large group, and there might be situations where we can&#8217;t keep an eye on everyone, especially in the vast ocean. We want to avoid any potential dangers.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want, would you like to join us and play together? We were worried about the large number of people in our group, so we thought having the 3G with us could help prevent strange approaches and accidents.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? We&#8217;d love to! Thank you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you saying we&#8217;re the strange ones?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, I follow you on social media. Can I get your autograph later?&#8221;</p>







<p>They turned out to be unexpected reinforcements. They&#8217;re really good people. With them joining us, we can enjoy beach time safely.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go swimming too.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems like a fun and safe beach outing awaits us!</p>




<p>&#8220;Yukito, don&#8217;t let go! I mean it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Trembling, Hinagi-chan straddled the dolphin float (made of vinyl). It&#8217;s unexpectedly challenging to stay on it. It might be a good practice to improve one&#8217;s sense of balance.</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan is desperately holding on, but she doesn&#8217;t look relaxed at all. I&#8217;m here as her support on the ground.</p>



<p>She isn&#8217;t very confident in her swimming skills, but this is a shallow area just a few meters from the shore, and as long as Lifesaver Yukito Kokonoe is around, it&#8217;s safe and secure. She can challenge herself as much as she wants.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to ride it too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to as well, but it&#8217;s more unstable than I thought… Whoa!&#8221;</p>







<p>She flipped over and ended up with the float on top of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;You might not be cut out for surfing or anything like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll practice on a balance ball when I get back.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her enthusiasm is impressive. Despite this little setback, Hinagi-chan is competitive and won&#8217;t give up easily.</p>



<p>As Hinagi-chan tries to ride the float again, she suddenly remembers something and speaks up.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Hiori said she wants to talk to you, Yukito.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hiori? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>



<p>If Hinagi&#8217;s younger sister, Hiori, is in trouble and needs help, I&#8217;d be more than willing to assist. But what could it be about? Hiori is a very honest and straightforward person who doesn&#8217;t usually make enemies.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems like she wants to talk about something related to her friends.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;I see… I won&#8217;t know until I listen to her.&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t expect I can solve middle schoolers&#8217; problems, but it depends on the situation.</p>



<p>However, why is it that I seem to attract mostly love advice to this self-established Yukito Kokonoe&#8217;s Troubles Consultation Desk? I&#8217;m terrible at this…</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for causing trouble between us, sisters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I can do, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>She can now speak so honestly. Hinagi-chan is alright now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yukito. Let&#8217;s go to the summer festival together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A fireworks festival, huh? It brings back memories.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yeah. Let&#8217;s gradually regain our time together.&#8221;</p>







<p>I remember participating in the summer festival with Hinagi-chan every year. We would buy candy apples and cotton candy at the stalls, drink ramune, and watch the fireworks bloom in the pitch-black night sky. But now, those memories have come to an end. The last expression I recall from Hinagi-chan was never a smiling one.</p>



<p>&#8220;I regret it. Letting go of your hand, Yukito. It wasn&#8217;t because I disliked it. It was the opposite… I was embarrassed and acted impulsively, pushing you away. At that time, I had no composure, and I never thought about what you might think of me. I was foolish and self-centered.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, why not choose a different path? You don&#8217;t need to redo things now.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was the doubt I had been holding onto. It applies to Hinagi, Shiori, Mom, and even my sister. It&#8217;s understandable to have regrets about the past and want to redo things.</p>



<p>But in the end, the past is the past. We can&#8217;t erase or rewrite it. We can never time leap or change the past. We can only change the present and the future.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no need to be forever imprisoned by the past. It&#8217;s more efficient to choose a better future, a path that leads to happiness. It&#8217;s not worth putting in an immense effort just to redo things.</p>



<p>Besides, I don&#8217;t mind at all. I don&#8217;t hold any grudges or hatred. So, if cutting me off is the most efficient choice, then go ahead.</p>



<p>But still, is there any value in me that makes her want to redo things?</p>



<p>&#8220;――A path without you, Yukito, is meaningless. Even though we are strangers to each other, you are a precious childhood friend. It&#8217;s not just anyone. It&#8217;s because you are Yukito, the one who has spent time with me.&#8221;</p>







<p>The credibility of currency is guaranteed by the nation and the central bank. That&#8217;s why the trust in international currency is strong.</p>



<p>In the same way, the credibility of a childhood friend is guaranteed by the time we spent together, Hinagi and me. She believes in something uncertain and faint like that, and she thinks it&#8217;s special.</p>



<p>――So, I wanted to believe it too.</p>



<p>I must regain what makes me &#8220;special&#8221; to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m also growing. I don&#8217;t want to be protected all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>A strong and confident smile. Crying doesn&#8217;t suit my childhood friend.</p>



<p>Hinagi has become strong. Maybe even stronger than me. The unwavering determination in her eyes is dazzling.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve become a wonderful woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, she&#8217;s a remarkable woman. Just a bit too much dripping with seawater.</p>







<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because of someone else. &#8211;I&#8217;m having fun. I wish this kind of time could go on forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>I briskly hopped on the inflatable orca (shachi) and, without hesitation, spun around once before splashing back into the water.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, have you finished the artwork for the contest?&#8221;</p>



<p>Having given up on the orca ride, we were taking a break at the beach while enjoying shaved ice.</p>



<p>With the sound of waves and the hustle and bustle of the surroundings as our background music, we spent some time alone together as childhood friends.</p>



<p>Around us, there were people being relentlessly hit on, causing their faces to flush, or others like Shakado, who were being dragged around by Elizabeth and seemed to be spinning around in circles, all of them thoroughly enjoying their time at the summer beach.</p>



<p>&#8220;As for me, I might not have any artistic talent. I was shocked by my lack of sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not aiming for a prize, right? Just draw what you like.&#8221;</p>







<p>Art is such a thing. Though she looked troubled, I realized that since long ago, her drawing style has been original. That uniqueness is part of who she is. If she enjoys the club activities, then that&#8217;s good enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to come back, Yukito?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The art club has a natural enemy. ……&#8221;</p>



<p>Even I, the mighty me, shy away from the art club with the dreaded student council president. The painting of my sister is finished, and when Hinagi is in trouble, the ever-reliable Sanjoji Sensei is there to lend a helping hand.</p>



<p>Speaking of Sanjoji-Sensei, she seemed to be oddly preoccupied with her armpits. I wonder what&#8217;s so embarrassing about armpits?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Hinagi. Show me your armpits for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-you idiot!? Why are you suddenly saying that! &#8212;-Ouch!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan is keening her head with shaved ice with too much vigor. She forced herself to eat it. ……</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you so nonchalant about saying such tactless lines?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;In the Kokonoe family, the concept of tact doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know nothing about common sense!&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess family background is really important. I truly think so.</p>



<p>Still, I wonder if Hinagi-chan is also concerned about that. So, I realized that I&#8217;ve made a terribly grave mistake. Come on, stop messing around.</p>



<p>Looking at it calmly, it&#8217;s just not possible. I&#8217;m truly a jerk.</p>



<p>I forgot about something like this; it&#8217;s just utterly lacking in tact.</p>



<p>What the heck. This must be why Sanjoji-sensei and Hinagi-chan feel embarrassed. Unable to bear the weight of my sin, I prostrate myself on the scorching sandy beach.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Hinagi! I was thoughtless. But rest assured, no matter how much you&#8217;re worried about the armpit smell, I don&#8217;t mind—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really areeeeeeeeeeeee!&#8221;</p>







<p>Her face turned bright red. Could it be heatstroke? I hand her a sports drink. Hinagi-chan gulps it down in one go.</p>



<p>The cause of underarm odor is sweat. Apparently, the secretion from the apocrine sweat glands is the source of the smell, and it&#8217;s natural for people to worry about it. I can only apologize endlessly for my insensitive remarks.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! If you&#8217;re so concerned, I&#8217;ll donate money for the surgery—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up! Here, take a sniff! Come on!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hinagi-chan presses her armpit against me forcefully.</p>



<p>&#8220;It smells like the sea.&#8221;</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1.png?fit=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1"/>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the sea, right? Don&#8217;t let anyone spread this! What if people search my name and the search suggestions come up as &#8216;Hinagi Suzurikawa smelly&#8217; or something? It&#8217;s all because of you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Beautiful and non-smelly seas have fewer nutrients, while seas with the smell of the shore are nutrient-rich. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s an interesting topic to consider? Let&#8217;s continue to be mindful of marine pollution from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pay attention to my suggest pollution!&#8221;</p>







<p>Environmental issues, such as microplastic pollution, are serious problems facing humanity.</p>



<p>As Hinagi shook me back and forth, I made a pledge. I&#8217;ll stop littering.</p>




<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Yuki? You look troubled.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was looking forward to the beach trip, excited and full of anticipation. My chest was swelling with excitement, my heart racing in anticipation of thrilling moments.</p>



<p>Yet, it seemed like nothing exciting or embarrassing was happening around me. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s not right. There&#8217;s hardly any accidental revealing going on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, are you saying weird things again!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beach trip, right? Normally, there should be some revealing moments happening around here, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… everyone is being extremely careful to avoid any embarrassing accidents!&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Could it be that revealing accidents aren&#8217;t as common as I thought…?&#8221;</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s a letdown. Oh, what a disappointment! I wanted some excitement!</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwaa, Yuki looks more down than I&#8217;ve ever seen before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought something was off. Mom and my sister usually have an accident like once every hour, so I thought it was just a normal thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not an accident; it&#8217;s a deliberate and extremely malicious act!&#8221;</p>



<p>At home, my mom is always saying things like, &#8216;Oh, my shoulder strap came off again,&#8217; while revealing herself all the time.</p>



<p>Although it doesn&#8217;t happen frequently, the fact that she does it so often is probably due to some ghost&#8217;s influence, a supernatural occurrence. It might be something like a poltergeist.</p>



<p>Considering how my sanity is wearing thin each time it happens, I might soon be cursed to death by the revealing. It&#8217;s terrifying. Revealing and dying is not a laughing matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuki, do you really want to see that?&#8221;</p>







<p>While looking down, I tightly grip Shiori&#8217;s shoulders, her face turning bright red.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Well, if you want to see it that much, I can—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Accidental revealing that isn&#8217;t actually accidental isn&#8217;t lucky at all&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a principle I cannot compromise on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your dignity as a maiden will be doubly hurt!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m being poked and prodded. The debate about accidental revealing on the beach has become intense.</p>



<p>Eh, Shiori had an accident? I will protect the dignity of maidens!</p>





<p>&#8220;By the way, how is the girls&#8217; swim team?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Yeah! Even though I joined in the middle, the seniors and other girls from different classes treat me well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori happily shares her recent experiences as she floats gently on a water ring.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t too worried, but it seems she&#8217;s doing really well without any issues.</p>



<p>The girls&#8217; swim team captains were also delighted, and the advisor welcomed her warmly. She has accumulated a huge debt of gratitude, so she plans to repay it eventually. Besides, Shiori isn&#8217;t the type to isolate herself.</p>



<p>Being a manager is great, but Shiori is more attractive when she actively participates.</p>



<p>&#8220;Captain Sasaki also wanted to thank you. Thanks for that he said.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But in the end, it was you who decided to join.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is not true, if Yuki hadn&#8217;t encouraged me, I would still have been hesitant. The boys&#8217; basketball team manager is important, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if that was the right path for me. I need to be more observant like Yuki. This won&#8217;t do――ah!?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not true. Shiori should have realized it herself eventually. I just sped up the process. Shiori has talent that would be a waste to let go to waste. The stage where she can shine is not the boys&#8217; swim team.</p>







<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let your guard down, Shiori.&#8221;</p>



<p>I spray a water gun playfully. We&#8217;re here to have fun at the beach. There&#8217;s no time to be down.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have a wide range of variations, like a rabbit or a squid, Yuki. But, but, I won&#8217;t lose either! I&#8217;m a dancer after all. So, here I gooooo!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You actually liked that embarrassing outfit, huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were the one who made me wear it, Yuki!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In fact, I was the one who suggested that a sexier outfit would be better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you an audacious villain in disguise!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiori counters back relentlessly. She&#8217;s not holding back, maybe she&#8217;s been holding some resentment towards me.</p>



<p>In the sea, our sweet romance is just playing around, nothing more.</p>







<p>Between us, it&#8217;s a fierce battle, betting on not revealing too much.</p>



<p>&#8220;Calm down! Do you really want to expose yourself again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe that Yuki will protect the dignity of a maiden!&#8221;</p>



<p>The territorial battle that suddenly began continued the offensive and defensive back and forth. It&#8217;s a monster with unusual physical strength.</p>



<p>We are evenly matched. It&#8217;s a neck-and-neck battle. If it comes to this, I have no choice but to use my secret weapon!</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no choice. I&#8217;ll have to activate my special weapon. Farewell, Shiori.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Wait—Yuki, you idioooooooooooot!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I toss it with a thud, and a massive spray of water splashes up.</p>



<p>By moving our bodies and playing with all our might, our minds and bodies feel refreshed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you know, I got paid from the commercial Yuki invited me to. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m thinking of giving everyone a pair of sneakers as a present. What do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>After using up our energy, we take a break and eat grilled squid at the beach house.</p>



<p>According to Shiori, the girls from the swim team have reserved the sneakers. However, Shiori is grateful for being warmly accepted as someone who joined in the middle of things. That&#8217;s why she thought of giving sneakers as a present.</p>



<p>How Shiori uses the money is up to her. It&#8217;s not my place to interfere. But even so, I deliberately put a hold on it. The second edition hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, but Shiori should be fine with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori, this is still a secret, but wait a little longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… Is there something?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looks puzzled, but it should be something meaningful.</p>



<p>&#8220;In a while, the second edition will be announced. This time, there will be a Goddess Model and Saint Model.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Variations have increased without me noticing!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to give a present, I thought having multiple design options to choose from would be nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Bunnyman and Hero Party Model sneakers seem to be pre-ordering really well. During a meeting, I accidentally mentioned that there are other Goddess and Saint models at Hoshikawa High School, and in no time, the second edition was decided. They might release a Bard Model eventually.</p>



<p>While I&#8217;m witnessing the serious efforts of adults who don&#8217;t miss a business opportunity, isn&#8217;t this all about basketball anymore?</p>



<p>&#8220;Goddess and Saint… Even though everyone&#8217;s saying such nice things, I&#8217;m the only one with the Dancer, ugh…&#8221;</p>



<p>I firmly grab both of Shiori&#8217;s shoulders while she&#8217;s looking down, her face turning completely red.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, isn&#8217;t this the same pattern as before…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your outfit has the most exposure. Have confidence!&#8221;</p>



<p>The only female member in the Hero Party isn&#8217;t you.</p>



<p>&#8220;The dignity of a maiden has been forcibly restored!&#8221;</p>



<p>With four different models for women, there should be options that suit each person&#8217;s taste.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re giving a gift, you want the recipient to be happy, right?</p>



<p>But how do I explain this to Tojo-senpai and Goddess-senpai…</p>



<p>&#8220;Chayaaaaaahhhhhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>My powerful spike pierces the sandy beach. A resounding cheer erupts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hihihi… Oooh… gods…&#8221;</p>



<p>Shakado is praying. She&#8217;s completely out of the competition.</p>







<p>We&#8217;re having a serious showdown in a beach volleyball match titled &#8216;1st Year Class B&#8217;s Midsummer Serious Battle&#8217;.</p>



<p>For the sake of fairness, we&#8217;re paired by gender, and teams from the same sports clubs are not allowed to pair up. If I or fresh, handsome guy and Shiori were paired, there would be no team that could win. It was an appropriate consideration.</p>



<p>So, Shakado and I, the fresh handsome guy whose face is blending with the sandy beach due to his blinding handsomeness, formed a pair with Mineda. The soccer club&#8217;s Takahashi, with his pleasant vibes, paired with Natsume, Shiori teamed up with Akanuma, Hinagi with Ito, and Elizabeth paired up with Mikuriya, creating an exquisite balance for an intense match.</p>



<p>Especially whenever Shiori gets active, cheers fill the air, and the gallery keeps growing. Coins are jingling in the donation box subtly placed there. Thanks to Shiori&#8217;s efforts, it seems we&#8217;ll gather enough money for everyone&#8217;s lunch. Thank you, Shiori, I won&#8217;t forget your heroic efforts. Boing boing.</p>



<p>Shiori is clearly the winner of Miss Overlap at this beach. Congratulations!</p>



<p>&#8220;To think that the champions would be Seidou and Elizabeth… Both of you used to be in the volleyball club in the past? Our investigation was lacking. Surprising facts have come to light.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Essentially, it was 1 vs 2… I didn&#8217;t… do anything… hihihi… sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. As a punishment, Shakado, you have to go to a beauty salon during the summer break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;――!?&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Even sheep get their wool sheared before summer. Besides, it&#8217;s a given that you&#8217;ll turn into a beauty after cutting your hair.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aside from Shakado, who seems to be frozen in shock despite it being summer, Sakurai&#8217;s energy levels are high.</p>



<p>&#8220;To think I could beat Yukito!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufufmm~ How&#8217;s that for a sight! This is the dignity of a student council president!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just the other day, Mikuya, who joined the basketball club, and Elizabeth, who was in the light music club, apparently belonged to different middle school volleyball clubs. Knowing about each other&#8217;s pasts is proof of deepening interactions.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Here&#8217;s the prize money.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any romance or comedy left in this situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>I give out the collected tips as the prize money, but Elizabeth isn&#8217;t pleased.</p>



<p>&#8220;Getting cash as a Christmas present is the best. A ten-thousand yen bill full of socks.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such an ungrateful kid! By the way, what&#8217;s with this money?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shiori earned it with her body.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did Yuki just suddenly say something so indecent!?&#8221;</p>



<p>White stares from around. I&#8217;ve only spoken the truth…</p>



<p>Oh, I see. So, it&#8217;s because the amount is small, huh?</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be helped. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable letting Shiori earn money all the time. I&#8217;m not a pimp.</p>



<p>In that case, let me take care of this.</p>



<p>I casually take out a watermelon and place it on a sheet. The gallery&#8217;s attention is drawn.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmph.&#8221;</p>







<p>I punch it down vertically, and the watermelon cleanly splits into six pieces.</p>



<p>[Oooooooooooooooohhhhh!]</p>



<p>Applause erupts. Tips start coming in… looks like we&#8217;re going for a lavish dinner.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-kun, how did you do that!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I quietly tell Elizabeth the trick to splitting the watermelon while she&#8217;s flustered.</p>



<p>&#8220;For watermelon splitting, if you make cuts beforehand, it&#8217;ll split cleanly. Then, evenly apply pressure over the whole surface, and you get this result. I didn&#8217;t have a wooden sword with me, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>While I brought the watermelon, I forgot to bring the essential tool to split it. Not having a wooden sword or bat might have been better, as they would&#8217;ve been cumbersome to carry.</p>



<p>Oh, I should probably mention this.</p>



<p>&#8220;*The split watermelon was enjoyed by the staff.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s Kokonoe-kun we&#8217;re talking about. Anything goes. We have the prize money, so how about having lunch soon?&#8221;</p>



<h4 style="text-align: center;">[Unknown PoV]</h4>



<p>In this way, swaying gently with the waves, my own thoughts begin to seem terribly insignificant.</p>



<p>Lately, nothing seems to go well. Maybe I&#8217;ve been abandoned by luck.</p>



<p>I tried plotting together with them, but it&#8217;s hard to say we&#8217;ve succeeded. Rather than being trapped, they&#8217;re becoming more confident. No matter how much I curse them, reality doesn&#8217;t change.</p>



<p>Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have gotten involved. This is so frustrating. And that person they pushed onto me, too.</p>



<p>Are they planning to ruin my life again? This feeling of nothing going well is something I haven&#8217;t felt in a while.</p>



<p>An uncomfortable feeling, just like back in elementary school… I remembered something unpleasant.</p>



<p>Even though we came to enjoy a family beach outing, it&#8217;s all ruined. I strike the water&#8217;s surface in frustration.</p>







<p>I doubt anyone realizes it&#8217;s me. It&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;ll convince myself of that, but the unease doesn&#8217;t dissipate. Why do I have to take such risks?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m stuck in the same loop without an answer again. Maybe I should just lay it all out…</p>



<p>Impossible. That man doesn&#8217;t forgive his enemies. He crushed me that way. Both him and me.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that keeping a secret could be so mentally exhausting.</p>



<p>Constantly worried about getting caught, I can&#8217;t even enjoy my school life properly.</p>



<p>Being just an incompetent who follows orders, I don&#8217;t understand his scariness. If I&#8217;m in the same school, it will become clear. He&#8217;s truly untouchable. Unwanted topics keep reaching my ears daily.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way I can directly attack him. I have no allies. Even if I asked the upperclassmen for help, I doubt anyone would cooperate.</p>



<p>Rather, if a student approached with such a topic, there&#8217;s a high chance they&#8217;d report it to him.</p>



<p>For some reason, that guy isn&#8217;t alone. Annoyingly enough, he&#8217;s well-liked by many.</p>







<p>Teachers and upperclassmen don&#8217;t matter. Everyone is concerned about his movements, protecting him.</p>



<p>If I were to oppose him, it&#8217;s me who would be isolated. Especially if my elder sister, who values him highly, were to find out, I don&#8217;t know what would happen. Unlike him, she&#8217;d be serious about removing me.</p>



<p>Truly a dead end. A miserable situation. And all of this was my own doing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have reunited with Kazu…&#8221;</p>



<p>Regret is never-ending. The gears started to grind out of place after I reconnected with him in the new school.</p>



<p>Thinking it&#8217;s just fellow locals, I got close to him in delight, and that marked the beginning of my mistake.</p>



<p>Even though I transferred and should have distanced myself in high school, I became a target of his attention due to him standing out. While I&#8217;m suffering this much, people around him are always smiling. There&#8217;s always someone beside him, laughing.</p>



<p>Why is he always having fun while I&#8217;m all alone?! I can&#8217;t suppress my frustration.</p>



<p>Nervous and careful, I maintained surface-level relationships, and now I&#8217;m all alone.</p>







<p>If I hold dissatisfaction and turn hostile, he senses it keenly, and people distance themselves further, creating a vicious cycle.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I snap back to reality. The shoreline looks quite far away. I try to turn back, but unexpectedly, the waves are strong, and I can&#8217;t move forward as much as I&#8217;d like. A deep fear bubbles up from within me. I quickly adjust my posture. However, contrary to my intentions, my body doesn&#8217;t respond.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way… This can&#8217;t be happening! It&#8217;s dangerous! Someone, help—gobo-gobo.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I try to shout without concern for my dignity, seawater enters my mouth. Coughing, my left leg cramps.</p>



<p>(Why… Why is it just me ending up like this? Am I going to die? In a place like this… I still have so much I want to do!)</p>



<p>If this is the punishment for belittling others, then there&#8217;s undoubtedly a higher power.</p>



<p>Thinking such things belatedly, tears overflow. Looking back, I&#8217;ve only resented people. Hated them. Letting my hatred for him fester, blaming everything on him. And, I committed a sin.</p>



<p>(No… It wasn&#8217;t me at first… It was him. It&#8217;s because I met him—!)</p>







<p>At first, I understood it. That I was at fault. But as we started exchanging bad words, my thoughts gradually twisted, changed. I drowned in malice.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never even been in love. Never liked someone, let alone anything beyond that.</p>



<p>Perhaps my intense yearning for beautiful things stems from my own overwhelming ugliness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn it… Help me, please! I&#8217;ll apologize… I&#8217;ll change, please, someone—&#8221;</p>



<p>My voice doesn&#8217;t reach anyone. Because I&#8217;m alone. Different from him.</p>



<p>I should have just ignored that guy and lived properly. I should have spent my youth.</p>



<p>The beautiful surface of the sea seems like the maw of a demon, waiting to swallow me. It&#8217;s mouth is open, lying in wait for its prey. How deep is it? I can&#8217;t see through the pitch-black ocean floor.</p>



<p>How small and fragile humans are. We can die so easily. All the time we&#8217;ve accumulated disappears effortlessly. I have no more will to resist.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom, Dad, I&#8217;m sorry—&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;I never expected to be facing a situation like this all of a sudden… It&#8217;s okay now. First, grab onto this kickboard. Since there&#8217;s a chance you might sink if you panic and struggle, relax all your muscles.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this an illusion? A devil in all black may have come to pick me up from the bottom of the ocean.</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m beaten. Seems like I&#8217;m in quite a pinch. Let&#8217;s see, in times like this… Got it! The other day, I tried to lower the favorability rating of the Unmoving Wisdom King sister without learning my lesson, and I acted all high and mighty, giving orders and stuff, and she seemed really delighted and carried them out. Is that some new form of harassment? When I met her, she was suddenly wearing just suspenders. I thought to myself, the internet can&#8217;t be trusted. What am I supposed to do with her!&#8221;</p>



<p>The demon is talking about something that&#8217;s hard to understand. Perhaps it&#8217;s a curse that leads to death.</p>



<p>Unmoving Wisdom King sister?… What is this person talking about? Person… a person!? Not a demon!</p>



<p>&#8220;H… help—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting closer to the shore, so you don&#8217;t need to be scared anymore. Look, it&#8217;s shallow, shallow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takai takai?&#8221; (lifting (a child) high up in the air)</p>



<p>My awareness gradually becomes clearer. It&#8217;s not a demon, just a person. He behaved brightly to reassure me.</p>







<p>… Did I make it? I&#8217;m enveloped in a sudden feeling of relief.</p>



<p>My tears have made it difficult to see their faces, which are blurred. I abandon my jumbled emotions. My eyelids are heavy, and I feel like I want to sleep like this.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m pulled up onto the shore and laid down. Feeling the land against my back is more comforting than anything.</p>



<p>A supple hand touches my left leg, and my body twitches. I remember the pain I had almost forgotten.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cramping. I&#8217;m going to stretch it like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>My left leg is lifted up, and it&#8217;s bent in a stretching-like movement, then pulled to straighten it. After a few repetitions, the cramp subsides, and I can move freely again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew. Are you feeling better now?&#8221;</p>



<p>The demon steps away swiftly. No, this person isn&#8217;t a demon. He is the person who helped me.</p>



<p>I have to thank them… at least, I want to see them just once—!</p>







<p>&#8220;—Akari!&#8221;</p>



<p>I sense my familiar mother&#8217;s voice approaching, and my consciousness falls into a deep darkness.</p>




<h4 style="text-align:center;">[Third Person PoV]</h4>



<p>&#8220;Shiorin, it&#8217;s amazing! This is like a weapon, a weapon!&#8221;</p>



<p>On the way back from the beach, she stopped by a spa to rinse off her entire body. Even though she took a shower, soaking in the bath like this made her realize how much fatigue had accumulated.</p>



<p>Mineda, who had touched Shiori Kamishiro&#8217;s chest, exclaimed in admiration. Looking down at her own chest, she was overwhelmed by the emptiness despite the fact that it was something springy and elastic with a magical power that she couldn&#8217;t resist. Trembling at the touch sinking into her chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ohhhh! This is addictive. Totally addictive!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyann! You touched me… Yaa…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Miki-chan! Cut it out, you&#8217;re making her uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>







<p>Sakurai pulled Mineda away with a sharp tug. Unsatisfied, Mineda reached out to touch Sakurai&#8217;s chest, but sadly, they were in the same boat. Among this group, only Natsume could rival Kamishiro.</p>



<p>The classmates&#8217; pressure and envious glances were intensifying. Kamishiro wavered before the ABCD encirclement (cup sizes). Her E-cup breasts felt cramped due to the blockade.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa, Amazing! You know, Kokonoe-chan was murmuring &#8216;melon or watermelon&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing Mineda&#8217;s words, Kamishiro blushed and sank into the bathtub with a bubbling sound.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito tends to sexually harass people…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito usually gets so much sexual harassment from his family that he&#8217;s numb to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzurikawa chuckled. It was undoubtedly due to his family&#8217;s influence. The Kokonoe family, including Yukito&#8217;s mother Ouka and his sister Yuri, had always adored Yukito. Only he himself seemed unaware of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kokonoe-chan is so confidently and openly engaging in sexual harassment, so it&#8217;s kind of bold, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukito speaks his mind right away. He&#8217;s just being honest.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuki was complaining about his &#8216;goodwill rating&#8217; the other day, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>While saying things like &#8220;Think about the lines you shouldn&#8217;t cross!&#8221;, Yukito had encountered Yukito, who was sexually harassing him, and barely managed to escape in one piece.</p>



<p>Not knowing the details of what had happened, he was dying. It happens all the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Yukito has been popular for a while now. Just today, he rescued a girl who was almost drowning.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sight of him rescuing a girl who was nearly drowning as he swiftly departed was undeniably heroic.</p>



<p>Watching with bated breath, Sakurai also felt a rush of relief when Yukito reached the shore, and her heart swelled with emotion. It was undoubtedly going to become a lifelong memory for that girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what Yukito means by the importance of preparation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suzurikawa murmured. Nodding in agreement, everyone understood in their own way. Yukito had always been prepared to handle anything at any time. For him, it wasn&#8217;t anything exceptional; it was simply a matter of course.</p>



<p>One could call it a state of mind, both Suzurikawa and Sakurai had a sense of the message Yukito was conveying.</p>







<p>&#8220;By the way, Shiorin, isn&#8217;t it great that you got treated so generously?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha, don&#8217;t worry about it. It was Yukito&#8217;s idea from the start. We had a blast playing together!&#8221;</p>



<p>The cost of the beach outing had been covered by the combined effort of Yukito Kokonoe, Kouki Mihou, and Shiori Kamishiro. Yukito paid half, while Mihou and Kamishiro split the remaining half equally.</p>



<p>All three of them had earned quite a bit, including the fees from their commercial appearances. Especially Yukito had amassed a sum that was beyond what one would expect from a student. In addition to the commercial shoots, there were other activities as well.</p>



<p>For Kamishiro, who was bewildered by the unexpected extra income, Yukito&#8217;s proposal was a godsend.</p>



<p>Kamishiro had no intention of splurging. She could use the money for tuition or further studies. She thought that way, but she should be allowed to spend it freely for something like this. Even though she had been dragged into it by Yukito, it was the first money she had earned on her own. An unexpected reward for her efforts. She had even bought presents for her parents. It was embarrassing for them to see the commercial, though.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got a pair of shoes that suit Kamishiro-san&#8217;s style too! You&#8217;re not going to wear the dancer costume anymore?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t! It was so embarrassing!&#8221;</p>



<p>She argued with Sakurai, but Kamishiro couldn&#8217;t help feeling nervous inside, thinking that she might have another chance to wear that outfit.</p>







<p>Yukito had hinted at a second round. If things continued this way, it might become a reality. The reality was indeed harsh.</p>



<p>Still, Kamishiro had no intention of declining. Even if she ended up wearing that outfit again.</p>



<p>The surroundings of Yukito Kokonoe were full of excitement, and waves of anticipation surged.</p>



<p>In some way, their classmates seemed to have a shared understanding that they were relying on Yukito too much.</p>



<p>This was evident in today&#8217;s events as well. They were willing to put in any effort for the sake of others. They all felt that they wanted to give back as much as Yukito had done for them. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Class B was so united.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, Anya-chan, join us!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shorty… hihi… The world of differences in bust sizes… reality is cruel… I must destroy it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sakurai brought Anya Shakado along , who had been standing quietly by the side. While gently patting her chest, the dejected self-deprecation of the current Shakado was a far cry from the excitement she displayed when finding an unusual insect. Sadly, Shakado was an introvert.</p>



<p>&#8220;That girl he helped might become your rival from now on, you know?&#8221;</p>







<p>Kamishiro laughed off Mineda&#8217;s teasing question.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. Right, Suzurikawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about wanting to be rivals. I&#8217;ve become friends with Kamishiro-san like this, too… Yukito has been through a lot of painful experiences, and has always faced hardships. I&#8217;ve done terrible things as well. Yet, he&#8217;s always been there to help and bring happiness. This time, it&#8217;s my turn. I&#8217;ve decided not to rush. First, I&#8217;ll do my best to create days that Yukito can find enjoyable. I want to make an effort, too&#8221;</p>



<p>Kamishiro quietly listened to Suzurikawa&#8217;s words. There was no jealousy in her tone.</p>



<p>Kamishiro felt the same way. It was more of a comrade-like relationship than a rivalry. It&#8217;s fine to take it slowly. There&#8217;s no need to rush.</p>



<p>Yukito Kokonoe told Kamishiro that he wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>



<p>Kamishiro had a vague conviction that Yukito wouldn&#8217;t immediately enter into a relationship with someone else.</p>



<p>If Yukito were to decide such a thing, he would surely tell Kamishiro and Suzurikawa first.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to be a warm person like Yukito, someone who can bring happiness to others!&#8221;</p>


<p>Once spoken aloud, her goal became clear. This was the path that Shiori Kamishiro would pursue from now on.</p>



<p>Perhaps the desired future awaited at the end of that path.</p>



<p>Have the boys finished in the bath by now? Yukito might be causing some kind of commotion again. But there was no need to worry about that.</p>



<p>—There was surely happiness there.</p>
