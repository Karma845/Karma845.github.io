<h3>Chapter 6 - Ball of Rejection.</h3>


<p>Today, we live in an IT society. Even though we live in a digital age where ministries and agencies are encouraging people to get rid of their stamps, I’ve been struggling with the analog world since this morning. Should I just ignore it? It’s a hassle anyway.<br><br>As I was struggling alone with the prospect of new trouble, an easygoing-looking man approached me and asked,<br>“Do you have any problems? “<p>“What are you doing, Yukito?”<p>“I found a letter in my box….”<p>“Oh, a love letter!”<p>Yes, attention! All eyes of the class are on me.<p>Drop dead, you refreshingly good-looking guuuuuuuuuuy!<p>“Kokonoe-chan, did you get a love letter?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. I’m not boasting, but I’ve never been popular with the ladies.”<p>“Isn’t this guy crazy?”<p>“I think so too” “I think aswell?” “I agree.” “I was convinced from the beginning.” “Hihi-…… that’s the good part. ……” “Don’t worry, I’m on your side!” “Me too, me too”, “I vote funny”, “I knew it he was weird”, “You could have said that”, “#Funny”, “Die scum”, “Psychotic b*****d Nya”.<p>“Who the f*ck are you people!?”</p><p>Shut uuuuuup! Don’t tweet hashtags on social networking sites! And weren’t there any inhabitants of the fantasy world? What, did they look at me like that? I was supposed to live my life as a quiet, reserved, brooding loner, so why ………<p>“So what’s it really about?”<p>“I don’t know. This is why I’m in trouble. Does this look like a love letter to you?”<p>What was carelessly shoved into the shoe box was not a stylish love letter. It was an inorganic loose-leaf letter divided into four equal parts. The only words written on the plain page were, “Please come to the study room after school.” There were no such things as dreams or hopes.</p>

<p>“But isn’t this a girl’s handwriting?”<p>“It looks like something like that. Although it doesn’t look like a love letter. ……”<p>Sakurai, Mineta and the others had also dismissed the idea of a love letter. What is it then? What is it? Scary!<p>“Yuki, you don’t have to go to that weird thing!”<p>“I don’t want to go either, but what shall I do? Kouki, why don’t you go instead?”<p>“Why me? Well, I’m not busy, and if you insist, I can go check it out.”<p>“You’re a really nice guy. What’s your opinion of me?”<p>“……, that you’re not the only one with a lot on your mind.”</p><p>What is this thought-provoking, fresh and handsome guy? The idea of reconnaissance is very appealing, but in any case, there’s nothing I can do if I leave it to him. After school, I will jump to the event!</p><p>“Eh, who are you really?”<p>The individual who had called me out was standing right in front of me. One thing I can say is that she was not in a sweet and sour mood to confess her feelings. We are the only ones here. It’s hard to think of it as an invitation to join club activities.<p>“I’m Ren Hasumura from C class. Thank you for coming.”<p>“Do I need to introduce myself?”<p>“I know you very well. Do you remember me? We were in the same junior high school.”<p>“We’ve never met before, have we?”<p>“You got that wrong. We never spoke directly to each other, though.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t remember at all. More and more, I don’t know what she wanted from me.</p><p>“I came here today to ask you to do me a favor.”<p>Suddenly, her slit eyes narrowed and the gaze was almost hostile.<p>“I’m going to be straight to the point. Please release Shiori.”<p>I ruminated over the words. Shiori —-Is she talking about Kamishiro? The word “release” is a word that makes me uncomfortable.<p>Was she sealed up, or was she a prisoner of war or something? No international treaties were violated.<p>“Could you please explain it a little more carefully? What do you mean, ‘release?'”<p>“Shiori is my best friend. It’s all your fault. After getting involved with you, Shiori became depressed. Even now, she’s ……. It’s too painful to watch!”</p>

<p>A sad voice. Best friend. I see what you mean. If you ask that much, naturally it makes sense.<p>This girl is simply worried about Kamishiro. Her words do not seem to be laced with lies. The determined look in her eyes was filled with a strong will. Hasumura-san is telling me not to get involved with Kamishiro.<p>“What should I do?”<p>“Eh?”<p>“I’m not forcing her to do anything, even if you say ‘release her’. Hasumura-san knows that much. I’ve told Kamishiro many times. But she won’t leave me. So what should I do?”<p>Hasumura-san was bewildered by the suggestion that should have come from her. She looked back and forth as if in doubt.<p>“Why … are you okay with that?”<p>“In the beginning, I always had this feeling. I don’t want to be pitied by Kamishiro forever.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t true! That was just us making fun of Shiori. She really–“<p>“I don’t care about the past. It’s about the present, isn’t it?”<p>“B-But …… can you give up on Shiori so easily?”<p>The question was baffling. Give up? Me? Who? If I don’t give up, what will be there? Nothing. I have always come this far with nothing. Always looking for something, only to find that there is no way to get it. I was shaking off with a slight headache.</p>

<p>“There is no hope of us matching from the start. We are not equals.”</p><p>“The reason Shiori chose this high school was because she was chasing you. How can you think that Shiori is lying when she likes you so much? You know that much!”<p>“Wrong. You got it wrong, Hasumura-san.”<p>I guess she doesn’t know what has been going on between me and Kamishiro. She is Kamishiro’s best friend. Then it’s a good time for her to know the truth. When I told her what had happened, she was visibly dismayed.</p>

<p>“N-no, that can’t be……”<p>“You want me to stay away from Kamishiro? All right, I’ll give it one more try.”<p>“Wait! That shouldn’t be all there is to Shiori! Why, it’s not supposed to be like this–“<p>I turned my back on the stunned Hasumura-san and left the study room.<p>I should have clearly told Kamishiro earlier. I should have told her that she should leave me for the sake of both of us.<p>Maybe the reason why I couldn’t commit to it somewhere was because I felt that time back then wasn’t so bad. But it was only the past that I could never get back.</p><p>Well, hello there. I’m third year f*ck boy!<p>My name is Yukito Kokonoe, and I have taken over the nickname of “third-year f*ck boy”.</p>

<p>Isn’t it too terrible!? What is “F*ck boy”? <em>Pl</em>ayboy? There are students like this in the first grade! Too bad I wasn’t a Yokohama fan. Sniff…….<p>I, Yukito Kokonoe, had become the most famous person in the school as the man who got the third-year student council president and vice president down on their knees to become my f*ck buddy. Rumors and gossip have too many tails.<p>The nickname I got was “Third year F*ck boy”<p>For the record, I never set anyone up. I don’t even know how to use a rubber. So s*x is out of the question.</p><p>I have it in my bag bag with great care. Just in case something should happen, you know? I-It’s true!<p>There was no sign of the “shady little boy” plan at all. Just walking down the hallway, I’m being whispered to. In this case, it is terrible that the meaning is somehow understood even if I remain a three-year bedridden person.<p>To be exposed to the public and given such a nickname would have done me a great deal of damage if I were not as strong mentally as Karmelthaite, who is beyond steel. In that sense, I could say that I was still lucky to be me, but my future was bleak. I was getting further and further away from my ideal school life.<p>It’s not good for me to be in this situation. I want to spend my time quietly and plain, like an outcast adventurer living a slow life in the middle of nowhere, but things are going against my wishes.</p><p>It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Something must be done. …… But what should I do about it…..</p>

“But then again, Yukito is Yuuri’s younger brother, right? What did he do to make the student body president get down on her knees? An extraordinary hope has emerged.”<p>“Is that true? I can’t believe it.”<p>“I heard that someone took a picture of it. No doubt about it.”</p><p>“Haa, ……. Guys, it’s not funny. It’s something more serious.”<p>I have to protect my brother’s school life. I am going to run for student council this year. With that, I will improve the school to make it as comfortable as possible for that boy. That’s all I can do, but I still couldn’t stop myself from doing it.<p>I wonder if someday he will call me Onee-chan again. ……<p>Such a trivial wish is the only thing that motivates me. I’m not much different from the Hinagi Suzurikawa and Shiori Kamishiro.<p>I was aware that I was probably the one who hurt them the most. My brother never talked about what had happened. I was also afraid that someone would find out about it, so I kept it bottled up for a long time.</p>

<p>It was an irrevocable sin.<p>Looking back on it now, it is no wonder that I missed my brother so much. I guess he turned from my mother to me to be pampered. But even if I had realized that now, it was too late.<p>I am carrying an unforgivable sin on my shoulders. It was I who destroyed my brother to the point where it was too late.<p>I am the one who destroyed my brother with my own hands ……. I look down at my hands, which I can still feel. I sometimes dreamed of his face at that moment. What was he thinking at that moment? [Aah, you are one of them too] I’m sure his eyes were like that.<p>Since that day, my brother, who had been so fond of me, were gone. The love and affection as well.<p>The bond between sister and brother had also been lost. He probably thinks of me as a stranger. We have no bond.<p>I don’t think he knew that I was worried about him like this at all.<p>–That day, I tried to kill my brother.</p>

<p>[I really hate you! Disappear!]<p>Our hands were seperated.<p>He looked straight at me without averting his gaze. Immediately, the confusion that had been floating in me turned into resignation, acceptance of reality, and then, at that moment—</p><p>“Is Yukito Kokonoe here?”<p>How many times have I seen this pattern already! This development has already become familiar.</p><p>Now, my name recognition is growing. I have been fed up with the continuous recruiting by the athletic club, and now, as the man who has conquered the impregnable student body president, I have been asked for advice on love. I had never been popular with the girls, so I was not interested in counseling on love. I was simply constipated.<p>There was no way I could understand how other people felt. I can’t even understand my own feelings, so it’s impossible for me to understand others.<p>As usual, a senpai visited me in the classroom and Who is this guy ……?</p>

<p>The number of people I know is increasing without my knowing it, and that is me, Yukito Kokonoe.<p>“That’s me, and why are YOU in this class?”<p>“I see, it’s you. I’m Toshiro Himura. a third-year student. I’m the captain of the basketball team.”<p>“I had a bad feeling. Come to think of it, Kokonoe was at the school cafeteria earlier.”<p>“Don’t become suddenly a different person. You just said you were Kokonoe”<p>“But, you look like trouble.”<p>As one would expect from a member of the basketball team, Himura-senpai is quite tall. However, this school’s basketball team is not a strong one, so it doesn’t really matter. The school’s basketball team is not a powerhouse, though, so there is no reason to be concerned about that.<p>“I heard about it from Hyakuma-senpai. He wondered why you weren’t on the basketball team.”</p>

<p>“You knew him?”<p>“Hyakuma-senpai is an alumnus of this school, you know? You didn’t know about this?”<p>“I don’t like to pry into other people’s business, so no”<p>“That’s how I found out about you. That’s why I came to ask you out.”<p>“If I had been so open-minded as to accept an invitation, I would have joined the club from the very beginning.”</p><p>I see, so Hyakuma-senpai was an alumnus. If I think about it, coincidences of that magnitude can happen in any number of ways. Perhaps he was concerned about me in his own way. Or perhaps he was simply wondering. To be honest, it’s a bit of a nuisance, but I guess I should be thankful for that.</p><p>“There are people in the basketball club who were in the same junior high school as me, right? When these people don’t say anything, you know what I’m talking about.”<p>“I thought so and asked them, but none of them were in the same junior high school as you.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”<p>“Because our basketball team is not very active.”<p>“Then even more so, why do you have to invite me?”<p>It is too late for anything. The fact that I devoted myself to club activities was nothing more than an escape from reality. I didn’t have a firm determination to do so. That’s why my feelings were so easily broken. I was left halfway, unable to fulfill even a single goal. So I have no intention to resume playing basketball. It’s not that I particularly like basketball.</p><p>“Kokonoe, this is the last year for us. It is true that we are not strong. We don’t have the strength to win a championship. Even so, we have been playing for three years. We want to give it our all at the tournament. Please lend me your strength!”<p>“Isn’t that strange? It’s not possible for a freshman to easily participate in the tournament in the first place.”<p>“I should tell you, there are only nine of us in our school basketball team, including me.”<p>“Eh!? Is the popularity of basketball in the nineties over!”</p>

<p>“At the moment, it’s 2021. A few years ago, there was a brief period of popularity, but it was thanks to JUMP in both cases.”<p>“Weak, aren’t you?”<p>“That’s why. I want to surprise them with a little success, no?”<p>“Who are you talking about? I don’t have anyone like that.”<p>“Kokonoe, there is a girl in my class whom I like. I’m going to confess my love to her after the tournament is over. I want to show her how good I look and how I like her!”</p><p>“This is all about you! Why do the upperclassmen at this school start spouting off things to the underclassmen that they haven’t even heard? Is it an endemic disease?”<p>Himura-senpai was a hot-blooded man who was easy to understand. He was also an idiot. He was passionate and straight-forward. He is a nuisance to me. Do whatever you want.<p>Look, my classmates are looking at me again. Stop smirking! What the hell is wrong with you guys! And if you think about the personality of Himura-senpai, I kind of feel like I can read what’s going to happen after this.</p>

<p>“Well then, Kokonoe, play basketball with me after school!”<p>Himura-senpai was a resident of the manga world. What’s with the “then”? The front and back don’t connect! I don’t understand the point of the game at all. For some reason, my classmates were excited. Some of them were operating their phones intently. What the hell are they doing?<p>“I understand. Let’s do it, Yukito!”<p>“Ha? Hey, wait a minute! Why are you suddenly jumping in?”<p>“Let’s do it, Yuki!”<p>You’re looking good today, Mihou. The fresh smile on his face is about 300% more attractive than before. And who’s that other person who just agreed to do it?</p>

<p>What about my intention? Something is going on around me without my consent. ignoring me. …… Is this a violation of human rights? Is it bullying?<p>“How about a 3×3 match? There’s also Ito from the basketball team at this class.<p>“What? I see, Hayato, you were in this class too!”<p>“My presence…..”<p>Reluctantly, Ito (?) of the basketball club from the basketball team came over. I don’t know him that well. In fact, I still couldn’t even remember his name. I see, so this person is Ito Hayato!<p>“Please do it without me. ……”<p>I mumbled to myself.</p>

<p>The group chat on my phone is getting more and more exciting. For some reason, this is a mysterious group where my brother’s information is reported every step of the way. I use it because it’s convenient, but it’s also a headache. My brother himself seems to be completely unaware of it. It was completely unauthorized.<p>“That boy is again…… !”<p>Since that one incident, my brother had been the talk of the town. He was so conspicuous that even the second year class knew his name. In a sense, he may be the most famous person in the school. Otherwise, he would not have attracted so much attention. More and more classmates were joining this group. Apparently, this time he was going to have an after-school game with the captain of the basketball team.</p><p>Why can’t that boy just stay quiet?<p>He had quit basketball in junior high school. He doesn’t seem to be particularly attached to it now. He said he was a homecoming club member, but I can’t help but wonder why this is happening to him. Will he be all right? Is he involved in some kind of trouble? There is no end to my worries.<p>Fufu. It’s funny, isn’t it? What am I supposed to worry about now? I’m not qualified for that kind of thing anymore, right? I can’t help but to let my self-mockery spill out.<p>That’s right. Since that time, I have long since lost such qualifications.</p>

<b>[Yuuri PoV]</b>

<p>“I really hate you! Disappear!”<p>I pushed my brother from the top of the playground equipment in the park. I didn’t realize the significance of that, but I was following my emotions and acting on them. I felt a fresh sensation. The hands that were connected on the chain were separated and my brother’s body was thrown into the air without a struggle.<p>A look in his eyes was appealing, “Why?” They were appealing to me. “Why are you doing this to me?” I was shaken. The impulse that was driving me.<p>“Because I hate you!”<p>I couldn’t stand it any longer and shouted so. A few moments later, I heard a dull thud. Blood was flowing from his forehead. The blood of human beings is red and beautiful. …… I had such an empty feeling of reality. However, I came back to myself when I saw my brother, who had collapsed and was not moving even a twitch.<p>“Eh……?”</p>

<p>What did I just do? I couldn’t believe my own actions. I didn’t want to admit what had happened as a result. A feeling of emptiness takes over.<p>I was sure that now, with my own hands, my brother–.<p>The fear that came over me. My hands were shaking. Bending my knees, I laughed and slowly climbed down from the playground equipment.<p>“Yukito ……? Hey, hey, you are okay, right?”<p>There was no reply. It’s the biggest surprise I’ve ever seen. It was too shocking a sight for me, a child. Blood gushed out and turned the ground black.<p>“……No……That’s not right……How could ……this happen?”<p>Wanting to deny reality, I fled the scene.<p>–And my brother never came back.</p>

<p>I loved my brother. My mother was busy with work, so I had to take care of him more often than not. My brother was very serious and unmanageable. He was very attached to me. Maybe that made my mother feel at ease. But I am still a child. I am only one year older than my younger brother. I am only an immature child after all.<p>I spent more and more time with my brother, and we played together more and more. It was not hard for me, but it was also a time when I was beginning to build my own relationships with others. The awakening of the ego. My world was rapidly expanding.</p><p>In the midst of all this, being constantly with my younger brother became a burden.<p>Even my mother only cared about my brother. Perhaps that cast a shadow over my mind somehow. Looking back, I guess I was also starved for affection after all, even though that was never the case. I was lonely, too.<p>One day I was playing with my best friend Maki. There was also my younger brother there.<p>Maki was an only child. I guess that’s why she longed to have an older sister and a younger brother. She was very protective of my younger brother. I felt a sense of alienation in my heart. I felt possessive that he was my brother, and ugly jealousy that my brother had taken my best friend. Maki is my best friend! Such complicated feelings are mixed together. One day, when I was going home with my brother without being able to digest them, that’s when it happened.<p>I hit the bare skin of my emotions. It was too much, too terrible treatment that hurt both my mind and body. It was not enough to be cruel. Can I deny that I did not intend to kill him? It was not an act that could be forgiven just because I was a child. My brother never came home. My anxiety grew. Even though it was my fault, regardless of what I had done, I could not get his eyes out of my mind.<p>It was six days later when my younger brother came home. No, he did not come home. The police called us. I had told my mother everything. There was no way I could hide it. I rushed to the park, but my brother was no longer there. Maybe he was on his way home. I thought so and waited, but he did not come back.</p>

<p>The next day, I filed a missing persons report with the police. The days went on like hell until I received a call asking for confirmation. But the real hell started after that.<p>My younger brother, who had been found, was severely exhausted. He was found in a neighboring city. His forehead was badly injured and his bones were cracked. I did this to my brother! I was tormented by tremendous regret. My younger brother looked at me with dark eyes and uttered a muffled voice.<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t disappear.”</p><p>–Eh? Strange, this is strange! I’m the one who should be apologizing, you’re the one who didn’t do anything wrong! A flood of emotion washes over me and I can’t say anything.<br>It’s not just the injury. Then is it my fault that Yukito didn’t come back? Was it because I told him to disappear? Is that why he tried to disappear?<p>Naturally, I was angry. But my angry mother was crying as she hugged me. That was more painful than simply being angry.<p>But at that time, I still did not understand the meaning of my younger brother’s words.<p>My brother wanted to disappear from my life. He took that to mean exactly what it literally meant. I had taken it lightly, thinking that he would simply disappear. I feel bad that I pushed him away. No amount of grief and regret would ever forgive me.<p>But that was still the extent of my perception. That was my limit as a child.</p>

<p>When was the timing? It does not matter. But when I grew up and understood human “death,” everything changed.<p>My brother was going to die. Disappearing, not from me, but from this world. That is why my brother did not come back. I don’t think he understood “death” himself.<p>But he may have sensed it instinctively. In fact, he could have died if he had been found a day later. Or if he had fallen off the playground equipment and hit the wrong spot. He might have died instantly.<p>When I realized this, my mind went blank with fear. I was about to kill my beloved brother. I tried to take his life out of my temporary emotion</p><p>When he returned home, he was a changed man. Our hands were no longer hold together. He no longer missed me. My younger brother, who used to follow behind me with a smile on his face, calling me “onee-chan,” was gone. Since then, he has never called me “Onee-chan”<p>It was obvious. I tried to kill my brother. There was no telling when he might be killed again. There was no way I could carelessly approach him. There was no way he could be friends with someone who had tried to kill him. But there was no fear in my younger brother’s eyes. That also puzzled me. It would be easier to understand if he were frightened. But his reaction was so strange, as if he had lost something, as if he was broken.<p>I apologized again and again. I repeated my apologies. Every time I dreamed of that day, every time I saw my younger brother broken, I couldn’t help but apologize.<p>But it was too late. No matter how much I apologized, my brother would not understand. Apologies are made to ask for forgiveness. Only when you tell the other person that it was your fault, and only when the other person is angry with you, can the rift be resolved. Otherwise, it is impossible to move</p> 

<p>But my younger brother was not angry about anything. He had forgiven me from the beginning. No matter how much I apologized to him, it was meaningless. No matter how much I told him that I was sorry and that it was my fault, if he forgave me, it would not make sense.<p>It is as if he has lost the feeling of “anger” …….<p>I can’t help it if I apologize when he forgives me and he is not angry. My brother kept forgiving every time I apologized. So it always ends there. Nothing changes. Nothing can change. What is broken cannot be restored. No matter how much I wanted to go back to the old relationship, my brother, who forgave me, would never go back.</p><p>I wanted to be condemned. I wanted to be accused of why I did what I did.<p>I wanted to be honest with him, to cry, to apologize, to tell him that I really loved him, and to be a sister and brother again. It was a wish that would never come true.<p>After that, my brother got worse and worse. It seemed as if every time something happened to him, he lost something. It was as if he was losing his emotions one by one. ……<p>Then I realized. –So what would happen if he lost all his emotions?<p>I remember the conversation I had with him when I called him. He said he wanted me to wait until I got through high school. For what? That’s obvious. That boy is surely going to disappear from my life. I may never plan to see him again. Besides, if he has lost the feeling of “fear,” he might easily choose death without hesitation.</p>

<p>Even now, my words of that day are driven into my brother’s heart as a wedge. I cannot pull it out. I cannot help my younger brother because I cannot touch his heart.<p>That is why I hoped for someone else. I thought it would be her. But it was a failure. On the contrary, she ended up hurting him more deeply. I should not have relied on her!<br>Still, I will save him somehow. It will be me, no one else. This time.<p>“A basketball game doesn’t …… sound like the kind of thing he’d do.”<p>What kind of change of heart did he have? I should not miss anything. Every sign, every little change, every little thing about my brother, I will not miss. I will never let him out of my sight. Once I let go of his hand, we will never bond again.<p>If I take my eyes off him this time, I’m sure I won’t be able to see him anymore.<p>Should I bring a towel and a sports drink? I think I have that much, but I can’t help but do something anyway. When he was in junior high school, my brother, who was devoted to basketball, was honestly cool. Maybe I will be able to see him like that again.<p>With my heart pounding, I waited for after-school hours.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p>The gymnasium was overflowing with people of leisure who had heard the commotion. A crowd of spectators had formed in the gallery. I decided to ignore them as I heard “that’s the rumored one ……”. I wondered if they were anticipating an event that had just popped up in their daily lives. I would like to pretend to be a bystander like that. The problem is that I’m at the center of this commotion. Excuse me, can I go home? At the center of the commotion, it’s me, Yukito Kokonoe, who is yelling at people to go home.</p><p>I don’t understand why I, a member of the club that goes home, am being put in this situation here. My opponents are three regulars from the basketball club, led by Himura-senpai. Depending on how you look at it, I was the cocky underclassman who disobeyed my senpai. I want to live in peace, but why ……<p>The 3×3 game is played in 10 minutes with two five-minute rounds per period with alternating offensive and defensive shifts. Once the game starts, it is over quickly and easily, and there is no such thing as strategy.<p>“Then, if we win, you will join the basketball team, right?”<p>“Okay.”<p>“Nothing okay! Can you please not decide on your own? Isn’t senpai being immature?”<p>“We don’t even know if we’ll win! If I had that much confidence in our basketball team, I wouldn’t have invited you.”<p>“Then, if we win, the basketball team will be disbanded.”</p>

<p>“That’s, that’s aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh?!”<p>The Senpai were in grief. It made no sense. Would any third-year student expect to be beaten by a first-year student from the very beginning? I don’t even know how well the fresh handsome guy can move, let alone Ito-kun who says he is a member of the basketball team.<p>“Besides, I have no motivation, so I honestly don’t care if I win or lose. ……”<p>“Yukito, let’s win for sure!”<p>“You guys, even though they’re our Senpai, they’re regulars, remember? Of course we’re going to lose.”<p>For some reason, the fresh and handsome man smiles at me.<p>“We’re going to win. There is no way we’re going to lose. Right?”<p>“Where do you get your confidence from?”</p>

<p>After the summer of my second year, there was a girl who talked to me strangely.<p>That was Shiori Kamishiro, the one who lied to me.</p>

<b>[Shiori PoV]</b>

<p>“Huh? Wasn’t he here last week?”<p>Saturday. I saw him practicing on the free court at the park. He was a member of the men’s basketball team, I believe. It was the second time I saw him at this place. I remember seeing him practicing alone at the same place at the same time last week. I didn’t pay any attention to him at that time, but perhaps because I also play the women’s basketball team, I was strangely interested in him the second time I saw him. He had a presence that seemed to attract me.</p><p>But for some reason, the atmosphere was different and he was just desperately trying to get things done.<p>The third time would soon come. I decided to see him properly at school for the first time. Even though the basketball clubs interacted with each other, we had never had much contact or talked to each other before. I wondered what kind of person he was. He even practices on his days off. He’s a very dedicated practitioner, I guess.<p>That was my first impression. He is different from me, who is not that enthusiastic about club activities.</p><p>The men’s basketball team is not that strong. So how can he work so hard? I was interested in him and started to follow him with my eyes.<p>Perhaps that was a mistake. When I finally began to pay attention to him, his abnormality was remarkable. He practiced in the morning, after school, and at night. Not with anyone else, but always alone. It was so unnatural in basketball, which is a team sport. What was the point of him practicing alone? What’s the point if the team doesn’t get stronger?<p>He was an idiot,……, but at the same time, somewhere in the back of my mind, I may have been dazzled by his figure.<p>He was becoming more and more prominent. No wonder. He has practiced that much. The members of the men’s basketball team were bewildered by his appearance. They did not know how to treat him. There was a clear difference in attitude toward club activities. They are doing it for fun, but there is one person who is very serious about it, and they feel like they are not part of the club.<p>However, he doesn’t mind being subjected to such an atmosphere. And he did not ask others to make the same effort as he did. Today he continues to practice alone.</p>

<p>“Hey, how are you able to work so hard?”<p>When I spoke to him, he was just an ordinary male student. Or so I thought at the time. He was very easy to talk to and very kind.<p>In spite of my appearance, apparently I am popular. I have been confessed several times. I am tall and my breasts are growing well. I knew I was well-developed. I could feel the eyes of boys on my body.<p>If I were to say that I was self-conscious, I would be right, but he was different. He didn’t look at me that way. He didn’t even recognize me to begin with. When I first spoke to him, the first words he said to me were, “Who are you?”. I was a little annoyed by that and sulked.<br>I wondered how I could get him to be interested in me. I felt that he had little awareness of other people.</p>

<p>What is the point of continuing unrewarding practice alone?<p>What is reflected in his eyes? He was so deep, dark, and stagnant that I couldn’t help but think about such things. He was staring at something very coldly. And yet, his attitude and words were always kind. He was an unbalanced and strange existence that could not be left alone. That was Yukito Kokonoe.<p>He became a person who made me feel at ease. An important friend of the opposite sex. It did not take long for him to become more than that.</p>

<p>I started calling him Yuki, and he started calling me Shiori. I asked him to call me that.<p>The opportunity to make a big change in his presence within the club came. In the fall tournament of my sophomore year, the men’s basketball team defeated a strong school and made it to the top 16 of the prefectural tournament. It was a great accomplishment. The men’s basketball team, which usually loses in the first or second round of district tournaments, made it all the way to the prefectural tournament and achieved a result. He also received a commendation from the school. It was almost entirely his achievement.</p><p>But basketball is a team sport. No matter how great he is, there is a limit. However, this result will change the mindset of the boys.<p>If they could do better, they could aim higher. Such expectations were beginning to emerge in the men’s basketball team. If they improve, they may be able to achieve better results. Before long, the boys began to seriously devote themselves to basketball with a completely different attitude. He single-handedly changed the basketball team.<p>He did not say anything on his own. He did not force anyone to do anything. He changed his surroundings just by his own actions.<p>He was a classmate and good friend. At the same time, I had a strong admiration for his presence and his back.<p>And the heat and aftermath of the event gradually spread to the women’s basketball team as well. Everyone began to practice more seriously than before.<p>Around this time, more and more people around me began to pay attention to him. Some members were giving him hot glances. Of course. He is simply good looking. How could I not care about him with such dazzling brilliance and irrepressible darkness?</p>

<p>I had a slight feeling of superiority, but at the same time I had a sense of insecurity. I was still too much of a child to understand what that feeling was. I had been exercising all my life, and I was too inexperienced to know that it was love.<p>My relationship with him continued after that. By that time, I had already fallen in love with him. I was so excited that I clearly knew it was love. I enjoy talking to him. I wanted to be with him. These feelings swelled up.<p>And finally, unable to hold back, I told him that.</p><p>But I never thought it would turn out like that. ……<p>From that day on, my regrets began. I should never have told him. If only I had been more honest with myself.<p>“Yuki, you know what? There’s something I want you to hear today. ……”<p>“What’s wrong, Shiori?”<p>It was getting dark outside. Yuki spends until the very last minute practicing after school, and by the time he returns home, the sun has gone down. I choose to wait for Yuki and go home with him.</p>

<p>He doesn’t say anything in particular when he sees how nervous I am, but gently urges me on as usual.<p>“I love you, Yuki!”<p>His eyes flicker a little. A look of surprise in his eyes. I may have seen it for the first time. It is rare that I can see his emotions. I have never seen him express his feelings like this.<p>All I knew of him was either his gentle, everyday appearance or the way he devoted himself to club activities to the utmost of his strength. That is why his appearance filled my heart with emotion. I knew that even I could convey something to him. I stared into Yuki’s eyes and waited for him to say something.</p><p>“Sorry, Shiori. Can you wait until after the tournament for my reply?”<p>“I ……see. It’s the last tournament, isn’t it?”<p>His answer was contrary to my expectations. Whether I liked it or not, I was going to accept it either way, and I thought I had the determination and courage to confess my feelings. But what I got back was a third option, which was neither of the two. It was to “wait.”<p>Thinking about it, for Yuki, who had devoted himself so much to club activities, the final competition of his junior year was the culmination of all his hard work. He must have been very attached to it. The other members of the club were also looking forward to the tournament. They were eager to show what they could do. I understand that he wants to focus on that for now.</p>

<p>“Will you give me an answer when it’s over?”<p>“I promise I will.”<p>” …..I undestand. I’ll wait. But I don’t want to be sad!”<p>Unable to bear the awkwardness and embarrassment, I told him that and ran out. I had some hope that I might get a good answer. Because if Yuki didn’t like me, if he didn’t think anything of me, then he should have just told me right here and now. There was no reason to hold off.</p></span><p>And yet, he wanted me to wait until the convention. That must be the time Yuki needed to face me.<p>If that was the case, Yuki would surely give me the answer I wanted. With a bouncy feeling, I set off for home.<p>Some time later, I was being questioned by my friends in front of the girls’ restroom. The three of us were in different classes, but we had been friends since elementary school and were still good friends. It seemed that I had been acting strangely lately. This must be something wrong, they asked, grinning at me.<p>“Shiori, did you perhaps confess your feelings for Kokonoe?”</p>

<p>“W-Why!? There is nothing between us!”<p>“Then why are you so flustered?”<p>“You are showing too much of emotion. On the contrary, Kokonoe-kun has a poker face.”<p>“Aah. Spring has finally come to Shiori-chan.”<p>It was my first experience to be ridiculed and teased like that. My mind goes blank. This is my first love. This feeling is very precious and sweet. I want to keep it deep in my heart. I don’t want to hurt it, and I don’t want to be hurt by it. I don’t want to be made fun of, so I say things that I don’t even think about.<p>” Shiori is always with him these days, you know. It’s obvious if you’re giving off an aura of liking him so much, you know that, right?”<p>“No! Yuki and I are not like that. It’s not that I like Yuki–it’s just that he always seems to be alone and sad, so I’m giving him some attention! There is no such ……”<p>“So you don’t like him?”</p>

<p>“It’s not like that! I don’t care about Yuki—-“<p>I don’t know what I’m talking about. My friends were grinning at me as they watched me, and I was able to argue with them with a bright red face. The expression of my friends all stiffened up. Their gazes are behind me. I have a very bad feeling.<p>What’s wrong? I turn around and see Yuki coming out of the men’s room.</p><p>Eh? Why is Yuki here!?<p>I was wondering, but it was nothing to wonder about. Anyone would go to the bathroom. My mind was so disoriented that I didn’t even understand that immediately. Did he hear what I just said? To whom? Yuki? What did I say? I had confessed to Yuki, and now I was denying it. The thoughts continue to wander around in a corridor with no exit in sight.<p>“U-uhm Kokonoe-kun ……”<p>My pale, white-haired friend tried to speak to him, but Yuki didn’t seem to be bothered by anything in particular, didn’t even look at us, and walked away as if he didn’t even notice us.<p>“W-what should we do, Shiori? He might have heard us just now!”</p>

<p>“It’s our fault. We made fun of Shiori. ……”<p>“Are you sure you didn’t confess? If it’s a lie, deny it now or else I don’t know if it will get complicated.”<p>“Shiori, if you don’t be honest, you might be in big trouble. ……”<p>“Eh! Wait a minute. That’s –“<p>A tremendous sense of frustration. I have to do something, but I’m afraid to move my legs.<p>What should I do? What should I do? Do I tell him that I lied about everything?<p>Maybe he didn’t hear me. If so, I shouldn’t do anything unnecessary. But what if he did ask? I don’t know the answer. I only grew impatient.<p>A few days passed, and I still could not ask Yuki anything. On the surface, Yuki’s behavior had not changed at all. He was kind and good-looking as usual.</p>

<p>But somehow, I had the feeling that the distance between us had grown slightly. But it was not a change that I could clearly sense, just a minor change. Maybe I’m just being overly concerned about it, or maybe I’m just mistaken. Maybe it was just my insecurity and misunderstanding.<p>But the lies I had told were advancing without my knowledge.<div style=height:100px aria-hidden=true class=wp-block-spacer></div><p>“It’s almost time for the competition, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah”<p>Today I was going home with Yuki. We were approaching a pedestrian bridge. Nothing much had happened since then. So I felt somewhat relieved.<p>That was my mistake. If I had been honest about everything from the beginning, there would have been no misunderstandings or miscommunications.……<p>“I’ll be waiting for your reply then!”<p>I said that in a flirtatious mood, not considering Yuki’s feelings.</p>

<p>“Reply?”<p>“Muu. You are not going to tell me you forgot about it, are you? The answer to my confession.”<p>Yuki’s expression suddenly makes me feel uneasy. Yuki is not the kind of person who would intentionally blurt it out knowingly. If he didn’t really think anything of it, he wouldn’t have responded the way he did.<p>“Aah. That thing. Shiori, you don’t have to hang out with me anymore.”<p>“Eh?”<p>“It’s not that I’m lonely by myself. I like it that way. I’m alone because I want to be alone, so don’t feel sorry for me.”<p>“What are you…talking about……”<p>I didn’t know what Yuki was talking about. But something decisive–.</p>

<p>“Shiori, you don’t have to care about someone you don’t like.”<p>Yuki was the same as usual, even at a time like this. Nothing changed in his gaze or voice. But his words were filled with a definite rejection.<p>“I can’t believe you would do such a trivial thing as lying to me.”<p>Yuki was nonchalant, as if it was nothing.<p>I knew he heard us! I should have talked to him properly at that time instead of leaving it alone!<p>Such regrets are coming back to haunt me now. I hurriedly tried to tell him how I felt, but I couldn’t speak.</p><p>“If you want to hear my answer, I’ll tell you now. Shiori, the answer is no.”<p>“Noo! You got it wrong, Yuki! I didn’t mean what I said.”</p>

<p>“It’s also annoying for Shiori ……No, it is also annoying for Kamishiro to go home with a guy like me. So let’s end this today.”<p>Kamishiro? It was as if we had gone back to the beginning. Around the time of our first conversation.<p>I hate it. It’s not true! I really like Yuki, and I’m not lying—-!<p>I try to reach out my hand to Yuki, who is calmly moving forward, but in my haste, I lose my footing on the steps of the pedestrian bridge. The ground that should be there is gone. My tangled legs are thrown into the air, and my sense of balance is lost. My body followed gravity and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Shiori!?”<p>He called my name. In such a situation, I am happy to hear such a thing. But my body did not stop. I found myself in Yuki’s arms. I fell down the stairs.<p>I checked my body. There seemed to be no danger to me. Someone was supporting me. Yuki was the only one who was supporting me. Yuki, that’s right, Yuki is!<p>Yuki is lying on the floor, protecting me. I could hear Yuki’s voice leaking out in bitter agony.</p>

<p>“Are you okay Shiori?…..!”<p>Thank God he’s conscious. Yuki is safe! In the short time I had to rejoice, I saw it. Yuki’s right hand was bent in an impossible direction. I also do sport.<p>I immediately knew at a glance what it meant.<p>Yuki’s right hand was broken. The tournament was just around the corner.<p>–Yuki could no longer participate in the tournament.</p><p>I don’t know what you would call my haircut, but I guess you could call it a scattered cut head. I don’t sound particularly civilized when I slap it, but the reason why I was playing basketball was because of a sense of shame. I wanted to forget the stupidity of my foolish and embarrassing mistake.<p>Because when I tried to confess my feelings for my childhood crush, she had a new boyfriend and rejected me. Well, it was a shock, I guess.<p>Soon after that, the relationship between Suzurikawa and her senpai deepened. When was the last time I held Suzurikawa’s hand? I don’t even remember. It may have never happened in the first place. Of course, we never kissed, and there was nothing more than that between us.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why. I felt a sense of emptiness toward my childhood friend who easily crossed the line with the other person.<p>Ah, so this is how it’s going to be. …… I had given up on myself.<p>The void that opened up in my heart is widening day by day. I tried to fill it, but I couldn’t. It was like a bottomless bucket. Even if you poured water into it from above, it would not fill up. Emotions leaked out and wore away little by little.<p>There was no fear in these days. However, my rational mind was screaming that this was not the way to go.<br>That is why I devoted myself to club activities. I was committed to basketball. I was desperate to fill the void with something. And I set a goal.</p><p>I would use the last tournament as an opportunity to move forward. At that time, I still had feelings of “love” for Suzurikawa. But I could no longer reach it. There was no point in holding on to them forever. It was a goal I set in order to break away from such feelings.<p>Eventually, the feelings of “liking” and ” affection” for someone else would disappear. I found myself unable to understand. Every day I felt that I was breaking down. Wanting to deny it, I became even more absorbed in basketball.</p>

<p>There was someone who approached me. That person was Shiori Kamishiro.<p>Before I knew it, we had become good friends. One day after those days passed, Shiori Kamishiro confessed her feelings for me. Untruthfully, it was a lie. Even though I knew it was a lie, I didn’t really care. In fact, I was relieved. There was no need to be shocked.<p>Nothing would start until the last tournament was over. Unless I firmly erased the person inside me, Hinagi Suzurikawa and Shiori Kamishiro, I would not be able to face them.</p><p>That is why I held my answer in abeyance. Everything would not move forward until the tournament was over.<p>However, I broke my arm just before the tournament and did not compete. Everything was thrown out halfway through and left without any sort of resolution. That broke me a little bit again.<p>I wonder if something would have changed if I had participated in the tournament properly at that time. Would I have been able to get something back? I will never know the answer to that question, but at the very least, my relationship with Kamishiro should have been clearly resolved at that time.</p>

<p>“This pressure is too low. I’d better put a little more air in it.”<p>I tried to dribble, but the ball did not rebound very well. I wonder how good the fresh handsome guy is who got me into this situation with such gusto. However, with a grin, Kouki easily dunked the ball through the markings of the Senpai. A tremendous physical performance. The girls cheered in excitement.</p><p>Isn’t it unfair that he’s so handsome? He is taking advantage of this opportunity to gain the favor of the girls.<p>The offense and defense changed, and the Senpai became the attackers. I soon found out. The Senpai are not that good. There is a big gap in physical growth between first-year and third-year students, but even so, it is hard to say that they are not good opponents. Because of their large size, their movements were clumsy and unpolished. I could tell immediately by their eyes what they were going to do next. If that is the level of the basketball team at this school, it is understandable that they are weak.<p>Senpai’s center of gravity is off as he tries to shoot by crushing a quick attack. Just by doing that, the ball easily bounces off the ring. Once again, the offense and defense are reversed. This time, he tries to pass the ball to Ito-kun. He missed it and was hurriedly chasing the ball. I thought to myself. This is—–<p>“Isn’t it better not to do this anymore?”<p>“‘No, it’s not over”</p>

<p>“If we keep playing like this, we’re going to win. ……”<p>“What? Yukito, you still don’t know the weight of this place, do you?”<p>“I do. I mean, Kouki. That move, you have experience huh.”<p>“You just noticed that now, …… I don’t know how I feel about it at all.”<p>There was no way I could understand the feelings of a refreshingly handsome guy.<p>I am proud to say that I am a good student, but one thing I am not good at is answering unreasonable questions in Japanese, such as “How does the author feel?” I wrote, “Wasn’t he irritated because he had to go to the bathroom?” I was once told not to joke around when I wrote that. I don’t understand ……. I am not a psychologist. How could I possibly know how the author felt!<p>You don’t have to digest two periods. This is an easy match. They lack practice, skill, and everything else. Just because you’re big doesn’t mean they can’t be beaten. Haa………. Sighs spill out. I had no intention of doing it from the beginning, but it became more of a negative.<p>I shot the ball in a throwaway. The ball goes through the ring as if sucked in. The crowd was no longer cheering in excitement. The atmosphere that was so lively just a few minutes ago has now faded away.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the gym after school. It was one-sided. Not even a story.<p>“Really boring. ……”<p>I didn’t notice that everyone in the room had a twitchy look on their faces.<p>“If that’s the case, the next round. Play against me, Yukito.”<p>The sharp gaze of the fresh handsome guy was shooting through me.</p><p>[Kouki Mihou PoV]<p>A chilly sensation that makes my skin tingle. It is a pleasant feeling of tension that I have not felt for a long time.<p>I can’t pass up this chance that has unexpectedly come my way. Even I think it’s ridiculous. It’s no use being obsessed with it forever.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>But I was still waiting for this moment.<p>I, Kouki, have a special place in my heart for the man in front of me. It may be like a lover, so to speak, like this.<p>I was invited by many sports clubs. I like sports. I chose basketball in junior high school simply because I did not want to practice outside on a hot summer day, but I was selected as a regular member of the basketball team from the first grade and played an active role in the games.<p>The basketball team was said to be a strong one. A powerhouse, a top-ranked school in the prefectural tournament.</p><p>I wasn’t being conceited by any means. It was a strictly obvious fact that I was athletically superior. That’s probably why. The encounter with the man was a shock to me.<p>It came suddenly. It was a district tournament. The opponent was a weak school that I didn’t know very well. There was no need to take data. Our goal was the national tournament, and the regional tournament was just a stepping stone. It was an opponent we didn’t even need to worry about. No one doubted that we would win by a large margin. It was supposed to be that way. But a few minutes after the start of the tournament, we were down on the court as if we were looking at a ghost.<p>The man was glaring at the court with his deep, stagnant eyes, as if unable to see any emotion in him. He was the point guard, but he controlled everything. Nothing was getting through. Passes were cut off, and no feints were ever caught. I should have been watching the ball, but the next thing I knew, the ball was out of the man’s hands and a pass was being made. There is no preliminary movement, no intention to pass, no sense of anything. The physical strength of the man was like a monster.<p>He crushed our shots without breaking a sweat, and showed not a shred of joy no matter how many goals he scored. Like an emotionless machine, the man was scoring goals without a care in the world. It was clearly abnormal.</p>

<p>But that was not the only thing that was strange. Only the man stood out from the rest of the team. The rest of the team was not so different. There was a chance to win, but our hearts were already broken. The team composition was too distorted. And yet, we were no match for our opponents. We experienced for the first time overwhelming defeat and humiliation.</p><p>What a powerhouse. What is the national championship? I felt ashamed. Unless we beat this man, we would never make it to the nationals. The disappointment of the Senpai who had ended without a fight. My clenched fists trembled and tears welled up in my eyes. I was so frustrated. I had never felt so strongly that I did not want to lose to anyone.</p>

<p>For the first time, I was seriously involved in sports. By that time, I had become captain. To beat him, that became my goal, and not just mine, but our goal as a basketball team.<p>However, he didn’t show up for the final tournament of my junior year, which I went to with a lot of enthusiasm. We were selected to participate in the national tournament, and we made it to the third round before losing. It was a great leap forward, a great advance, a great accomplishment, and the school and the people around us were happy about it.<p>However, there was something smoldering in our basketball team that we couldn’t explain. We had not beaten that man. Even if we made it to the national tournament, what did it matter? We were still losing, and we had lost our chance to beat him again.<p>And then I met him. It was a strange coincidence. It was enough to make me want to believe in fate. By chance, I ended up in the same class as him in high school. He is a funny and interesting guy beyond my imagination.<br>I guess you could call him a maverick, but somehow I couldn’t leave him alone. There were times when I wondered if this was that Yukito Kokonoe.<p>The feeling in my hand. The pass I just made. There was no doubt. It was this man who crushed me that time!<p>Goosebumps rise. My whole body is filled with joy. I wanted to play against him again. I wanted to play together as friends. With this guy, with Yukito Kokonoe. This atmosphere is the same as that time. This man’s play erases everything. The rivalry of the opponent, the cheers, the cheering. At some point, only silence will dominate the place.</p>

<p>I never take my eyes off the ball. And yet, it was as if the ball suddenly appeared in front of me. I panicked. Ito had missed it, but there was nothing he could do. Just like that time, I couldn’t read any emotions or thoughts. It was impossible. The Senpai’s ability will never be able to stop them. Then Yukito mumbled.<p>“Really boring. ……”<p>Yeah, that’s right. It’s boring for you. I didn’t want to lose this opportunity. I wanted to play with this guy for as long as I could. That’s why I—-</p>

<b>[Shiori PoV]</b>

<p>“Then, next round. Play against me, Yukito.”<p>Mihou-kun had declared war on Yuki. How did this happen? Wasn’t Mihou on Yuki’s side? Questions that came and went. But more than that, I was filled with joy to see Yuki standing on the court.<p>He enjoyed street basketball, but I still felt he belonged here.<p>I regret all the things I’ve done. I was the one who ruined Yuki’s future.</p>

<p>I thought Yuki would play basketball when he entered high school. But he chose home coming club.<p>“Hey. How can you work so hard?”<p>That question I had asked only once in the past. Yuki’s answer was surprising. Despite the fact that it seemed like a difficult topic to talk about, Yuki didn’t seem bothered by the question.<p>It was because he had been rejected by his childhood crush. To shake off those feelings. He told me that was why he was devoting himself to it.</p><p>When I confessed my feelings to him, he asked me to wait until the last competition. That must have been the goal Yuki had set for himself. I was sure that after that tournament, Yuki was going to sort out his feelings.</p><p>I ruined that opportunity. Because of me, because of my stupidity.<p>Then, where did the feelings that were inside Yuki, the feelings that he had devoted himself to basketball so much, go?<p>I took away the opportunity for him to move on. Maybe there are still some unorganized feelings left in him. They have remained frozen since that moment.</p>

<p>“Ha? Are you lost in your mind, Kouki? Don’t think you can get away with anything because you’re good-looking.”<p>“It’s boring if we keep playing like this.”<p>“What’s wrong with that? I have plans to go home and hang out with my friends.”<p>“No, you don’t have any friends!”<p>“Oi, oi stop joking around, pl*yboy. I have a beautiful witch named Himiyama”<p>“Is that a …… friend of yours?”<p>“Well, I don’t plan on going there because it’s a danger zone for me.”<p>“Then you don’t have any plans! Don’t get into the M*LF hobby at that age……”</p>

<p>“I’m not popular. Well, I can’t help it if that’s what happens.”<p>” Hmm, I’d like to go around denying it. Well, that’s okay. Anyway, senpai, I’m going to join you from now on. Please, someone take my place. You can’t win if you keep going like this.”<p>“O-oi, don’t just go ahead with your own story. That’s not the way it works!”<p>“It’s impossible for senpai to win if you keep going like this. Please!”<p>“I didn’t expect to be beaten to a pulp by a freshman. I understand. Come on, I’ll take your place.”<p>“Thank you very much.”<p>“Then I’ll go in this side.”<p>“Why does everyone always ignore me?”</p>

<p>“They have noticed you, but they don’t know I exist?”<p>“You are ……? Yeah, inappropriate.”<p>“Why?!”<p>Ito-kun was a rather interesting guy. Kouki looked back at me as if the discussion was over. It was not his usual fresh and handsome smile. It was a ferocious smile. It was filled with a kind of fighting spirit. I was so surprised. Why does this guy go home from school when he has a personality like this?<p>“I’m going to beat you this time, Yukito!”<p>“Were you really that hot-blooded?”<p>“I want to play basketball with you.”<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“But you can—–“<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can live up to your expectations.”<p>Kouki face clouded with sadness and he let out a breath.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then Yukito Kokonoe. If I win this match, I’ll get Shiori Kamishiro!”<p>There was a moment of silence. But the next moment, it was filled with a shout. The person in question, Kamishiro, was the most perplexed of all.<p>“Wa-wa-wa-wa-what do you mean Mihou?!”<p>“Heeh. So Kouki likes Kamishiro. They might be a good match for each other as they are both athletic, beautiful people. At least it’s a lot healthier than hanging around me. No one would complain about this fresh and handsome guy.<p>For that matter, I’m sure even Kamishiro’s best friend, Ren Hasumura-san, would feel at ease.</p>

<p>“I’m happy for you, Kamishiro. Kouki is a good guy.”<p>“……Eh?”<p>“O-oi Yukito! Are you really okay with that?!”<p>“By all means.”<p>For some reason, the refreshingly good-looking guy who had started it all by himself was the most agitated. In this case, I don’t have anything to do with it anymore, do I? Why am I doing this? The rest is up to the two young people.<p>“What’s the point of this game?”<p>“Why, Yukito, why don’t you see it! You really don’t feel anything, do you? Don’t you really feel anything for Kamishiro, or for Suzurikawa, or for the way they’re behaving?”<p>“I don’t know, but you and Kamishiro should get along.”</p>

<p>“Yukito, why are you so determined to reject them?”<p>Rejection? Reject what? Reject who? I still don’t understand what the fresh and handsome guy is saying.<br>Thinking back, both Suzurikawa and Kamishiro had been lying about everything. There was no way I could understand their true intentions. And moreover, it is impossible for me to understand them now.<p>Who am I rejecting? Rather, it’s the opposite. I have always been rejected. My mother, my sister, my childhood friends, my classmates, my senpai. Everyone has rejected me. No one wanted me. There was no place for me anywhere. All they wanted was for me to disappear.</p><p>What was directed at me was always “rejection,” never ” affection”. It wasn’t me who was rejecting them. It should not have been me. I was the one being rejected.<p>–Is that really true? Something whispered in my heart.<p>It wasn’t pity. It is not sympathy, but a confession of love—-.<p>A dull ache attacked me as a headache. It is a familiar feeling, as if something important has been lost, as if a void has opened up a little.<p>Crack, there was another sound as if something had been broken.</p>

<p>Well, whatever!<p>I gave up everything. I didn’t know anything anyway. It was useless to even think about it.<p>Now that I have lost faith in the World Health Organization, I am the man who does not believe in international organizations. In a world where even the United Nations cannot be trusted, what is there to trust in an individual? A world where you can’t even say what you want to say is nothing but poison. What is the point of lying to me? What is the purpose of the lie? There is no answer to that question. I can’t think of a reason. It is foolish to think about whether it is true or false.</p><p>However, it would be the right thing to do to support a classmate’s love life. There is no doubt that Kouki is a good guy. Then, I have only one thing to do.<p>” All right, then, if I win this match, both of you stay out of my life.”<p>“What?”<p>“Yuki, …… what…….”<p>“It’s up to both of you from there on out, but that’s not my problem. Besides, if you don’t get involved with me, you won’t get into all this trouble. Furthermore, I won’t even join the basketball team. All settled now!”</p>

<p>“Wait, why are you so–“<p>“Let’s get on with it.”<p>Now both Kamishiro and the fresh handsome guy will be able to deepen their relationship without worrying about me.<p>“Kokonoe, I’m not going to get involved in that kind of competition.”<p>“I don’t know what’s going on, but if it’s going to be like that, we can’t help you, you know?”<p>The eyes of the alienated look. Yes, these eyes. These are the eyes that should be directed at me. I feel at home when I look into those eyes. I feel at ease. It is as if my existence is being affirmed, or rather, denied. And I don’t want to get involved anymore. It’s the right thing to do for me, a loner in the shadows.</p><p>“Okay then. I’ll do it alone.”<p>“Oi, Kokonoe. Just because you can play doesn’t—-“</p>

<p>“Just rest here.”<p>I start dribbling slowly. The crowd was all puzzled. For me, it was business as usual. For some reason, when I was playing a basketball game, the venue often became quiet before I knew it. I was getting stares from people as if they were looking at something strange, but I didn’t have to worry about it because it was just the same as usual.<p>“Please wait! I’ll join Yuki’s team!”<p>An interesting and powerful voice of Kamishiro echoed on the court.</p>
