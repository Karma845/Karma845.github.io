<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nice to meet you. My name is Leonard D.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, to the readers who have picked up this work, to the editors who were involved in its publication, and to the illustrator, Fuyuki Sensei. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all those who have supported me up to this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been a year since I submitted this work to 『Syosetu』. I am truly happy to be able to publish it as a book in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, this story is about a hero and heroine who are far removed from the royal theme of 『otherworldly fantasy about a sacred sword』. This story started from such an idea, but after a lot of trial and error, I ended up with a hero with a cursed sword and an erotic maid, a unique couple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a great feeling to see the stories that I have been writing, full of anxiety and wondering, [Are these guys really OK?], now published in book form and delivered to you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be very grateful if you would continue to accompany us in the story of the rebellion and battles of Raidorl. Perhaps there will be some great service scenes provided by the erotic maids!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, wishing to all Gods, Buddhas and demons that we will meet again.</span></p>
