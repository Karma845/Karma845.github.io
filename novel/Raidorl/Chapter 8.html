<h3>Chapter 8 - The Beginning of thr Battle.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kingdom of Zain forces in a dense formation with their backs against the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Western Invasion Army of the Arslanian Empire, in a horizontal formation on the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two armies finished their formation at the same time, as if by design, and engaged in a standoff at different heights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom Army soldier looks up at the Imperial Army on the hill as if challenging them. In contrast, the imperial soldiers glare down at the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two armies wait impatiently for their commanders&#8217; instructions, their sweaty hands gripping their weapons tightly.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Royal Army is not moving. They are going to attack us and intercept us in some way, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the enemies lined up below, Barzen sniffed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army is eerily quiet, having made no moves since setting up formation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Go ahead. Come at me.] The voice of the enemy general, Bazel Garst, was clearly audible in Barzen&#8217;s ears as he invited him to join him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well, I will take you up on your offer!　Let us see how you plan to deal with this great army!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First Army, charge!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Barzen&#8217;s instructions, his second-in-command, Safaris, raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「「OOOOOOOOOOO!!!」」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the Imperial troops camped on the hilltop begin to move. The Imperial troops lined up horizontally are surging in like a tsunami, gaining momentum due to the slope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The high conquers the low. This is the basis of warfare!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Zain Royal Army has taken up a square formation with Fort Blaine at its back. The Imperial soldiers, outnumbered, charge side by side, spreading out to envelop the solidified Royal Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial soldiers, who had been moving down the slope with great vigour, attacked the Kingdom Army furiously with the momentum they had gained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking advantage of the slope of the hill, the Imperial troops were coming at them fiercely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The development was just as he had anticipated in advance. Darren, who had been given command of the front line, immediately raised his hand and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spearmen, forward! Intercept the enemy!”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They did not intend to be violently beaten at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Darren&#8217;s command, the soldiers with shields in front quickly retreated to the side, and a new unit of spearmen emerged from the fortress and moved forward.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldier advancing forward holds a four-metre long spear in his hand, nearly twice as long as the lances used by the imperial soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The densely-packed Royal Guards held their long lances outstretched in front of them, creating a defensive wall of sharp lances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-stop! Aaaaahhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cries of the Imperial soldiers roared across the battlefield. The enemy soldiers who charged downhill with the same momentum were skewered by the long spears that suddenly appeared, without any way to do anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial soldiers who tried to stop in a hurry to kill their momentum were also pushed out by the soldiers following them, and suffered the same fate as those who charged first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the military art of the 『Spear Wall』. It is extremely difficult for infantry and cavalry to break through long spears that are tightly packed together. No matter how powerful the Imperial Guard is, we will not be easily broken!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren says with a smile of satisfaction.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army, with its long spears densely packed together, had no room for entry and stood in the way as a wall of spears. The lances used by the Imperial troops could not reach the Royal troops, and the cavalry were skewered with their horses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The momentum from the height difference seems to have had an adverse effect. We have made the first move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Commander Darren! The Imperial Guard is flanking us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re already here? As expected of the Empire,they’re quick to respond&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon receiving the report from his subordinates, Darren quickly glances around and looks to the flanks of his own troops.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial soldiers who had charged from the front had been caught in the crossfire of long spears, but a detachment had already flanked them. They are closing in to pinch the Royal Army from both sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve already predicted that too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Archers, fire!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice echoes from the top of the ramparts, and arrows rain down on the imperial soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrows, fired to protect the Royal Army, originated from Fort Brain, which the Royal Army had at its back.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soldiers lined up on the ramparts, covering fire at the Royal Army, which was positioned to defend the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now! Strike the enemy when they are frightened!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「「 Haaa!!」」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom soldiers thrust their spears at the Imperial soldiers, who had stopped moving due to the covering fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial side, the central continental champion, had the superior number and skill of soldiers, but their strength was halved when they had to be alert to arrows from overhead. There was no way they could break the dense formation of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Guard, which should have charged in with great enthusiasm, was rapidly reduced in numbers, with the few surviving Imperial Guard barely able to crawl to the rear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren exhaled and looked up at the Imperial troops position on the hill.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;The first exchange was won by us. But it was only a part of the enemies that we beat. The battle is just beginning.”　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the『spear wall』 and covering fire from the fort, they succeeded in destroying the advance guard of the Imperial Army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the main Impartial still remained intact on the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army and the Imperial Army. The decisive battle between the two armies was still far away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, using a fortress as a strategic weapon instead of a fortress as a cage&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s Bazel Garst!　And is that his son commanding the front line?　You youngsters are doing it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing the defeat of his own soldiers, Barzen speaks of his admiration for the enemy general in the Imperial Army camp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a disgrace for a commander that his allies have suffered so severely. However, when they are beaten so painfully, a kind of respect springs up from the superior enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being slightly defeated by a commander who is one or two times younger than him, Barzen&#8217;s chest had something of a refreshing feeling apart from regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Grandpa, shall I go after all?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia, who had walked up next to Barzen with a happy expression on her face, tilted her head and asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Princess had been wearing a military uniform earlier, but now she has changed into a blue-silver armour suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The armour, forged from the finest mithril, was only permitted to be worn by royalty and was first-class armour with excellent physical and magical resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hohoho, don&#8217;t be hasty. The war has only just begun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen laughs like an old man to reassure his beloved princess, and strokes his chin and beard with a relaxed hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The enemy is stronger than expected. It’s a painful blow, but it&#8217;s also the best part of warfare. You must stand firm, Your Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then I&#8217;ll just watch from here&#8230;..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia nodded in agreement with Barzen&#8217;s words, but her face showed a somewhat unconvinced colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gaze is directed towards the dead bodies of soldiers lying on the ground around the Royal Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her well-shaped lip ispursed, apparently unable to accept the deaths of her allies as a necessary sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She is a gentle princess. If I could, I would not let her be in a position to stand on a battlefield like this&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Celia Von Arslanian is a person who is loved by everyone with a true heart of gold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had not been chosen by the Holy Sword, she would not be standing in such a bloody place and would be living a life of loving flowers.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘And eventually marry a man from a powerful noble family&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen forgot about the situation and got so lost in such sentimentality that he coughed and held his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Move the damaged First Army to the rear!　The Second Army will surround the enemy unhurriedly and slowly. The Third Army should spread out on the hill and fire its bows to cover the encirclement by the Second Army!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking off the slightest hesitation that had arisen within him, the old general, who had fought many battles in his career, furiously sent out his orders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun shining brilliantly in the sky had only just passed its zenith.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle had only just begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee, that&#8217;s great!　You&#8217;re fighting a good fight against an enemy more than twice your size!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing on the ramparts, watching the battle between the two armies, Raidorl claps his hands in admiration.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel Garst is standing next to Raidorl, watching the battle in a commanding role, while a short distance away is Saara Leifet, who has been left behind as Raidorl&#8217;s escort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no sign of Neimilia, perhaps because he did not bring a maid to the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down from the ramparts, the Royal Army had successfully lured the Imperial Guards into a bitter counterattack. The Royal Army&#8217;s unexpected counterattack, which was thought to be crushed by their numbers and geographical advantage, was a painful sight to behold from above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps there&#8217;s no room for me?　You are the Protector of the Realm. I bow down to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Only in the beginning do they fall for our tricks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The general, who was praised, shook his head with a calm expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The earlier attack was only possible because they didn&#8217;t know what we were up to. I am sure that the enemy general, Gracos Barzen,would be able to quickly regroup.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re praising the enemy general a lot. Is the Imperial commander so superior?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A fierce general in spite of his age. If it weren&#8217;t for the legendary armour of the Holy Sword, men like him would have been called heroes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Garst answers Raidorl’s question with a distant look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The only thing I have over the man is my youth. Had he not been born in the Empire, the Empire&#8217;s territory might have been much smaller than it is now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh &#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s a big deal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a curious smile on his lips, Raidorl turned his attention to the hill where the imperial camp was located.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Raidorl, whose eyesight is better than that of a human being due to the blessing of the Holy Sword, cannot see the enemy general there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, he felt his blood boil just at the thought of an amazing commander there.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shouldn&#8217;t have said that. It&#8217;s my first battle and I&#8217;m strangely excited. It&#8217;s demoralising to get carried away on the battlefield.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As a vassal, I am very proud of you. You are indeed the chosen hero of the Holy Sword, to be more joyful than fearful on the battlefield.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not that big a deal. I’m just a kid who hasn&#8217;t grown out of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl slapped both of his cheeks with a bash, tightened his loose face and turned his attention once more to the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial troops were hit by a painful counter-attack and the First Army was half destroyed, but the rearguard units soon moved forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They did not charge with the momentum of the hill like the First Army, but slowly spread out across the battlefield with their shields raised above their heads to block arrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While using their shields to block covering fire from the fort, they gradually narrow the distance between them and the Royal Army. Behind them, another force is deployed, firing their bows at the Royal Army, which is in a dense formation from the heights of the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He has already found a way to counter-attack. How troublesome, you damned old bastard.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Garst swears with an unusually twisted expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a quick glance at the general, Raidorl was amazed at the quick counter-attack by the Imperial troops.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arrows fired from Fort Blaine at the Imperial soldiers are blocked by shields above their heads, making them less effective. Conversely, arrows are being fired from the hilltop at the Royal troops, which are also blocked by shields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the conditions are still the same, then the difference in numbers is still highlighted in the war situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Army had already surrounded the Royal Army and was attacking from the front, left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to their custom-made long spears, the Royal Army still maintained their good defending, but as time passed, they were pushed to the rear due to the difference in troop strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army has already been pushed to within sight of Fort Blaine and is losing its escape route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It appears that the time for Your Highness to fight has come. Leifet, escort His Highness downstairs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir. Your Highness, this way, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Led by Saara, Raidorl descends inside the fortress walls. As he descends the stairs, he gently reaches for the sword at his waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The holy sword Dáinsleif was repeatedly vibrating in its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let&#8217;s fight them quickly. Cut them down quickly.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The holy sword, which has met its first wielder in two hundred years, is chirping as it strikes its fangs together for the first time in a long time on the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be in a hurry, it will start soon. It&#8217;s my story, our hero story..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness? What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. Shall we get going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl shows his fangs and laughs, shrugging his shoulders at Saara, who has a questioning look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not only the holy sword at his waist that is excited about his first battle. Raidorl is also excited by the battle, his blood boiling with excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s getting tougher…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army clashes with the Imperial Army. Darren Garst, who was in command in the middle of the battle, let out a rough breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, the Royal Army had gained the upper hand by deception, but as time passed, the Imperial Army reeled back and is now being encircled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although covering archers are being fired from the fortress, it is the same for the Imperial Army. Arrows fired by the imperial troops lined up on the hill were raining down on the Royal Army&#8217;s heads, and they were barely defending themselves with shields over their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only logical that the Imperial Army, with its greater numbers, would have the upper hand. The Royal Army was gradually losing numbers and was slowly being driven back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Commander Darren, are you all right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, no problem&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to the words of the knights under his command, Darren strikes down the flying arrows with his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren, the commander, was poised in the rear of the Royal Army, but the enemy attack was already close enough for their archers to reach his spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The right-wing captain, Lucas, has been killed! It is no longer possible to hold the line!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;! I see&#8230;.. Lucas is gone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing of the death of his comrade in arms, Darren&#8217;s brilliant face is distorted with grief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His well-defined face is still beautiful even when tinged with melancholy, and even his subordinates, who were supposed to be of the same sex, couldn&#8217;t help but admire him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if we continue the battle, defeat is inevitable. However, Father has not yet given the order to retreat. We need to stall for a while now&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, ah &#8230;&#8230; ha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong? Are you wounded by any chance&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m fine! I was just thinking about something!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: lmoa, the author change Saara to an unnamed soldier captivate by Darren’s beauty) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He couldn&#8217;t tell Darren that he was admiring his face, and his subordinate pulled a face and waved his hands in the air to cover it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren looks quizzical, but is unable to pursue further with his red-faced subordinate and clutches his sword again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we are destroyed, the kingdom will no longer have the strength to defend Fort Blaine. This is the crucial moment. Just stay on for a little longer&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Darren could finish, the sound of a trumpet echoed high above the battlefield. The high-pitched sound that cut through the air emanated from Fort Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; It appears he has saved our lives. That&#8217;s the signal to retreat”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saved&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When his subordinate asked him with an anxious look in his eyes, Darren returned a troubled, ambiguous smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, it’s up to His Highness Raidorl Zain&#8230;&#8230;we&#8217;re retreating.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! Yes, sir!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren sent out instructions to the soldiers around him and began to retreat backwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind them, at Fort Blaine, the front gate had been opened before they knew it, sucking in the Kingdom soldiers like water flowing into a hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun, which had risen to its zenith, gradually tilted to the west, and the battlefield entered a new phase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five hours after the battle began, a major change appeared on the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army, which had until then remained on their feet with their backs against Fort Blaine, were now retreating back into the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Royal Army is retreating!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep attacking the fortress!　Don&#8217;t let them close the gates!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In pursuit of the retreating Royal Army, the encircling Imperial troops charge into the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, it appears that we have won!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dallas Safaris cheered at the sight of the Imperial soldiers heading for the city gates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“General Barzen, you have led us well!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Umu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the congratulatory words from his second-in-command, Gracos Barzen nodded his head with a somewhat unflattering look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. something wrong, Grandpa?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old general&#8217;s expression darkens as she peers into his face, and Celia asks with a worried look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen realises that he has worried the lovely princess and opens his eyes and taps his own forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, it&#8217;s nothing serious&#8230;&#8230;I just thought it was too quick and easy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Army initially suffered a painful counterattack, but soon reeled them back in and were on the verge of victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army had already retreated inside Fort Blaine. Some Imperial soldiers were holding the gates as they were about to close, while other Imperial soldiers were avalanching into the interior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If things continue as they are, the fortress will be brought down and the Empire will win in no time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Bazel Garst is no fool. He would not be an incompetent general who would take a gamble he could not win. Then why did he venture into the field?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen&#8217;s face fell in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had thought that they had prepared a trump card to take the fight to five minutes in the field, but that trump card has yet to appear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or do they still have time to save their trump card at this stage?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If this continues, we will win.　What&#8217;s the matter? Garst!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha&#8230;&#8230;! General Barzen, look!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The deputy&#8217;s shout made Barzen look up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahead of him, the soldiers who had entered Fort Blaine through the gates were rushing out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers are crawling to escape, even throwing away the victory they could have seized in the next few seconds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A jet-black slashed their backs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s that&#8230;&#8230;is it magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dozens of Imperial soldiers are blown away by a black slash. Barzen&#8217;s eyes widen and he murmurs at the sight of his allied soldiers, who are floating lightly through the air like flower petals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently there are sorcerers in the fortress who were skilled in offensive magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why they had preserved them until now, Barzen doesn&#8217;t know, but surely a high-ranking magician could be a trump card to throw a stone in the war situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. No, Grandpa. That one is different.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness Princess?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia murmured in a hard, nervous voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen looks back with a doubtful face at Celia&#8217;s unusually stern tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess in blue and silver armour has a pallid face and tightly pursed lips. Her small shoulders were shaking slightly, as if she was frightened of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time he had seen Celia, with her picture-perfect naivety, show so much nervousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waaaaaaaaaaa??!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.hm?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen, who had been watching the trembling princess, turned his attention to the fortress in a huff at the screams that cut through the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gates of Fortress Blaine are still open and unbolted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Countless Imperial soldiers had fallen around the gates, and even those soldiers who were safe had moved away from the gates and were pointing their weapons in a frightened manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually,under the watchful eyes of many Imperial soldiers, a man emerges from behind the gates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a young man in black armour. Even the sword he carries in his right hand is jet black, and his figure, painted black, resembles a god of death from folklore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha…!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man quickly swung his right hand. The sword shoots out a slash of miasma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slashes spread out in a circle around the man in black armour, brushing past the bodies of the Imperial soldiers surrounding the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, without a drop of blood spurting out, the soldiers fall and lie on the ground like corpses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not magic,&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s a holy sword. It&#8217;s the same Excalibur as Claíomh Solas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia murmurs in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The eyes of the imperial princess, staring straight at the man in black armour, are shimmering with hostility, elation, awe and fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Claíomh Solas on Celia&#8217;s waist was also emitting pale sparks as if excited in the face of a divine weapon of the same rank that stood in her way as an enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, &#8230; the Kingdom of Zain has one too. One of the twelve holy swords&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t&#8230;..think that&#8217;s the Holy Sword:Excalibur Dáinsleif!? Someone has been chosen for that holy sword whose owner has not been found for two hundred years!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen&#8217;s face contorted and Safaris exclaimed in shock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old warlord sensed that the tide of the battle had turned and the victory that was sure to be his was slipping away from his grasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What an abominable power! The Holy Sword of the Evil Curse!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Out of Barzen&#8217;s line of sight, the man held up the holy sword again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cursed miasma turned into a black tornado that swirled across the battlefield, knocking hundreds of Imperial troops to their deaths in one fell swoop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a nightmarish scene for the imperial army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha….Hahaahahahahah!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the centre of the black tornado that rumbles through the heavens, Raidorl lets out a mad laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around him, the horrific miasma was raging as a frenzied wind. It was a horrifying sight that froze normal soldiers to the core, but Raidorl, who was in the middle of the vortex, felt no fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, he squinted his eyes as if he was comfortable with the torrent of evil power surrounding him, and his lips hung up in a crescent moon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the Holy Sword! This is my power! Hahahaha AHAHAHAHAHA!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A feeling of omnipotence, as if he had become a god or a demon, envelops Raidorl&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An enormous amount of power flows like a tidal wave through the handle in his grip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in response to his master&#8217;s frenzy, the Holy Sword Dáinsleif also intensifies the momentum of its storm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The jet-black slashes from Dáinsleif are filled with a cursed miasma, and the bodies of the Imperial soldiers develop effects such as poison, paralysis and petrification, causing them to fall one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such power&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s not human, he’s a monster!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are we fighting&#8230;&#8230;is that an incarnation of a demon god&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial soldiers, who had narrowly escaped the curse, had forgotten how to flee and were staring at the raging black tornado.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl had just reaped hundreds of soldiers, but there were still thousands of soldiers standing in his way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re outnumbered, so what!　I’ll crush any difference in numbers! I&#8217;ll trample your geographical advantage! If there&#8217;s anyone who can stop me, come out”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the second time Raidorl had drawn the Holy Sword. He felt a surge of power that was greater than the previous time, as if his body had grown accustomed to the power of the holy sword. The overwhelming energy was incomparable to that of when he slaughtered the sub-dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having gained such immense power, Raidorl&#8217;s heart was filled with arrogant confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, Raidorl had devoted five years of his life to fighting in the frontier city and was proud that he had become strong enough to call himself a strong man, and he thought he had already perfected himself as a swordsman.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But&#8230;&#8230;there’s still more!　I hadn&#8217;t reached my true strength!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they scorn it as arrogance, so be it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they insult it as pride, so be it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Raidorl will never let anyone call him weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Betting on this holy sword, betting on Dáinsleif that has chosen him over two hundred years since the first King of Zain, he will no longer be defeated.He will not let anything take away his path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More! Give me more power!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power is increased to the limit with violent destructive impulses. A high-pitched sound like metal being rubbed together returns from the holy sword clutched in his right hand, and the black storm gains even more momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tornado, which grew so huge that it covered the battlefield, was now like a single black dragon ascending to the heavens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One by one, the imperial soldiers who witnessed the spectacle lost the will to fight and collapsed to their knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can&#8217;t win,&#8230;&#8230;we can&#8217;t win against something like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone muttered. These were the words that represented the thoughts of all the Imperial soldiers present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way we can win against such a force beyond human knowledge. It is absurd to even challenge it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Guard&#8217;s bodies are unable to even move as they are eaten away by the winds of the curse that has been cast upon them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deprived of the option of escaping, let alone fighting, the kneeling soldiers felt like sinners awaiting God&#8217;s judgement in heaven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O God, &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the Kingdom soldiers watching the battle behind Raidorl were also kneeling on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they too were bathed in the raging jet-black wind, the power of the Dáinsleif apparently only affects the enemy. The curse had no effect on them at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even without the influence of the curse, they voluntarily knelt down on their knees and folded their hands in prayer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of them was a bearer of supernatural power that could only be a god or a demon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it were an enemy, they would sink into disappointment and despair and have no choice but to lament, just as the imperial soldiers do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder, the agent of God, is not an enemy. They are on their own side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hence, the Kingdom soldiers pray earnestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Be thankful to God that the mad wind is on the kingdom&#8217;s side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Begging that the incarnation of that tyranny would not become an enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They continue to pray earnestly and continuously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaware of these soldiers&#8217; feelings, Raidorl laughed loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much he sprinkled the wind of curses, the power that was still rising was no longer something he was willing to refrain from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How far could he go with this power, Raidorl couldn&#8217;t help but want to test it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cursed sword fighting method【Jörmungandr, the great serpent of the apocalypse】!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl swung his sword forward with an ever-increasing exuberance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The point of the sword was aimed at the Imperial Army&#8217;s position built on the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wind that had been raging around Raidorl became a gigantic slash and tore through the battlefield in accordance with the will of the young man who was the bearer of the holy sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「「「「「AAAAAAAAAAAaaa!?」」」」」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a giant snake opening its mouth and thrusting forward. Countless Imperial soldiers were swallowed up by the black slash that sliced the battlefield in half and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the slashes never lost momentum. With a roaring sound, it tore through the battlefield, advancing straight towards the Empire&#8217;s main camp on top of the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve won&#8230;&#8230;this one, you won&#8217;t be able to prevent it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After unleashing an attack that could have changed even the terrain, Raidorl continued laughing and the edges of his mouth hanging open in victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, just as it looked as if the attack would cut through the Imperial Army&#8217;s ranks, a shadow stood in its way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slender little figure is unreliable compared to the huge black slashes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is like a small boat pushing through a stormy sea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Protect us all! Claíomh Solas!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm….?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The small figure flaps its right hand. Instantly, with a thunderous roar, a flash of lightning flashed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl holds a thin, pale sword in her right hand. The dazzling thunderbolts emitted from it collide head-on with the jet-black slashes that come rushing in like a tsunami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Black and white. The miasma and the lightning were in balance for only a few seconds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon the thunderbolt breaks through the slash and the disastrous cursed wind disappears into a thousand pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230; right, I forgot. I&#8217;m such an idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having been neutralised by a blow that could be described as an all-out attack, Raidorl&#8217;s mind, which was immersed in a feeling of omnipotence, cools down. He quickly sort out the situation and grasp it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that the person chosen by the Holy Sword may gain god-like power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Raidorl is not the only one who has acquired the power of a god. There is at least one more person on this battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;re the Empire’s Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder &#8211; Celia Von Arslanian!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s as far as you can go! I&#8217;ll be your opponent from now on!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl bares his fangs and howls at the appearance of a powerful enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Raidorl, who is clutching Dáinsleif. An angry cry from Celia jumped at him with Claíomh Solas in her hand.</span></p>
