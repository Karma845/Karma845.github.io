<h3>Chapter 5 - The Royal City of Dark Clouds.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few days, Mertina came to the frontier city to visit Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren Garst, Commander of the Thousand Horsemen of the Zain Royal Army, came to the frontier city of Raid. The young general on horseback is followed by a thousand soldiers led by him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh&#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re here already? You move faster than I imagined.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down from the top of the ramparts at the soldiers lined up outside, Raidorl murmured in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They want to welcome  a royalty, albeit exiled. Whether they resorted to gentle or violent measures, Raidorl expected them to come here a little more prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s how cornered our country is, Your Highness&#8230;.. Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing next to Raidorl was Mertina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slave collar is placed around the neck of the neat-looking noblewoman. A thin chain extends from the metal fetters, the end of which is held in Raidorl&#8217;s hand. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The treatment as if she were a dog was too harsh on the Prime Minister&#8217;s daughter, Mertina, but it was too light  of a punishment for the disrespect she had shown towards a royal family by casting a cursed curse on them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our country has been driven into a corner by the imperial invasion, and there is no other way to save it than to put our trust in Your Highness &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You speak with the permission of no one. I never gave you permission to do that, did I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m so sorry&#8230;&#8230;higguuu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s thin body jerked up and she collapsed, losing all her strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her white skin was slightly flushed and a hot gasp escaped from her rosy lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at his former fiancée, who now looks ravishing as if she were in heat, Raidorl&#8217;s lips twisted in mockery.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look pretty good, don&#8217;t you? I wonder what the Prime Minister would look like if he saw you now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s lips quivered slightly at Raidorl&#8217;s taunting and she looked up at the young man in a cowering position. Her upward gaze is not only tinged with resentment at being treated unfairly, but also with a hint of flirtatious lust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina tried to bind Raidorl with a curse, but on the contrary, she was captured and subjected to severe interrogation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina, who claims that the curse was not ordered by the king or the Prime Minister, but by her own decision, was not willing to submit to the interrogation, and as a result, she was treated in a way that was unthinkable for a noblewoman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl was already prepared to return to Royal Capital and confront his brother King, who was imposing his unreasonableness on him. Hence, he is thirsting for information about the king and the Prime Minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, he tortured and interrogated her to gather as much information as possible. Mertina kept her mouth shut like a shellfish and did not divulge any information.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t like my childhood friend, but I respect her for this. I wonder how much loyalty to the country she must have had to grow up to be such a woman’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s personality was the epitome of a selfless and dedicated servant, and Raidorl nodded his head in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of education did the Prime Minister give her to create an iron maiden like her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl would like to avoid returning to his birthplace, which has become hostile territory, without having any information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few setbacks, Raidorl decided to leave Mertina in Neimilia&#8217;s care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mufufu, leave it to me! This Neimilia knows everything a woman cries for! In a week, I will see to it that this girl is trained to be a faithful dog!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Neimilia powerfully slapped Mertina’s chest and placed a series of various curses on her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curse to weaken her spirit.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curse that chip away at her alertness and defiance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curse to make her defenceless against pain and pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, lastly a curse that gives her intense pleasure from exchanging words with and being touched by Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was about a week ago that Neimilia placed the curse on Mertina, who had a strong spirit, began to crack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Human can resist pain, but they cannot resist pleasure or happiness.  No matter how much they are trained to endure torture, that does not change..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mere act of being approached by Raidorl is enough to bring on pleasures close to sexual intercourse, which must be unbearable for a noblewoman who has been forced to live a chaste life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina, whose spirit had been poisoned by a witch&#8217;s curse, had not yet lost her loyalty to her country, but her heart was steadily turning to the side of Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, she has already opened her mouth to some deep information about the Zain Kingdom. Although she has not revealed definitive secrets, she is a far cry from where she was at the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『She still seems to be rebelling, but it&#8217;s only a matter of time. In a little while, you&#8217;ll be killing your parents for master.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Neimiria smiling as she uttered such horrifying things, Raidorl was convinced that [Aa, she&#8217;s a witch after all].</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, the knight came to pick me up as planned, but he really doesn&#8217;t have any hostile intentions towards me, does he?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nkkuu&#8230;&#8230; of course, His Majesty the King has ordered that if His Highness returns to the Royal Capital, he should be politely brought to him. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given permission to open her mouth, Mertina answers Raidorl&#8217;s question, her body shaking with pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And moreover, Darren Garst, the commander, is a man of pure heart&#8230;&#8230;and would never be disrespectful to His Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou…If you&#8217;re asking me to believe you, it&#8217;s too late now. Whoever it is, I don&#8217;t trust anyone under my brother&#8217;s thumb.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a cruel smile on his face, Raidorl looked down at the knight who had stepped forward to the castle gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how pure and clean he was, he must be an enemy to him just because he owed allegiance to his brother King Granard, who had banished him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It doesn&#8217;t matter. Whoever I&#8217;m dealing with, if you&#8217;re hostile to me, I&#8217;ll show no mercy. &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am Darren Garst. By order of His Majesty the King, I have come to receive His Royal Highness the King&#8217;s Brother Raidorl Zain!　Please open the gates for us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaware of Raidorl&#8217;s determination, Darren raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An adventurer waiting at the gate turns to Raidorl and looks at him for instructions. Raidorl nodded and signalled for the gate to be opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren and several knights under his command entered through the open gate. Other cavalrymen were waiting at the gate and did not appear to set foot inside the frontier city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl descends from the ramparts and rides out in front of Darren on his horse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for coming such a long way. I am Raidorl Zain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,&#8230;&#8230;! This, Your Highness, is a long time coming!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On seeing Raidorl, Darren immediately dismounted from his horse and knelt on his knees. The knights under his command soon followed their superior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, they intend to honour him, the king&#8217;s brother. Raidorl looked down at the knights, who were kneeling and face down, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can look up now. Did you say your name is&#8230;&#8230; Darren Garst?　Are you the son of General Bazel Garst?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!　I once came with my father to the royal palace. I&#8217;m glad to see you in such good health. Your Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looked at Darren&#8217;s brilliant physiognomy and searched his memory. It was a long time ago, but he did remember meeting him. He was struck by the fact that he bore no resemblance to his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;..It&#8217;s been a long time, Darren.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren bows deeply again in response to Raidorl&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the attitude of the knight with the face of a nobleman, a sense of reverence for Raidorl was clearly visible. It seems that he is not acting, but really respects him  as a member of the royal family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The treatment as royalty, which had not been directed at him for a long time, made him feel more uncomfortable than happy. Raidorl scratched his head and decided to move on quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough with the greetings, let&#8217;s get down to business. Darren, you&#8217;re here to take me to Royal Capital&#8230;&#8230;That’s not a mistake?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, I have received word from my men that His Highness Raidorl is going to join the battle. Therefore, I am here to welcome you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren gives Raidorl a probing look. Perhaps he doubts whether Raidorl is really going to take part in the war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a natural reaction to have doubts, since a person who has been treated coldly until now has actively offered to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. I keep my promises. It&#8217;s true that my brother and your father have a history with me. But I don&#8217;t want my country to be destroyed either. I will fulfil my duty as a man born into a royal family.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl snickers at Darren&#8217;s concerns and proudly declares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People and subjects respect and are loyal to royalty. Therefore, in return, the royalty must devote themselves to the defence of the country with all their might, body and soul. This is the teaching of my late father, the previous king. For the sake of my beloved father, I will fulfil my duty as a royalthy of Zain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The spirit of His Highness&#8230;&#8230;is truly admirable. As one of your subjects, I will support you, to see that your will is carried through to the end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m looking forward to it. By the way&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looks at Darren, who is holding his hand over his chest, and changes the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can leave any time, but what about Mertina?　Should we take this woman to the Royal Capital too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl glanced behind him. Standing there, was Mertina, who had climbed down from the ramparts and was standing there looking out of place.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lady Mertina&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Darren unintentionally called out her name, Mertina lowered her eyebrows and averted her eyes as if she was troubled. Her eyes were weak and moist for some reason, and her shoulders and knees were shaking slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren was at Mertina’s behaviour, who looked as if she was in agony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been very painful for her to be used in a plot to bring Raidorl to the Royal Capital on her father&#8217;s orders. Darren interpreted Mertina&#8217;s condition in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the fact is that she is enduring the pleasures of the witch&#8217;s curse, but there is no way Darren is aware of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.The disposition of Lady Mertina, the Prime Minister&#8217;s daughter, is not something I can decide on at my own discretion. However, the crime she committed constitutes treason against the royal family. Therefore, no one can blame His Highness Reidor for the way in which Lady Meltina has been dealt with.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. &#8230;&#8230;So it&#8217;s up to me to decide?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl made a slight thoughtful gesture and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I will take custody of Mertina. She may be a traitor, but she is the daughter of the Prime Minister. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find a use for her in due course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren&#8217;s shoulders drop in relief when he realises that the worst possible outcome of Mertina&#8217;s execution has been averted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, I&#8217;ll leave Mertina in the frontier city. She won&#8217;t be of any use in the war anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Raidorl’s words, Mertina&#8217;s beautiful face contorts in a complicated manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Relief at being free from domination, if only for a short while. Loneliness at the departure of the man who taught her the pleasures of womanhood. Anxiety at the prospect of going to the battlefield where Raidorl, who is becoming a bigger part of her day, might die. The mixture of emotions torments Mertina from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m looking forward to your return, Raidorl-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina said this while squeezing her own chest with her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not 『Your Highness』, but 『Raidorl-sama』. Mertina seems surprised at herself for having unintentionally referred to him by his childhood name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s eyes widened at the unexpected surprise. He looks closely at his childhood friend who is slumped in embarrassment, and opens his mouth with a complex expression that is hard to describe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m off&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Tina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Greeted by a thousand cavalrymen, Raidorl Zain climbed into the carriage provided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He left the pioneer city in the hands of the guildmaster Zafis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before he was originally sent to the frontier to become a lord, Zafis and other influential people in the town had ruled the town. It would be possible to run the town well enough without him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that my elder brother or the Prime Minister won&#8217;t make some crazy scheme,&#8230;&#8230;, but I&#8217;d like to believe that they&#8217;re not that stupid’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pioneer cities are responsible for preventing the flow of demons from the jungle in the south of the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they create chaos with the frontier cities, demons would flow into the kingdom and they would be caught between the empire and the demon hordes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although King Granard and his prime minister have banished the Raidorl, there is no doubt that they are trying to protect the country in their own way. They would not go out of their way to harm the pioneer cities and destroy the country.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At any rate,&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s hostile territory from here onwards. I&#8217;ve got to brace myself.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looks out of the carriage window with a leering glare, while his heart once again grows angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young prince, his eyes determined, hears a concerned voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master, is there something bothering you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;It’s nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl responds by waving lightly at the girl in the maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl is about to ride into the lap of his elder brother, who has disinherited him and is accompanied by his only companion, Neimilia. A young man, a holder of the Holy Sword Excalibur, and the witch, dressed as a maid, sit side by side in the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And sitting opposite them is a young knight in a suit of armour. He was Darren Garst, the commander in charge of this unit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you are not feeling well, please tell me at once, your Royal Highness Raidorl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s lips twisted sarcastically at the young knight&#8217;s attempts to see his colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Heh, so you do intend to respect me as royalty, in a manner of speaking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naturally. You are, without doubt, a legitimate royal of the Zain royal bloodline.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee&#8230;..then, you&#8217;ll take my side if I have to fight my brother?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Your Highness, please don&#8217;t say anything improper. Even if it is a joke, not everyone will take it lightly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren frowns and complains bitterly. Raidorl y shrugs his shoulders and scornfully smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll have to forgive me for this level of complaining. I&#8217;ve been discarded as a useless prince and called back for their own reasons. Of course I would have such feelings right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Your Highness. It may be impertinent for me to say this, but His Majesty Granard sincerely hopes that you and His Highness will make peace and stand together against the Empire. I would be grateful if you would take these feelings into account.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Feeling&#8230;I think it&#8217;s a selfish argument but it’s refreshing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl became a Holy Sword holder and got in the way, so Granard banished him to the frontier and cut him down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now he needs the power of the Holy Sword, so he asks for reconciliation without properly asking for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both are for the convenience of the kingdom. Or more accurately,  Granard&#8217;s self-centered convenience.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If they had just left me alone,&#8230;&#8230;then there would have been no quarrel between us’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Milia. Give me some tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl called the maid by a nickname he did not normally call her by, and ordered her to be straightforward. The reason why he does not call her &#8216;Neimilia&#8217; as usual is a measure to prevent Darren from realising that she is one of the 『Witches Of Doom』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The names of the six witches who almost destroyed the world are so well known that they appear in picture books, and anyone with good instincts might recognise them because of her golden eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, under orders from her master, took a water sac and a wooden cup from her bag and began to brew tea in the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please wait a moment while I heat it up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Neimilia clenched the cup of tea in her hands, the liquid inside bubbled up, and soon a mellow aroma rose from the cup along with the steam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it&#8217;s ready. The milk is still &#8230;&#8230; not coming out, so please forgive me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Don&#8217;t put anything extra. Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazing! Is this woman a magician?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise as Neimilia handed Raidorl a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this world, people who can use magic are called sorcerers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that there is only one person in a thousand who has a background in magic, and they are often protected by the state and nobility as valuable human resources.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Magic without chanting&#8230;&#8230;! How did a sorcerer end up on the frontier&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren muttered in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Children of sorcerers are also more likely to inherit their magical backgrounds, and even if they do not serve in the royal court, they will have no trouble finding someone to marry. This is even more so if they can use magic without chanting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the nobility and wealthy merchants are so generous with their marriage proposals, it was hard to understand why so many magicians would go to the trouble of living in a dangerous frontier city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren, who froze in surprise, received a cup of tea from Raidorl with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the matter?　I don&#8217;t remember showing you anything amazing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;. I see what your highness is doing&#8230;but why did His Highness bring her alone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are not more than ten magicians in the court who are skilled enough to use chantless magic. If you have a man of that calibre as your bodyguard, then you don&#8217;t need any other bodyguard, do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren says it while nodding, his honest-looking face tense slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was understood that the maid called Milia was a sorceress of great ability. The question was why Raidorl had revealed this to Darren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;His Highness is warning me, isn&#8217;t he? I have a good sorcerer escorting me by my side. So don&#8217;t pretend to be a fool or do unnecessary things…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, you&#8217;re being too cautious. I don&#8217;t mean anything deep like that. I just wanted a cup of tea because I was thirsty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl smiled and sipped from his cup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren looks bitterly at him, who is drinking the steamy tea while blowing on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren realised inwardly that Raidorl did not trust them. He doesn&#8217;t trust the King &#8211; not even a shred of trust for his own brother, Granard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why he accompanied Darren to the capital is not because he is seriously trying to save the country. He must have some other agenda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren remains silent and mulls in agony. The more he thought about it, the darker his thoughts sank, and he began to anguish as if his guts were filled with lead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not he knew the inner thoughts of the young commander, Raidorl had a calm expression on his face as he sipped on the tea the maid had brewed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uun, after all, tea brewed by Milia is delicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a waste of words. It was worth putting in the special honey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I’m withdrawing my previous statement. What the hell did you put in my drink?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and Neimilia begin to argue in the carriage as if they were a married couple in a comic dialogue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he looked at them, Darren sighed with a headache-inducing expression on his face and slowly shook his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a few days later. Raidorl stepped into the royal capital for the first time in five years as the carriage rocked along.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The streets of the royal city have not changed much from what Raidorl knows. However, the number of people passing in and out of the main streets and the number of stalls lined up on either side of the road had clearly diminished, and the entire capital city seemed to have a somewhat dark shadow over it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s wartime, so it&#8217;s not surprising that the air quality is poor&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s gloomy, the war isn&#8217;t going well, is it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the war had favoured Zain’s, people&#8217;s faces would not be so gloomy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why the faces of the people passing through the town are so sombre must be because they sense, in their own way, that the Kingdom of Zain is being driven into a corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looked out of the carriage window and predicted the war situation in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Kingdom of Zain is  in a desperate situation the king may be forced to recall his brother, who may never want to see his face again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will take his highness straight to the mansion. His highness&#8217;s audience with His Majesty the King will be tomorrow, so please take your time and relax after your journey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The mansion? Aren&#8217;t we going to the royal palace?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Darren&#8217;s explanation, Raidorl&#8217;s eyebrows raised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is a lot going on at the palace, so we have arranged a house in the noble district for His Highness. You may use that residence for the duration of your stay in the capital.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see. I guess my brother doesn&#8217;t trust me at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl clicked his tongue abominably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Raidorl was banished from the royal capital and sent to the frontier, his royal status was not taken away. Therefore, he had always assumed that he would sleep in the royal palace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the elder brother king apparently despises his younger brother to such an extent that he cannot tolerate this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is he afraid that Raidorl will rebel against him and come after him in his sleep, or is it simply that he has no face to show to his brother? Although the reason is not clear, it seems that he does not even want to put him under the same roof as himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not like that by any means&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to cover it up. I&#8217;ve known for five years that my brother hates me because of the Holy Sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl turned his head out of the window and said softly. Darren looks down with a sombre look in his eyes and apologetically shuts his mouth. A long silence enveloped the carriage, with only the rattling of the wheels scratching the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage drove on for a while, and soon came to a section lined with the residences of aristocrats and leading merchants. The number of pedestrians has decreased dramatically, and a quiet, tranquil atmosphere envelops the area instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage continues deeper into the aristocratic district, eventually coming to a stop in front of a particularly large building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have arrived&#8230;&#8230;This is the mansion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren speaks up as if he cannot bear the silence. One of the knights surrounding him dismounts from his horse and opens the carriage door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Darren, who dismounted first, Raidorl and Neimilia step out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh,&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s quite a big mansion, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up at the large mansion standing before him, Raidorl looked in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The house has the appearance of a large nobleman&#8217;s mansion, with a vast garden filled with well-tended plants and seasonal flowers. The chalk walls and blue-painted roof have been carefully cared for and not a speck of dirt can be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If one were to purchase a mansion of this magnitude with money, it might blow a year&#8217;s income in a pioneer city.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see&#8230;&#8230;I can see right through your heart, brother.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up at the grand and opulent mansion, Raidorl guesses what his brother King Granard thinks of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He fears and loathes him and does not want him in the royal palace. But he still wants to use Raidorl’s strength, so he gives him sweet candy canes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The malice of wanting Raidorl to disappear and the calculation of wanting to tame the Excalibur Holder. Granard must be struggling with two conflicting emotions on a balance sheet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope you don&#8217;t mind if I do what I want in this house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. His Majesty has asked that you use it freely.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa,good. I&#8217;ll take your word for it and do as I like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will come back tomorrow to pick his highness up. I beg your pardon then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding back at Darren, who bowed, Raidorl stepped without hesitation into the gateway doorway that the knight had opened. Neimilia follows behind him like a shadow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they disappeared into the house, Darren watched their backs with a look of hope mixed with a strong sense of anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「「 Welcome back, His Majesty’s brother Raidorl Zain! 」」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as they entered the mansion, the butlers and maids, who were queuing at the entrance, all greeted him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oou&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a spectacular sight of sorts to see these very well-bred men and women bowing in unison under their breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time Raidorl saw them was when he was living in the royal palace as a prince, but he had spent a long time in the countryside in the middle of nowhere and was involuntarily overwhelmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master, you must get your act together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?, ah &#8230;&#8230; sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, standing behind him, tugs at the hem of Raidorl&#8217;s jacket. Raidorl regained his composure and cleared his throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that I am the lord of this house, who represents you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is I. Your Royal Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man in a butler&#8217;s uniform with a moustache and moustache advanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is around the age of stepping into his first years. His carefully coiffed hair and beard were dyed a romance grey, and the way he greeted the man, carefully folding his hips, oozed a sincere personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look familiar. I believe you worked at the royal palace five years ago?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it&#8217;s been a long time. My name is Sarawyn, a former attaché of His Majesty Granard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The butler, Sarawyn smiles at Raidorl with a loose-lipped smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His calm and composed mood is the same as it was five years ago. Raidorl remembers the time when he was a child and received sweets from Sarawyn at a tea party held by his brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, yes, it you, Sarawyn. It&#8217;s been a long time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is a pleasure to see you again, your highness. Welcome back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, by the way, &#8230;&#8230;there&#8217;s one thing I need to discuss, or rather tell everyone here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Sarawyn&#8217;s expression turns doubtful, Raidorl smiles with his mouth in the shape of a crescent moon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone here is fired. Now get out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sarawyn&#8217;s expression freezes at the all-too-unexpected words. The other servants in the room behind him begin to rustle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-, is there something wrong with us?　If there are any &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no such thing as a problem. I&#8217;m just asking you to leave because I don&#8217;t need you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncompromisingly, Raidorl refused them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sarawin&#8217;s gaze wanders from side to side in confusion, but he still insists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This house is as large as you can see. I&#8217;m afraid your maid can&#8217;t clean it all by herself. &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not your concern&#8230;.. Let me put it this way. I only trust this maid here. I&#8217;m not going to have anyone else by my side.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You people cannot be trusted. So get out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl says this out loud, Sarawyn&#8217;s face contorts in humiliation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old butler stared at Raidorl and Neimilia resentfully for a while, but eventually sighed as if he had given up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I understand. I will inform His Majesty Granard of this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do so, thank you for your service.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl fluttered and waved his hand. The servants hesitantly looked into Raidorl&#8217;s face as they walked out of the house, Sarawyn in the lead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, when they had all left, he looked back at Neimilia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Check the&#8230;&#8230;Mansion. Every corner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia pinches the hem of her apron dress and reverently returns the acknowledgement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“【Shadow beast: ShadowServant】”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia&#8217;s shadow slowly changes shape to form a human form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shadows are women in maid uniforms. The faces of these maids, which look as if they have been kneaded into darkness, have no eyes or noses and are as smooth as eggs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are not human, of course. They were Neimilia&#8217;s servants, living in the shadows and born from the shadows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Explore the mansion, see if there are any dangerous objects or anyone lurking around. Those who are available, check the supplies in the house. Especially clothing and foodstuffs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『As your will, Mistress』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About ten shadow maids scattered around the mansion with gliding steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since they were created from shadows, they were able to enter every crevice and explore every detail of the mansion. Neimilia nodded with a satisfied look on her face at her servants who were exploring even the crevices that ants can get into.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; then, please rest at ease, master. Please leave all the mundane matters and management of the mansion to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I&#8217;m counting on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you are too excited to sleep, you can call upon me at any time. I will comfort your master with all my might. Mufufufu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl takes one look at Neimilia as if she were an insect crawling out from under a stone, and disappears silently into a suitable room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although her comments are questionable in many ways, Neimilia will be able to manage everything in the spacious mansion without any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rare and precious witch who once nearly destroyed the world has now become a respectable maid.</span></p>
