<h3>Bonus Chapter - Sightseeing in the Royal Capital.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mufufu. Master, does it feel good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia&#8217;s slender fingers slowly caressed his breasts. Two soft bulges pressed against his abdomen, changing shape and rubbing against his fine, silky skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl felt every nerve in his body hypersensitive and aroused to match Neimilia&#8217;s every move. An intense heat arose deep in his chest, breaking out in a blur of sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, you&#8217;re weak here. It&#8217;s so cute that you reacted like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guhh&#8230;.!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A red tongue tickles his neck, sending goosebumps down his spine. Neimilia&#8217;s fingers and tongue are deftly and viciously poking at Raidorl&#8217;s weak points.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What is this situation!? How could this happen?!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While being played with by the hands of a lewd and wild maid, Raidorl lets out a cry of doubt in his heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the darkness of midnight &#8211; the bodies of a man and a woman are violently entwined in bed. The hot gasps and groans that leak out uncontrollably, and the wet sounds that echo sensuously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is this happening to Raidorl and Neimilia?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes back in time to half a day ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> 〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two weeks have passed since the battle between the Kingdom of Zain and the Empire of Arslanian.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The capital, which until a short time ago was enveloped in a funeral-like atmosphere, terrified by the imperial invasion, is now in a festive mood after the threat of the empire was repelled by Raidorl&#8217;s successes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many stalls lined the main street of the capital city, where victory celebrations were held, and housewives with piles of purchased goods and children running around with sweets bought from the stalls in their hands were everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In such a festive capital, Raidorl and Neimilia were walking together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Raidorl was dressed in black as usual, Neimilia  was unusually wearing a white one-piece dress instead of a maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl probably hid his royal status and came here as a normal citizen. To keep a low profile, Neimilia also seems to have changed out of her maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them walking side by side looked like a couple on a date, but Neimilia&#8217;s expression was somehow disatisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu…..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Come on, get yourself in a good mood. Here, I&#8217;ll buy you some sweets.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because&#8230;&#8230;Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl hands Neimilia, who is looking puffy, a candy bar from a stall. Neimilia accepted the candy bar and glared at Raidorl, her golden eyes glinting with resentment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had heard that I was going to give me a reward, so I thought Master was going to give me some crazy climax play&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s a scam that we&#8217;re going out together!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, you&#8217;re so unhappy with this date?　You say hurtful things.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, they were out on a 『reward date』 to reward the erotic maid for her work in the war. However, Neimilia did not like the reward and has been in a bad mood since morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about!  I&#8217;m very happy to have a date with Master! But&#8230;&#8230;dates are for two people, aren&#8217;t they!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! What are you eating, Onii–san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia is venting her frustration, and Raidorl trying to appease her. A third companion, who had been a short distance away, rushed up to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The identity of the girl in the simple disguise of a plain one-piece dress and a hat is Celia Von Arslanian. She is the Imperial Princess held as a prisoner of war inside Raidorl’s mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Raidorl, Celia is a holder of the Holy Sword:Excalibur, but today she is not holding Claíomh Solas, and her beautiful blonde hair is tied up on her head and hidden in her hat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Here&#8217;s some candy I bought in the shop there&#8230;..and you can try some too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmm&#8230;..so sweet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl shared his candy into Celia&#8217;s mouth, the beautiful princess opened her eyes in astonishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this, it looks like an apple but it&#8217;s coated on the surface like bee honey&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve never tasted a pastry like this before!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re an exaggerator, aren&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s not a rare pastry, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl curiously asked Celia, who was sucking on the candy handed to her as if she was impressed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I used to eat cookies and pancakes in the castle, but I&#8217;ve never had sweets like these!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a commoner&#8217;s pastry, so maybe they don&#8217;t serve it at the royal palace. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re enjoying your sightseeing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was first taken out of the mansion, Celia was very wary of going out with the man who had defeated her and taken the power of the Holy Sword from her. However, as they toured the festive streets of the town, her mood had completely recovered and she was looking around with a twinkle in her eye, full of curiosity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mwah&#8230;..you&#8217;re all over Celia! This is not a date!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia voiced her dissatisfaction at Raidorl and Ceilia’s exchange, which could have been seen as a lover&#8217;s exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t be helped. We can&#8217;t just leave a prisoner of war alone in the Mansion, no matter how many hostages we take to prevent them from escaping.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia&#8217;s stay at Raidorl’s mansion is a strong point until the negotiations with the Empire are concluded. No matter how much he had sealed the power of the Holy Sword and held the old general Gracos Barzen, who was close to Celia, he could not just leave her alone and go out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a natural decision for Raidorl to bring Celia, but it was something that Neimilia could not accept, having been interrupted on a date alone with him.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;.. sorry, Neimilia–san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing the disgruntled maid, Celia stops herself from eating the candy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all, it would annoy you if I followed you too, right? I didn&#8217;t mean to disturb you&#8230;&#8230;Sorry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia bows her head apologetically. Neimilia was surprised after the unexpected apology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not your fault, Celia, but&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry too. I&#8217;m sorry for sulking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Neimilia bows her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Excalibur Holder『Thunder』, and the Witch of 『Darkness』. They were in completely different positions, but surprisingly, they did not seem to be incompatible. Although they had only lived together for a few days, they never fought in the mansion.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, Neimilia was gentle and brought no harm to Raidorl, and did not like conflict, despite being a witch. Celia was an innocent person with no malicious intent and did not care about the difference in their positions. It is perhaps natural for the two girls to become close in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia did not respond to the name 『Neimilia』, so it is possible that she did not know much about the 『Six Witches of Doom』 in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mumu&#8230;&#8230;Celia–san has unexpected good qualities. If this happens, you might as well put master between your legs and have a sampi&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Stop it. If you do something funny to Her Imperial Highness, it will become an international problem and war will resume.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After rebuking Neimilia, who is plotting an ill-conceived ambition, Raidorl takes them through the noisy boulevard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl used to explore the capital as a child on 『adventures』, but the town has not changed in five years. There were nostalgic buildings in places, and he felt once again that he had returned to his birthplace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oya! Isn&#8217;t that Prince Raidorl!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the residents of the street noticed Raidorl&#8217;s figure as he was walking, and called out to him. She was a middle-aged woman in her fifties.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re&#8230;&#8230; the landlady lady of the general store?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was so glad you remembered me! You&#8217;ve grown up so much!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman takes Raidorl&#8217;s hand and squeezes it, saying in an easygoing tone for dealing with royalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Five years ago, you suddenly disappeared from the capital, and I was always worried about your safety!　I&#8217;m so glad you’re still alive!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, &#8230;&#8230; I see. I&#8217;m glad you are doing well too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl speaks from the heart as he recalls his childhood memories. The woman in front of him had seen Raidorl many times when he was a child, when he had escaped from the castle. She had once sheltered him in a shop in order to disperse his pursuers who had come to bring him back from the royal palace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His Highness Raidorl?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oou! The hero of the Kingdom is here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people began to gather around Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, hero! You saved this country!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected, you are the hero of the Holy Sword!　Come on, eat some meat from our shop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have alcohol too! Come on, come on, you girls, have a drink too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crowd of people gather around them and one after another food, drinks and sweets are forced into their hands. Raidorl&#8217;s face is slightly scrunched up, but he accepts the food without refusal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, he had intended to come here without notice. He had disappeared from the capital for five years, so he had not worn any disguise, thinking that if he met someone he knew, they would not recognise him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Raidorl&#8217;s silver-haired, red-eyed features left a bigger impression on the residents of Royal Capital than he thought, so it was no longer enough to fool despite the fact that he had grown a little taller and his face had become sharper.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Ne–chan are so lovely!　Are you his highness&#8217;s girlfriends?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh….I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Drink this fruit water! It goes well with the fish dishes over here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The food and drinks were gathered one after another, even in the hands of Celia, who seemed unable to say that she was the imperial princess of an enemy country. But still Celia accepts wholeheartedly despite her puzzled expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Yareyare. It&#8217;s a hassle to hold these gifts together. Neimilia.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Master【Shadow Curtain】.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia activates a magic to hide herself from the wave of people who have finally gathered, then a curtain of darkness enveloped the three of them, blocking their view of their surroundings.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha happened? It&#8217;s suddenly dark!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, follow me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyah&#8230;&#8230;Onii–san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl holds Celia&#8217;s shoulders, her hands full of food, and quickly slips between the gathered people. Neimilia follows them like a shadow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Yareyare..that was a lot of trouble. It&#8217;s not easy being famous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve become a people pleaser. There were so many people, I thought the master would be turned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl speaks jokingly and Neimilia replies with obscenities. Against the two with a fond tone of voice, Celia looks down at the food she has been given, her expression somewhat darkened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew I should have at least worn a disguise. I was completely caught off guard. Well,&#8230;&#8230;now that we&#8217;re in a quiet place, let&#8217;s eat what we got here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ne, Onii–san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.something wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sat on the ground and finally noticed Celia with a sombre expression on her face. The imperial princess, who should have been excited about her first visit to the royal city, now had a thoughtful look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those people earlier were incredibly happy, weren&#8217;t they? That my&#8230;&#8230;imperial invasion failed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;..that would be, wouldn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl nodded his head, seeing the cause of the clouded expression on the beautiful princess&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For them, the Kingdom of Zain is their birthplace. They must be very happy to have won, since it was almost destroyed by the enemy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia sits on the ground and places the food that had been blocking her hands on her knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought what the empire was fighting for is right. I thought that if the Empire united the continent, there would be no more wars in the world and everyone would live in peace. But when I saw&#8230;..those people, I felt lost. Did we really do the right thing?　Did we make everyone happy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;ve got childish worries. You&#8217;re going to make me feel stupid, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia blinks repeatedly in response to Raidorl’s dismissive words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no absolute justice from anyone&#8217;s eyes. There is imperial justice for the empire, and there is kingdom justice for the kingdom. Know those two are incompatible and that&#8217;s why we had to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl does not necessarily believe that the empire is on the wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The empire&#8217;s aim is peace &#8211; the unification of all regions and peoples by an overwhelming strength to end the war. The rule of the strong over the weak is far more realistic than the ideal of the weak, and will serve as a deterrent to end conflict rather than a talking point for peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the Kingdom of Zain fought off the imperial invasion thanks to Raidorl&#8217;s successes, thinking about the future ten or even a hundred years down the road, a more peaceful future might have been waiting for them if they had just given in meekly and quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not protesting against the Empire because its ways are wrong. But I have my own non-negotiable 『path』. So I took up the sword and fought so that my path would not be crushed. It&#8217;s not that one of us is right and one of us is wrong. We fought to stick to our beliefs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beliefs….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia repeats Raidorl&#8217;s words. Raidorl doesn&#8217;t know how much of what he was trying to say was understood, but it seems that his feelings were conveyed. Celia’s are flickering with a different kind of thoughtful colour than hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Onii–san, I still want the Empire to unite the world. But I also don&#8217;t want to make the people who shared my food and sweets sad. Is it selfish of me to want to have both?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia looks up and asks. Raidorl snickers, [Ha!] and grabs a piece of baked bread on Celia&#8217;s lap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s certainly demanding a lot of selfishness to protect both the Empire and the Kingdom! But if&#8230;.that&#8217;s the path you want to follow, then I guess you can call it complete, total and utter justice,right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If your righteousness overlaps with my path, I will help you. If it gets in the way, I&#8217;ll crush it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl tosses the baked pastry into the air and catches it into his mouth. He savours the savoury texture with a crunching sound, and then gulps down a swallow. At the same time, Neimilia, sitting next to him, offers him a drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My path is the same as the Master&#8217;s. Because that&#8217;s what feels best! You can be honest about your desires, Celia–san, and do whatever play you want, and fuck as much as you want!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. You, you really like to ruin a lot of things,do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl accepts the drink with a look of dismay and gulps it down his throat. Neimilia smiles and caress Raidorl&#8217;s thigh with a suspicious hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia blurted out unintentionall. The two of them were on good terms with each other and seeing the two of them together made her own worries seem insignificant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it&#8217;s not me to dither and fret! I help everyone who wants to help me, and I kill all the bad people!　That was my justice! Thanks for listening to me, Onii–san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad you found it helpful. I&#8217;m using you as a hostage too, so this is a small price to pay for such advice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ceilia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not 『you』, my name is 『Ceilia』. You know that, don&#8217;t you, brother?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Celia wanted to be called by her name. When Ceilia peeks into his face with a cute tilt of her head, Raidorl is silent, as if frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he thinks about it, with the exception of Mertina, a young familiar face, and Neimilia, a maid, he may rarely have called a woman of his age by her first name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it would not be mature to make an outright rejection here. Raidorl reluctantly opens his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah &#8230;..once again, please take care of me from now on. Celia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un! I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you too, Onii–san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Celia smiles like a flower, Raidorl becomes embarrassed and turns away from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..You are really a shinning gem. Celia-san &#8211; you&#8217;re going to be someone I can write as 『strong rival』 and call 『best friend』!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Raidorl, Neimilia clenches her fist in a tight fist. The dark-haired maid&#8217;s eyes were burning with a mysterious fighting spirit and she was clearly looking ahead to a future battle of the women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then,&#8230;..I think I&#8217;ll ask you to accompany me one last time to one last place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After having lunch with food given to them by the residents of Royal Capital, Raidorl tells the two women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl procures a couple of horses from a stable and drives them through the city gates and out of the capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He thought he might get into trouble at the gates because he was trying to get the captive princess out of the city, but to his surprise, he was able to get out without being harmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the soldiers guarding the gates of the castle were taking part in the battle of Fort Blaine. Instead of stopping him, he was asked to shake their hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl was leading the horse, with Neimilia hugging him tightly on his back. The other horse was straddled by Celia, who had changed into riding clothes and was controlling the reins with a familiar hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re good! Who taught you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I learned it from the knights at the castle!　I love to ride horses!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and Celia rode their horses competitively through the streets of the northern part of the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky is clear and blue, and the horses are as light as flying through the air, as they advance through the wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After an hour&#8217;s ride, they arrived at their destination. It was on a small mountain north of the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waa…..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dismounting from her horse and looking at the landscape ahead, Celia let out an exclamation of admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the small mountain, she can see the road stretching northwards and the port town at the end of the road. And the blue sea stretching further out can be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the sea, isn&#8217;t it! It’s beautiful&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good thing the weather&#8217;s nice. You can&#8217;t see much when it&#8217;s cloudy&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl also dismounted from his horse and extended his hand to Neimilia, who was riding behind him. There was no way that the Witch of Darkness could not dismount from her horse by herself, but Neimilia deliberately [Eii!] and hugged Raidorl&#8217;s body. The way she pressed her breasts against her master&#8217;s face when hugging him was very rough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this where the master wanted to come? Sure, the view is nice, but it&#8217;s just the sea, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?　Isn&#8217;t it soooo beautiful!　Can&#8217;t you see it, Neimilia?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can see it, but&#8230;&#8230;haven&#8217;t you ever seen the sea, Ceilia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Neimilia asked, Celia nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Empire has oceans, but I&#8217;ve only been to the imperial capital and around it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so you&#8217;re a young lady in a box.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl chuckles and explores the grass around him. Celia tilts her head at Raidorl, who has his back to the view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii–san what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I was just looking for something&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl searched for a rectangular stone that had collapsed in the overgrown grass. On closer inspection, the stone was inscribed with words, indicating that it was a stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it &#8230;&#8230; someone&#8217;s grave?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not a grave, but&#8230;.well, it&#8217;s something similar.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl brushes away the soil covering the surface of the stone monument, the inscriptions become faintly legible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I wish for peace for my wife, Leithia. Bernard』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leithia. Bernard?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My parents. I mean, the previous king and queen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In answer to Celia, who peeked out from behind him back, Raidorl raised the fallen stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s see&#8230;Can&#8217;t I just ask what this is or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing that this is a sensitive topic, Celia asks fearfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not a big deal. It&#8217;s not important enough to keep it a secret.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl shrugged and briefly explained the origin of the monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s mother &#8211; Leithia Zain &#8211; was a foreigner who had married into the family from a country in the north of the continent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her relationship with her father, Bernard Zain, was good, but even so, Leithia sometimes felt nostalgic and missed her homeland in the far north.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At such times, the previous king, Bernard, used to visit this mountain with his wife and comfort Leithia by showing her the northern sea, which was connected to her homeland.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monument was placed by Bernard when Leithia died of illness. Bernard would occasionally visit the site with his children to remember the late queen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After my father fell ill, me and my brother used to do the occasional cleaning and stuff&#8230;&#8230;Apparently, it&#8217;s been neglected ever since I was banished to the frontier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the place of memories of his father and mother in ruins &#8211; what kind of state of mind did Granard really have? Was he simply too busy with his work as acting king? Or did he feel guilty about his brother&#8217;s exile, and therefore had no face to show to his mother?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how I feel. I&#8217;m just saying what kind of face I&#8217;m supposed to come here with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl pouted as he stroked the dirty stone monument with his fingertips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl already has an acrimonious relationship with his brother King, and they will eventually clash in earnest over the throne.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even his parents must not want the siblings to fight. When Raidorl thinks about it, he feels sorry for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;I&#8217;m also a man. Once I&#8217;ve made up my mind, I can&#8217;t easily bend it. If one day I go over there, I&#8217;ll get down on my knees or whatever, so please forgive me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia was listening to Raidorl&#8217;s monologue, she silently knelt down on the spot and pulled out the weeds. Soon after, Celia did the same, cleaning up around the monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, you guys?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If this is where the master&#8217;s mother is, it must be well looked after!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes!　I can at least do the weed! Don&#8217;t underestimate my princess upbringing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them neatly arranged themselves around the stone monument, not minding that their clothes were dirty. Raidorl chuckled involuntarily and sat down on the spot to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> 〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the sightseeing tour of the royal capital by Raidorl and the two women was successfully completed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia was given a 『reward』 in the form of a date for her active role in the battle, and she succeeded in closing the distance between her and Celia, who was supposed to be a prisoner of war. If Raidorl only looks at the results, he can call it a great success.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However &#8211; the day was not yet over. The night had only just begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guu&#8230;..gaaa&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mufufufu&#8230;&#8230; It seems that the medicine is working!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia said to Raidorl, who was lying on a bed in the mansion and groaning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all, I&#8217;m not rewarded with just a date!　I&#8217;m going to have to have Master for my evening meal!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne–Neimilia! You can&#8217;t possibly have poisoned&#8230;.the dinner! There&#8217;s no such thing as poison that works on me&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s body was immune to any kind of poison, thanks to the blessing of the holy sword. He therefore ate the food without alarm, but tonight he was suffering from unidentified fever and intoxication, and was extremely agitated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master was served turtle meat, snake snake&#8217;s live blood, bear&#8217;s testicles, nourishing liquor and medicinal herbs&#8230;..all of which have energising properties! They are all medicines, not poisons! Apparently, even the blessings of the Holy Sword can&#8217;t neutralise foodstuffs that only energise the body!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ggh &#8230;&#8230; I didn&#8217;t think there was such a loophole&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl murmurs with a shiver. It is true that his body is surprisingly healthy, especially his 『certain parts』 are more robust than ever. He has become so energetic that he can hardly move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, let&#8217;s make tonight a super night! I&#8217;ve got some great toys for you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her hands, gasping with excitement, Neimilia holds a wax candle, a whip and an unnamed toy that is instantly recognisable as having been designed for obscene purposes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of special play sacrifice could Raidorl be in? Raidorl&#8217;s face scrunched up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait, wait! What the hell are you doing to me? We’ve got Celia in this house!　You should be ashamed of yourself!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, then there&#8217;s nothing to worry about. If it&#8217;s Celia, she&#8217;s probably in the next room listening in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Neimilia said this, a rattling sound of things falling over could be heard from the next room, and a high-pitched scream of [Kya-Kyaa] could be heard. It seems that the imperial princess, who had been caught eavesdropping, panicked and fell down in her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it bothers you so much, why don&#8217;t you just mix it up with us&#8230;..Celia is too modest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W–where…I&#8217;m just afraid of adolescence &#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now&#8230;..let’s leave the little one alone and let&#8217;s have an adulterous time from here, shall we? Master, I will take you to heaven soon!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She takes off her clothes in mid-air and Neimilia jumps on Raidorl like a lioness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The drug-induced arousal has left Raidorl unable to move, and she is helplessly embraced by the perverted erotic maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the brief holiday of Raidorl and his friends comes to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A hero chosen by the Holy Sword and a witch who falls in love with the hero who is supposed to be her enemy. The Imperial Princess the Maiden of the Holy Sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The road ahead for these three people with their strange fates will no doubt be filled with fierce battles, but it is a night of fuss and commotion that gives no hint of such dark clouds in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bonus: &#8216;The hunter and the hunted&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A frontier city in the south of the Kingdom of Zain. The 『Demon Forest』 spread out around it. The jungle is inhabited by a wide variety of demons, some of which have an intelligence close to that of humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Gururururu….It looks like the monster is dead』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A white-haired wolf standing on two legs &#8211; a demon called Wise Wolf &#8211; muttered in a language only understood by its own kind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wise Wolves are highly intelligent. Although they could not speak human languages, they spoke their own language and hunted in packs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Is the child alone? Could be a trap.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wolf, the leader of the pack, looked at a lone boy. It was clearly an unnatural sight to see a child walking alone in the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader signals his companions to search the surroundings. But there is no other figure hiding. It was not a decoy, but the boy was really all alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Did that stupid child sneak into the forest? It&#8217;s a cuckoo food!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wise wolves are smart and only attack prey in situations where they can be sure of a kill. The boy has already invaded their territory. Other wolves were hiding in the shadows of the trees, waiting for their leader to give the signal to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy in front of them is clearly easy prey to hunt. There was no reason not to attack him. The leader raised his right hand and howled loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Such Foolishness』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Gaaaaaaaaah!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On cue, the wolves that had been hiding jumped out on masse. They were clearly overstrength to hunt a child, but it was the hunt of the Wise Wolves to stay on their guard and hit them with all their strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I want you dead! You stupid human!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pack leader also took off. Ten wolves attack the poor boy. The boy&#8217;s end is clear. In the next instant, the trees in the forest will be stained with blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sword Fighting Method–【Medusa, stone-eyed goddess】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then something unexpected happened for the wolves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the boy lightly swung his sword, a black hemispherical dome appeared. One after another, the wolves who jumped into the dome turned to stone and crashed to the ground. Their pack leaders were also in the same condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Wh–what happen! We weren&#8217;t careful enoug&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm &#8230;&#8230;You’ve been killed. Boring.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy smirks at the fallen wolf and sheaths his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard they were attacking all the fledgling adventurers one after the other&#8230;..but it was surprisingly easy. Still, it was at least a test slash for the Sword Fighting Method.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wise Wolf was mistaken. They were not the hunters, but the prey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a day in the life of Raidorl Zain &#8211; the man who would later become a hero &#8211; when he was fifteen years old.</span></p>
