<h3>Chapter 3 - Guest from Royal Capital.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;. morning already&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two months after the Catastro Orc attack, Raidorl woke up in his mansion in the frontier city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frowning at the sunlight streaming in through the cracks in the curtains, Raidorl turns over in bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl Zain, second prince of the Kingdom of Zain. As the lord of the development city of Raid, his life is anything but luxurious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mansion in which Raidorl lives is too modest for a lord, being only slightly larger than a typical house in a frontier city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Zafis came uninvited and with a bottle of liquor in his hand, it is difficult to find a place to put his master, who is sleeping soundly after a heavy drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s morning already, is it? Sleepy master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uootoo!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a woman&#8217;s voice echoed in the room,Raidorl involuntarily raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looks from side to side, looking for the owner of the voice, but no one is in the room except for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t tell me&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, suddenly aware of the weight he felt on his body, he rolled up the duvet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, as expected. The figure of a dark-haired girl was there, closely adhering to the upper-body naked Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, good morning. Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning &#8230;..— what are you doing?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to do a little morning service for you and&#8230;.. fuggyaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl kicked the girl off the bed with the duvet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl rolled on the floor and struggled to drown under the duvet that was covering her body, but she eventually bounced off the duvet and emerged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mooou! What are you doing all of a sudden!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl in a maid&#8217;s outfit with glossy black hair flowing down her back emerged from the duvet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s name was Neimilia. She is the only servant working in the mansion where Raidorl resides.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pale-skinned and with a young face, Neimilia had the appearance of an elaborate doll at first glance. Her black hair, like crow&#8217;s feathers, and her golden eyes, shining like a full moon, are striking and attract the eyes of men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her attractive look would have captivated many a man if she&#8217;d just sat back and kept quiet,&#8230;&#8230; but her employer, Raidorl, knew in his bones that it was only her appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you &#8230;&#8230; doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well I was going to do [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nani’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to do now, is to make suck off master&#8217;s with my mouth. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ナニ if you katakana it and Noun, means penis)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, you don&#8217;t have to say it, shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, when she opens her mouth, all the innuendos come out without a care in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vulgarities that emanate from the mouth of a girl as pretty as a flower have always annoyed Raidorl.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, in a pioneer city full of adventurers and ruffians, maids like her who do the household chores are extremely rare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to a certain situation she was facing, Raidorl was unable to kick her out and continued to employ her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Neimilia is the only person living in this house, which is supposed to be a lord&#8217;s mansion, apart from him. Therefore, Neimilia is recognised as Raidorl&#8217;s mistress by the people of the pioneer city, which is also a headache for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(go,go Neimilia)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, enough of this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna change, and you are going to get the hell out of here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, and I can help you. I&#8217;ll take you by the hand, from good morning to good night. &#8230;..Mefufu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just get out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl frowned and chased the girl in the maid&#8217;s uniform out of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick glance at the clock shows that the time is already ten o&#8217;clock. It was a little late to call it a morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Raidorl was a lord, financial and military affairs were left to the commercial and adventurers&#8217; guilds, which had been operating since before Raidorl became lord of the town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl’s job is to follow up on their decisions. And the only thing he does is to stand on arrows and masks in negotiations with the outside nobility and leading merchants.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, his life was irregular and no one could fault him for sleeping until close to noon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuah&#8230;..so sleepy&#8230;&#8230; How shall I spend my day?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl ponders as he changes his underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no particular lordly task, and he had no business to meet anyone. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Should I go and thin out the demons in the frontier?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the frontier demons were an important source of funding for the frontier cities, as they were all rare materials. The more demons Raydor hunted, the more money would be available for the operation of the frontier city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mefufu,Meifufu&#8230;&#8230; master&#8217;s fresh clothes. &#8230;&#8230; This is going to be a lot of work”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. so what are you doing?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Raidorl was getting dressed thinking about his plans for the day, his eyes met a gaze staring at him from behind the door. It was the erotic maid, as it should be, without daring to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glaring back at the cat-like eyes staring at him through the door, Raidorl presses his forehead to stave off a headache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I&#8217;m so sorry. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m just so&#8230;&#8230; amazed by master&#8217;s tasty muscles.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right. I know what I’m going to do today. I&#8217;ll go to the hardware store today and buy a padlock. From today onwards you&#8217;re not allowed in my room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeh! No, no, no,! I&#8217;ve have business to be here!　I didn&#8217;t come here just to peek!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia argued in a panicked manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Half-liddedly looking into her teary golden eyes, Raidorl gives a single click of his tongue.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then get on with your business. If it&#8217;s not a big deal, I won&#8217;t agree to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu&#8230;&#8230;Master is a sadist&#8230;&#8230;! We have a visitor at the door now!　It seems they have come from the Royal Capital to inquire about master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From Royal Capital&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, from Royal Capital. They certainly said so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s brows furrowed and his expression contorted as if he had eaten a poisonous herb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since his banishment to the frontier, he has been absent from the royal capital affairs. No matter how many letters of explanation he sent out, no matter how much he asked for help from those he had befriended, he never received a reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl finally decided he had no intention of getting involved again, but why would they come to visit him after all this time?</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Okay, I&#8217;ll meet them. Keep them waiting in the parlour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, Master. Oh, should I contact Zafis-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Yes. That would be better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is hard to imagine what business a emissary from Royal Capital would have, but there is no doubt that it would be a troublesome matter. Zafis, who is supposed to be Raidorl&#8217;s guardian, would probably be able to smooth things out when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Are they trying to force me to do something nasty? Or is it, after all this time, that brother wants a reconciliation? Either way, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be a depressing matter.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling a smouldering fire deep inside, Raidorl held his chest as if scratching it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it the fire of hatred towards those who betrayed him, or was it the fire of a fighting spirit that sensed the signs of battle that awaited him in the future?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm-hmm, the master is motivated. And down there, too, you&#8217;ve become so energetic&#8230;..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just get on with it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl shouted at the maid, who was drooling at the entrance to the room, and covered his skin with his jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   〇　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having changed into his formal clothes to meet a guest from the royal capital, Raidorl headed for the parlour with Neimilia in tow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was called a parlour, it was a small house that was rarely visited by guests. The living room had been hastily tidied up and made up as a parlour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Raidorl opened the door, the guests who had already entered the room bowed their heads and gave him dusty greetings</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It has been a long time. His Majesty’s brother, Raidorl Zain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re&#8230;.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl froze in his stance as he stepped into the room and his eyes widened to the limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had thought of several familiar faces when he heard that the guest was from Royal Capital, but what he found there was someone he had not expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the room, a woman in a clean-looking light blue dress stood without sitting on a chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long purplish hair cascading down her back. She had long, slender arms and legs, and a sculpted, beautiful face with a well-defined nose. Her calm and gentle expression still retains traces from her childhood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Raidorl wanted to forget, he could never forget, her name is Mertina Marcell. The only daughter of Lockwood Marcell, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Zain, she was his childhood friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I didn&#8217;t expect you to come. How could a daughter of the Prime Minister come all the way to the countryside?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reuniting with the woman who would have been his wife if he had not been chosen by the Holy Sword, and who had so easily abandoned him when he was banished to the frontier, Raidorl&#8217;s voice naturally turned grim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He exhales heavily to calm his rising emotions, while desperately holding back his right hand from reaching for the sword he has placed at his waist, just in case.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I’m glad to see you&#8217;re breathing well, My childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can&#8217;t you call me &#8216;Tina&#8217; like you used to, Your Highness?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..What on earth brings you all the way from the royal capital to this remote region?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring his childhood friend&#8217;s words, he sat down on the sofa, and Raidorl scooted over with his chin and invited Meltina to sit down as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina lets out a short sigh and sits down on the sofa opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind her are two knights who appear to be her bodyguards. Both knights are dressed in high-end white armour and have ornate swords at their waists.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, behind Raidorl, there is only one maid. Not even one of the guards is besides him. It is difficult to tell which of them is royalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s gaze turns to Neimilia, who is standing behind Raidorl, and her eyes narrow slightly. Perhaps she is suspicious that a mere servant is present at a conversation between a royal and a duchess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Raidorl also does not encourage his maid to leave the room. No matter how offended Mertina is, it is something that Raidorl did not feel like a pain or an itch.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ve changed &#8230;&#8230; and so has this woman’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looks at Mertina sitting on the sofa and murmurs to himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After five years on the frontier, Raidorl, once a mere child, has grown into a first-class swordsman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that he was not the only one who grew up. Mertina, too, has changed so much over the past five years that she is no longer the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face, which had originally been that of a lovely, gentle pretty girl, has completely transformed into that of a grown-up adult woman. Her high nose, full lips and large almond-shaped eyes were surprisingly attractive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body from the neck down has also changed to that of an adult woman, especially the two fruits on her chest, which are so rich that they are raw and spiteful.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaa, damn it!　How the hell did you turn out to be such a good woman!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl chewed on his back teeth and swore heartily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who once abandoned him has grown into a ridiculously attractive woman. That was frustrating to me. The fact that he had aroused even the slightest lust for a woman he should have hated with all his heart even seemed like an indelible stain on his life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..We&#8217;ve both changed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, five years is a surprisingly long time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl mumbled in a terse tone, careful not to let his frustration go unnoticed. Mertina also responds in an emotionless voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two childhood friends looked at each other silently for a while, and then Meltina spoke first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am truly sorry for my unexpected visit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230;I haven&#8217;t heard from you in five years, it&#8217;s quite a sudden visit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My father will make a formal apology for that at a later date. Your Royal Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I was wondering earlier, what did say before calling my name. Since when did I become the King&#8217;s Brother?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl asks, dimly sensing the answer. Mertina&#8217;s eyes were downcast for a moment, then she quickly looked up and answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other day,The First King&#8230;&#8230;His Highness Raidorl’s father passed away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His Majesty Granard is now on the throne as the new King. With this, His Highness Prince Raidorl has been made into a royal brother instead of a prince.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the half-expected answer, Raidorl casts down his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father, the king, was still a young man in his fifties, but he was seriously ill at the time of Raidorl&#8217;s exile. In which, he had survived for five years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The queen, who gave birth to two princes, died when Raidorl was very young. This left his only blood relative was his older brother, who had banished him to the frontier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl closes his eyes for a few seconds and prays for the repose of his father&#8217;s soul, whom he never saw again after he was banished to the frontier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young prince&#8217;s banishment was decided by his older brother, who was acting king, and his entourage. His father was not involved in it and there is no enmity or feud between Raidorl and his father.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Raidorl didn&#8217;t shed any tears in front of Mertina, he felt as if he&#8217;d stuffed stones into his gut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Well, thank you for your report. But you didn&#8217;t come all the way here to tell me about my father&#8217;s death, did you? Now get on with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short silent prayer, Raidorl asks again what she wants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl’s father has passed away and his older brother has ascended the throne as the new king. That must be a major national event, but it is unlikely that the people of Royal Capital, who have not heard from him for five years, will bother to come and tell him. The main issue must be something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then &#8230;&#8230; I give His Royal Highness the King and Brothe to Raidorl Zain, this is an imperial command from His Majesty the new King Granard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That my brother Raidorl Zain will cease to be lord of the frontier city immediately and return to the royal capital&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl squints and asks back in a slightly irritated tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina stares back at him without flinching in the face of his sword-swallowing gaze. Her glassy, emotionless eyes make Raidorl&#8217;s gaze even steeper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you trying to do?　I hope you&#8217;re willing to explain what&#8217;s going on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a chilling voice, Raidorl asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person in front of Mertina is not the kind and gentle childhood friend she once had. It is a man who has been fighting demons in a frontier city for many years.His killing intent was sharp that it stung her skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, Mertina&#8217;s bodyguards, who are supposed to be accustomed to killing atmosphere, are shivering and pulling their faces, but nevertheless they are on high alert, ready to move at any moment to fulfil their duty of guarding her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I would very much like His Highness to hear it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is no fear on Mertina&#8217;s face, even though she is  facing the killing intent head-on. She looks back at Raidorl with a resolute expression on her face while smiling.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Heh &#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s still the same woman, ain&#8217;t she? I don&#8217;t think I ever understood her at all.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina, whose expression did not change, reaffirmed Raidorl&#8217;s assessment of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the same five years ago, but she is still a formidable woman. Looking back, Mertina is the girl who once sent Raidorl off to exile without changing a single expression. Even five years ago, it was impossible to read her mind. Now that she has grown up, it would be even more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl took a deep breath, suppressed his simmering emotions and urged the conversation to continue with his eyes. Mertina nodded and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the moment, our country is facing a great crisis&#8230;&#8230; Your Highness, have you heard about the Arslanian Empire in the East?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could I not know? They are the central continental hegemon, the world&#8217;s greatest power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,and that empire has declared war on the Kingdom of Zain. War has already been waged in the eastern border region for two months.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl unexpectedly makes a bare voice. This is because what came out of Mertina&#8217;s mouth was unexpected information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Arslanian Empire, which occupies most of the central part of the continent, is a large country that boasts more than ten times the size and power of the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empire has set the unification of the continent by force as a guiding principle for its state, and had several conflicts with the Kingdom of Zain in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, because the Arslanian Empire is a large country with enemies on all sides, it could not send enough troops to destroy the Zain Kingdom, and most battles would have ended in skirmishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s probably just the usual showing off their military might this time anyway. Isn&#8217;t it overblown to call something of that magnitude a national crisis?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, it seems that this time they seriously intend to destroy our country, since &#8230;&#8230; they seem to have a 『Holy Sword: Excalibur Holder』 as an enemy.&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Holy Sword: Excalibur Holder&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unheard word made Raidorl surprised. The Holy Sword &#8211; the thing that turned the young prince&#8217;s life fundamentally upside down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holy Sword is a sacred tool said to have been given to man by God in mythical times, and according to tradition, there were twelve of them on earth. One of them was the Dáinsleif, which was owned by the Kingdom of Zain and for which Raidorl was chosen as its owner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Raidorl&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, Mertina continued her explanation in a calm tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Arslanian Empire owns three Holy Swords. And as of now, we have received information that the holders of all three have appeared.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All three?! That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A holy sword is not something that anyone can use. Only those selected by divine will or by fate are allowed to possess it. It was not unusual for the holder to be absent for more than a hundred years, just as the first king of the Kingdom of Zain was the last to use the Dáinsleif.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now,there are three in one era. Including Raydor, it means that four have appeared.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m starting to read the story&#8230;&#8230;. Shit! How far you can go with your selfishness&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl covers his face with his right hand, his shoulders shaking with rage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of Mertina&#8217;s words were predictable. It is so selfish that it can only be seen as a mockery of Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Royal Highness Raidorl Zain. Please return to the Royal Capital, take the Dáinsleif in your hand and defeat the Empire’s Holy Sword to save your kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to the expected words, Raidorl slams his fist fist down on the table with all his might. The simple wooden table broke in half.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be silly! Stop making false assumptions about people!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an angry cry released from the depths of his soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason Raidorl was banished to the frontier was that he had been chosen as the holder of the holy sword Dáinsleif. And yet, the person who banished him is now asking him to return because he needs the power of the Holy Sword. This self-serving argument was not something he could suppress his emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think you&#8217;re doing with people&#8217;s lives?! You think I&#8217;m your convenient toy?!&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness! Please calm down!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s guards rush to stop Raidorl, who is reaching for the hilt of his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a fist strike, fired with blinding speed at the knight who came forward to hold Raidorl, pierced his throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guguet!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay there!&#8230;or you will be cut to death!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hic&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two knights escorting Mertina, one of whom was struck in the throat and fell on his back. The other was struck with a bare, violent killing intent and stood frozen, cowering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The escorting knights are well trained and are not weak. Even so, the current Raidorl, who has gained so much real combat experience in the frontier, can slaughter them with his bare hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even more so if it is Mertina, the daughter of a noblewoman. He should be able to grab her by her thin neck with one hand and snatch her life as if he was strangling a chicken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that the two guards had fallen silent, Raidorl glared at Mertina, who was still sitting in her chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mertina &#8230;&#8230; Answer with all your heart. Are you asking me to fight?　Are you asking me to risk my life to fight for you people who drove me out of Royal Capital?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness&#8230;&#8230;please calm your heart. This is for your own good as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou &#8230;..explain it to me.While, I can still contain myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she received the most post-gratuitous words, Mertina&#8217;s eyes looked back at her angry childhood friend without blinking. Raidorl&#8217;s head cools slightly as his lips tighten in determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His Majesty the King has said that he will fulfil any wish if his young brother Raidorl Zain will stand on the battlefield as the Holy Sword Holder. Not only would he regain his royal status, but he would also be able to acquire a more favourable territory that is not in such a remote area.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, that will no longer work!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five years ago, this would have been a proposal that would have been tempting, but unfortunately it has no appeal to the current Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had already made a new home in a frontier city and had no desire to return to the royal capital. And it would be unthinkable for him to be transferred to another territory. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that&#8217;s all you have to say, I wish you&#8217;d go home. You&#8217;ve grown very high and mighty, insulting someone&#8217;s territory!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t mean to insult you,&#8230;..Your Highness, are you sure you can&#8217;t come back to the Royal Capital?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want me to spare your life, you&#8217;d better get out of here while I still have reason!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; then I have no choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s eyes go down and she sighs as if she has given up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sniffs and tries to open the door to ask her to leave, but his eyes peel back when he sees what looks like a jewel that Mertina has taken out of somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do not wish to do this, but I must take Your Highness &#8230;&#8230; into custody.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina is clutching a red jewel. It was a magic item that could trap any magic in advance and activate it at different times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The red pearl shatters into pieces in Mertina&#8217;s hand and chains shoot out from inside the jewel like a snake poking a burrow, wrapping around Raidorl&#8217;s body and tying him up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia let out a high-pitched scream and rushed to Raidorl, who was tied up and on his knees. With the maid supporting him on her shoulders, Raidorl looks up at Mertina hatefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You &#8230;&#8230;! This was your plan all along, Mertina!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black chains tighten around Raidorl as if a snake were crushing its prey. Biting his back teeth against the binding magic that binds his limbs, Raidorl asks in a tone of fury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I wouldn&#8217;t want to do this if I could. That&#8217;s not a lie, though”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was questioned, Mertina tilted her thin head with an annoyed expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevertheless, I am the daughter of the Prime Minister, Lockwood Marcell. I am obliged to get my hands dirty for the sake of this country and give up everything if necessary. I would be grateful if Your Highness would understand this&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The daughter of the Prime Minister&#8230;&#8230;.Oh, yes, you are. That&#8217;s why you abandoned me five years ago too&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That happened, hasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a long time ago. Anyway, it&#8217;s all for the future of the Kingdom of Zain. His Royal King and the younger brother Raidorl will continue to accompany us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina raises her right hand and the knight escort steps forward. One of the knights has been knocked comatose by Raidorl, but another knight remains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how strong Raidorl is, having survived in the harsh frontier, there is no way he can win with his limbs bound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You force me to go to the royal capital, do you think I&#8217;m going to fight for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the worst case scenario, we will  force you to fight for us, even if we have to use servitude magic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slave magics, how far you&#8230;&#8230;will go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enslavement magic is a type of magic that forces the use of others by placing fetters on their souls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is normally only used against some people, such as sinners and prisoners of war, and should not be used against people who have committed no crime&#8230;&#8230;, much less royalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I ask this as a former childhood friend and as a former fiancée. Please be calm and quiet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s words sounded sincere if Raidorl only listened to the tone of her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no way Raidorl would follow them. This is the second time that his childhood friend has betrayed him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t convince me that you&#8217;re my fiancée now!　I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not going to give in to you people ever again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then what are you going to do about it? How do you resist while tied up?　Or would you like your servants to help you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s tone is dismissive, as if she were dealing with a child who doesn&#8217;t listen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, there’s a way! Don&#8217;t underestimate my maid, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina looked at him with a puzzled look on her face and blinked her eyes</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl smirked at her stunned childhood friend and ordered the maid who was standing close to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Neimilia, don&#8217;t be shy. Give the rude guest some senses in them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, master!　My guests, I will not tolerate any wolverine attacks on my master!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia stands in front of the knight as he tries to take Raidorl away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia held out her arms to form a protective wall around Raidorl, glaring straight at the knight, who was more than a head taller than she was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight frowns suspiciously at Neimilia, who is not even an escort, but a clear non-combatant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a very pretty escort. The first time I saw you, I’m impressed with you. Musume-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not retreat! I will protect my master!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, as a knight I wouldn&#8217;t want my unarmed woman to get hurt. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight exhaled languidly and reached for Neimilia&#8217;s shoulder, where she stood. The woman&#8217;s thin body could easily be pushed aside by a knight who makes his living fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then something unexpected happened, both for the knight and for Mertina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not allow Master to be touched. That&#8217;s what he ordered!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, a torrent of magical power erupted from Neimilia&#8217;s body like a storm. At the same time, the jet-black hair flowing down her back flailed like a living creature, and her eyes shone golden like the full moon in the night sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a mythical goddess, majestic and terrifying, and so beautiful that it sent shivers down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only Neimilia can bind and whip Master! You, a fat titted woman, I don&#8217;t remember giving you permission!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaagh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia holds up her hand along with her innuendo words. Instantly, the magic that gushed out with a violent force physically splashed the knight and slammed him into the wall of the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The simple wall could not even catch the man&#8217;s body, and it was easily broken through, and the knight rolled around on the ground outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia puffed out her chest in pride at the sight of the knight, who had fallen down and stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph,&#8230;&#8230; this level of bondage play with the master is disgusting!　At least know some fashion about bondage!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just no, what are you even talking about &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia points a finger at Mertina. Raidorl gave the dependable but erotic maid a bitter look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Mertina was witnessing such a dumb exchange, she stiffened by Neimilia&#8217;s golden eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Golden eyes like the moon shining in the night sky&#8230;. No way, how could the 『Witches Of Doom』 be in a place like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face, which had always maintained a calm demeanour, twisted into shock at the sight of Neimilia, who had revealed her true nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『Six Witches Of Doom』 were regarded as divine enemies in the teachings of the Church.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A great earthquake struck the empire a hundred years ago. An epidemic that spread across the eastern part of the continent 200 years ago. The 『Great Calamity』 that destroyed many countries and wiped out many civilisations 300 years ago. Witches are believed to be behind various other historical disasters, and 『Six Witches Of Doom』 are the subject of horror in children&#8217;s bedtime stories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Master, are you safe?　You haven&#8217;t been hurt yet, have you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, who has incapacitated the knight, touches the chains binding Raidorl and mumbles an incantations. Then, like wet paper in water, the black chains shattered into a thousand pieces, dissolved into the air like a haze and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aaa, no problem. Thanks for the help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mefufufu, as a maid I did what was natural. Master can leave the care to me, top to bottom, perfectly!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you say it like that, it sounds like you&#8217;re implying something&#8230;&#8230; No, nevermind it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After being released, Raidorl looks at the unexplained Neimilia&#8217;s many outlandish words and actions, but he honestly thank her for her help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He lightly moves the joints of his limbs to check that there are no problems, and turns to Mertina once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now&#8230;&#8230;, even if I am royalty, you tried to restrain me with a curse, and you failed to do so. You know what you&#8217;re about to get yourself into, Mertina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I didn&#8217;t expect His Royal Highness the King&#8217;s Brother to have a legendary witch on his side. I guess I&#8217;ve lost this one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s shoulders slump in resignation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl gives his childhood friend, who has a mysterious attitude without a single excuse, a choking look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me ask you something. Was it my brother &#8230;&#8230; Granard who restrained me with a curse and ordered me to be forcibly taken to the Royal Capital?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meltina closed her eyes and answered immediately without pause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is my own decision. Neither His Majesty nor my father had anything to do with it. It is all my fault for being too hasty. Please judge me as Your Highness wishes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know Mertina. Deep down, that&#8217;s a lie. But&#8230;.. I&#8217;ll leave it at that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl drew the sword at his waist and swung it sideways. A dull silver blade is moved towards Mertina&#8217;s neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An inevitable death that looms before her. Mertina accepts it without resistance, with her eyes downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmph, what a boring reaction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slash is approaching Mertina&#8217;s head but just before it does, the sword stops. A single skin of Mertina&#8217;s neck is cut open and a single line of blood flows down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, as if she didn&#8217;t expect it to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness&#8230;&#8230;Why did you stop it?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Make no mistake. This is not about childhood friendships.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl says as he sheathed his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy to kill Mertina here. It will be a great pleasure to kill Mertina, who once betrayed him and committed another outrage.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But I don&#8217;t like &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not the slightest hint of fear on Mertina&#8217;s face as she was about to be cut to death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she had expected that to happen from the very beginning, and seeing her expression, Raidorl had completely lost the will to kill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He walked up to the knight stretched out on the floor and stomped on his belly as hard as he could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, get up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“you&#8230;.. Your Royal Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at the knight, who finally wakes up and raises his upper body, Raidorl coldly pronounces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen. Mertina Marcell here has unleashed a curse against me, a royal, and tried to capture me by force. For that crime of impiety, I will have her bound here and now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Well, that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight looks confusedly at Mertina, who is behind Raidorl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina nods silently and makes eye contact to inform them that their ruse has failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir, I understand. So, what am I&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We will take custody of Mertina and you should report this to your superiors. Now, take him and get the fuck out of here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight man nodded with a bitter expression as Raidorl pointed to the knight lying outside. To the knight, Raidorl sniffed, &#8216;humph&#8217;, and threw in some more words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And one more thing. I will agree to participate in the war against the Arslanian Empire. As soon as I am ready, I will be on my way to the royal capital, so be sure to let them know that as well!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;..?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight and Mertina roll their eyes together. Even Neimilia, who is supposed to be on Raidorl’s side, is puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kukku&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the startled stares of the three, Raidorl grinned like a bad boy who had come up with a naughty prank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two knights were kicked out from the frontier city after locking the bound Mertina in a room Raidorl use for a storeroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, the knights did not suffer life-threatening injuries and did not require further treatment once they were given a bottle of recovery medicine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights were subjected to a simple memory operation by Neimilia, which erased the memory of Raidorl having one of the 『Witches Of Doom』 as a maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia&#8217;s power is something that the Kingdom of Zain does not grasp and could be a trump card. There was no advantage in it being known to those on the king&#8217;s side at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so that happened before I came.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but I don&#8217;t think that would have happened if you, the slow-witted old man, had arrived earlier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the discussion about Mertina, Raidorl spat sarcastic venom at Zafis Bartolomeo, who finally arrived at the right moment to remove the knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After receiving a scathing remark from his protégé, Zafis hung up his eyes and retorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t help it! We&#8217;re busy over here, unlike you, the decorative lord!&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a rough hand, Zafis picked up the wooden cup in front of him and gulped down the liquid inside. Then, “Boo-hoo!” and spits half of it out on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bitter! What the hell is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pardon me. It seems I used the wrong amount of tea leaves.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia said with a smile and mopped up the rather thick tea that Zafis had sprinkled all over the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zafis fearfully calls out to the maid, who sweeps the floor with a nonchalant look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah &#8230;&#8230; are you mad at me by any chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, I&#8217;m not angry at you for missing from master&#8217;s crisis or for calling him an ornament!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia&#8217;s expression may show a gentle smile, but a demonic anger is hidden behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zafis&#8217;s face was drawn into a shudder, and continue to he coughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank goodness you&#8217;re all right. Be that as it may, how could you agree to return to Royal Capital?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was on my mind too! Is master a masochist who goes out of his way to comply with the demands of those who drove him out of his home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who&#8217;s a masochist! I&#8217;ve got my own ideas!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl resentfully retorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Think about it, whatever the Palace&#8217;s intentions, we can&#8217;t just leave the Arslanian Empire alone, can we?　If the Empire destroys the Kingdom of Zain, they will naturally eradicate the royal people. I can&#8217;t be a part of that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He might be able to explain to his brother king that he was treated coldly by him and ask for a pardon, but there is no guarantee that this would be accepted by the empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the perspective of the Empire, there is no merit in keeping alive the royalty of an enemy country that it has destroyed. It is far more likely that they will be disposed of in order to cut off any lingering worries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl would be beheaded or burnt at the stake,either way it won’t end happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And this is a great opportunity. In times of war, Granada will have no choice but to concede to my demand, and I can even extract aid for the town.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pioneer cities serve to prevent the influx of demons from the dense forests to the south of the Kingdom of Zain. Despite this, the town is run by money from the sale of demon materials and assistance from the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, and no aid money was ever given by the royal court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. Is that really all there is?　You&#8217;re not going to take revenge on your brother, are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zafis raises his eyebrows and asks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing Raidorl when he was sent to the frontier, Zafis was well aware of how devastated and hurt the young prince had been by the betrayal from those he had trusted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He suspects that he intends to use the war as an opportunity to return to the Royal Capital and take revenge on his brother King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Revenge, or &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the question of the man who was his sword master, Raidorl turned his faraway gaze out of the window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has always hated his brother Granard, who betrayed him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He also resented his close associates, Lockwood Marcell and Bazel Garst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He even hated the Kingdom of Zain, which has kept its peace by relegating him to the frontier and treating him coldly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But &#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, Raidorl had no intention of taking revenge, by oath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Granard had left him alone, he was fine with a lifetime of fighting demons on the frontier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The frontier cities were full of danger and chaos, but there was a pure truth that the strong survived, which suited Raidorl&#8217;s skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would have been fine if my brother, Granard, had stayed out of my life. But if he still wants to take it from me at this stage, I&#8217;ll have to fight. I won&#8217;t let them look down on me again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see. Then I ain&#8217;t got nothing to say to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would stand beside with Master until the end of our nirvana!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Raidorl&#8217;s determination, Zafis nodded. Neimilia also pinched the edge of her skirt and bowed her head with a smiling expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a fight for my pride!　What is taken from me, I will take it back. I will show no mercy to those who took it from me!　The empire and my shitty older brother, I’m going to crush them both together!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a determination like a burning flame, Raidorl stared out of the window at the northern sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Far beyond the sky &#8211; in the royal palace of the Kingdom of Zain, a dead holy sword chirped with a high-pitched sound as if calling out to its master.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The regional city of Sardelia is located straight ahead in a northern direction from the pioneer city of Raid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A battalion sent from the royal capital is stationed in the town, which is a logistics centre in the southern part of the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander of the battalion, who rented a room in the lord&#8217;s mansion, was listening to the report of a knight who had returned from the frontier city in the drawing room, which serves as an improvised command centre.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, such things happen in the frontier city &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the knight&#8217;s report, the man in command of the battalion sighed deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander sits in his chair, legs crossed, and pokes his forehead, which is wrinkled in distress, with his index finger. The returning knight hurriedly bowed to his superior, who looked as if he was enduring a headache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I&#8217;m sorry!　We could not protect, Lady Mertina! This responsibility is &#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s within our expectations that she won&#8217;t come back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander uses a polite tone of voice, which is not something one would expect to address a civilian knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The failure to fulfil the task of escorting, the failure to bring Raidorl to this place. There was no rebuke for either of these failures, and the commander&#8217;s tone of voice was so calm that it felt unnatural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can step back now. Thank you for your hard work. Have a good rest and get rid of your fatigue.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander chuckled and urged the two knights to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights tilted their heads at their superior&#8217;s words. However, there was no way they could complain about the lack of punishment, so they obeyed the order and left the command centre in an orderly and mature manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander crossed his arms with a sombre look on his face as he watched the two knights leave the room and their footsteps fade away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t expect His Highness agreed to fight the Empire &#8230;&#8230;this is unexpected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If His Royal Highness, Raidorl Zain is willing to come back on his own volition, then there is nothing wrong with that, is there? Darren-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commander, whose expression darkened, was approached by his second-in-command, a female knight, in a concerned tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the commander, who is pondering in agony, is Darren Garst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the son of General Bazel Garst, one of the people who once expelled Raidorl from the royal capital, and is a commander belonging to the Royal Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He bore no resemblance to his father, who had a face as rugged as a rock, but has a beautiful, well-groomed appearance of a stage actor. With soft golden hair and blue eyes, he looks more like a nobleman than a warrior as he sits with his legs crossed. If he were not wearing his armour, the uniform of the knighthood, it would not even be apparent to the onlooker that he was a knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, the female second-in-command sighs as if entranced by Darren&#8217;s troubled look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Darren was still young at the age of twenty-five, his position as a commander was in no way due to his family background or his father&#8217;s connections. It is because Darren&#8217;s bravery and command ability are exceptional and he is an indispensable force in the Kingdom&#8217;s army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, Daren and 1,000 soldiers under his command are stationed in this town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of one battalion gathering in the town despite the war with the Empire is to capture and forcibly take Raidorl if he refuses to return to the Royal Capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True&#8230;&#8230;, I suppose I should be relieved&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren mumbles in a polite tone that does not befit his position, his brows furrowed in thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His second-in-command, the female knight Saara Leifet, covers her mouth with her hand in annoyance, not understanding why Darren is so distressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saara  was tall for a woman and had short brown hair. Wearing women&#8217;s armour, her appearance is reminiscent of a 『beauty in men&#8217;s clothing』, and she gives others the impression of being 『good-looking』rather than 『pretty&#8217; or beautifu』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her serious face is cool, but her gaze on Darren is passionate, and in her steeple-coloured eyes there is a hint of infatuation that transcends the boss-subordinate relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren, the commander, does not notice the passionate gaze of his second-in-command, but sinks deeper into the sea of thoughts.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I didn&#8217;t expect His Highness to agree to join the war &#8230;&#8230;,but what was his intention in detaining Mistress Mertina, who had committed a wolf crime, and returning only the knight &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">King Granard, by royal order, sent an emissary to his brother Raidorl to return to the Royal Capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, however, he did not expect Raidorl to agree to return at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither Granard, the king, nor Lockwood, his prime minister, were so flowery as to think that the exiled prince did not hold a grudge against them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They chose Mertina as their emissary not because they thought that she, as a childhood friend, would be able to persuade him, but rather to stir up Raidorl&#8217;s anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, send Meltina as an emissary, and if she can persuade Raidorl, that&#8217;s all that matters. If persuasion fails, the 『binding curse』 woven by more than a dozen court magicians will be activated to capture Raidorl. If the restraint by the curse failed, Darren is going to lead an army to besiege the frontier city and detain Raidorl according to the charge of 『murdering the vizier&#8217;s daughter』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, both persuasion and restraint by Mertina were premised on failure. It was a ploy to provoke Raidorl&#8217;s anger and have him charged with the murder of the Prime Minister&#8217;s daughter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No matter how much His Majesty the King&#8217;s orders, it takes a great deal of righteousness to detain a royal who has not committed a crime. That is why Ladt Meltina was chosen as a sacrifice. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fearfully, it was Lockwood, Mertina&#8217;s father, who devised the plot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the binding by curse succeeds, Mertina will be punished for single-handedly casting a curse on the royal family; if it fails, she will be murdered by Raidorl and used as a banner to capture her ex-fiancee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood&#8217;s cold-heartedness in blaming even his own daughter for the sacrifice for his country had left Darren with a chilling physical sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when it was over, Raidorl had agreed to return to the Royal Capital, and Mertina was captured without being killed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result was different from the development that had been anticipated beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it seems that&#8230;&#8230;Lady Mertina didn&#8217;t get killed either, so let&#8217;s be happy with the outcome for now, shall we? And I didn&#8217;t have to point my spear at His Highness Raidorl, the royal family.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren shook his excellent-looking face to the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was an unexpected turn of events, it was not a bad one, if he only looked at the final outcome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is unfortunate that Mertina was captured, but it is far better than being killed as planned. Depending on the Prime Minister&#8217;s negotiations, it should be possible to rescue her alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Raidorl&#8217;s intentions are worrying, Darren&#8217;s mission is only to bring the younger brother of the Holy Sword Holder to the royal capital. It is left to the King and the Prime Minister to find out his inner thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, although Darren had been ordered to capture Raidorl, he was by no means hostile or malicious towards the poor prince who had been banished to the frontier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, he even feels sympathy for him, who is forced to be unreasonable for the convenience of his country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was willing to cross swords for the king&#8217;s and the country&#8217;s sake, but he was still happy if he did not have to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Shall we then prepare to pick up His Royal Highness Raidorl? Before His Highness changes his mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir. We will be ready to leave immediately!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saara breathed a sigh of relief at her superior, whose expression brightened, and walked out of the control room with a willowy gait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he watched her back, Darren held his chest with his hand to suppress the unexplainable anxiety that had sprung up in his heart.</span></p>
