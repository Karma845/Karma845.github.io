<h3>Chapter 7 - The Calm Before the Storm.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arslanian Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the catastrophe caused by the 『Six Witches of Doom』 three hundred years ago, this great empire quickly recovered, annexed the neighbouring countries and became the central continental champion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only a few years ago that this country began to harbour the endless ambition of continental domination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite being a major power, the empire before that time had a rather conservative system and worked to avoid losing the wealth it already had, rather than invading neighbouring countries by force of arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, having become a major power, it had created many enemies in its surroundings.</span></>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no small number of forces threatening the Empire, including the subhuman countries in the south of the continent and the guild allies in the east.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the Empire is allied with the Divine Empire in the north, it is not certain whether it can be trusted, as alliances between nations can be broken at any time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they were to start a war unwisely, they could create enemies on all sides, giving them the opportunity to take advantage of the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The impetus that drove the Arslanian Empire to conquer the continent was the three holy swords owned by the Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holy Sword of Fire 『Durandal』</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400">　The Holy Sword of Ice 『Gjallarhorn』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　Holy sword of thunder 『Claíomh Solas』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The holders of these three holy swords appeared at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holders of the Holy Sword may or may not appear once every few decades.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was the first time since the founding of the Empire that the holders of the three sacred swords were chosen at the same time.</span></p>

<p>The emperor of the current time, Zacharias Van Arslanian, saw this as an opportunity to conquer the continent and launched a large-scale invasion of neighbouring countries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Zacharia’s orders, the Empire Army launched a simultaneous invasion of the Guild Confederacy in the east, the subhuman countries in the south and the Kingdom of Zain in the west.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the eastern part of the Kingdom of Zain, at the Imperial Army position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the help of a powerful weapon, the Holy Sword, the invasion of the Kingdom of Zain was progressing smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial army has already pushed into the last key blockade defending the capital, and the fate of the kingdom is now hanging in the balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the last stronghold of the Zain Kingdom. The kingdom&#8217;s men must be desperate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking into the distance at the Blaine Fortress in front of the royal capital of the Kingdom of Zain, two men exchange words.</span></p>

<p>The two men, dressed in military uniforms indicating that they belong to the Imperial Army, are an old man with grey hair and a man of mature age, somewhat younger than him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, their fall is only a matter of time. It will take less than a month.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the old man who opens his mouth gravely is Lieutenant General Gracos Barzen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the supreme commander of the Arslanian Imperial Army&#8217;s western invasion force, an old general who has been fighting for the Empire for nearly fifty years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, if we drop this place, the kingdom is as good as naked. Let&#8217;s attack slowly and without haste.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the man who responds to the old general&#8217;s words is Colonel Dallas Safaris.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also a general in the Western Invasion Army of the Arslanian Imperial Army, he was a trusted second in command for Gracos.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many soldiers are on standby, which is an imperial military position. The Imperial soldiers, who are the most highly trained on the continent, are all preparing for battle with crisp, lean movements, and the attack is expected to resume without much delay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two months ago, the Arslanian Imperial Army began its invasion of the Kingdom of Zain in the west.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they had fought several skirmishes with the kingdom in the past, this was the first full-scale invasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the Kingdom of Zain is only about one-tenth the size of the Empire, it is by no means a weak country. It has long had a reputation for defensive warfare using geographical advantages, and it was estimated that this invasion would take a considerable amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, once the battle actually started, the invasion went so smoothly that the invading empire was surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In just one month, the key border fortress of Balmes fell, and in another month they subjugated most of the nobles with fiefdoms in the eastern part of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the Empire had attacked Fort Blaine, the last stronghold defending the royal city, and was in a good position to take the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t expect things to happen so quickly. It was so easy to fight against our long-standing enemy, the Kingdom&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris sighs in some dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empire had invaded the Zain Kingdom once before, about ten years ago, but had failed to even take down a border fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a young man, Safaris had also participated in past invasions, and the bitter memories of defeat remained with him.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm &#8230;&#8230; it is possible to be afraid of the Holy Sword. How could a single person so decisively change the course of the war?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true&#8230;&#8230; a hero&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to the proud Barzen, Safaris&#8217; face is somewhat bitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has mixed feelings towards the Excalibur Holder, who has so easily conquered a fortress that he and his team had struggled so hard to defeat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to this attitude of his second-in-command, Barzen patted him on the shoulder in a comforting manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no need to be so downhearted. As I am sure you know, Her Highness is a cheerful and open-minded person. She is not the person to whom you should direct your pent-up emotions,right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s &#8230;..of course I know that, but &#8230;. ugh!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris lowers his eyebrows at his superior&#8217;s consolation, but his expression tightens at the sight of a figure running towards them from a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The figure runs through the Imperial Army&#8217;s ranks with flying speed and lands in front of them with a small jump.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mouu, Where were you two hiding!　I&#8217;ve been looking for you everywhere!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, It’s Her Highness the Princess. How may I help you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The appearance of the new intruder caused Barzen to relax his twin eyes kindly, and Safaris to pull his cheeks together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who appeared was in her mid-teens, and could still be called a &#8216;girl&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has long blonde hair that shines as if woven with the light of the sun. Eyes as blue as the clear sky. She has a beautiful face with a straight nose, but she still looks young and innocent.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dressed in a military uniform, but it did not suit her magnificently. Her beautiful features would have looked much better if she had worn a dress to a ball.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you if you wanted to talk about the war, you had to invite me too!　You&#8217;re being really mean by excluding me again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl bounces from body to body in restless, childish movements. She doesn&#8217;t seem to mind that her golden hair is dancing like flapping wings behind her back, [I&#8217;m angry!] Her cheeks were puffed out in a dissatisfied manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who shows such childish gestures has a sword at her waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s name is Celia Von Arslanian. She is an Imperial Princess and an Excalibur holder『Claíomh Solas』, the sacred sword that governs thunder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;..sorry. Your Highness the Princess. It seems that Safaris here is not very good with Your Highness, and I have no choice but to&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris exclaimed unintentionally at the sudden shift of responsibility from Barzen. Celia  nodded her head, [I knew it], and her lips twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mouu!　Get used to it, Colonel Safaris!　I&#8217;ve heard that the Colonel is a prejudiced person, but we are friends who will fight together. You won&#8217;t make it on the battlefield that way!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I’m sorry for my rudeness. Her Imperial Highness Princess Ceilia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris bowed his head to Ceilia, glaring reproachfully at the superior officer next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are old enough, Colonel, to get over your prejudices and find someone to marry. You may have a bad look in your eyes, but the Colonel doesn&#8217;t have a bad face, and if you wanted to, you could find a good woman in no time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..I will take your words to heart. Thank you for your consideration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris, who was reluctant to do this, hides his expression by keeping his face down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen intervenes with a slap on the shoulder of his second in command.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will give him a stern talking, so please forgive him. But more importantly, we were talking about the war. I would very much like to hear your opinion, Your Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course!　I&#8217;ve always wanted to talk to Grandpa about war too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hohoho, that&#8217;s great!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen smiles nimbly and loosens his cheeks sloppily at Celia, who innocently approaches him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such a superior officer at his side, Safaris sighed in spite of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spoiling her again,&#8230;..we really can&#8217;t help it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris has a hard time with Celia , who is an imperial princess,an Excalibur holder and the most important reason for this was that the superior officer was her.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old general, Gracos Barzen, is a heroic figure whose fame is renowned throughout the empire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His military tactics, sometimes cautious, sometimes daring, were nothing short of brilliant, and he was called a devil by his enemies and a god of war by his allies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris have admired the stern but merciful Barzen since he was a young man, and was even moved to tears of joy when he was chosen as his deputy several years ago following the retirement of his predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, only when dealing with Her Highness Princess Celia, Gracos Barzen appears as pathetic as an old man who is weak against his grandchildren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever Safaris sees such an appearance of Barzen, he feels irresistibly shameful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Grandpa. What did you and the Colonel talk about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we were talking about how we should take down Fort Blaine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia asked with an innocent tilt of her head. When asked, Barzen still cracks up without a second thought.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fortress Blaine is even more fortified than Fort Balmes on the border, and we know that it has ample stocks of weapons and provisions. It will take more time to bring it down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And it is General Bazel Garst who is guarding it. It shouldn&#8217;t be a simple matter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen explains, and Safaris adds from the side. Celia  nodded in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, so great. The enemy general is..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. General Garst is a fierce general who defended the border for 20 years. He is the patron saint of the Kingdom of Zain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee, is he even better than Grandpa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s ridiculous! Of course I&#8217;m better than him!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen responds to Celia&#8217;s innocent question in a stern manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However fierce a general he may be, he is still a young man, no more than 20 years old. He may be competent, but he is in the weak kingdom of Zain. He is no match for us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, Grandpa is the strongest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu,umu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen&#8217;s chest heaves with [ehem] at Celia&#8217;s praise. While looking at his superior officer in a white-faced manner, Safaris opens his mouth to offer a little water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, it is also true that the Empire&#8217;s road has been hindered by the enemy&#8217;s guardian deity. This battle will not be easy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, then shall I go and get that person&#8217;s head?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia  says it like it&#8217;s nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it were me, I could go into the fortress alone and kill that man, you know?　Then we would have won this battle, wouldn&#8217;t we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you will not! No such danger will Your Highness the Princess carry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen shouts angrily. The old general&#8217;s face changes from the kindly expression he had earlier to a stern one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, I beg you, please don&#8217;t do anything reckless like you did at Balmes Fortress! I thought my heart was going to stop at that point!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a matter of fact, it was largely due to the success of Celia that the Imperial Army was able to bring down the border fortress of Balmes in such a short time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Princess, the Excalibur Holder, had gone missing as the Imperial Army attacked the fortress and used her astonishing physical abilities to leap over the walls and enter the interior of the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Celia  jumped into the fortress, she pulled out her holy sword and went on a rampage, throwing the enemy into confusion, and as a result, the Imperial forces led by Barzen defeated them when the fortifications were less well-protected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her lion-hearted and inspired fighting style was truly heroic. She was a worthy holder of the Holy Sword Excalibur, but for Barzen, who loved her dearly, it was a nightmare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, please promise me that you&#8217;ll never fight a reckless battle like that, and never let this old man worry again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, That’s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia  flinched at Barzen&#8217;s swashbuckling, but fidgeted and clasped her index fingers of both hands together to muddle her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL:engaging in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Judging from the way she&#8217;s avoiding a clear statement, she&#8217;s planning to do the same thing in this attack on Fort Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do. You. Understand.?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Au&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia  gets teary-eyed at the old general, who comes at her with an unusually angry expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris shakes his head at the sight of the two of them, and offers help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her Highness Princess Celia. Your outstanding performance in the recent battle was truly outstanding. However, if  Her Highness plays an active role, we and many other officers will lose the opportunity to play an active role. Some of our soldiers are aiming to use this opportunity to take credit and rise in the ranks, so we would be grateful if you would hand over the credit to us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmuu&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..if that&#8217;s what you want, then okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia thought about it for quite a long time and nodded somewhat unsatisfactorily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brave princess has a reckless personality, but she is by no means blind to reason. If someone quotes about other soldiers, she will surely understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia&#8217;s purity and compassion was something that even Safaris, who had a hard time with her, understood without doubt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In return, if we need your highness&#8217;s help, we will certainly ask for it. Until then, please be patient.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. I look forward to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu,umu..that is why you are the Princess. Royalty is only possible if you treat your subjects well. That&#8217;s the calibre of a person who stands above others!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia  gives her honest approval. Barzen gently pats her head and thanks Safaris with eye contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris responded to his superior with a shrug of his shoulders and turned his gaze away from them and towards the fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after he had an audience with his brother King Granard and recovered the Holy Sword, Raidorl immediately set off for Fortress Blaine, the scene of the battle against the Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Accompanying Raidorl, as when he arrived in Royal Capital, was Darren Garst, Commander of the Thousand Horsemen, and about a hundred soldiers under his command. Darren is leading a thousand cavalrymen, but most of his men had already gone ahead of him to Fortress Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Granard did not come out to see Raidorl off as he left. He remained holed up in the castle and never even showed his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s to be expected. After what happened yesterday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps, but &#8230;&#8230; I think it is the king&#8217;s duty to keep up appearances, even if they are for deception.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl is on his way to the battlefield today,with Darren in the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Granard wanted to avoid as much as possible the exposure of Raidorl, who has become the Holy Sword:Excalibur holder in both name and reality, to the eyes of the people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He doesn&#8217;t have to be so scared. It&#8217;s crazy how frightened that thing is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There you go again, calling the king a thing,&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren frowned at Raidorl&#8217;s comment and shook his head, realising that it was useless to say anything with his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; His Majesty adores the Founding King, you know. That&#8217;s how much he values the power of the Holy Sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Hmph,&#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s why he banished his young brother. I&#8217;m sure he takes it very seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;By the way, Nilia-tono is dressed as a maid again today, isn&#8217;t she? No matter how high-ranking a sorceress she is, I think she should change into something more quintessential, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps wanting to change the subject, Darren turned his attention to Neimilia, who was sitting next to Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because he is going to war, Raidorl is not dressed as an adventurer, but wears a black armour suit that he had made in advance by a smith in a frontier city. This special armour, made of melted iron mixed with the blood and bones of demons, is lighter than it looks, and so tough that an ordinary sword cannot even leave a mark on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Neimilia was dressed in a maid&#8217;s uniform as usual. The apron she wore over her black dress was so out of place that it was hard to believe that she was about to head out into the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An apron dress is a maid&#8217;s combat uniform! If I’m going to the battlefield, there is no better dress!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia asserted proudly with her chest outstretched. Her confident tone even makes it sound as if Darren is the one saying the bizarre things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren pulls a light face, but soon realises the pointlessness of arguing with someone he doesn&#8217;t understand and shakes his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see. Well, if it&#8217;s okay with you, I have no problem with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about her. Let&#8217;s talk about the war instead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl interrupted the futile conversation and cut to the chase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, tell me about the current situation of the Royal Army. I hear you&#8217;re being cornered by the Empire, but how much of a gap in strength do you have exactly?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,&#8230;&#8230;first of all, as for the strength of the Royal Army, the total number of soldiers packed into Fortress Blaine is 10,000. It is commanded by my father, Bazel Garst.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of Raidorl&#8217;s eyebrows twitches at the name Bazel Garst. It was one of the people who had once banished him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren had noticed this change in Raidorl, but he continued, not daring to poke around in the bushes where he knew a serpent was lurking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The total number of the opposing Imperial forces is 50,000. Twenty thousand of them are directed at suppressing the nobles who hold territories in the east, so the number of troops attacking the fortress is 30,000. That means a threefold difference in troop strength.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;..That sounds even worse than I imagined.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers in the fortress must be in for a nightmare, being forced to defend the fortress against an opponent with three times the number of troops without any reinforcements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the battle is that imminent, it is not surprising that Raidorl, who had been sent to the frontier for being sparse, is brought back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I don&#8217;t understand. Why didn&#8217;t Granard move when he was in such a neck-and-neck situation?　Why does he stay in the Royal Capital and not go out to the battlefield?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a question for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king stays in a safe place and does not go out into the dangerous battlefield. That may seem obvious, but it was a bad move at a time when the country was on the verge of extinction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the king goes to the front line, that alone will boost the morale of the soldiers, and since the king&#8217;s guards, the Kingsguard, can also be mobilised, the strength of the army will be greatly increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, if the Blaine Fortress is overrun, it is only a matter of time before Kingdom Of Zain is defeated. The king&#8217;s army is not a military force to be saved, but should be released all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren&#8217;s words were muddled by Raidorl&#8217;s question. From the look of hesitation on his face, it was clear that the young commander had the same idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren was silent for a while, lost in thought, but when he saw the gazes of Raidorl and Neimilia directed at him, he eventually gave up and opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. His Majesty the King is not a coward. But he is extremely afraid of the Holy Sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When Fortress Blaine was first besieged, His Majesty proposed that he himself should go on a personal conquest. However, when he heard that the enemy had the holy sword-bearer Excalibur Holder, he decided against it and stayed in the royal palace.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know much about war, but isn&#8217;t it the duty of a king to do what is best for his country, regardless of the enemy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Neimilia tilted her head and asked, Darren turned his face downwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;that man is possessed by the shadow of the Holy Sword. Because he was not chosen to be the Holy Sword, he has an extreme fear and hostility towards the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;So annoying. I don&#8217;t know what the Holy Sword did to that thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s lips twisted sarcastically and he spat out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is hostile to the Holy Sword and therefore excludes his own brother and refuses to go into battle because he is afraid of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the holy sword is involved, the elder brother seems to become a very foolish king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You abandoned your younger brother because you needed to protect the country, but when that country is on the verge of destruction, you can&#8217;t do your deadly work, what a joke. Do you think that qualifies you for the throne?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His Majesty the King is a &#8230;&#8230; competent man. At least when it comes to political affairs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren defends his inexcusable defence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no point in hurling any more accusations at the knight, who seemed desperate to defend the king. Raidorl looked out of the carriage window with a sullen frown on his face.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The Holy Sword is beyond human power. It is right for man to fear it. But&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl reached out and touched the hilt of the jet-black sword on his waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing the battlefield approaching, Dáinsleif is hot as if seared by fire.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You don&#8217;t become king because you were chosen by the Holy Sword. You&#8217;re supposed to be a king, so the Holy Sword responds to you. My poor brother&#8230;&#8230; if you were truly the vessel of a king, Dáinsleif would have chosen you from the start.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Raidorl&#8217;s hand, the jet-black holy sword pulsed a small pulsation of affirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The journey from the royal capital to Fort Blaine takes a week by horseback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and his escorting knights proceeded eastwards, camping out along the way and sometimes staying in villages near the road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first five days were uneventful, but on the sixth day, trouble struck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Your Highness. Are you awake?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U&#8230;&#8230; Darren &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Early in the morning, while sleeping in his tent, he is approached by Darren and Raidorl wakes up with a frown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he had just woken up, Raidorl&#8217;s face was very tired and he had dark dark circles around his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl has been sleeping in the same tent as Neimilia during this road trip. Last night, the erotic maid, who was strangely aroused by the continuous wild camping, pressed her body in various strange ways, which caused Raidorl to be completely sleep deprived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MunyaMinyaa…master&#8217;s muscles, they look so beautifully tasty..mufufuf..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, the source of his lack of sleep, is happily sleeping in a state of undress. Her mouth is dripping with drool, and her bare bosom is wet and soggy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This girl&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl felt the urge to literally slap the loose-faced maid awake. But he couldn&#8217;t keep Darren outside waiting too long. With a small click of his tongue,he quickly adjusted his dishevelled clothes and stepped out of the tent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to keep you waiting, Darren.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Your Highness. I&#8217;m sorry to bother you this early morning, but I have a few things I need to ask you&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, say it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an apologetic look on Darren&#8217;s face, Raidorl urged him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve just heard from the locals&#8230;..and it seems that demons are appearing on the road ahead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Demons? What about it? It&#8217;s not that unusual, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl furrowed his brow and replied in a dubious voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are demons everywhere. You can&#8217;t live your life worrying about them all the time, can you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness&#8230;..this is not the remote area where you used to live. It&#8217;s not so much compared to the deep forests or deep in the mountains, but it&#8217;s not often that something as serious as demons appear on the roads and in human settlements.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm&#8230;&#8230;is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl blinks curiously. His senses had been dulled by living on the frontier for so long, but thinking back, Darren may be right.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</ple="font-weight: 400">“And moreover, it appears that it is a sub-dragon that is tearing up the&#8230;..road.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren distorts his neat face in distress and continues his explanation with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A sub-dragon&#8230;&#8230;『dragon-like』, eh? That&#8217;s a big one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(竜もどき)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s eyes widened slightly as if Darren&#8217;s words had woken him from his sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is the strongest demon in this world? The first thing many warriors and adventurers mention when asked that question is the『dragon』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragon, Hydra, Leviathan, Lindworm and Jörmungandr&#8230;..dragons included a number of demons, all of which were designated disaster class and recognised as monsters that could destroy towns and cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Note: author use Midgard instead of Jörmungandr but I personally think most people will know the latter name &amp; Lindworm is a serpentine body dragon from sweden’s folklore)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Catastro Orc, which Raidorl once fought in a frontier city, is of a similar danger level as a disaster-class demon. However, while the catastro-orc are highly dangerous as a [swarm], the dragons have the fighting power to destroy cities on their own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some have been confirmed to use magic and even manipulate human languages, and their true power is still unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『sub-dragons』 are not as powerful or wise as real dragons, but unlike dragons, which rarely appear in people&#8217;s sphere of existence, they often appear near human settlements and are therefore feared as a more immediate threat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve never fought a dragon, but if it was a sub-dragon, I&#8217;ve come across it a few times on the frontier. I’ve finally managed to defeat them in cooperation with other adventurers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Yes, that&#8217;s right. It seems that the territorial soldiers of a nearby town have blocked the road and have hired adventurers to form a strike force. It&#8217;s going to take a while to take them down, and we&#8217;re going to have to bypass the road if we don&#8217;t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Daren speaks in a sombre tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they bypass the road, it will be a few more days before they reach the fortress. A slight delay will make not Blaine Fortress fall but Darren is still anxious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi why do we have to wait for someone else to take it down? If there are demons in the way, we can just defeat them ourselves and go on our way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Daren couldn&#8217;t help but let out a goofy sound when he heard Raidorl spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.but the opponent is a sub-dragon and it is by no means a weak demon. We are small in number and we are not prepared to hunt demons.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Darren is by no means afraid of demons because of the winds of cowardice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, knights are a fighting force that is designed to fight against humans as enemies, such as invading enemy countries. Fighting demons was the job of adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If demons appear that cannot be dealt with by adventurers alone, they may join the fight, but knights do not have the specialist know-how to trap demons in traps or use drugs to drive them away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly, we have more than a hundred of us, so we are well equipped in terms of headcount alone. But as knights, we don&#8217;t have the knowledge or skills to fight demons. If we were to fight a sub-dragon, which is a semi-disaster class demon, there would be a big amount of damage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re going to the battlefield now and they can&#8217;t afford to cause any unnecessary damage. Darren complained bitterly with a hard look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha,I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Raidorl laughed off Darren&#8217;s advice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then there&#8217;s no problem. I&#8217;m the only one fighting the sublunar dragon. I don&#8217;t mind if you guys don&#8217;t follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren was speechless for a few seconds at Raidorl&#8217;s words. However, he quickly wrinkled his brows and raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!　That can&#8217;t be possible!　We are His Highness Raidorl&#8217;s bodyguards. What are knights who stay back and only let the one they are guarding go off to fight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s great loyalty, isn&#8217;t it? You’re only protecting me temporarily. Why should a man who works under the orders of Aniki be loyal to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;I beg you not to make fun of me!　It is true that I am His Highness&#8217; bodyguard by order of His Majesty the King. But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that His Highness is a man of noble blood whom I should serve at the risk of my own life!　If His Highness is going to fight demons,I will accompany him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Oh, I see, you say things that make me cry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Darren says to him with a straight gaze, Raidorl awkwardly turns his face away. Since he has not been treated as royalty since his expulsion from Royal Capital, his shyness inevitably gets the better of him in situations like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl regains his composure and clears his throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m well aware that you&#8217;re an ideal knight &#8230;&#8230;, but this time I want to fight”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Raidorl strokes the hilt of the sword at his waist with the palm of his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There it was, not the sword he was familiar with from his days as an adventurer, but a jet-black sword in a leather sheath. It was the holy sword Dáinsleif, which he had just met again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before I go out into battle, I want to do a warm-up with my Excalibur. I want to see how far I can go with just me and him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The sub-dragon, the closest demon to the dragon, is a suitable first enemy for me. Don&#8217;t you think so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Daren nodded silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the lord he serves decides so, there are no pros and cons for Darren, the knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was decided that Raidorl and his party would slay the sub-dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, Raidorl and his party proceeded along the roads that had become the habitat of the sub-dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The roads closed by the neighbouring lords are deserted and quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl had dismounted from the carriage he had ridden to this point and switched to a horse. The reason is that he cannot stay in the carriage with no escape when he does not know when he might be attacked by demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Raidorl in the lead, Daren and the other knights followed. The group had been moving along the road for a while without incident, but soon a small mountain came into view ahead of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mountain was charred brown, as if it had just caught fire, and as they approached it, they could see that it was wriggling and squirming in small movements. As soon as the group realised that it was not a mountain, but a creature, they were hit by a nose-piercing odour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pungent smell, which smells like rotten eggs, makes Raidorl raise his eyebrows and cover his nose with one hand. With a wave of his other hand, he signals the knights behind him to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stopping his horse, Raidorl observes a writhing knoll a short distance away. It turns out to be a huge lizard monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lizard covered with brown scales is sitting in the middle of the road with its bright red eyeballs gawking at something. The huge lizard does not seem to be aware of the approaching Raidorl, and is devouring something with its jaw so large it could swallow a horse in a single gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a &#8230;&#8230; stone statue?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl mutters quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant lizard was devouring a stone statue in the shape of a human being. The stone statue, with an expression of despair on its face as if it were the end of the world, is being chewed to bits by a sharp-toothed tusk, making a loud crunching sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Raidorl, Darren gulps and spits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, I believe that thing is&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, Basilisk&#8230;.. are the worst demons I can think of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Basilisk is a monster feared by people as a particularly troublesome presence among sub-dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Basilisk has a huge body, of course, but the breath from its mouth has the power to petrify living creatures. The poor victim who inhaled the poisonous breath would be transformed into a mute stone statue with intense fear and, unable to move, would end up being crushed by it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wreckage of what appears to be a crushed carriage is scattered under the basilisk&#8217;s feet. Among the wreckage are pieces of luggage and crates in transit, suggesting that the attackers are probably peddlers who have failed to escape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ara, That’s a problem. Master, if you like, I can help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need. Watch from there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, who was waiting in the carriage, looks out of the window and asks. Raidorl shakes his head, declines the maid&#8217;s offer and turns to Darren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This time it&#8217;s just a test cut for him. You and the others will not be allowed to use your sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! I understand. But if His Highness is in danger, We will certainly help you, no matter what punishment we may have to suffer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ &#8230;&#8230;you&#8217;re a hard worker”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl relaxed his shoulders, dismounted from his horse and gripped the sword at his waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time he had used Dáinsleif. Despite this, the holy sword in his grip is so familiar to his body that it seemed to become one with his right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He draws the sword as he closes the distance between himself and the basilisk. At the same time, the jet-black holy sword emitted a noxious miasma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The swirling vortex of noxious air that swirls around the sword seems as if it is rejoicing that the holy sword is being used by its owner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have noticed the disturbing signs that arose behind it. The basilisk that had been feeding on the stone statue turned its head and looked back. The blood-red reptile&#8217;s eyes reflected the image of the raidor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to interrupt your meal. I&#8217;m going to have to ask you to stay with me for a bit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The basilisk responded to Raidorl&#8217;s words of ridicule with a deafening scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant lizard&#8217;s forelegs lifted up and swung sideways at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t make a fuss,this is no problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s body flutters, and he flies through the air to avoid the basilisk&#8217;s paws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl twisted his body in mid-air and slashed at the basilisk with a spin. The black blades and sheaths easily tear through the skalengeck&#8217;s scales, leaving a straight scar on its thick neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hushaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The sword is a holy sword, after all. The sharpness is quite impressive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl nods in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword he had used before was no doubt not a poor quality, but the sharpness of the holy sword was still of a different standard. Even the hard scales of the sub-dragon could be slashed with almost no resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the sub-dragon&#8217;s vitality is also extraordinary. While its neck was slashed open and purple blood was sprinkled, a fierce killing intent still floated in the basilisk&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The basilisk took a deep breath. It appears to be about to release a petrifying breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl ponders with his eyes steep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his current speed, it is not difficult for him to avoid the poisonous breath being sprayed at him. However, Darren and the others behind him would be subjected to the breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia, one of the feared witches in history, might be able to handle petrification. But Darren and the others, who are only a man, even if they are knights, will not get away with it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t have any obligation to help them. If you ask me if these guys are on my side, I can&#8217;t say for sure that they are&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Darren follows as his bodyguard, it is by Granard&#8217;s orders. If they become hostile, they may flip on him and point their sword at Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But I would not have a good night&#8217;s sleep&#8230;&#8230; leaving him to die!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if only for the first time, Darren swore allegiance to Raidorl and showed respect for the royal family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he was the son of Bazel Garst, the man who had banished him, Daren had not yet betrayed Raidorl. He had no reason to abandon him in the land of the dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Holy Sword, Dáinsleif&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl raised the Holy Sword above his head and commanded cheerfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The great sword that controls the cursed curse of the gods. Show me your power as told in ancient legends!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, the black miasma surrounding Dáinsleif gains momentum. The enormous amount of miasma released from the sword, like a volcano erupting, is like a huge blade that strikes the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since pulling out the holy sword five years ago, the blessing of the Dáinsleif has resided in Raidorl&#8217;s body. The power of the sword was powerful enough to overwhelm ordinary adventurers and soldiers, but the power transmitted from the holy sword in his grip was far greater than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Curse sword fighting method【Hatchet Of Giants:Hrungnir】!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Norse mythos) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kishaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl swung down the miasma sword that had become a giant blade. At the same time, petrifying breath is blasted out from the basilisk&#8217;s huge jaws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poisonous breath that petrified all life surged like a tsunami. However, Raidorl&#8217;s huge sword slices through the breath of inevitable death, cutting it in half.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The breath splits into left and right. Raidorl, as well as the knights behind him, are not harmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the cursed blade that cuts the breath in two does not slow down and slams into the basilisk&#8217;s huge body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Giaaaaaaaaaa!!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A desperate scream came out of the basilisk&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade swung down towards the ground as if slamming an axe into a tree, breaking through the basilisk&#8217;s hard scales, tearing its flesh and scraping it down to the bone, smashing the basilisk the size of a small mountain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was left after the blade had passed through was a huge body of a basilisk that had split in two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, not bad &#8230;&#8230;. No, it&#8217;s pretty good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl smiled in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What remained in Raidorl&#8217;s heart after he had overwhelmed even the sub-dragon unharmed was a refreshingly clear feeling like a clear sky. In contrast to the holy sword, which is still cloaked in a disastrous miasma, there was a refreshing smile on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gi……Aa……..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The basilisk that had been cut in half was still breathing with tremendous vitality, but its feeble cries would soon cease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It did not die. Its huge body, lying in blood, gradually hardened and eventually transformed into a grey stone statue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dáinsleif is a holy sword that governs curses. The blade of the miasma can poison or paralyse the person it cuts with it. It could easily be turned to stone like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl answered Darren&#8217;s question with a mocking scornful smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You turned people to stone and ate them. You should try it for once and see what it feels like to be turned to stone yourself. You&#8217;ll never be the same again, though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What power to turn a petrified sub-dragon to stone &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren is stunned with wariness and excitement. Raidorl looks back at his escort, the knight, with the face of a child whose prank has succeeded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry to burst your bubble, but this isn&#8217;t even close to our full strength. It&#8217;s just a test. I&#8217;ll show you our true colours in the war against the Empire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa, how exciting! I wonder how much power I&#8217;ll have when I draw all the power of the Holy Sword!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Darren’s expression changed to fear, his eyes glued to the ground while Raidorl laughed merrily and raised his Dáinsleif above his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to encounters with demons along the way, Raidorl finally arrives at Fortress Blaine ten days after leaving the Royal Capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fort Blaine is located in a basin surrounded by rolling hills and surrounded by high walls. The fortress seemed to have been attacked several times, leaving fresh battle scars on the walls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial troops have established a position on a hill a short distance away. Fortunately, the fortress does not appear to be surrounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s in a very low location, isn&#8217;t it? Doesn&#8217;t seem like a very good location for a military base, does it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at the fortress from the hill opposite the imperial camp, Raidorl tilted his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dismounting from the carriage, Raidorl&#8217;s eyes could clearly see the fortress on the low ground. Although it was impossible to see inside the fortress walls, he could clearly see the soldiers working on the walls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This means that the enemy imperial forces can also see the fortress clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl was still living in the royal palace, he studied military science as a necessary education for royalty. According to the knowledge he learned as a child, forts and fortresses are supposed to be built on high ground where they can be overlooked by the enemy. Isn&#8217;t this the exact opposite?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely the basics are right. It&#8217;s not wrong”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren, standing next to him, answers Raidorl&#8217;s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;This Blaine fortress takes advantage of the lowland terrain, which would normally be a disadvantage. Firstly, the descent from the attacker on the high ground prevents the cavalry from moving vertically and horizontally endlessly. Furthermore, because the surrounding area is marshy and prone to rainwater run-off, the infantry will also be stuck in the mud, making it difficult for them to move. And best of all, if the fortress is besieged by the enemy, the reinforcements that come to the rescue later will be able to stand on higher ground than the enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;So that&#8217;s why the Imperial Army is not encircling the fortress, but building positions on the hills.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In warfare, it is more advantageous to fight from a high position, as it is easier to send bows and arrows and to give momentum to the assault. If the Imperial Army surrounded the fortress, it would be at a disadvantage because it would have to fight an opponent from a height when reinforcements were sent in from the Kingdom side later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hence, instead of encircling Fort Blaine, they would take up positions on a nearby hill and only come down from the hill when it was time to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This will allow us to enter the fortress undisturbed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, there are no signs of any ambush soldiers around, so let&#8217;s get right into the fortress!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl returned to the carriage and was able to enter the fortress from the western gate without trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome, Your Highness, The King’s brother Raidorl Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first person to greet him as he entered the fortress was Bazel Garst, the chief officer of the Royal Army guarding Fortress Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, long time no see. General Garst.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it&#8217;s been a long time. Your Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They met again for the first time in five years and remained silent as they looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl had a lot to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel had a lot to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they did not speak out and looked at each other head-on. Sensing an unusual atmosphere, Neimilia and Darren&#8217;s expressions hardened behind Raydor&#8217;s back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They stared at each other for a dozen seconds or so, and then looked away from each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sniffs with a sarcastic, cold smile, while Bazel relaxes his rock-white face slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness Raidorl, you have grown quite splendid. You have the appearance of a splendid warrior.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look a little old yourself, don&#8217;t you?　Perhaps you should consider retirement.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll think about it when this battle is over. Now, please go in the back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reunion between the exiled prince and the generals involved in his exile ended on a barely congenial note.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia gently lowers her right hand, which was secretly preparing to cast a spell, and Darren also brushes his hair back as he exhales a breath of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl was led by Garst to a room in the fortress and, as recommended, sat on a chair. Neimilia stood immediately behind him, with Darren next to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel sits in the chair opposite across the table and bows his head towards Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;..once again, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support all the way from the frontier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter, I&#8217;m going to squeeze every last penny out of my brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting plunked down in a chair, Raidorl naturally puts his legs up on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His toes were pointed towards Bazel, who was sitting opposite him, but the elderly general brushed off the overly rude attitude and instead turned his attention to Neimilia, who was behind him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way,is that lady one of His Highness Raidorl&#8217;s attendants?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, even if he could forgive Raidorl&#8217;s rudeness, he could not shed the maid who had come to the battlefield. There was a slight tone of reproach in his tone as he asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll see. Don&#8217;t worry about every single detail between father and son.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel looks over to Darren, who is next to Neimilia. Asked by his father with his eyes, Darren gave him a troubled look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, that was the only gesture that made him realise the situation. Bazel sighs and strokes his moustache. Darren also chuckles at his father&#8217;s resigned look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re convinced, can you explain the war situation to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I understand. The Imperial Army attacked the eastern border fortress of Balmes a month ago and has since pacified the nobility in the east. They invaded Fort Blaine about half a month ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the general told Raidorl was almost identical to what he had heard from Darren beforehand. What was new to him was what came next.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“During the past half month, the Empire has attacked the fortress day after day. So far we have managed to hold out without any serious damage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou, they&#8217;re taking their time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl blurted out with a raised eyebrow, suspiciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how difficult it is to encircle the fortress of Blaine due to its terrain, the Imperial Army has three times as many troops as the Kingdom’s side. There is also the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder and if they attacked with force, it wouldn&#8217;t take that long to bring down the fortress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have a good point. But it seems the Empire has their own ideas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Interesting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl urges Bazel to talk, folding his arms thoughtfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently, the Imperial Army doesn&#8217;t like to wear out its troops. If they try to forcibly attack a fortress in a short period of time, they will inflict heavy damage. They seem to be avoiding that and daring to fight a long war.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long-term warfare, eh? I don&#8217;t understand the logic of it, but if they prolong the war in vain, they will only lose their rations. Besides, if we continue like this, it&#8217;s going to be winter, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empire had invaded the Kingdom of Zain several times in the past, but always pulled out before winter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because they inevitably need manpower during the busy farming season in autumn, and in winter, the army is stuck in the cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the Kingdom of Zain is not a region with much snowfall, the Empire is always covered with snow in winter. If the snow cuts off the supply routes for the army, the army will starve and wither.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness is right. But this is not the case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel shook his head reproachfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Imperial Army has already seized Fort Balmes on the border between our two countries and is treating it as a stronghold for its own troops. When winter comes, it will be easier for them to keep out the cold if they have a stronghold there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel spread a map on the table and tapped the border fortress in the middle of it with his index finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He then draws a circle with his finger around the eastern part of the kingdom between Fort Balmes and Fort Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Furthermore, the Imperial Army has already taken over the eastern part of the Kingdom. If they collect from the areas under their control, they won&#8217;t have to carry in troops from their home country. There is no reason for the Imperial Army to force its soldiers to fight a short battle by forcing them to wear themselves out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;.When winter comes, the eastern part of the kingdom will be hell.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl shook his head in sympathy as he thought of the villages being mercilessly looted by the Imperial Army. Bazel nodded gravely in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have welcomed His Highness to ensure that this does not happen. His Highness Raidorl Zain….. I know that you are right to be angry with us. But we have no choice but to cling to your power. Please help us to protect the Kingdom of Zain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Father&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel bows so deeply that his forehead touches the table. His son Darren&#8217;s eyes widened at the sight of his stern father bowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed at the top of the general&#8217;s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..If my brother had done this from the beginning and had a less arrogant attitude, maybe we could still be brothers. Though it&#8217;s too late to say that now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl’s words, mumbled in a whisper as loud as the flapping of an insect&#8217;s wings, only reached Neimilia, who was right behind him. The girl in the maid&#8217;s uniform touched Raidorl’s shoulder in a caring manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl turned around to say it was alright and gave the maid behind her a quick glance. He then stepped down from the table and stuck his index finger at Bazel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t mind lending you a helping hand &#8230;&#8230; but just so you know. General Garst has made a sincere apology, and now I will return the favour. General, if you accept one condition, I will grant your wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel replied to Raidorl&#8217;s words without a pause. Admiring the general&#8217;s lawfulness as he kept his head bowed, Raidorl put forward his demands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want you to be my enemy when this fight is over. That&#8217;s all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I have a contract with my brother and I will fight the Empire even if the General does not give in to my demands. But if General Garst promises me, I promise to bring about victory with the least amount of damage, with no stone left unturned. I can swear on this holy sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a thud, Raidorl placed the Dáinsleif on the table. Bazel looks difficult and bites his back teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, Bazel has no intention of antagonising Raidorl. However, daring to remind Bazel of this means he is about to do something that could turn Bazel against him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel was in anguish for a while as he realised the rebellious intent behind those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loyalty and integrity. Pride of a warrior. Rebellion against the Empire. After weighing these various things on a balance sheet in his mind, Bazel eventually came up with an answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am a warrior in the service of the kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sighs ruefully. He looked away seeing the negotiations had failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was more to Bazel&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;there is no loyalty if the country I serve is no longer there. If His Highness will save the kingdom, I will offer him the same loyalty as His Majesty Granard”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loyalty equal to that of the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is to say, if Raidorl were to fight with Granard, it would be a statement that he would remain neutral, not taking sides.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If the kingdom&#8217;s most powerful general stays out of my way, that alone will make things a lot easier. That&#8217;s a good achievement.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. This Raidorl Zain, I swear it, will bring victory to the Kingdom&#8217;s army. I will never fall behind the imperial sword-bearer Excalibur Holder or anyone else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl rises from his chair and proclaims his victory with firm resolve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel kneels on the floor and bows deeply to show his loyalty to the young man who will become a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> 〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then, let us resume our attack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning after Raidorl entered Fortress Blaine. At the Imperial Army position, Lieutenant General Gracos Barzen, General of the Western Invasion Army, strokes his beard with his hand as he declares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing on top of a hill, Barzen&#8217;s gaze is on the fortress to be attacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last fortress protecting the royal capital of the Kingdom of Zain stood majestically and loomed over the imperial army, as if to show the majesty of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lining up beside Barzen is his second-in-command, Colonel Dallas Safaris. Behind him is the Empire’s Princess, Celia Von Arslanian.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Barzen is neatly dressed in his military uniform, Celia had misbuttoned her top and bottom buttons and her shirt was sticking out from the edge of her trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes are half-open and her eyelids are drooping, as if she had just woken up from sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mo—&#8230;.. I’m sleepy to fight in the morning, why don&#8217;t we start at noon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oya,oya…If you are sleepy, you can rest in your tent. We will take care of the troublesome battles for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Celia, who rubs her eyes with her hands and even yawns, Barzen says in a cat-pawing voice, as if she were spoiling her grandchildren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The general acted like his own grandfather, [No, you can&#8217;t do that,] said Ceilia, pinching both her cheeks with her fingers and pulling them sleepily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m supposed to be in charge of this army, after all. I can&#8217;t leave everything to Grandpa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hohohoho, how kind of you to take care of my old body. I, Gracos Barzen, will do my best to repay the Princess&#8217;s kindness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; So, how shall we attack today? General Barzen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu&#8230;&#8230;Safaris.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are conversing like close grandparents and grandchildren, when Safaris interrupts them from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen glares at his deputy with a sideways glance when he is interrupted from his moment with the doting princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true&#8230;..today we can take it a little more seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? Weren&#8217;t we supposed to go easy on them for a while?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris raises his eyebrows suspiciously and asks his superior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the recent attack on Fort Brain, the Imperial West Invasion Army led by Bahzen had no intention of attacking with all its might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or perhaps it should be said that there was no need to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this war, the Imperial Army dropped the border fortress of Balmes in an extremely short period of one month and occupied most of the eastern part of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, some of the nobles serving the Kingdom have switched sides to the Empire, and secret agents have already been sent to various parts of the Kingdom to carry out raids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, preparations are steadily underway to cut down the Kingdom of Zain from within without forcibly dropping Fort Blaine, and even without wasting soldiers&#8217; lives, the kingdom&#8217;s collapse is only a matter of time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Moreover,&#8230;&#8230;we are not finished with destroying Zain. Any loss of life from the army will hinder the &#8216;next&#8217;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris looks to the future after the destruction of the Kingdom of Zain and exhales softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the west of the Kingdom of Zain, there are several small states across the mountain range. After the destruction of the kingdom, a battle with those countries awaits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of preparing for the next battle, the Imperial Army wanted to win without fighting as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So why are we launching a full-scale attack now?　Are you going to change your policy of aiming for political victory without forcing a battle?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu,&#8230;&#8230; I didn&#8217;t intend to force a fight either, but&#8230;.I have a feeling that the atmosphere in the fortress has changed, hasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen stared at the fortress with a serious expression on his face, a change from the face of an old man spoiling his granddaughter. Safaris spat nervously at the look on the old general&#8217;s face, who has been defending the Empire for so many years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday, the Royal Army defending the fortress had an air of resignation about them, but today it feels very different. There&#8217;s an air of activity, an air that somehow seems to be coming back to life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it have something to do with the reinforcements that&#8230;..entered the fortress yesterday?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The watchman who guarded Fort Blaine reported that reinforcements from the direction of Royal Capital had entered the fortress. Only a hundred soldiers entered the fortress. This is not an alarming number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or perhaps the key could be the person who was said to have entered the fortress in a carriage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The carriage &#8230;&#8230;Don’t tell me!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris&#8217; eyes widened. The young man, who was supposed to be calm and collected, surprised with elation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Has the king, Granard Zain, entered the fortress?　Then it makes sense that the morale of the Kingdom&#8217;s army would be boosted”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu&#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s a possibility.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen nods his head while quieting his excited deputy with his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the national crisis, King Granard of the Kingdom of Zain has never moved from his seat in the royal capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is a good chance that he has raised his heavy hand, believing that he cannot win the war if the situation remains the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If this fortress is dropped, the kingdom is finished. Has he finally moved&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is worrying is that there has been no word from the nobles in the royal palace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the kingdom&#8217;s nobles working in the royal palace had already made secret agreements to turn side, and had been informed of the situation in the royal capital. However, they have not reported that the King has moved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They may have noticed the traitors.　Or they may have decided that the kingdom might be picking up and are weighing the scales against us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris frowned uncomfortably and spat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Safaris, who are deeply loyal to the Empire, nobles who betray their lord as soon as they are cornered are an object of hatred. Even if it worked to his country&#8217;s advantage, he could not erase his ill-feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It could be the opportunist nobility. The royal palace is more than a battlefield, it&#8217;s an underworld. It&#8217;s the same in every country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barze sighs heavily and turns his distant eyes skywards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, Barzen had also been caught up in the intrigues of imperial aristocrats and politicians, and had painful experiences. He has lost some of his most trusted subordinates because of them, and he does not have good feelings towards those in power who control politics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old general, whose shoulders seem to have fallen, is approached from behind by Celia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know about conspiracies or anything like that, but you mustn&#8217;t let your spirit down. Grandpa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oya? Does Her Highness the Princess have her own thoughts on the matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until now, Celia has wielded a sword on the battlefield, but has never meddled in military policy. Her sudden advice makes Barzen&#8217;s eyes go black and white.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ummm&#8230;&#8230;something, Claíomh Solas has been making a lot of noise since a while ago. There is something in that fortress. Something that threatens us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia  says, stroking the hilt of the sword at her waist &#8211; the HolySword: Excalibur Claíomh Solas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Dáinsleif, which is also a holy sword, is a bit more rugged and unadorned, Claíomh Solas is a bit more slender and has an elaborate design on the hilt and scabbard. The white blade in the scabbard emitted crackling, bluish-white sparks and vibrated repeatedly in small increments, as if to warn of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Ceilia&#8217;s advice, Barzen, the commanding officer, also raises his eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Her Highness the Princess, the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder, says so, then her advice is worth its weight in gold. We must deal a crushing blow to the Kingdom&#8217;s army before that someone or something turns the tide of the battlefield&#8230;&#8230; mu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was movement in Fort Blaine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gates, which had been tightly closed, were opened and soldiers emerged from within.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers who emerged from the fortress quickly formed up under the direction of a person who appeared to be the commander.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;ve come out from the fortress!? You&#8217;re not going to fight us in the field, is it?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the secret report, there are approximately 10,000 soldiers in Fort Blaine. The Imperial Army, on the other hand, has 30,000.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it were a siege in a fortress or fortress, the Empire would surely win the battle on the plain, where superiority in numbers makes the difference between victory and defeat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Bazel Garst is not so incompetent that he doesn&#8217;t know this!　Then, he must have a trump card that will allow him to die and live again!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, this remains an excellent opportunity for the Empire side. If the enemy has set a trap, then they will just have to smash the whole trap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Safaris, we will crush the Kingdom’s Army here!　Have the troops ready to charge!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The enemy has formed a dense square formation of soldiers. We must spread out to the sides, surround them from all sides and crush them!　The First Army will lead, followed by the Second Army. The Third Army will follow the enemy&#8217;s movements and cover the encirclement!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir! I will send out instructions to everyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safaris ran at Barzen&#8217;s command.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old general and the princess knight, left on the hill, glared down at the kingdom&#8217;s army, which was lined up side by side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandpa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. This battle, you can never be too careful. If there is a special circumstance, I would like Your Highness to be at the front.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s what the Holy Sword is for!　You can count on it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Celia squeezes the hilt of her sword, Claíomh Solas sparks blue-white sparks in response to it’s owner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until we know the identity of the enemy&#8217;s trump card, be cautious. If by any chance Your Highness is struck down, we will be defeated at that point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I know. But when the time comes, I won&#8217;t hesitate!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Celia said this firmly, with her chest puffed out, Barzen nodded with a slightly relaxed look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, at Fort Blaine. Raidorl and Bazel stood side by side on the ramparts, looking down on the plain that was to become the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Below them, the soldiers of the Kingdom’s Army are in formation, preparing for a field battle with the Empire’s Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I&#8217;m surprised. How could you ever think of fighting out there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl opens his mouth in a ridiculously teasing tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In war, the greater the number, the greater the advantage. This is common sense that even a child can understand, without daring to explain it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would the Kingdom Army, which until now had been holed up in fortresses playing a defensive move, now decide to go into the field?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have been holed up until now because we had no other recourse. Your Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel replied, his face as tight as a rock as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if we fought them in the field, there would be no chance of victory. The other side outnumbers us, and the enemy even has a Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder. But now we have His Royal Highness..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re giving too much credit. It&#8217;s my first time fighting a human, let alone a demon. It&#8217;s only the second time I&#8217;ve drawn the holy sword. It&#8217;s a lot of pressure to be relied on so much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel glanced sideways at Raidorl, who was cowering his shoulders and making a frightening gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he was speaking with a sense of humility, Raidorl&#8217;s eyes were filled with a burning confidence. He did not seem to think in the slightest that he would be defeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five years ago, the boy was teary-eyed after being betrayed by his brother, but now he has grown as strong as a flying dragon flapping its wings in the sky. Bazel felt truly encouraged by this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is true that relying on individual strength to fight a war is the height of recklessness. But we have no other choice but to rely on His Highness. If we continue to cower, the kingdom will eventually rot from the inside out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From within &#8230;&#8230;?　Are there traitors in the kingdom?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too many to count. And there will be more in the future.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel makes a surprising guess without changing his expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is certain that there are people inside the court who are in league with the Empire. And it seems that the Empire is sending secret agents to influential people around the kingdom to plot against us. We don&#8217;t know how many traitors there are at the moment, but the longer the war drags on, the more people will turn to the Empire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. So the Imperial Army was able to win without receiving heavy casualties, so they were able to stand their ground and attack with ease? This is a widow army. Traitors in the back. It&#8217;s a situation that makes me want to cry. I don&#8217;t think the aristocrats on that side&#8230;..are entirely to blame, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Betrayal is an abhorrent act. But Raidorl had no intention of blaming him for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, a monarchy allows the king the right to rule over the people with privileges because he protects his lands and people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he can no longer protect the country, he is no longer worthy of being a respected king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same applies to the nobles. What is important to them is their own home and territory, and they have no obligation to risk their lives to serve a royal family that cannot guarantee their safety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If the plundering continues, the Kingdom of Zain will be destroyed, even if the fortress is defended. To avoid this, we have no choice but to win this battle in the short term.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I see. I understand. So what should I do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an adventurer, Raidorl is one of the best swordsman in the kingdom. This is also guaranteed by his sword master, Zafis Bartolomeo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in warfare, he was no different from a new soldier on his first battle. Raidorl never felt like he could command and move an army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness will stand by until the time comes. And when the time comes, you can wield your sword to your heart&#8217;s content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s easy to understand&#8230;&#8230;.By the way, you said the Imperial Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder uses the Holy Sword of Thunder, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;..The holy sword: Excalibur Claíomh Solas, which governs thunder. Its wielder is the Imperial Princess Celia Von Arslanian.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An Imperial Princess&#8230;.the enemy Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder, a woman?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl asks back with surprise at the information he has not heard before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl took the liberty of imagining a strong warrior like Bazel wielding a holy sword, but it seems he was mistaken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be on your guard, even if she is a woman. It is because of that girl that Fort Balmes has fallen and the Royal Army has been pushed to this point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bazel&#8217;s rocky face moves slightly. His lips twist in frustration and regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how many tricks we put up, no matter how careful we are, she defeats us as easily as if she was brushing away a spider&#8217;s web with a branch. &#8230;..As abominable as that sounds, that&#8217;s what a hero is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee,so she’s the quintessential Holy Sword:Excalibur holder,eh? That&#8217;s interesting&#8230;..It makes my blood boil.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s mouth hangs open in amusement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the frontier cities, he has encountered powerful demons many times, and has even faced life-threatening encounters on many occasions. The other day, he even fought a basilisk, a sub-dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he were to place such past powerful enemies on the same scale, the imperial Holy Sword:Excalibur holder that he will fight in the future would be superior,not inferior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;..here I am. I&#8217;m going to show the Empire that there is more than one hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no trace of fear or nervousness in Raidorl&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how strong an enemy stood in his way, there was no way he could ever be defeated by the man he was now. He was not careless or proud, but clearly convinced of this.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There was no way I could lose. I have this guy now.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl gripped the hilt of his Dáinsleif tightly. The holy sword at his waist lightly pulsated as if to say, [Leave it to me].</span></p>
