<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small country in the western part of the continent &#8211; the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sandwiched between the great Arslanian Empire to the east and a group of several smaller states across the mountain range to the west, the country is a monarchy with a 200-year history since its foundation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A boy &#8211; Raidorl &#8211; was born into the world as the second prince of the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the misfortune of losing his mother in an accident when he was a child, Raidorl&#8217;s life has generally been a smooth sailing. He was able to live until the age of 13 without serious injury or illness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His character is clever and honest. His curiosity is quite vigorous, and he sometimes escapes from the royal palace to go on 『adventures』 in the castle town, often to the annoyance of his caretakers. However, his silver hair and red eyes, similar to those of her mother from the north of the continent, were very eye-catching, and he was soon brought back and constantly scolded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although his academic performance in politics, economics and other subjects has been somewhat subpar, his swordsmanship is outstanding that even his instructor is astonished. He has already won a mock battle against a grown-up adult knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the second prince, he could not take the throne as long as his elder brother prince was still alive and well, but Raidorl adored his elder brother, who was ten years older than him, and had no complaints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If nothing had happened, Raidorl&#8217;s life would have gone on peacefully from then on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of adult do you want to be in the future, Raidorl-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something wrong, Tina? Suddenly asking me weird questions”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question was posed by his childhood sweetheart, Mertina Marcell, to which Raidorl raised his eyebrows suspiciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them are in the Zain Royal Palace, the heart of the capital. They are in a garden built in the courtyard of the palace. Raidorl and Mertina were sitting on a bench in the middle of the garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spring garden was full of colourful flowers and the sweet scent tickled their noses on the breeze. A handkerchief was spread out on Meltina&#8217;s lap, and a few flowers picked from the flowerbeds were laid out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl is the son of the current king. Mertina is the daughter of the prime minister, a close associate of the king. Both are the same age of thirteen, and both were well dressed as children due to their status as a prince and a noblewoman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two, who are also close in status, have spent a lot of time together as childhood friends since they were born, and it is planned that they will be formally engaged once they come of age. It was what is known as a 『political marriage』, but the two showed no signs of dissatisfaction. Raidorl&#8217;s eyes show a fondness for Mertina, and Meltina seems to accept the affection shown to her by the prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, as usual, Mertina has been taken to the royal palace by her father, and Raidorl is in the middle of a conversation with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not urgent. Raidorl-sama will come of age next month, so I was just wondering what your plans are after that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina shakes her purple hair and looks at Raidorl&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young lady, Mertina Marcell, is a lovely-looking girl to look at. Her hair and eyes are the shade of purple crystal. Skin as white as freshly cut marble. Although still a child, she is not stunted, and her slender body has feminine roundness in all the right places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her ruffled peach-coloured dress suited the lovely young lady very well, and the way she sat in the garden was like a bewitching spirit of flowers.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s right, yeah,&#8230;..I haven&#8217;t thought about it much, but surely it&#8217;s time to start thinking about it properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gazed at up close by a childhood friend who is acquiring a more mature charm with each passing year, Raidorl flinches slightly as he ponders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next month, Raidorlr will turn thirteen, which means he will reach the age of adulthood in this country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl will not be able to play around as children as he has done in the past. He will have to take on some kind of job as an adult in the not too distant future, though probably not immediately as an adult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably kinda obvious, but would I want a job where I can support my brother, who will eventually become king.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ara?　That’s Surprising. I thought, 『I want to be an adventurer and travel the world!』 I thought you were going to say something like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who do you think I am!　I&#8217;m a prince born into the Zain royal family too. I will not irresponsibly abandon my royal duties!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina is astonished and, with Raidorl’s arms crossed, shares his vision of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Becoming your brother&#8217;s vassal? Isn&#8217;t the prime minister and minister&#8230;.a bit too much for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not very good at studying, am I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Yes, how about a job where you can swing a sword and fight, like to be a knight or a military officer, defending this country against enemy invasion. That would be perfect for you, Raidorl!　I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll make a wonderful knight!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Uu—unn! I know Tina would agree!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slightly embarrassed by Mertina, who clasped her hands together and shouted floridly, Raidorl said, [Right!] and rose from the bench with his chest puffed out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I&#8217;m going to be a hero, I&#8217;ll be a hero who can protect my country from all dangers!　I will use my sword to slay demons, armies of other nations, and all enemies that threaten the Kingdom of Zain, and become a hero who will go down in history!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina is involuntarily blown away by Raidorl, who utters boyishly grandiose words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Did you just laugh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I didn&#8217;t laugh! It’s a very nice dream to have&#8230;&#8230; fufu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it!　That’s terrible Tina, to laugh at people&#8217;s dreams!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re a hero&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sulked and turned away from Mertina, who was finally laughing in earnest with her back arched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The prince&#8217;s face turns embarrassed to look at her and a large palm is placed on his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re telling an interesting story, Rai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;&#8230;Ni–san!”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before he knew it, standing behind him was Raidorl&#8217;s older brother, Granard Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first prince, who was already over 20 years old, had brown hair and eyes, and at first glance it would be hard to tell that he was a brother to the silver-haired, red-eyed Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not because of any dramatic circumstance such as 『they are not actually brothers』, but simply because Granard resembles his father and Raidorl resembles his mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a nice dream, isn&#8217;t it? Becoming a hero. &#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a great goal, worthy of a royal boy. After all, a man should be able to talk about dreams as big as that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mwu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard laughs and pats his brother on the head. Despite his frustration at being treated like a child by a brother ten years older than him, Raidorl seems to enjoy the comfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are right, my dear child. Your Highness Raidorl&#8217;s dreams is wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-father&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Granard is the Prime Minister, Lockwood Marcell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Mertina’s father saw her laughing hysterically, which is not typical of a daughter, Mertina looked somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The prime minister&#8217;s expression was calm, but there was a reproachful tinge in his eyes as he looked at Mertina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mertina placed the flowers in her lap on the bench, stood up, fingered the edge of her skirt and bowed her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have been rude. Your Highness Raidorl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that&#8217;s fine&#8230;&#8230;But more importantly, Ni–san, are you free now? If you have time, would you like to go on a long run with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl invited his older brother to play, but Granard lowered his eyebrows in hesitance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry &#8230;&#8230; I have some business I need to clear up with Lockwood now. Apparently, Father hasn&#8217;t been feeling well lately.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, &#8230;it’s okay if you can&#8217;t help it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the apologetic look on his older brother&#8217;s face, Raidorl shook his head hurriedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their father, the current King Bernard, had been suffering from lung problems for several months and was unable to get out of bed. As a result, Granard has been conducting political affairs as acting king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rai&#8230;&#8230;I’m sorry I haven&#8217;t been able to keep you company lately. I know you must be feeling lonely after what happened to father.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not a problem!　Ni–san has a job to do as acting king, I don&#8217;t blame you!　I have Tina and my other subjects are good to me. I won’t be lonely at all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;d appreciate you saying so. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard relaxes his face at his little brother&#8217;s concern for him, but&#8230;..suddenly a shadow appears on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hero,is it&#8230;&#8230;well, you&#8217;re about to have your coming of age ceremony. In that place, the 『Holy Sword Room』&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ni–san?Is there something wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl tilted his head at his brother, who murmured with a somewhat thoughtful expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard immediately returns to his usual gentle face and pats Raidorl on the head again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s nothing. Rai, it&#8217;s not easy being a hero. No one, including me, has ever been chosen by the 『Holy Sword』 of this country. But if it were you, you would be a great hero even without the Holy Sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ni–san&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be the strongest hero and protect this country. You will support me, won&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Of course!”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl nodded his head vigorously. He tapped his chest with a thump with Mertina giggling next to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will be a great hero. I will become one!　I will become so strong that no one can beat me, and I will be able to protect my Ni–san, Tina and even the Kingdom of Zain!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard nodded back at Raidorl with a calm expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a scene from a time when the two princes were still on friendly terms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl did not yet know reality. It is a memory from before he experienced the pitch-black betrayal and the deep red bloodstained battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later, Raidorl Zain&#8217;s dreams would come true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy who could only talk about his dreams would become a hero with wings as powerful as those of the Phoenix King, and would fly into the sky of the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But &#8211; as yet &#8211; Raidorl did not know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heroes who shine like stars in history. None of them have been able to become heroes without being sacrificed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every person who is called a hero has experienced many tragedies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They kill their enemies, bathe in their blood, get themselves covered in wounds and bleed. After betraying and being betrayed, they become known as heroes. Sometimes they even kill their parents and brothers and lose their homeland in the fires of war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the moment when Raidorl will become a hero in exchange for many sacrifices is approaching step by step like a demon lurking in the darkness.</span></p>
