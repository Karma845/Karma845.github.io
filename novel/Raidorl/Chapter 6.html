<h3>Chapter 6 - Reunion and Farewell.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: Now, Raidorl called Granard 『Aniue』instead of 『Niisan』which is more closer in ranking,But I use older brother or just brother to make easier)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, Raidorl was taken to the royal palace by Darren, who came to pick him up. He was to have an audience with his brother, Granard, who had become king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was an audience with the king, he could not take his maid Neimilia with him and had to leave her at the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in case of emergency, a servant demon created by Neimilia lurks in the shadows and is supposed to help him escape from the castle in the event of a catastrophe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After returning to the royal palace for the first time in five years, Raidorl was made to wait in the parlour with Darren until Granard was ready for an audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he used to live in the royal palace, he feels more distant than nostalgic. Some of the servants he passed were familiar to him, but they all had awkward expressions on their faces and quickly turned their heads away from him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl knew he wasn’t the right person to be here. But he felt like he was being told that he wasn&#8217;t allowed to be here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry to have kept you waiting. Please come through to the audience chamber.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for about ten minutes, a man who appeared to be a civil servant came to guide them. Apparently everything was ready, and Raidorl was escorted to the audience chamber.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience chamber had a long carpeted floor from the door to the back, with rows of nobles, knights lined up on either side across the carpet, and a throne for the king to sit on further back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have brought His Royal Highness Raidorl Zain”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren gives a dusty greeting as he enters the room, and then urges Raidorl to come forward. Having done his duty, Darren steps aside and joins the line of knights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your hard work. “</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man sitting on the throne opens his mouth in a stern and reverential manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing his voice, Raidorl frowned slightly. The voice sounded familiar, of course. The voice belonged to his own blood brother, Granard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sniffed lightly. He stomped his way across the carpet to the far end of the room and, just before nearing his brother, dropped to one knee and bowed his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raise your face. Raidorl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard says in a grave tone, and Raidorl follows his brother&#8217;s words and raises his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man looking at him and sitting higher than Raidorl, is Granard Zain.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is Raidorl&#8217;s older brother and was responsible for banishing him, who became the holder of the Dáinsleif, from Royal Capital.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; have you lost some weight?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he looked at Granard, who was sitting on his throne and looking down at him, Raidorl thought vaguely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His brother, ten years older than him, looked a little more gaunt than Raidorl remembered, and his head was beginning to show some white.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Being a king is a very hard job, isn&#8217;t it? How could my brother be so skinny and grey?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding back a smile from forming on his lips, Raidorl waits for the King to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard looked at Raidorl in silence for a moment, and then opened his mouth solemnly.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome, Raidorl. My younger brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, it&#8217;s been a long time. Your Majesty the King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm &#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t talk to me like a stranger. Even if I’m king, we are brothers. You can call me as you used to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then, I&#8217;ll take your word for it&#8230;&#8230;brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard dare Raidorl to call him 『Niisan』 instead of 『Aniue』 as in the past, but at a distance. Since they don&#8217;t use nicknames any more either, Raidorl guesses they&#8217;re even.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl takes a breath and restrains his heart from rising.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Stranger?　Brothers?　You banished me for no reason, and now you&#8217;re talking nonsense!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am very sorry that I could not attend our father&#8217;s funeral. I also ask you to forgive me for my inability to support my own brother the king to this day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all right. You have fulfilled your role of keeping the demons at bay in the southern frontier cities. Your success has reached the royal capital. You are indeed my brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a waste of words, brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and Granard. The two brothers continue their conversation in a cheerful manner with a smile on their lips.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the vassals watching around them watched the brothers&#8217; conversation with an indescribably anxious expression. They had expected the reunion between the exiled prince and the king to be a rather bleak affair, but the two conversing in a surprisingly friendly manner stirred their anxiety instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation, which seemed to be only superficially mended, was like that of a volcano on the verge of erupting, radiating an atmosphere of urgency that could explode at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brothers exchange words of reunion in a friendly manner. At the sight of the two, Prime Minister Lockwood Marcell, who was waiting right next to the throne, also had a bitter expression on his face, as if he were biting the earth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is a surprise. I never thought their relationship would be so strained&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How many of the vassals observing the audience would have noticed? From a moment ago, neither Granard, who is sitting on his throne, nor Raidorl, who is kneeling in front of him, has been smiling but neither of their eyes is smiling at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how softly they talk to each other, the eyes of both of them are hostile and they are glaring at each other as if they are slashing at the other with their gazes.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It is to be expected that His Highness Raidorl holds a grudge against His Majesty the King. However, I never thought that even His Majesty would have such refractory feelings towards His Highness&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Granard was born as the first prince of the previous king, Bernard, he had a deep respect for the first king, who was a Excalibur holder, from an early age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had been educated as a crown prince with the ambition of eventually being chosen as the holder of the Holy Sword and leading the Kingdom of Zain to even greater prosperity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood, who was supporting Granard, was aware that Granard was jealous of Raidorl, who had become the holder of the holy sword Dáinsleif.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason Raidorl was banished to the frontier was not only to prevent the country from being divided between the first prince, who was conducting political affairs in place of the sick king, and the second prince, who had become the holder of the Holy Sword Excalibur. One of the reasons for this was the fire of backward and delusional obsession that burned in Granard&#8217;s heart.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Even so, &#8230;&#8230; with the death of His Majesty the First and the accession of His Majesty Granard to the throne, his position was already so secure that there was no way for a succession struggle to take place. I had thought that the feeling of vindictiveness towards His Highness Raidorl had somewhat cleared up. &#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the disgust and jealousy that Granard harbours is far deeper than Lockwood had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And no doubt, Raidorl is also aware of these black feelings.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The older brother who banished him still abhors him. He must have sensed this clearly and returned a hostile glare.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Will he really be able to &#8230;&#8230; win over His Highness Raidorl and make him fight against the Empire? And after winning the war against the Empire and saving the country from a national crisis, can the brothers be brought together amicably?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There is no way it can happen]. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Lockwood gulped down a nervous spit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; come to think of it, it seems that the daughter of Marcell who I sent as an emissary has been disrespectful?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the reunion, Granard cut to the chase as he recalled. The topic of discussion was the Prime Minister&#8217;s daughter, Mertina Marcell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been sent to the frontier city as an envoy to bring Raidorl to the capital, but was now being held on the charge of trying to bind Raidorl with a curse. She is still in the city and has been put into the prison cells of the Adventurers&#8217; Guild under the control of Zafis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I didn&#8217;t want to detain the Prime Minister&#8217;s daughter, but I had to take her into custody because of the circumstances. If Your Excellency wishes, I will release her and return her to you.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No, that won&#8217;t be necessary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood replied to Raidorl, who made the suggestion with a nonchalant expression on his face/</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My daughter has committed an unforgivable act in the service of the Zain royal family. Even if it was out of a desire to save the country, I am not in a position to beg for her help. Please, Your Highness, judge her as you wish.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if Your Excellency the Prime Minister says so, then I will do so.　She&#8217;s your precious, precious daughter, isn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl confirmed this with a nasty, hung-up lip. Lockwood, on the other hand, replies flatly without losing his hard expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, Your Highness. That daughter is no longer a member of House Marcell. Please boil her or roast her or do with her as you please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Aaa, agreed. I&#8217;ll do as I please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sniffed in a bored manner.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Lockwood were to stand up for Mertina here, it would be the perfect opportunity to pursue the Prime Minister for disrespect to the royal family and oust him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Lockwood had been disposed of, it would have reduced the power of his brother slightly, but it appears that this is not going to happen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘well, I knew the man was capable of cutting his heart out for the good of the country. I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sighs with resignation in his heart and quickly changes his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, brother. What business did you call me back to Royal Capital for?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he had already been briefed by Mertina and Darren, Raidorl dared to put it into words and ask the question. Granard&#8217;s eyebrows raised up when he got to the point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About that, &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve already heard, but the Arslanian Empire to the east has invaded our borders and invaded the Kingdom of Zain.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;The Empire has more troops than our country, and on top of that, even the Holy Excalibur Holder is following this invasion. The key border fortress of Balmes has already been defeated, and a third of the kingdom has been overrun. General Garst is holding the enemy forces, but at this rate the kingdom&#8217;s destruction will only be a matter of time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;.. what do you want me to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he asked, Raidorl clenched his fist fist tightly. The tip of the nail claw pierced his palm, causing a sharp pain. Even so, he does not relax his hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now, how do we get out of this?　This is the last turning point for us, remember?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Raidorl and Granard were to reconcile and join hands, this would be the last opportunity to do so. If Granard would bow his head and apologise, the deep rift that has been carved between them could be bridged a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if Granard says what Raidorl expects him to say, then the bond between the brothers will be completely severed. It can no longer be repaired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why Raidorl quietly waits for his brother to speak.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, what was released from Granard&#8217;s mouth were heartless words that extinguished the last hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Holy Excalibur Holder Raidorl Zain. To save the Kingdom of Zain, take the Dáinsleif in your hand and fight the Empire!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl bit his back teeth and closed both eyes tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the few remaining feelings for his brother in Raidorl&#8217;s heart were destroyed to pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard drove Raidorl to the frontier in order to reign as king and out of jealousy at being deprived of the Holy Sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And instead of apologising for this and repairing their relationship, he has used his authority as king as a shield to force him to fight unilaterally for his country.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their relationship is no longer that of brothers. One who uses and one who is used. It has become a relationship of ruler and slave.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see&#8230;&#8230;brother, you don&#8217;t really think of me as brother anymore, do you?　You think of me as nothing more than a pawn, a valuable pawn, don&#8217;t you?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s heart chills as if a block of ice has been thrown into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The days of being a close friend with his brother flashed through his mind. They soon fade away, relegated to the corners of his memory.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If that is your intention, I will show no mercy. I will take back what was taken from me and crush those who oppose me! I will not let them take my place again!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a determined will to break up burning like fire, Raidorl looked up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You order me&#8230;..? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding! You’re a king who was not even chosen by the Holy Sword. How can a king with such insecurity, who chose to banish his own brother out of jealousy, rule over me!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Raidorl&#8217;s eyes, the throne in front of his gaze was no longer just a prey to be snatched away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hence, Raidorl declares clearly and mercilessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry, but I must decline.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard&#8217;s eyebrows raised in a cold rejection. He probably did not expect his words to be rejected. A suspicious look flashed in his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is impolite to disobey a royal decree!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how much you may be the king&#8217;s brother, this is unforgivable!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience chamber was enveloped in a tumultuous atmosphere, with angry shouts of censure for rudeness coming from the vassals who were watching the situation around them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even when he was being accused from all sides, Raidorl’s expression remained unchanged. He opens his mouth without a single change of colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry, but I cannot fight the Empire. Brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. do you understand what you are saying?　This is a royal decree, remember?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much Raidorl is the king&#8217;s brother, he is not allowed to reject the king&#8217;s orders. The royal family is only related to the king by blood, but they are still his subjects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard&#8217;s eyes grow stern as he is told that his orders have been rejected. His fingertips are trembling in anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to see the king, who was about to shout, Lockwood spoke up instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness Raidorl!　You are disrespectful to His Majesty the King!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, Prime Minister, as the lord of the frontier city of Raid, I have the duty of preventing the invasion of the monsters of the jungle. It would be somewhat outrageous to ask me to abandon that duty and go to the border, far away from my territory, to fight without having been given much time to prepare. However royal the order may be, isn&#8217;t there a reason for things?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t be reasonable when your country is about to be destroyed! Don&#8217;t you know what your priorities are!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood exclaims, shrugging off his usual calm, to which Raidorl replies with a chilling sneer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose the importance of the mission to protect the border remains the same, regardless of whether we&#8217;re dealing with the Empire or demons. Or are there other lords besides me who are rushing to the border from the frontier to reinforce the troops?　My recollection is that only the Army and the Knights are standing up to the Empire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood is slightly at a loss for words. Seeing the opportunity, Raidorl slashes at him with more verbal blades and yields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There seem to be many landed nobles here, but how many troops did they have sent out?　I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re suggesting that I go to war with no forces other than a few adventurers, and they&#8217;re not manning up!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nobles around him began to murmur at his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large number of nobles serving in the Granard are gathered here, but most of them have not sent out troops under the guise of 『maintaining public order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was certainly reasonable for a Raidorl to refuse to fight when the nobles were also refusing to follow him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A murmur of agitation and bewilderment covers the audience chamber. Some of the nobles present nodded in agreement with Raidorl&#8217;s words, while others made a fuss about his disrespect for the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the king&#8217;s order to suddenly recall a prince who had been banished to the frontier and treated coldly and unilaterally order him to go to war is itself unreasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s argument was undoubtedly correct, except that it ignored the national crisis of enemy invasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood&#8217;s expression became austere at the sight of the nobles with divergent opinions, but he still managed to open his mouth again in an attempt to persuade Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, before the Prime Minister could utter a word, Granard spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? How do you propose to fight the Empire?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The noisy nobles quiet down at the sound of Granard&#8217;s voice, which is resentful and questioning, his shoulders shaking with anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard continues to speak, cutting through the air of the silent audience chamber.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you really don&#8217;t want to go to war, then all you have to do is not come to the Royal Capital in the first place. There must be some conditions. What is it? Money?　Status? Tell me what you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mended smile that was on Granard&#8217;s face earlier is no longer on his face as he says evasively. Instead, his expression was dominated by the contemptuous disdain with which he lambasted his petulant brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl was stared at with a face that was not, very likely, intended for his immediate family, his lips lifted sarcastically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why you’re the King, after all. You&#8217;re very quick to speak, thank you very much. The king must be a master at reading people&#8217;s minds, is that right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..State your demands. I will not listen to your flattery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood, then shall I ask what I want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl reached into his pocket and pulled out a rolled up piece of parchment from the inside pocket of his jacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am willing to fight the Empire if you accept the terms of my oath. If my brother, who is now king, is willing to do what his poor younger brother, who was driven from his birthplace, asks&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl says with a clownishly amused tone, Granard gives him a silent, reproachful look and verbally urges him to read it quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glaring at his brother king, Raidorl unfolded a rolled up piece of parchment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, Raidorl Zain, shall fight to defend the Kingdom of Zain from the Arslanian Empire if you agree to the following conditions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl stands tall and reads the text on the oath in a stern tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard, Lockwood and all the nobles present listen silently to the words being spun as they flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Condition One: King Granard shall guarantee the safety of the Raidorl within the Kingdom of Zain.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On hearing the first condition, Granard raised one eyebrow and snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contempt in Granard&#8217;s eyes deepened. Perhaps he thought that Raidorl was afraid that his brother would betray him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Condition Two, the Crown shall pay 100,000 gold coins in aid to the frontier city of Raid, which is governed by Raidorl.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jyu, 100,000&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A trembling voice was uttered by a man of noble birth with a fat belly and a sweating forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man, who holds the position of Minister of Finance in the royal court, calculates the amount of the reward demanded by Raidorl on the abacus in his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One hundred thousand gold coins is one tenth of the Zain kingdom&#8217;s national budget.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a country with a huge financial resource in the form of tax revenue from its people, it was not an amount that could not be paid, but even so, it was not a cheap sum.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘And now, moreover, it is wartime. It&#8217;s a headache when you think about the post-war reconstruction costs&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood gave the sweating Finance Minister a sideways glance and a sigh of sympathy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He feels sincere pity for his colleague, who is gaining weight from stress, but he still can&#8217;t help him out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One hundred thousand gold coins is a lot of money, but it is not an undeserved amount for the aid to the frontier city that continues to protect its southern border from demons. It is rather strange that the royal court has so far provided no assistance to the adventurer towns guarding the borders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Condition three, all property acquired by Raidorl in the war shall be the property of Raidorl, and the Crown shall not be able to demand its delivery.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood tilted his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a condition he doesn&#8217;t understand. Treasure and prisoners of war taken from the imperial army and taken for themselves. That is, well, a natural right, but he doesn&#8217;t understand why Raidorl would bother to remind them of it as a condition.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does His Highness, by any chance, have any goods he’s after? What on earth is he thinking&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood twisted his head, unable to read Raidorl&#8217;s thoughts. However, the untranslatable demands continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Condition Four, the Raidorl shall have the right to determine the treatment of prisoners of war captured by the Raidorl in the war.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Again&#8230;&#8230;Another odd condition. What is His Highness thinking?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is becoming dimly apparent that Raidorl has a straightforward plot, but Lockwood doesn&#8217;t know what its purpose is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from aid money, what is the purpose of demanding goods and prisoners of war? If he wants a reward, he should clearly state that as a condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood crosses his arms and ponders. And the elder brother King Granard, who listens to his brother&#8217;s words in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl looks at both of them in turn and takes a huffing breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And &#8230;&#8230; this is the last condition. 『Condition five, King Granard nominates his brother Raidorl as Crown Prince, to be the next King of the Kingdom.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At these words, the air in the audience chamber froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you an idiot!? Do you know what you are saying!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Lockwood who first shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of the normally calm Prime Minister distraught made the nobles around him realise once again the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The child, born some time after Raidorl was exiled to the frontier, was nominated as the Dauphin despite his young age, and was recognised by those around him as the next king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conditions demanded by Raidorl were like a clear statement that he would depose the prince and become the next king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how much he may be your royal brother, it&#8217;s disrespectful! To address the king and demand to be  a king&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood chokes up and Raidorl rolls up the parchment with the oath on it and rolls it around in his hands, as if he has said everything he needs to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister&#8217;s brow is furrowed at the sight of this tensionless figure, like a child playing with his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His Highness Raidorl&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raidorl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood still tries to argue, but is frozen by Granard&#8217;s quiet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister turned around and gulped and turned to his lord&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raidorl, are you serious about this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no anger in Granard&#8217;s voice as he asks his brother. But no one here would expect him to remain calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard&#8217;s face was stained with hatred and murderous intent that he no longer intended to hide. His face, which has turned red like a demon&#8217;s from rage, is contorted as if he is about to curse his brother to death, who stands before him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would also be the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The condition that Raidorl demanded, that he be the next king, was not simply that he would take away the position of the current crown prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is to become king in the event of the king&#8217;s death in a roundabout way, this could be taken as a declaration of war,[I will kill you and become the king myself.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The crown prince, the next king is my son Strauss!　I will not have you as my crown prince!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nobles present trembled at the argument which was uttered with murderous intent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard had been known as a fair man since he had once served as the king&#8217;s deputy. His attitude towards his brother was absurd, but he was never narrow-minded as a king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many of those present had never seen such a Granard possessed by anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Depending on his reply, he might order the soldiers to kill Raidorl on the spot. Even the air of such a bleakness was made to smell, and angry voices were hurled at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, Okay then. Ignore the last condition.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to his brother&#8217;s angry shouts, Raidorl simply dropped the condition. The palpable ease which he withdrew makes Granard look dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ I don&#8217;t have to be crown prince. I’ll remove it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl said in a calm tone but his lips lifted nastily in a grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“hee&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whose dazed voice was it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl simply dropped the condition, without showing any regret, those present all had disbelief in their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m saying that if you don&#8217;t like it that much, I&#8217;ll drop the last condition. It&#8217;s not like I really wanted to be crown prince.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a calm tone, Raidorl took a brush and inkwell from his pocket. He unfolded the rolled parchment again and, without hesitation, crossed out the last condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, so the only conditions are the four above. That&#8217;s alright with you, brother?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, mmm&#8230;yes&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard, who had been furious and angry earlier, is now being snuffed out like a willow. He was so stunned that he unintentionally nodded his head in agreement with Raidorl&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re convinced. I&#8217;ll get you to sign the oath right away.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So that was your aim&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Raidorl smiles with his arms crossed in satisfaction, Lockwood realised what he was aiming for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the start, Raidorl had never expected Granard to offer him the title of crown prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl gambled to state the conditions that would be denied, and then simply withdrew them when he received Granard&#8217;s furious outrage, as he aimed to do. By doing so, he made it easier for other demands to be met.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘His Highness Raidorl readily conceded to the conditions. If he takes advantage of this and presses for further concessions, it will make His Majesty look small.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all of the nobles present were loyal to Granard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they ostensibly follow Granard, the king, some are willing to turn on the enemy if they see an opening, partly because of the imperial invasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard could not afford to show that he was a small king in front of those who might betray him at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard seems to have come to the same conclusion as Lockwood, and accepts Raidorl&#8217;s claim with a bitter face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. fine. I&#8217;m fine with those conditions. I&#8217;ll have the mark brought to you at once, just wait a little.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no need for that, Brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard tried to order his men to bring him a seal to be used for official contracts, but Raidorl stops him away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are blood brothers. Then let us conclude the contract in a manner befitting that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A manner befitting a brother?　You&#8217;re not going to give me a verbal promise?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that makes you feel more secure, that&#8217;s fine, but&#8230;&#8230; well, let&#8217;s say we make a contract here with a blood seal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blood seal&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard wrinkled his brow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the name suggests, a blood seal is a contract signed in one&#8217;s own blood. Although it is not a legal means and has no official binding force, the contract is heavy because it uses one&#8217;s own blood instead of ink. Disobeying a contract signed with a blood seal is nothing less than an act of dishonouring the dignity of the soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness,&#8230;&#8230; may I say this, but to ask His Majesty Granard, the King, to shed blood is an act of disrespect.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There will be no disrespect now, but Lockwood will complain bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister, who has been looking a bit worn out since this audience began, smiles wryly and spreads his hands out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?　Indeed, my brother is the king at the top of this country. I may be royalty, but I am only a lord on the frontier. There is probably as much difference in our positions as there is between the heavens and the abyss. But now we have to face the national crisis of the imperial invasion together. Isn&#8217;t it natural for us to reconnect our brotherly bonds?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s true, but is there such a thing…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blood brothers enter into a covenant of faith with a covenant of blood. I can think of no more fitting means.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl stuck his right thumb in his mouth and bit off the tip of his finger with his canine teeth without hesitation. He then used the oozing blood to inscribe his name on the oath in a silky, smooth manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Done, I have written my name. What about you, brother?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When confronted with an oath inscribed with a red blood mark, Granard becomes even more grim-faced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I am willing to shed blood. What about you?]　He felt as if he had been provoked in that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you really don&#8217;t want to be in pain, then regular ink is fine. I won&#8217;t force you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. don&#8217;t make fun of me. Who is afraid of this level of fear? I never said I wouldn&#8217;t sign anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard ordered his knight to bring the oath from Raidorl&#8217;s hand, and he did the same, biting off the tip of his finger and writing his name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">King Granard Zain and his royal brother Raydor Zain. The names of the two royals are written in blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The oath with their names on it passed through the hands of the knight and was returned to Raidorl&#8217;s hand again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now you have nothing to complain about, Raidorl. Your terms are accepted. You will fight the Empire as you promised.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course. Our deal is done&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;『Activation』.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl briefly mumbled the words of a spellbook. The next moment, the oath is engulfed in black flames in his hand. The black flame that burnt the oath split in two and became a fist-sized fireball, which pierced the chests of Raidorl and Granard respectively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl accepts the black flame without blinking. Granard, by contrast, clutched his chest and rolled off his throne.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty!”</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p143-697x1024.jpg"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood cries out in horror, and the other nobles scream and shout in bewilderment. The audience chamber was instantly filled with angry shouts and clamour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Now the deal is done. Now, brace yourself. My fangs are deep, brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl murmured so loudly that no one could hear him, and a cold smile appeared on his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guards! Seize that wolf!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prime Minister Lockwood Marcell rushed to the fallen king and gave the knights a sharp order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights of the Kingsguard, who had been frozen by the unusual situation suddenly arose in the audience chamber, reflexively obeyed the order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three Kingsguard knights leap at Raidorl from the left, right and rear in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! Too slow, too slow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh &#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl grabs the arm of a knight who jumps on him from the right and uses his opponent&#8217;s momentum to throw him away and the one of the knights is blown away as they fold in on top of each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only one knight remains. As the Kingsguard knight attempted to pin the Raidorl down from behind, Raidorl turned around and unleashed a fist.A sharp blow with enough hip rotation struck the knight&#8217;s chin and shook his brain violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gi, ah &#8230;&#8230; kisa, ma &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go back to sleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight, who fell forward, still manages to raise himself up to catch the wolf who has harmed the king. Raidorl stomped mercilessly on the head of the loyal Kingsguard knight, causing him to fall into a coma this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All three knights, who were defeated in less than a few seconds, were chosen for the Kingsguard and are the most elite warriors in the Kingdom of Zain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at their fallen state, Raidorl lamentably covers his face with his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can the knights of the Kingsguard be this bad!　No wonder this kingdom is dying!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you lost your mind?, Your Highness&#8230;&#8230;!　I urge you not to put up any more resistance!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood releases a warning voice as he helps Granard up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the commotion in the audience chamber, soldiers rush through the door and surround Raidorl at a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What have you done to His Majesty the King!　This is an act of high treason.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treason &#8230;&#8230;? I just signed a contract, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do not intend to respond seriously, I will detain you!　After all that you have done, you cannot expect to be treated as royalty!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how strong Raidorl was, he was outnumbered on this occasion. If all the soldiers were to get involved at once, he would eventually be captured. And what awaits him after that is treatment as prisoners of war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite being confronted with such a future, Raidorl does not break his smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looks mockingly at Lockwood, who is standing by Granard&#8217;s side, and sticks up his middle finger provocatively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can do it, do it!　Only if you are prepared to lose your king!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Condition One: King Granard shall guarantee the safety of the Raidorl within the Kingdom of Zain.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the wording of the oath you just swore&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lockwood&#8217;s eyes narrowed dubiously, and Raidorl nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The deal is already made. Disobey and he will be punished.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That means&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl says in a taunting manner. Lockwood&#8217;s face paled as he realised what the traitor in front of him was trying to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean&#8230;&#8230;you&#8217;ve put a covenant curse on me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty Granard&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard raises himself up and glares at Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard is dressed in luxurious clothes as a king, but his chest is bare since it had been burned off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His bare skin was marked with red emblems, as if he had been hit with a burning iron. It was an eerie pattern of a serpent snake coiled around a sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s how it is. On each other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl&#8217;s chest was also burned by the flames and stripped bare, with the exact same crest as Granard&#8217;s on his well-proportioned, muscled chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you not realise the meaning of what you have done? to curse me, the&#8230;.. king, how could you be this foolish?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone in Granard&#8217;s voice contained not only anger, but also questions about his foolish brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『Curse of the Covenant』, which compels certain behaviours, is a widely known magic technique, used to punish criminals and to subjugate slaves. The coercive force is so strong that some punishments can even lead to death if the offender disobeys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the curses are never permanent. They can be lifted if the appropriate steps are taken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know what curse you have cast, but it will be lifted as soon as the court magicians gather. All that will be left is the crime you committed, Raidorl!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe. But I wouldn&#8217;t trust you otherwise. Brother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have an idea of how to lose credibility, don&#8217;t you? It wasn&#8217;t me who betrayed you, it was you, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He no longer intends to mend. Raidorl turns the blade of his words against his own brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Publicly accused of banishing him from Royal Capital to the frontier, Granard narrows his eyes and sincerely laments Raidorl’s folly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;If you had done as I told you&#8230;..as you were, I would have let you live, no matter how much of an eyesore you were. Are you getting carried away now that you’re the Holy Sword Excalibur Holder? Did you think you had surpassed me as king?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t know, do you?　I don&#8217;t feel I have the right to explain that to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granard was beyond angry and disgusted by Raidorl&#8217;s playful attitude, moreover Raidorl did not want to listen to him. He even feels pity for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Granard, Raidorl is an abominable being chosen by the holy sword Dáinsleif. He was a threat to his throne, and an infuriating opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, Granard did not actively want to kill his brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he had really disliked Raydor, he could have assassinated him instead of sending him to the frontier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;fine. I&#8217;ll honour the contract. You do what you want with what you have taken from the Empire. I will also provide aid to the frontier cities. But I will never forgive you for putting a curse on me. If you defeat the empire, you will have to prepare yourself for a suitable punishment!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then I&#8217;ll fight the Empire seriously too. I&#8217;ll show you how I&#8217;m going to save this country, and you&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re on a big ship.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl flutters and waves one hand in the air as he tries to leave the audience chamber. The soldiers surrounding him naturally make way.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Prepare yourself? That&#8217;s my line, brother.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They have already declared war. There is no need to hide their hostility, it’s time to rebel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What has been taken from him, he will take back. He will crush those who have taken from him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I will never let anyone take from me again.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is Raidorl’s belief, who was sent to the frontier after his place was taken away from him, and it is a pride that no one can compromise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I was not wrong in banishing you to the frontier!　The first king, the previous holder of the Dáinsleif, also killed his brother and founded this country!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Granard&#8217;s voice at his back, Raidorl leaves the throne room without looking back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the moment when the two brothers of the Zain royal blood were decisively separated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness! Why did you do that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl leaves the audience chamber and strides through the palace. Following behind him was Darren Garst, commander of the Kingdom&#8217;s army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he continues on his way, he glances sideways at Darren, who is questioning him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why, I was just reminding him not to break the &#8230;..contract.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, you don&#8217;t know what kind of punishment you&#8217;ll get &#8230;&#8230; for putting a curse on the king!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Punishment? Hey, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible as long as the curse is in place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The curse of the oath prevents Granard from taking any action that would harm Raidorl. Until the curse is lifted, Raidorl&#8217;s safety is guaranteed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The curse of the covenant, for example, will soon be lifted by the court magician!　If that happens, His Majesty&#8217;s wrath will be directed mercilessly at His Highness. I beg you, please apologise to His Majesty &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, you care about me. That&#8217;s very kind of you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl blinked at him in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren&#8217;s father is Bazel Garst, a general in the Kingdom of Zain. Bazel was Granard&#8217;s confidant and one of the central figures in favour of Raidorl&#8217;s banishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Indeed, my father was one of those who were in no small way involved in the banishment of His Highness. But that was only to prevent a succession struggle from breaking out because His Highness had become the Holder Excalibur, not because he had any grudge against His Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Whatever the reason is, I have no reason to forgive General Garst.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;my father knows that. My father was very saddened that His Highness was driven to the frontier to fight for our convenience.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl nodded silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the curse was placed on Granard in the audience chamber, the knights present attacked Raidorl. However, Darren, who should have been there, stood there without moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the reason Darren did not actively act to harm Raidorl was because he had his own thoughts on the matter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it sympathy or&#8230;..another emotion? Either way, though, I won&#8217;t condone you if you ultimately side with my brother.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The castle gate isn&#8217;t that way, is it?　Where are you going, your highness?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren sounded suspicious of Raidorl, who was heading in the wrong direction, making him think he was going straight out of the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without looking back at Darren, Raidorl walked silently and eventually arrived in front of a room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the room where the national treasure, the Dáinsleif, is enshrined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the room were two knights,surprised by the sudden appearance of Raidorl and Darren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, Raidorl&#8230;&#8230;! Sorry, this room&#8230;&#8230; without His Majesty&#8217;s permission.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like it&#8217;s locked. The key is&#8230;.. there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight tried to stop Raidorl from putting his hand on the door of the room, but his fist was mercilessly driven into his face. The knight was hit so hard that he spun around and fell to the floor as if in a heap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl took the key from the knight&#8217;s waist and inserted it into the keyhole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Wh-what&#8230;..!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other knight panicked and put his hand on his sword. Darren tapped the knight on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Enough. Stop it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Darren Garst the Thousand Horsemen!　But this is clearly&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I take full responsibility for it. It is nothing for you to worry about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Yes, sir. We have seen nothing. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have to take my colleague who fell asleep to the infirmary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the resigned look on Darren&#8217;s face, the knight seemed to have some idea of what was going on. He let go of the sword at his waist and disappeared across the corridor, dragging the unconscious knight with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl opens the door and slides into the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time he has been in the 『Room of the Holy Sword』since his coming-of-age ceremony. The room, with its white marble walls and floor, is almost unchanged from five years ago. What is different is that the jet-black Holy Sword is still on the pedestal in the centre of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The holy sword that Raidorl pulled out could not be thrust back in, and it would have taken several people to place the sword, which weighed as much as a huge stone, on the pedestal for anyone other than the chosen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A torrent of black miasma was spewing from the sword at the force of a storm, raging in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;kuuk!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren groans in horror and clutches his chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The miasma rising from the Holy Sword is like a whirlpool, churning the air in the room, raging like a miniature tornado.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Struck by the black winds, Darren kneels down unbearably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;”Ggh &#8230;&#8230; force is &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take it easy. This is a cursed wind that takes away your strength. If you try to force yourself to stand, you will wilt and die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness Raidorl&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl walks without hesitation through the black storm of holy swords. The cursed winds beat against his body, but the king&#8217;s brother continues to walk without moving an eyebrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Raidorl reaches the pedestal and grips the holy sword that is spreading the miasma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re very excited, aren&#8217;t you? Are you that happy to see me again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A strong wind blew out from the sword as if in protest,which became a blade and sliced through Raidorl&#8217;s cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay. Just a sweet bite.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl chuckles. The wound on his cheek is shallow, and in a few days it will have disappeared without a trace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holy Sword is not really resisting. It is not trying to hurt him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s&#8230;..sulking. He is just having a tantrum at the fact that the man he has chosen as his Excalibur Holder has left him alone for five years.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl slowly strokes the hilt of his Dáinsleif, as if to soothe a crying child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to my hand after five years. Holy Sword Dáinsleif!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring the blood running down his cheek, Raidorl lifted the holy sword from its pedestal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black holy sword, which no one had been able to pull out since the first king, was once again in Raidorl&#8217;s hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The storm that had raged through the room blew away. Instead, a jet-black aura, like an elaborate night darkness, swirled around Dáinsleif.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unintentional voice escapes Darren&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The emotion in his voice was a mix of fear and admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I witnessing a passage from the &#8230;.. heroic tale?　Does this mean this is the moment a new hero is born?”</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p155-697x1024.jpg"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking his shoulders, Darren bowed as if praying to God.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was dealing with a man who had cursed the king he served, a conspiratorial criminal. Knowing this, he couldn&#8217;t help but show his respect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His soul as a knight and his pride as a warrior demanded the utmost respect for the hero born before him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the gaze of the commander at his back, Raidorl raised his holy sword high above his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome home, master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia greeted Raidorl, who had returned to the mansion after retrieving the Holy Sword, with a prodigal, melting smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet but beautiful expression on her face, like sugar candy, will captivate the opposite sex and even the same sex to the point of dreaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite such a smile being directed at him, Raidorl&#8217;s response is nonchalant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He replied casually, but his gaze was directed at the [thing] lying on the floor, and he raised his eyebrows suspiciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s that? Where did you pick that up from?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t believe what I picked up! They came into the mansion without permission, so I got rid of them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five men lie at the feet of Neimilia, who waves her hands in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The men, all dressed in ragged clothes, which would not be seen in this section of the city where the nobility live, are all white eyed, foaming from their mouth and comatose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? Who are these people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to the torture I have conducted, it seems that they are an assassin hired by the nobility of this country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assassins&#8230;..Oioi, did they come after my life right off the bat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl showed so much violence in the presence of the king. It&#8217;s no surprise that he was the target of assassins.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Even so, they&#8217;re moving too fast. I thought that even if Granard&#8217;s men were to move, it would be after they had finished analysing the curse I had placed on him&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The curse placed on Granard by Raidorl should have triggered when Granard took action in breach of his covenant with him. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn&#8217;t it too quick to attack me before the curse is lifted?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, it seems these people were after me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, they were going to take me alive and take me somewhere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neimilia&#8217;s words caused Raidorl to ponder for a moment, and eventually he came to one conclusion and snapped his fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, hostages!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl is a hero chosen by the Holy Sword, a joker who can be said to hold the fate of this country in his own hands. There will be plenty of people in this country who want that power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not clear whether their employer, a nobleman, is under the king&#8217;s thumb or acting on his own initiative.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, they must have tried to seize Neimilia as a bargaining card against Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, that was a blind spot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that Raidorl had forgotten about Neimilia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because for Raidorl, Neimilia is not a &#8216;weak&#8217; existence to be protected, and therefore the idea of being taken hostage had never occurred to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, Neymilia&#8217;s true identity is that of the 『Six Witches of Doom』, the demons who nearly destroyed the world. Although she has lost most of her power due to the 200 years of sealing, her power is beyond the reach of ordinary people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Raidorl, who has received the blessing of the Holy Sword, is unsure if he can win without the Dáinsleif.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;..Maybe we should put someone on guard duty at the mansion from now on. If possible, I&#8217;d like adventurers from the frontier cities to come here&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers of the pioneering city of Raid are trusted comrades-in-arms who have eaten from the same pot together. They are far more reliable than the small, clean-cut, beautiful knights who guard the royal city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they are responsible for preventing the influx of demons from the southern jungle and will not be able to leave the frontier city easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is even more the case now that Raidorl, who was the best force in the pioneering city, has left the town.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Once the battle with the Empire is over, I will have to face my brother. I&#8217;d like to have at least a couple more usable limbs. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said that, this is Granard&#8217;s territory. Not many will take sides with Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if some ostensibly take his side, it does not necessarily mean that they are not under the breath of the Granard or the nobility.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If there is a chance, it is this fight against the Empire. If I achieve tangible results here, people might even betray Granard and join me.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this to happen, the results must be overwhelming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Victory is an absolute requirement, but it must be more than a crushing defeat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He must take credit for pulling the heads of his general, Darren Garst, and the other soldiers of the Kingdom&#8217;s army.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Then there&#8217;s only one head to take&#8230;&#8230;the Enemy’s Holy Sword holder!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, with everything is happening, Master. Which would you like to have, a bath or a meal? Or is it still me? It&#8217;s me, isn&#8217;t it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You never know when my brother&#8217;s hand will strike. So be on your guard for a while and stay out of my bed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cry came back more astonished than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl held both ears at the sheer volume of the cry, and his body was thrown back significantly.</span></p>
