<h3>Chapter 9 - The Two Holy Swords.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, for God&#8217;s sake!　You&#8217;ve just ruined the good mood I was in!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a howl of disgust, Raidorl thrust out the tip of his Dáinsleif. The black blades and flails from the tip of the sword around like a whip and strike at the Celia running down from the hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cursed sword fighting method 【Scorpion Thrust】!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imperial Style Sacred Sword Art 【Instant Thunder】!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before the black blade reached her body, Celia&#8217;s body disappeared with a flash of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the princess knight wielding a pale sword appears right in front of Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will defeat the enemies of the Empire!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A holy sword clad in lightning strikes Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quickly kicking the ground, Raidorl jumps backwards and dodges the killing blow. However, a thunderbolt that he was unable to dodge struck him on the shoulder, causing severe pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve done a nasty thing with your swiftness movement, haven&#8217;t you!　Is that your holy sword&#8217;s ability?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t call Claíomh Solas nasty!　You, who use such horrifying powers, I don&#8217;t want to hear it from you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and Celia glare at each other from a slight distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two are Excalibur holders, the chosen holder of the Sacred Sword of the Holy Sword. However, the two figures are so different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A King’s brother and an Imperial princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black sword and a white sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man clad in a dreadful miasma and a woman clad in a pale blue lightning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two, who are supposed to be living legends revived in the modern age, are in stark contrast and seem to be incompatible, like water and oil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, the hero chosen by the Holy Sword, why are you doing this! How many people do you think have died because of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia shouted as she thrust the tip of her sword at Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia’s figure,with lightning in the background,  is like a warrior maiden who condemns evil and is as divine as a mythological story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi,oi what are you talking about?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side, Raidorl, who was in the position of the demon who had been condemned, slightly narrowed his eyes and twisted his lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, it was the Empire that invaded the Zain Kingdom, wasn&#8217;t it? Did you start the war yourself, and then when you got pushed back, you just licked your chops and played the victim?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Empire is fighting to unite the continent and create a peaceful world! If the Empire unites the continent, everyone will be happy, why can&#8217;t you see that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Peace&#8230;..happiness&#8230;&#8230;? Ha, you sound like you&#8217;ve got a bug in your head!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sniffs mockingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words uttered by the maiden of thunder standing before him are so foul-smelling and purely selfish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This pure princess does not even doubt that she, the Empire, is just.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cannot conceive that others might suffer misfortune as a result of the aggression she has brought about under the guise of peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So this is what you get for being the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder of the Empire. You&#8217;re just a kid who doesn&#8217;t even know how tough the world is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha&#8230;..you&#8217;re not that much older than me!　Don&#8217;t treat me like a child!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I am making fun of you…..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia&#8217;s face turns red like an apple and she slashes at Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl also swiftly counter-attack, and the two holy swords collided head-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gugu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small explosion occurs between the clashing swords, and their bodies are blown apart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl positions himself in the air and lands on both legs, while Celia rolls on the ground and takes a passive stance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“【Scorpion Thrust 】!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl sent a slash towards Ceilia, who rolled on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“【Thunder–Tonitrus】!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia rose from the ground and fired lightning towards the oncoming jet-black slash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pale lightning broke through Raidorl&#8217;s curse slash and struck him back in the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl clucked his tongue and flew sideways. However, Celia appeared in the space where he flew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“【Instant Thunder】! —yah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Khh&#8230;&#8230;! Don&#8217;t fuck with me!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl repelled the swinging Claíomh Solas with  his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She also attempted to strike the Dáinsleif with her sword in return, but the attack, launched from an impossible posture, was avoided with a light step and only ended up gouging the ground under Celia&#8217;s feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t let you get away!　Spell Sword Fighting 【Stone-Eyed Goddess Medusa】!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He&#8230;&#8230;.kyaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl launches a ranged attack with his sword tip still striking the ground. A black dome with a radius of ten metres appears centred on Raidorl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a cursed space that petrified enemies and had the power to transform creatures taken into it into stone statues in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuhyaaa&#8230;&#8230;what was that,Mouu! It’s disgusting!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the dome disappeared, Celia appeared, unscatched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Celia is shaking off the black miasma that is entangling her body with a puzzled expression, she does not seem to be noticeably affected by the curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch&#8230;.. this is going to be troublesome. Blessing from the Holy Sword is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl realised his disadvantage and his face contorted bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl and Celia. It is impossible to say which of the two is the superior Excalibur Holder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that the cursed power of the Dáinsleif is less effective against Celia, who has the blessing of the Holy Sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Celia, who possesses a weapon with superior destructive power in the form of lightning, has an overwhelming advantage in terms of compatibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Arere? Is it by any chance, Onii-san?&#8230;.cornered?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Raidorl&#8217;s bitter expression, Celia smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia too must have realised her advantage. A proud look of triumph flashed across her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you surrender, shall I spare your life? Onii-san seems strong, and if you submit to the Empire, maybe Papa will hire you? Papa likes strong people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, thank you for your depressing and annoying concern!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The supercilious words, as if she had already won, were spat out by Raidorl with a spit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate to break it to you, but I&#8217;ve decided I will never stand in anyone else&#8217;s shoes again. The idea of entrusting my fate to an emperor I&#8217;ve never met makes me want to vomit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fummnn, I see. Okay then. I think it&#8217;s time to end this,am I right?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, Celia teleports and steps into Raidorl&#8217;s space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl intercepted her with Dáinsleif, his expression distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re&#8230;&#8230;annoying!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he avoided a direct hit at the very last moment, Raidorl’s body and clothes were covered with burns and scorch marks. Damage is gradually accumulating due to the lightning that he was unable to avoid, and impatience is becoming noticeable on his face.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aa&#8230;&#8230; this, I think I might have won.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Raidorl is cornered, Celia is convinced of her victory. With a smile of satisfaction, she releases more lightning in pursuit.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, a knight shouldn&#8217;t smile in the middle of a battle. It leads to carelessness and pride, and is not polite to the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even so, Celia can&#8217;t stop the muscles in her face from relaxing. The victory over a strong enemy who had never been fought before, a holy sword user of the same rank, had made her heart flutter uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not more than five minutes have passed in time since the fight between Raidorl and Celia began. Neither of them had sustained any noticeable external injuries, and to anyone other than those involved it would appear that the battle had only just begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in that short time, Celia had realised the decisive difference in strength between herself and her enemy and was convinced of her superiority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl Zain was the first enemy Ce;ia had fought as an enemy, the Holy Sword:Excalibur holder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because, although there are three holy swords in the Arslanian Empire, including Celia&#8217;s Claíomh Solas, she has never seriously fought against an ally before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she witnessed Raidorl wielding the Holy Sword, Celia would break out in sweat at the rush of his power. His figure that transformed the battlefield by generating a huge black tornado was more like an evil god or demon from mythology than a hero chosen by the Holy Sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its sheer mighty power was even terrifying.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But &#8211;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s really amazing to draw that much power from the Holy Sword&#8230;&#8230;but that&#8217;s it. The output alone is not enough to beat me’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Celia could not unleash an attack capable of knocking down thousands of soldiers to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her father, the Emperor and Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder that wields Durandal, the Holy Sword of Fire, can burn an entire battlefield to the ground and Raidorl&#8217;s power would be comparable to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet &#8211; Celia thinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She will never be defeated. She is better than Raidorl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Onii-san. You realise that, don&#8217;t you? You can&#8217;t beat me with that holy sword, can you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia said in a sympathetic tone and swung her  Claíomh Solas at Raidorl.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl clicked his tongue and deflected the lightning slash with his Dáinsleif.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dáinsleif, a holy sword that creates a miasma of curses &#8211; a fearsome holy sword that wields abominable power on a scale that can change the terrain, cutting thousands of soldiers into pieces with its cursed slashes and putting them in a state of disrepair. Its power undoubtedly can single-handedly influence the course of battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in a battle between holy swords, their power is not so frightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder has received blessings from the Holy Sword and has gained strong resistance to curses and other abnormal conditions.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘And my power is lightning. It&#8217;s faster and sharper than a cursed slash!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the spirit of a warrior, Celia unleashes a lightning strike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl immediately intercepts it by sending out a slash, but the blade of miasma is slashed by the lightning and fizzles away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa, damn it! It doesn&#8217;t work after all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-san is very strong, but neither your power nor your speed can reach my lightning. That holy sword is even lower than Claíomh Solas, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re telling me, you made a false assumption about my partner!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl retorts with an abhorrent distorted expression, but in Celia&#8217;s eyes it is nothing more than the howl of a loser.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cursed slashes released by Dáinsleif are indeed troublesome, but they are far from the lightning that boasts an overwhelming amount of energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much more power Raidorl could use at once, if they clashed head-on, Celia would always win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-san—why don&#8217;t you just give up and surrender? If you surrender like an adult and meekly, I won&#8217;t do anything bad to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia expresses pity and advises Raidorl to surrender.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeating Raidorl was no longer a decisive factor in the Imperial Princess&#8217;s mind, and he was dropped [not even necessary to kill].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My papa, you know, he&#8217;s very tolerant of strong people.If Onii-san serves the Empire and wields the Holy Sword for the Empire, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be quite respectful”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..That&#8217;s a tempting proposition, isn&#8217;t it? Totally.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Realising that he is being underestimated as a lower-ranked man, Raidorl bites his back teeth in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the fighting spirit is still burning in his eyes, and Celia tilts her head at Raidorl unbreakable will to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-san, why are you trying so hard? Is the Kingdom of Zain that important to you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not important, but this country &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl peeled back his fang, like a beast growling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This country has abandoned me. They are using me. They are playing with my life for peace!　I have no attachment to such a country! I hate this country!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surrounding him are also soldiers from the kingdom. Even so, Raidorl is unable to suppress his emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why not?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Kingdom of Zain is defeated by the Arslanian Empire, His brother,King Granard will be executed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Raidorl may be able to survive, as Celia says, because he is recognised for his use as a Holy Sword:Excalibur holder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His brother, the object of his revenge, dies and he survives. If he only looks at the outcome, it doesn&#8217;t seem so bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you see, these feelings are mine. It&#8217;s mine and mine alone! I will not leave my revenge in someone else&#8217;s hands! I&#8217;m going to get my revenge with my own hands!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl raises his sword at Celia and says decisively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And there&#8217;s no point in surrendering in a battle I can &#8230;&#8230;win! I&#8217;m going to defeat you, the Empire, and push forward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still saying that….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia opened her mouth as if she were talking to a child who was not listening&#8230;.and the next moment, both eyes widened to their limits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「「OOOOOooooo！」」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud, angry shout echoed across the battlefield. This was the sound of a battle cry, the voice of an oncoming warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia hurriedly turned her neck to find the source of the voice and looked backwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a lie&#8230;&#8230; why is our position being attacked!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked back to see the imperial position built on top of a small hill was being attacked by someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, this isn&#8217;t a one-on-one duel. It&#8217;s a war. Princess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl says with the face of a bad boy who has successfully pulled off a well-crafted prank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia doesn&#8217;t hear a word of it. She just stood there cowering, looking up at the fire rising from her army&#8217;s position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be! Enemy surprise attack!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of the Imperial Army&#8217;s position, a mix of rage and chaos, Dallas Safaris screams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Army&#8217;s position on the hill was suddenly swamped by the Royal Army. Only about 500 soldiers were charged into his position. Looking at their numbers alone, they are not a foe to be feared by the Imperial Army, which has troops numbering in the tens of thousands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the Imperial Army soldiers were unable to fight back properly against the ambush they did not expect, and they were attacked unilaterally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened? How could no one have noticed? What were the guards doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cry from Safaris&#8217;s mouth was the cry of his soul. It was a question from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Army attacked the Imperial positions &#8211; that in itself was no surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Striking the enemy&#8217;s main camp is a usual tactic in warfare, and of course, Safaris is aware of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was not known was how they had managed to pull off the surprise attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We set up a position on a hill with a good vantage point to avoid being ambushed by the enemy!　So why didn&#8217;t anyone notice! How is it possible that we are being attacked?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it, Safaris!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ba, General Barzen, &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Placing his hand on his deputy&#8217;s shoulder, who is incredulous, Gracos Barzen says in a stern tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no point in saying &#8216;why&#8217;. There is only the result in front of you. We must accept the results in front of us and push harder.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;! I am sorry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At his superior&#8217;s words, Safaris opens his eyes and immediately tries to rally the confused soldiers of the Imperial Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With instructions flying, Barzen looked away from his second-in-command&#8217;s back as he ran through the ranks, clenched his fists tightly and stared at the enemy&#8217;s main blockade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve done it&#8230;&#8230;Bazel Garst!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From a hilltop far from the fortress, it is naturally impossible to see the enemy generals who would be standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Barzen could clearly see Bazel, who had succeeded in his ruse, with a smile of satisfaction on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, a position built on a hill with good visibility would be unlikely to be taken by surprise by the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it were night, it would still be understandable, but the sun is still shining in the sky. A sentry who fails to spot the shadow of the enemy under such a clear sky would have been disposed of by his allies before he is killed by the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was made possible by the young man who is now crossing swords with Princess Celia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that you used&#8230;..the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder as a diversion! To divert our attention away from a surprise attack&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason the Imperial Army was so successfully caught by surprise was they were blinded by the battle between Raidorl and Celia that was unfolding below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl scattering the wind of curses, and Celia unleashing lightning like the wrath of the heavens. The battle between the two holy sword-bearers, Excalibur Holder, looked like a scene out of mythology, and everyone present watched the battle with bated breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is why it was too late to notice the Royal Army&#8217;s ambush troops, who were approaching from the opposite direction of the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder is a trump card that rivals an army &#8230;&#8230; and I never thought you would use it to attract our attention&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen&#8217;s bearded face contorted in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it is not a mere diversion or decoy. It is not only the gaze of the Barzens that has been fished out, but also that of their princess, Celia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how they tried, they would not succeed in their assault if the Holy Sword:Excalibur Holder, Celia, remained in the camp. Raidorl&#8217;s spectacular outburst with a tornado probably had the purpose of luring Celia, out of the camp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve done it, young man&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to reflect on this later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barzen smacked his blue-streaked forehead and switched his attention back to the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial positions that had been attacked by the enemy were still in chaos, and the imperial soldiers were completely out of control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Safaris is shouting and trying to regroup, it will only be a matter of time before the enemy reaches him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The general of the Western Invasion Army of the Arslanian Empire is nominally the royal family Celia. However, it is Barzen who is in actual command, and if this old general were to be defeated, the Imperial Army would be torn apart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected, we have no choice but to concede defeat here. Shall we pull back and regroup?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but that&#8217;s a bit of a problem—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice from behind him made Barzen turn around in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had gone through so many battles, and he didn&#8217;t think anyone would be so easy to get behind him—and what caught the eyes of Barzen, who was surprised by such a startling revelation, was a girl dressed in an outfit that is out of place on the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A maid&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m a maid. Furifuriー.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of joke was this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing behind Barzen was a girl dressed in the kind of clothes worn by female servants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dark-haired girl, who looks about the same age as Celia, grabs the hem of her skirt with both hands and waves it frilly and happily, as if to say what&#8217;s funny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is a maid on the battlefield&#8230;&#8230;? Don&#8217;t tell me you’re a member of the Royal Army&#8230;..?”</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p249-697x1024.jpg"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay~,I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t have much time, so I&#8217;m going to finish my business here–【Shadow Binding】”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gunuuh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black shadow extends from the girl&#8217;s feet and wraps around Barzen&#8217;s body like a tentacle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the blink of an eye, the old general who has supported the Imperial Army for many years is bound hand and foot, and falls to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nuh-guh &#8230;&#8230;who the hell are you&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm, it&#8217;s still boring tying up old people! Well, I heard that if I catch you before the Royal Army, then Master will give me a reward. Shall we just leave it at that for the time being?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ma-master&#8230;&#8230;? You are not a Kingdom soldier&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, that’s close enough– The Imperials are on their way, so let&#8217;s get out of here, shall we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah…..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl in the maid&#8217;s uniform puts her palms together and instantly, Barzen&#8217;s eyes are enveloped in a pitch-black darkness.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Your Highness, Princess&#8230;&#8230;please run away&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bersen exclaims in his fading consciousness. The last thing he worries about is the imperial princess, whom he loves like a grandchild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the words never left his mouth and disappeared into the darkness along with Barzen&#8217;s consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When his second-in-command, Safaris, returned to Barzen&#8217;s side, his respected superior had disappeared without a trace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> 〇　　　　　　　　　〇　　　　　　　　　〇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Granpa! Everyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia screamed unbearably as she looked up at her allies&#8217; position under attack by the Royal Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She did not know where the Royal Guards who had launched the surprise attack had come from, but she could see from a distance that their position was about to be taken down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the camp, there are also her people she loves dearly, –especially Gracos Barzen, whom she respects like her own grandfather.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia loses her cool and tries to run towards her camp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Royal Highness, it’s not safe!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.tsu?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sharp voice called out to her. It belonged to an Imperial soldier who had survived the battle. At the same time, a cold killing spirit caressed the back of her neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia rushed to look back and saw Raidorl with his sword raised in the air, so close that she was horrified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not nice to turn your back, you know? You&#8217;re hurting me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuun!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no time to intercept. Celia concentrates all her attention on evasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She leaps backwards with her legs, which are almost tangled, and she bends her body so far back that her spine is in extreme pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kya&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a short, shrill cry, Raidorl delivers a slash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A jet-black sword passes right in front of Celia&#8217;s face as she evades. If she had avoided it a moment too late, her neck would have been cut in two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“【Instant Thunder】!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia has to get back to the camp as soon as possible &#8211; driven by such impatience, Celia activates the blessing of the Holy Sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The body of the imperial princess wearing mithril armour disappears and moves backwards more than ten metres in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll let you win for today! I&#8217;ll pay you back for this one day!&#8230;..eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiot! You&#8217;ll never get away with this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Celia retreated out of Raidorl&#8217;s surroundings, only to have her eyes widened in astonishment at the unexpected sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black disc is approaching in front of Celia&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it is not a disc. It was a sword that was flying towards her, spinning at a frightening speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the sword, which was coming at her like the blade of a guillotine, was Raidorl in a position where he had thrown something in the air. There is no holy sword Dáinsleif in his hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He threw it!!? The Holy Sword!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s impossible — an irrational scream echoed in the confused Celia&#8217;s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where in the world would a fool throw the hidden treasures created by God to punish his enemies?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man has no respect for legendary weapons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fly awayyyyy!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raidorl, who had thrown the Dáinsleif without hesitation, bared his sharp canine teeth and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For him, Excalibur Dáinsleif was the most reliable partner of all, but it was also the root of all the evil in his life. He is capable of throwing it away for the sake of victory without a second thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiguuuuu!!! Yooooouu!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she was taken aback by the unexpected attack, she still desperately tried to catch the enemy&#8217;s attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The instantaneous movement technique &#8211; 【Instant Thunder】, once used, cannot be used again without a cool time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only means of preventing the blade that is spinning and closing in on her is now the sword in her own hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dáinsleif is more than one size larger and thicker in shape than the Claíomh Solas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mass of Dáinsleif  as it spins and flies is no different from a lump of iron, and it is not very easy to catch it head-on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two holy swords overlapped each other and were sent flying backwards, tangling with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku, Claíomh Solas is&#8230;..Kyaaaaaa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow falls over Celia&#8217;s face as she loses the Holy Sword. The one who jumped in with the sun at his back was, of course, Raidorl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Raidorl and Celia have lost their holy swords. The means of attack taken by the weaponless Raidorl &#8211; was just a flying kick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky-high Raidorl kicked Celia in the abdomen with the same momentum that he had rushed through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuha&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mithril armour worn by Celia was not broken by the blow, but even so, it could not kill the impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The body of Celia  bent into a 『く』 shape and was blown backwards with great force. She bounces repeatedly on the ground like a ball before finally coming to a stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She falls limp, not moving a muscle, and is completely out cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imperial Princess Celia Von Arslanian! The King&#8217;s brother Raidorl Zain has strikes her down!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That can’t be&#8230;&#8230; Your Highness&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opposing Imperial soldiers shouted in despair and fell to their knees on the ground. With their positions lost and their lord defeated, there was no one in the Imperial Army who wanted to fight any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the time the sun set in the western sky, the battle for Fortress Blaine came to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Zain and the Empire of Arslanian. The battle between the two holy sword-bearers, ended with the victory of the Kingdom&#8217;s army.</span></p>
