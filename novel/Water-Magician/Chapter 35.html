<h3>Chapter 35 &#8211; Great Monster Battle</h3>


<p class="calibre2">Ryo and Abel were in a difficult situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, what is that …”</p><p class="calibre2">It was quite a distance ahead, but some giant creature was lying along the river.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s the first time I’m seeing one, but I think it’s a Behemoth …”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel answered quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, thinking with common sense, it was not a distance where it could hear them even if they talked normally, but it still made them think that they should talk softly.</p><p class="calibre2">If they made a mistake and it attacked …</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, seems like you can hunt it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“There is no way!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A huge monster with a total height of well over 100 meters.</p><p class="calibre2">And if it truly was a Behemoth, even if it was not a Dragon, they have not been reported to come in contact with people for more than a hundred years.</p><p class="calibre2">At least in the Kingdom of Knightley, no such report had been made.</p><p class="calibre2">“With such a gigantic body, it seems that it can easily block that free-falling Ice Wall 10 layers that I used against the Rock Golems.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo seemed to be having a little more fun than Abel, who had cold sweats and was keeping his voice down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To Ryo, It was a sight that he could never see when he was on Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">And it was a creature that did not exist on Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">Sure, he understood that there was a danger to their lives, but at the same time, he also realized that he was a little excited.</p><p class="calibre2">“First of all, it doesn’t seem like it will work. Ryo, definitely don’t try it, okay?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sheesh, Abel, don’t you think I’m such a crazy person?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, I do.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel nodded greatly.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was shocked to see that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, Ryo noticed something.</p><p class="calibre2">Something was approaching from the northern sky.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, something is coming from the sky over there.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel looked at the northern sky as he was told.</p><p class="calibre2">Even Abel, who had good eyesight, could see something approaching, but he could not tell what it was clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not clear but to be able to tell that 『something』 was flying from this distance, it was definitely a bird.</p><p class="calibre2">“Dragon …?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, their hands are wings, so they are Wyverns to be exact.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, the backward compatible version of Dragons!”</p><p class="calibre2">What a terrible way of putting it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Six Wyverns…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were many eyewitness accounts of Wyverns in the central countries.</p><p class="calibre2">And there were quite a few cases where caravans and villages had been attacked.</p><p class="calibre2">Although incomparable to a Dragon, they were still not something that adventurers and knights could manage with just a few people.&nbsp;Of course, that was against one Wyvern.</p><p class="calibre2">Now they were looking at six…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Those Wyverns … their goal is …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah. That Behemoth.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We get to watch a great monster battle!”</p><p class="calibre2">“No … it will be overwhelmingly tough for the Behemoth…”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel expressed his view.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel had participated in Wyvern subjugations several times before.</p><p class="calibre2">Therefore, he knew the strength and troublesomeness of Wyverns.</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t think Behi-chan will lose so easily!”</p><p class="calibre2">Before he knew it, Ryo had named it Behi-chan.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, surely, if you ignore its huge size, it looked like a hippopotamus so you can’t… can’t…can’t say that it’s not adorable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Attacking with numbers against just one target, they are a disgrace to the Dragon’s way.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Dragon’s way … Well, that’s true but they have an overwhelmingly advantage to be able to attack from the air. Wyverns can use Wind-Attribute Magic. Especially invisible attack spells like Air Slash and the superior spell Sonic Blade which is a bigger threat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sonic blade! Sonic blade from three body clones and a charging attack at the same time!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That tactic he calls a breakdown rush was something Ryo was particular about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Body clones are definitely impossible … and I have not heard of Sonic Blade accompanied by a charging attack?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel seriously answered Ryo’s delusions.&nbsp;He was a good guy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Behemoth that was lying down also began getting up to deal with the imminent threat.</p><p class="calibre2">Specifically, it just got on to its hands and knees.</p><p class="calibre2">The Behemoth on the ground and six Wyverns hovering in the air, the distance between them were about 40 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Wyverns initiated the fight.</p><p class="calibre2">They flapped their wings and seemingly attacked with Air Slashes.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo and Abel could only guess that they were Air Slashes because the slight air distortion caused by the casting of an Air Slash was not visible from that distance.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the Behemoth probably could recognize all the Air Slashes, including the number and trajectory of the shots.</p><p class="calibre2">Six human-head-sized pebbles instantly formed around the Behemoth.</p><p class="calibre2">As soon as they were created, the pebbles were released and accurately intercepted all the Air Slashes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ooo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“As expected of Behi-chan!”</p><p class="calibre2">“The next attack will likely be the ranged attack, Sonic Blade.”</p><p class="calibre2">Based on his past experience with Wyverns, Abel predicted the next move of the Wyverns.</p><p class="calibre2">“The trouble with Sonic Blade is that it splits into multiple blades after launch.”</p><p class="calibre2">“A saturation attack utilizing the power of numbers? Wind magic is terrible!”</p><p class="calibre2">There was nothing more troublesome than a spell that splits before landing.</p>     <p class="calibre2">As Abel envisioned, six Sonic Blades were fired from the six Wyverns.</p><p class="calibre2">Unlike Air Slash, Sonic Blade was a visible Wind-Attribute attack magic.</p><p class="calibre2">The six wind blades heading for Behemoth split into dozens of smaller blades after crossing half the distance.</p><p class="calibre2">But that may have been within the Behemoth’s expectations.</p><p class="calibre2">The Behemoth did not intercept with pebbles but created a huge stone wall in front of him from the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">The stone wall protected against all the Sonic Blades.</p><p class="calibre2">“I heard that the Behemoth was a monster of the earth, but I didn’t expect it to manipulate Earth-Attribute Magic so well.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I was expecting a melee battle but it turned out to be a magic battle.”</p><p class="calibre2">“In any case, it lacks a decisive hit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Wyverns, which were gathered in one place when they attacked, began to move and formed a circle to surround the Behemoth.</p><p class="calibre2">“It can’t possibly defend against attacks from all directions with the stone wall just now, what will it do?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ku … Good luck Behi-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Wyverns completed the circle and were about to release the Sonic Blades, Ryo felt a sense of discomfort.</p><p class="calibre2">That sense of discomfort was centered on the Behemoth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, he didn’t know the reason or the cause.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t know but it felt strange.</p><p class="calibre2">However, he had felt that sense of strangeness before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That discomfort rapidly spread from around the Behemoth and quickly encompassed the Wyverns.</p><p class="calibre2">The moment the Wyverns entered that zone, the Sonic Blades, which were about to be launched, were canceled and the Wyverns crashed to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">From the hovering state, they crashed as if they had lost lift in an instant…</p><p class="calibre2">“Paralysis? And in all directions?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No … it’s not that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Abel looked at Ryo, Ryo’s face was a little pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s probably magic nullification.”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, the discomfort that Ryo had felt before was the magical nullification that the one-eyed Assassin Hawk seemed to have acquired after evolution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Wyverns probably flew using magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Otherwise, it would be impossible to hover with such large bodies.</p><p class="calibre2">Gliding might be possible but hovering in the air would be impossible.</p><p class="calibre2">And that magic was sealed by the Behemoth and they crashed.</p><p class="calibre2">Although their magic was sealed so they can’t fly or attack with wind magic, they should be able to move if they were not paralyzed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that thought in mind, he saw that some of the grounded Wyverns got up and still displayed a fighting stance.</p><p class="calibre2">“Magic nullification? Making it impossible to use magic? Such a thing is possible? I’ve never heard of monsters using that, not to mention human Magicians. That’s impossible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Look. The fallen Wyverns are up. If they were paralyzed, they shouldn’t be able to move after they fall.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, you’re right. But magic nullification… that kind of thing … seems more likely to be a dungeon trap …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Dungeon!”</p><p class="calibre2">Speaking of fantasy, dungeons!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is there a dungeon in the Kingdom of Knightley?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, there is. The only dungeon in the central countries.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo got excited when he heard it.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s wonderful! So there is a dungeon trap with magic nullification.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never heard of such a trap in the dungeon in the kingdom. There apparently is such a trap in a dungeon in the western countries. A room with magic nullification space.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hoho. If there are dungeons, it won’t be strange to see monsters appear.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I think that’s strange enough …”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel frowned and shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is Ryo interested in dungeons?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course. I want to dive into one someday.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then, you’re in luck. The only dungeon in the central countries is in the City of Rune we are heading to.”</p><p class="calibre2">That information came as a surprise for Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">“What … Why did Abel keep silent about that until now!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, even if you say that … I didn’t know that Ryo was so interested in dungeons …”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fight continued on the battlefield while the two were talking.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it is more of a one-sided trampling than a battle …</p><p class="calibre2">The Wyverns lost their overwhelmingly advantageous position in the air, could not use attack magic, and could not fly.</p><p class="calibre2">On the other hand, the Behemoth was a sufficient threat with its huge body alone.</p><p class="calibre2">No matter what physical attack the Wyverns made, the Behemoth was not hurt.</p><p class="calibre2">What’s more, the Wyverns couldn’t use magic but the Behemoth could use it without any issues.</p><p class="calibre2">While trampling on one of the Wyverns with its foot, it hit a wyvern at the rear with stone to prevent it from escaping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one-sided battle was over in less than five minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">Six Wyvern corpses were lying there.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ve seen something scary.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, the Behemoth is terrifying.”</p><p class="calibre2">Before the battle, Abel thought that the Wyvern had an overwhelming advantage, but he never imagined that it would be such a one-sided development.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel swore firmly in his heart that he absolutely did not want to fight that.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, the second round is Abel vs. Behi-chan.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t joke around!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two intently gave the Behemoth, which was eating the Wyverns, a wide berth.</p>
