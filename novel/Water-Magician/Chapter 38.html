<h3>Chapter 38 &#8211; Ruler of the Sky</h3>

  
<p class="calibre2">A series of huge mountains towered in front of Ryo and Abel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Ryo first saw it, he thought of the Himalayas.</p><p class="calibre2">The mountain ridge that separates the Indian subcontinent and the Eurasian continent.&nbsp;Home to the world’s highest peak, Everest, the summit of the Gods locally called Chomolungma.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they were on Earth, it would have been extremely difficult to scale the summit without oxygen.</p><p class="calibre2">Moreover, they didn’t have decent equipment.</p><p class="calibre2">But even on Earth, some Nepalese high priests stay at the summit of Everest for 32 hours and spend 11 hours of which without additional oxygen supply.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case … it shouldn’t be difficult … maybe … for those who trained in 『Phi』to climbing without oxygen.</p>

<p class="calibre2">There was something that Abel found strange.</p><p class="calibre2">It was Ryo’s physical strength.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel was a B-class adventurer and Swordsman.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no doubt that his physical strength, including stamina, was top class among all humankind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo, who was keeping up with him without any problems, was a Magician.</p><p class="calibre2">Although it wasn’t a rule, fundamentally Magicians had poor physical strength.</p><p class="calibre2">If they were adventurers, they would have better physical strength than the average person, but they would still be considerably weaker than a Swordsman.</p><p class="calibre2">In fact, Abel’s party member, Rin, the Wind Magician, had terrible stamina.</p><p class="calibre2">Her low endurance was considerably bad even when compared against the priest in the same party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And yet.</p><p class="calibre2">Since the day he started traveling with Ryo, Ryo had no problems keeping pace with Abel’s movements and he didn’t even break a sweat.&nbsp;He wouldn’t have any problems even if he entered battle directly.</p><p class="calibre2">In a sense, it might even be possible to say that he was abnormal as a Magician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Ryo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong, Abel?”</p><p class="calibre2">They were still at an altitude that could still be called the 『foothills』.&nbsp;There was no need to cut down on conversations to preserve oxygen.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ryo has considerably physical strength for a wizard.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo replied with a bold smile, chuckling 『Fufufu』.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ve done well to notice, Abel. I gained a lot of endurance while living alone. I shouldn’t have a problem fighting continuously for about five hours.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, well, you’ll run out of magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel retorted that Ryo was supposed to be a Magician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“At any rate, I’m confident in my physical strength so Abel doesn’t have to worry about me and it is okay to go at your pace.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh wow, that’s some confidence.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course. B-class adventurer Swordsman or thereabouts can’t beat me in that area.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo provoked for no reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Interestinggg, if you want a fight, I welcome it!”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel rode on the provocation.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, I’m not scared at all even if you have dried meat in both hands.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s the same for you!”</p><p class="calibre2">While having foolish bickering, they walked toward the mountain.</p>

<p class="calibre2">As the sun approached the zenith, they felt extraordinary pressure.</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel looked left and right.</p><p class="calibre2">However, 『It』 flew down in front of them from the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">“Griffon …”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel could only say that and stiffened completely.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo couldn’t move at all either because of the sense of intimidation or presence coming from the Griffon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Griffon.</p><p class="calibre2">The Champion of the Sky, the God of Death of the Sky, the Ruler of the Sky … it was the governor of the sky with multiple aliases.</p><p class="calibre2">If it is the Behemoth that reigns on the ground, then it can be said that the Griffon controls the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">A terrifying monster with the upper body and wings of an eagle and the lower body of a lion.</p><p class="calibre2">Such a monster flew down in front of them and was staring at them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After about 20 seconds, Ryo finally regained his senses.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, on a whim, he slowly released the dried meat he had in his right hand toward the Griffon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Paku</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Griffon dexterously caught the dried meat that flew toward it with its beak and ate it.</p><p class="calibre2">That was when Abel finally regained his senses too.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo also threw the dried meat in his left hand to the Griffon in a similar fashion.</p><p class="calibre2">This time, the Griffon opened and caught the meat directly in its mouth before chewing.</p><p class="calibre2">After finishing, the Griffon’s gaze clearly turned to the dried meats Abel was holding on to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, dried meat.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo whispered in a voice that could barely be heard by Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">As prompted by it, Abel threw the dried meat he had in his right and left hands to the Griffon.</p><p class="calibre2">When it finished eating the dried meat that Abel threw to it, perhaps it was satisfied as it leaped into the sky with a large flap of its wings and the Griffon went away.</p>
     <p class="calibre2">The two were rooted for a while.</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t until well over five minutes after the Gryphon left that they were finally able to speak.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, I’m glad we’re alive.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I totally agree.”</p><p class="calibre2">They sat down at the base of a large tree nearby and took a breather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That was good thinking, tossing the dried meat.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel praised Ryo’s decision to toss the dried meat to the Griffon at the start.</p><p class="calibre2">“I thought of trying to first appeal that we weren’t its enemy and then I remembered the dried meat I had in my hand. I imagined that Griffons won’t hate meat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that was a great decision.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was shy from Abel’s continuous praises.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even so, it had a great sense of presence.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that was insane. Behi-chan was amazing too but that was a distance away. The Griffon was right in front of our eyes …”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m glad it didn’t become an enemy.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s probably impossible to win if that becomes hostile.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo nodded as he replied.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s not an opponent that humans can fight …”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s better to deal with six Wyverns than to deal with a Griffon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I would hate dealing with either of them.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">For the time being, since it was lunchtime, they decided to take out the dried meat in their bags to eat.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it goes without saying that they looked around when taking it out.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be a ridiculous turn of events if a Griffon suddenly appeared again …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nevertheless, Behi-chan, Griffon and such, there are all kinds of monsters.”</p><p class="calibre2">After calming down, Ryo muttered.</p><p class="calibre2">“Just like the Behemoth, humans have not reported sightings of a Griffon in the last few hundreds of years. I think this land is quite unusual.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s rude to call this land unusual. Isn’t it because humanity is not putting in enough effort?”</p><p class="calibre2">“What effort!?”</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed that their mental states had recovered to the point where they could finally make jokes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder if that northern mountain range is preventing Behemoths and Griffons from coming to human land.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, they don’t have to worry about food here. They probably wouldn’t bother making the effort to go over the mountains to the other side.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems it would be difficult even for the Griffon to cross that mountain.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But there seems to be a Swordsman trying to cross that same mountain …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo sighed ostentatiously.</p><p class="calibre2">“My bad! It can’t be helped. I was washed over from the sea but I don’t feel like returning through the sea.”</p><p class="calibre2">After all, there was a Kraken in the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Behi-chan on land, Kraken in the sea, and Griffon in the sky … Land, sea and air, you’ve collected them all.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I would have been happier not collecting them!”</p>
