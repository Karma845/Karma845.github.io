<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Greater Boar</h3>

<p class="calibre2">A couple of days after eating the salt-grilled piranha.</p><p class="calibre2">Today was once again a day to hunt in the afternoon.</p><p class="calibre2">The location was the usual East forest.</p><p class="calibre2">A place with many Lesser Rabbits and Lesser Boars.</p><p class="calibre2">Occasionally Normal Boars will appear but now, they were not a threat to Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He still had not planned out a strategy to win against Assassin Hawks but he probably wouldn’t lose as long as he fights on land.</p><p class="calibre2">“I am by no means being conceited.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment those words came out from his mouth, a Greater Boar appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">But now, even a Greater Boar was not a threat to Ryo … ‘Rustle’, he heard some rustling behind him.</p><p class="calibre2">Twisting only his head to look behind … he saw another Greater Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Armor&gt;)</p>
<p class="calibre2">That instant, he lost sight of the two Greater Boars in front and behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Ice Wall 5 layers were created in front and behind him.</p><p class="calibre2">The formation speed was 0.1 seconds.</p><p class="calibre2">He had been increasing his creation speed daily.</p><p class="calibre2">But even that barely made it in time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Around the same time the Ice Wall 5 layers were formed, the Greater Boars rammed into them from in front and behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One side had a lowered posture to target Ryo’s feet.</p><p class="calibre2">The other side had a higher posture targeting Ryo’s upper body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were clearly coordinating their attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The destruction from the charge of the Greater Boars reached the third layer of the Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">The force generated from the charge was terrifying.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo leaped out sideways from the Ice Walls to his front and back and chanted at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">Both boars were close to Ryo’s former spot. He could seal their movements at the same time by making the floor they stood on slippery.</p><p class="calibre2">But even if he sealed their movements, the Greater Boars had another means of attacking … right, the option to attack from a distance.</p><p class="calibre2">That aspect was completely different from the Lesser Boars!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two Greater Boars created countless gravel, truly a number that couldn’t be counted, in the surroundings.</p><p class="calibre2">“What, these numbers … &lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt; &lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt; &lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Since it was a competition by numbers, he overlaid multiple Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">The gravels were fired.</p><p class="calibre2">They struck the Ice Wall and formed mist or dust, worsening the visibility.</p><p class="calibre2">At that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hyun</p>
<p class="calibre2">A gravel collided with Ryo’s right flank.</p><p class="calibre2">“Guha.”</p><p class="calibre2">And another on his left shoulder.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ugh. &lt;Omnidirectional Ice Wall&gt;.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Making use of the reduced visibility, the Greater Boars bent the trajectory of the gravel.</p><p class="calibre2">It struck Ryo by twisting around the corner of the Ice Wall 5 layers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t expect them to be capable of bending the trajectory …”</p><p class="calibre2">He received damage due to the lack of combat experience.</p><p class="calibre2">His torso armor and left-hand armor shattered from the impact of the gravel.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Armor&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">For now, he regenerated his armor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he didn’t have time to relax.</p><p class="calibre2">The omnidirectional ice wall was just a single Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">It did not possess the endurance of the Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, the Greater Boars were incapable of moving due to the Ice Bahn below their feet.</p><p class="calibre2">They shouldn’t be able to move.</p><p class="calibre2">Shouldn’t be …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can they really not move?”</p>     <p class="calibre2">Greater Boars have feet capable of generating the force of a charge that approached the speed of sound.</p><p class="calibre2">That was naturally the power and speed of hooves that can dig into the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps with time, they would be able to stand on the ice with claws and run …</p><p class="calibre2">The previous time he hunted a Greater Boar, it certainly did fall down a couple of times on the Ice Bahn.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it would be too hasty to think that all other individuals will slip and fall just because of that one individual.</p><p class="calibre2">Even for humans, some would fall in an ice skating rink and some could even jump without any issue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, it was troublesome to have two opponents at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">He should defeat them one at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Which should he aim for …</p>
<p class="calibre2">They attacked from the front and behind.</p><p class="calibre2">Similarly, with the one-eyed Assassin Hawk, the one attacking from the front is probably the leader or has more experience.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, he should first defeat the one that attacked from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing multiple foes, one usual tactic is to hit the head of the enemy and cause confusion.</p><p class="calibre2">However, attacking the weaker foe and shaving off their strength before targeting the tougher foe toward the end was another common tactic too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time he chose the latter tactic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A foe with less experience would probably take longer to get used to moving on ice.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Omnidirectional Ice Wall Release&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">He went around the left side of the overlapping layers of Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">In his vision was only one Greater Boar that was slipping constantly on top of the Ice Bahn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other was missing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was probably wrapping around the overlapping Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">“So you are the first target. &lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">16 Icicle Lances formed above the fallen over Greater Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">“And the one that is wrapping around would probably appear from behind me?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo muttered and quickly chanted.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt; &lt;Icicle Lance 2&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Two Icicle Lances were formed on the other side of the Ice Wall 5 layers and were on standby for firing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, the 16 Icicle Lances above the Greater Boar pierced it and caused it to shriek.</p><p class="calibre2">“GiiaaaaaAAA!”</p><p class="calibre2">Shocked by the cry, the other Greater Boar appeared from the location Ryo anticipated.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire”</p><p class="calibre2">However, the two Icicle Lance struck its sturdy nose and shattered.</p><p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar’s vision was momentarily obscured by the shattered ice.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Jet 64&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Numerous Water Jets formed not from Ryo’s hands but the area around the Greater Boar’s face.</p><p class="calibre2">Their targets were the Greater Boar’s eyes, ears, throat, and other locations that were imaginably less sturdy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bad visibility from the shattered ice and point-blank Water Jets.</p><p class="calibre2">How would it avoid the ultra-fine jets of water that was formed 30 cm in front of its eyes?</p><p class="calibre2">At a distance that can’t be avoided and having jets of water form at its escape route … it was impossible to avoid.</p><p class="calibre2">By robbing its sight and hearing, it would fall into panic and he would deal the final hit … that was the procedure Ryo had in mind … but the process went amiss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of falling into panic, the Greater Boar died.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The Water Jets that entered the eyes, ears, and throat directly pierced its brain …</p><p class="calibre2">With its brain pierced dozens of times, there was no saving it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh … I defeated it …?”</p>
