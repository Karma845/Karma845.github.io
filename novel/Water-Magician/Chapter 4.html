<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Day of Battle</h3>

<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> day after coming to 『Phi』.</p>
<p>It was finally the day of the decisive battle.</p>
<p>He started a fire with experienced hands and ate meat.</p><p>He slowly ruminated the preparations he made in his head …</p>
<p>After finishing his meal, he confirmed the items he would bring.</p><p>The Wound Grass had already been ground and frozen into packs using water magic. They were ready to use by just melting them and applying them to any wound.</p><p>A bamboo spear with a knife as the tip. He had strengthened the part where the knife and spear connect with created ice.</p><p>That was all.</p>
<p>In fact, the items he took to leave the barrier were very limited.</p><p>His goal was to secure flint and Detoxifying grass.</p><p>And to fight a weak monster … if possible, he hoped for a slime!</p><p>He didn’t plan to stray too far.</p><p>If anything happened, it would be troubling if he was too far and couldn’t escape into the barrier quickly.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes a little and adjusted his breathing.</p><p>“All right, let’s depart.”</p><p>He headed in the direction of southwest. The direction where Michael (pseudonym) told him that there was a beach 500 meters away.</p>
<p>There were a couple of kinds of rocks that can be used as flint but Ryo was not well versed in it.</p><p>The only stone that Ryo could identify as an amateur was ‘Quartz’, a stone with a proven track record used as a flint.</p><p>There were colorless transparent quartz called crystals but the more common opaque white quartz could be found quite easily.</p>
<p>A good place to find such stones was at river banks.</p><p>If there was a sea, there should be rivers connected to it.</p><p>In that case, he wondered if he could encounter a river along the way to the sea.</p>
<p>“Well if this fails, I can set off in the opposite direction next time. This is an adventure in a sense. There’s no telling what can happen so it is an adventure.”</p><p>Ryo felt a slight sense of resistance as he left the barrier.</p><p>“I guess that sensation was the outer edge of the barrier.”</p>
<p>As he was within a forest, visibility was poor.</p><p>He listened carefully and walked slowly while relying on sound.</p><p>He could hear the sound of birds flapping their wings in the distance.</p>
<p>After proceeding about 100 meters outside the barrier, the forest suddenly ended.</p><p>In front of him was a river that spanned hundreds of meters to the opposite side.</p><p>“Bingo!”</p>
<p>However, Ryo appeared on the top of a cliff. It was a difficult spot to go down to the river to look for flint.</p><p>(I guess I’ll continue walking upstream.)</p><p>The river ran from east to west so Ryo carefully walked upstream on the cliff.</p><p>“Such a wide river is only a hundred meters away from home … This scenery is a little touching …”</p><p>However, the current Ryo couldn’t afford to take a leisurely look at the scenery.</p>
<p>After a short walk, he was able to get down to the riverbank.</p>
<p>And quickly found quartz.</p><p>He decided to give it a quick try to generate sparks.</p><p>He tried to hit the back of the knife attached to the bamboo spear to the quartz.</p>
<p>Spark spark</p>
<p>“Ooo, I see sparks. With this, I can make fire even when there is no sun.”</p><p>There was no need to linger once he confirmed that.</p><p>A river was a place for beasts to quench their thirst. There was no telling what would appear.</p>
<p>He quickly climbed up the cliff where he came down from and headed in the direction of northeast.</p><p>(If I continue moving north like this, I should appear on the south end of the house barrier. If I head northeast, I should be able to move while having my house to my left.)</p><p>If anything happened, he could quickly dash into his house barrier.</p>
<p>As mentioned many times, that was the most important matter to Ryo right now.</p><p>In the first place, he didn’t know how strong the monsters in 『Phi』 were.</p><p>He was certain that he could defeat slimes but it wasn’t guaranteed that only slimes would appear.</p>
<p>He was able to find flint fairly quickly but he couldn’t find Detoxifying grass no matter how long he looked.</p><p>He constantly moved while keeping the position of the house in mind so he didn’t stray too far from the barrier.</p>
<p>“Well … this is quite difficult … what should I do?”</p><p>Perhaps he was recalling the page on the Detoxifying grass in the Plant Encyclopedia hoping for a hint … at the very least, it was certain that his attention strayed from his surroundings.</p>
<p>When he suddenly realized a boar was looking in his direction.</p>
<p>“Shit. That is a Lesser Boar.”</p><p>The Lesser Boar charged in a straight line toward Ryo.</p>
<p>That was a Lesser Boar.</p><p>Charging in his direction.</p><p>He had to intercept it.</p>
<p>Ryo’s mind was aware of those facts. Even though he was aware, his body did not move.</p><p>It was the first time he faced the killing intent of a monster head-on.</p><p>It was a clear murderous intent that he had never experienced in his life.</p><p>Perhaps it was the same principle as a frog that couldn’t move when a snake glares at it.</p>
<p>“Shit, move, move, move~~~!”</p>
<p>His body finally jumped to the left. Instead of jumping, it may be closer to describe his action as falling to the side.</p><p>“Uguh …”</p><p>When dodging the Lesser Boar’s rush, its fangs lightly scratched Ryo’ right foot and injured him.</p><p>However, he couldn’t stay down forever.</p> 
<p>The Lesser Boar that rushed past him slowed down and stopped before turning around and staring at Ryo.</p><p>In those eyes was clear murderous intent. Or perhaps it was angered that he avoided its rush.</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>If it was possible to calm down just by saying that, no one would have a hard time.</p><p>Ryo was not an exception.</p>
<p>His heart was pumping like an alarm bell.</p><p>His mind was blank … well, not completely.</p><p>Even though that was the case, his body wouldn’t move as he wanted.</p>
<p>The Lesser Boar charged once more.</p><p>Once again, Ryo couldn’t move as expected.</p>
<p>However, even if he couldn’t move his body, Ryo had magic.</p>
<p>His water attribute magic that he has practiced over and over and over again.</p><p>Hard work will not betray.</p>
<p>“&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;” (T/N: Bahn = Road in German)</p><p>In front of Ryo to the Lesser Boar, an ice road about 2 meters wide was formed.</p><p>Due to its momentum, the Lesser Boar slid over the ice toward Ryo. It couldn’t stop itself on the ice.</p>
<p>“&lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;”</p><p>Even though the Icicle lance couldn’t fly yet, he could grow them from the Ice Bahn.</p><p>It was like a line of spears in front of Ryo.</p><p>The 16 spears grew from the ice floor at a 30-degree angle.</p><p>Without any means to stop, the Lesser Boar rammed into the mountain of Icicle Lance head-on.</p>
<p>“Gyooooooo”</p><p>The skewered Lesser Boar screamed from the severe pain.</p><p>But it had not died.</p>
<p>But the fear of death that bound Ryo was released.</p><p>He could finally move his body.</p>
<p>He held his bamboo spear affixed with a knife.</p><p>Ryo did kendo but of course, he didn’t know how to use a spear.</p>
<p>However, there was no need to think about it so much. He just needed to stab.</p>
<p>Face, neck, groin. He stabbed over and over again.</p><p>He could move his body now but that didn’t mean that he was calm.</p><p>He stabbed with the bamboo spear with all his might.</p><p>Again and again and again …</p>
<p>He probably stabbed a couple of dozen times.</p><p>Ryo finally realized that the Lesser Boar was no longer moving.</p><p>“I won …”</p><p>That day, Ryo defeated a monster for the first time.</p>
<p>“I have to quickly leave this place.”</p><p>There was no telling what might be attracted by the scent of blood.</p>
<p>Ryo summoned his energy and stood up.</p><p>The problem was the Lesser Boar’s corpse.</p><p>It looked heavy.</p><p>“So how should I carry this?”</p>
<p>Of course, leaving it there was not an option.</p>
<p>It was his first hunt.</p><p>Ryo decided that he would eat Lesser Boar meat tonight.</p>
<p>The barrier shouldn’t be far. It was at most a hundred meters.</p><p>That was when he suddenly saw the Ice Bahn that the Lesser Boar slid on.</p>
<p>“Could I pull the Lesser Boar if I spread ice below it?”</p><p>If he laid down Ice Bahn until the barrier, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to pull on his own.</p><p>With just a little adjustment, he created a path of ice below the Lesser Boar and pulled.</p><p>“Ooo, it’s super~ easy this way.”</p><p>He could easily pull the Lesser Boar that seemed close to 200 kilograms with a single hand.</p>
<p>Then, he passed through the barrier and arrived in front of his house.</p><p>“I’m finally … home.”</p><p>There stood a young man who had exhausted all his energy and willpower.</p>

<p>Although he didn’t get any Detoxifying grass, he obtained flint, won his fight battle, and net a Lesser Boar.</p><p>Those were sufficient results.</p>
