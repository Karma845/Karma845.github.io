<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; The Other Water Jet</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Even though it was called a Greater Boar, it seemed that attacks targeting the ears and eyes could easily reach the brain.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, it was quite a surprise for Ryo to not need to deal the final blow.</p><p class="calibre2">“Perhaps the power of my Water Jets increased?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After returning to the barrier, Ryo quickly set out to test it.</p><p class="calibre2">He planned to use the corpses of the Greater Boars he just hunted.</p><p class="calibre2">For a Greater Boar, the thickness of the skin above the neck and below the neck was completely different.</p><p class="calibre2">Because that charge was one of its primary means of attacking, the head including the nose was extremely tough.</p><p class="calibre2">However, in comparison, the areas below the neck were not that tough.</p><p class="calibre2">Even its feet were not that sturdy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He aimed at the Greater Boar’s right foot.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Jet&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Flash.</p><p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar’s right foot was sliced off.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oooh~!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had lived for a couple of months since reincarnating in 『Phi』.</p><p class="calibre2">The Water Jet that he arbitrarily decided to be the 『true attack magic for water attribute』 when he first reincarnated had finally displayed its true value.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If I target a tree …”</p><p class="calibre2">Juuon</p><p class="calibre2">He succeeded in cutting through, but not in an instant.</p><p class="calibre2">Until now, when fired at a tree, he could only carve or scrape it but cutting through was impossible, or so he imagined but … it seemed that he had overcome a wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the first place, a Water Jet was ordinary water fired out at an extremely high pressure and speed.</p><p class="calibre2">Therefore, the water shot out was of course physically ordinary water.</p><p class="calibre2">Such water jets had become a major method for processing various materials on Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">First, heat would not be generated because it was water.</p><p class="calibre2">In other words, it would not cause the material to change due to heat. For example, the phenomenon where plastic and such would melt and drip would not occur.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of that, poisonous gas would not be generated either.</p><p class="calibre2">It was possible to process soft and thin materials without causing them to crack too.</p><p class="calibre2">It could also process composite materials and laminated materials.</p><p class="calibre2">In Ryo’s company, they had a 5-axis controlled water jet machine.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of that, Ryo had some knowledge about it … of course, he had never used it before.</p><p class="calibre2">An employee would not get permission to use it …</p><p class="calibre2">In that regard, even the vice president had no choice but to obey the judgment of the worksite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That Ryo, who could not use a water jet on Earth, was using a magically produced Water Jet freely.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, he finally started to see visible results.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was more excited than that time he could make the Icicle Lance fly on its own.</p><p class="calibre2">But at the same time, he was calm.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo knew. There was another dimension to a Water Jet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had to experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was able to cut through a Greater Boar’s foot.</p><p class="calibre2">He could slice through tree trunk too.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, what about stone?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Typically the water jet is recognized as capable of cutting through anything.</p><p class="calibre2">That was correct.</p><p class="calibre2">That included rocks and stones.</p><p class="calibre2">He had seen animation in the past where it was used to cut out gravestones from granite which is considered tough among stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo shot it toward the stone enshrined in the courtyard.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Jet&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">It more or less carved it a little at a time.</p><p class="calibre2">If he continued for an hour, he might be able to cut through it.</p><p class="calibre2">However, that was a far cry from the 『Cutting』 image of a water jet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, 『This Water Jet』 could not cut rock.</p><p class="calibre2">『This Water Jet』 could cut soft items but could not cut tough or solid materials.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not suitable for cutting stone, metal, concrete, or glass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Ryo was not disappointed. Since this was within expectations.</p><p class="calibre2">『This Water Jet』 would be used to cut soft materials. It could be used on animals, monsters, wood, and food.</p><p class="calibre2">And 『Another Kind of Water Jet』 existed and that could be used to cut tougher materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was 『Another Kind of Water Jet』?</p><p class="calibre2">It was a 『Water Jet using not just water』.</p><p class="calibre2">Typically it was called an 『Abrasive Jet』.</p>     <p class="calibre2">On Earth, when used to cut tougher materials, they were not cut with just water.</p><p class="calibre2">Tiny 『abrasive agents』 were mixed from the water outlet and sprayed at the object with water.</p><p class="calibre2">Water, which approached the speed of Mach 3, and the abrasive agent would cut the object by 『shaving』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the material used for the abrasive agent was always the same.</p><p class="calibre2">『Garnet powder』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Garnet … right, that gem called garnet.</p><p class="calibre2">Although it was categorized as a gem, since the amount used was extremely small, the cost was not that high.</p><p class="calibre2">In the first place, powder form garnet was commonly excavated and was extremely cheap.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, garnet used as abrasive agent could be reused multiple times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason why garnet was used as an abrasive agent was mostly due to its 『hardness』.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, Sapphire, Ruby, and naturally Diamond were harder but … using those would be unprofitable.</p><p class="calibre2">In addition, the shape of the crystal was also a reason.</p><p class="calibre2">Garnet was a rhombic dodecahedron or octahedron.</p><p class="calibre2">In short, it was very close to the shape of a sphere.</p><p class="calibre2">The principle was that the closer the grain you use to hit a target was to a sphere, the easier it was to shave off the area as targeted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now then, while it was established that the abrasive agent used was garnet on Earth, he did not have it available on 『Phi』.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not obtain garnet or such … at least, Ryo could not think of a method to obtain them.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, he needed another abrasive agent other than garnet.</p><p class="calibre2">That was when Ryo thought of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, he could use tiny ice as an abrasive agent.</p><p class="calibre2">Ice was definitely not tough enough to be used as an abrasive agent.</p><p class="calibre2">That was, if it was regular ice.</p><p class="calibre2">But Ryo realized that ice made from Water Attribute Magic had the characteristic of becoming harder the more magical power put into it.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, he did not have the leeway to do so in battle so they always end up shattering …</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem was needing considerably small ice crystals.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo had seen the Water Jet or Abrasive Jet used by the company.</p><p class="calibre2">The abrasive agent garnet was pretty much small enough to be called a powder.</p><p class="calibre2">He had to create a large amount of ice of that size and not let them melt in water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, he created tiny ice crystals.</p><p class="calibre2">He took two water H2O molecules and bound them with hydrogen bond.</p><p class="calibre2">The result was … too small. In fact, it was completely impossible to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, he tried connecting 30 molecules.</p><p class="calibre2">He felt as though he could somewhat see it … no, that was his imagination. It was still not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such trial and error continued until he went to bed.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when he was starting the fire for dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when he was eating dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when he was in the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He connected a couple of water molecules to try to reach an optimal size…</p><p class="calibre2">The discovery of the optimal solution to that question continued.</p><p class="calibre2">But before he could find the optimal solution, Ryo’s magical power was about to be depleted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good night.”</p>
