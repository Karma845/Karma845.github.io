<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Mid Range</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Magic seemed to have somewhat of an effective range.</p><p class="calibre2">Currently, Ryo’s range was roughly about a radius of 15 meters around him.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not channel his magical power beyond that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, even if he launches a Water Ball, it would lose its ability to float and fall to the ground once it passes 15 meters.</p><p class="calibre2">Before it reaches 15 meters away, he seemed to be able to control it to some extent as though there was a thread of magical power connected to it.</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking back as to how the Water Ball would fall after 10 meters, he was able to verify that the effective range would be extended.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, the Water Ball wasn’t fast and its attack power was weak so Ryo could not use it as an attack spell …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the Ice Bahn that Ryo used when hunting the Lesser Boar could only be generated up to 15 meters in front of Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">It could only manifest starting from Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not possible to create an Ice Bahn directly underneath the feet of a Lesser Boar 15 meters away.</p><p class="calibre2">Suddenly creating a Water Ball in a space 15 meters away was impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what if he could do it …?</p><p class="calibre2">Forming a 3-meter radius Ice Bahn underneath a Lesser Boar 10 meters away … just that alone would render the Lesser Boar immobile due to the slippery surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the moment, Ryo’s greatest means of attack was the Water Jet.</p><p class="calibre2">That was a straight-line attack originating from Ryo toward the opponent too.</p><p class="calibre2">In a sense, that made it relatively easy to avoid.</p><p class="calibre2">Since the trajectory of the attack was just a straight line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sure, avoiding the fast Water Jet was pretty difficult but … that Assassin Hawk dodged it.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, &lt;Water Jet 32&gt; was Ryo’s hidden trump card.</p><p class="calibre2">Firing 32 Water Jets at the same time … An all-direction surface suppression, even though they were fired at a slight angle to achieve, but it still managed to move out of the effective range.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was still room for improvement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While enriching his food was an attractive prospect … there were still monsters that Ryo could not win against at his current stage.</p><p class="calibre2">And it could be found very close by.</p><p class="calibre2">He had to become even stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since everything would be over once he dies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He would hunt in the Eastern forest once every two days in the morning.</p><p class="calibre2">Hunt one Lesser Rabbit or Lesser Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">On days when he doesn’t go hunting or on rainy days, he would read the 『Monster Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』 in the morning diligently.</p><p class="calibre2">Since he didn’t know when, where or what kind of monster he would encounter.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be too pathetic if he couldn’t cope with the new monsters because he didn’t read up on them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from that, he would train magic.</p><p class="calibre2">He was practicing creating water and ice away from him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, he could not immediately create them 10 meters away from him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He extended his right arm.</p><p class="calibre2">He cast a Water Ball in front of him, forming a Water Ball 10 cm away from his palm.</p><p class="calibre2">His goal was to extend that distance to 15 meters or even further … that training seemed that it would take a long time as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, just because it felt like it would take a long time didn’t mean that he shouldn’t do it.</p><p class="calibre2">When he was practicing outside, he would always incorporate the practice of firing a Water Jet from a point away from him.</p><p class="calibre2">By doing so, he could practice both creating it away from him and improving its power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Growth only progressed in tiny steps.</p><p class="calibre2">But Ryo was happy to see the result of his growth.</p><p class="calibre2">As it was directly connected to his survival, he had to do it regardless of whether it made him happy or not.</p><p class="calibre2">That was a fact but humans are not that strong-willed.</p><p class="calibre2">Instead, having visible results from effort would have a great impact on motivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was more related to emotions than reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Half of the humankind’s drive comes from emotions.</p><p class="calibre2">Whether that half can be moved was crucial in getting good results.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo knew about that regardless of being a person who leaned on the side of reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was not a genius.</p><p class="calibre2">Nor was he a talented person.</p><p class="calibre2">But he knew the importance of hard work.</p><p class="calibre2">That came from his emotional side, rather than his rational side.</p><p class="calibre2">For a person like him, the effort didn’t bother him at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The change came suddenly.</p><p class="calibre2">On the day he goes hunting.</p><p class="calibre2">He was hunting for Lesser Rabbits or Lesser Boars in the Eastern forest.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Of course, there was a chance of encountering monsters other than those two types.</p><p class="calibre2">But he had not experienced it other than the encounter with the Assassin Hawk in the Northern forest.</p><p class="calibre2">The Northern and Eastern forests were connected and it wasn’t such a large distance so he naturally considered the possibility of the Assassin Hawk appearing in the Eastern forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he encountered a different monster today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Greater Boar …”</p><p class="calibre2">The greater species of the Normal Boar that is the greater species of the Lesser Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">Capable of shooting stone gravel as a long-range earth attribute attack magic.</p><p class="calibre2">And the speed of its charge was close to the speed of sound.</p><p class="calibre2">Although there was a difference of wind and earth and sky and ground, its characteristics were similar to the Assassin Hawk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was huge …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its length was about seven meters. Its head was around three meters above the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">Something that large would charge at subsonic speeds. It was a nightmare.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’d die if I get hit. I was hit by a truck and died on Earth but isn’t that even faster?”</p><p class="calibre2">Since kinetic energy was determined by mass and speed, a Greater Boar that charges at subsonic speed produce destructive power that is incomparable to the trucks on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By visual estimations, it was about the size of a dump truck.</p><p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar was so large that even though it was about 20 meters away from Ryo, the perspective seemed strange due to its appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">First, 16 Icicle Lances formed at a 30 degrees angle from the ground to intercept its charge.</p><p class="calibre2">That would prevent the subsonic charge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar fired two stone gravels while slowly approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Shield 2&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">Two shields about the size of tennis rackets made of ice formed in front of Ryo and disappeared after the gravels that were shot over collided with them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Guooooo”</p><p class="calibre2">He wasn’t sure if it was to intimidate or a cry of frustration. But the Greater Boar cried out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after, more than 20 stone gravels manifested around the Greater Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s way too many.”</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Wall&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo chose a wall instead of a shield to prevent all the attacks from the front.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar shot the stone gravels immediately after that.</p><p class="calibre2">The stone gravels that flew toward Ryo shattered the Icicle Lances before causing cracks on the Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo jumped to his left at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Almost the same time as the stone gravels landed, the Greater Boar charged.</p><p class="calibre2">“Charging in at the same time as using skills … are you some knight with a sacred sword technique!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was a technique that appeared in Ryo’s favorite comic.</p><p class="calibre2">“If I were a wind attribute magician, I could form three other bodies and shoot sonic blades before following up with a charge assault!”</p><p class="calibre2">But that was impossible for Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar shattered the Icicle Lances with stone gravels and shattered the Ice Wall with its body charge.</p><p class="calibre2">It passed Ryo by from the momentum of crushing the Ice Wall and turned around to face him after about 15 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You shouldn’t have stopped there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">He formed a floor of ice with the Greater Boar in the middle.</p><p class="calibre2">A radius of about three meters around the Greater Boar became a floor of ice and the space between it and Ryo was an ice floor as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Greater Boar failed to stand on the ice and fell over many times.</p><p class="calibre2">It probably never experienced walking on ice before in its lifetime. The Rondo Forest was warm after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">Even after that much practice, he still could not shoot the Icicle Lances forward.</p><p class="calibre2">However, after becoming able to form them away from himself, he found a new way of using them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">16 Icicle Lances formed 18 meters above the Greater Boar with their center of gravity placed near their tips.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, they fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gyaaaaaa”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Icicle Lances pierced the Greater Boar one after another from its neck to its back, except for its head.</p><p class="calibre2">Due to the Greater Boars characteristic to favor charging, its entire head, including its nose, was extremely sturdy.</p><p class="calibre2">An ordinary sword would not be able to pierce it.</p><p class="calibre2">That was how it was able to break through Ryo’s Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">However, its body other than its head wasn’t as sturdy.</p><p class="calibre2">It was similar to that of the Lesser Boar and may only be slightly tougher than a regular boar.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo aimed for that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m glad I read the 『Monster Encyclopedia』. But the hide is now full of holes and no longer useable …”</p>
