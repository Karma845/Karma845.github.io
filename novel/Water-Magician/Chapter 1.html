<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211;  Slow Life</h3>

<p>“The first ceiling.”</p><p>The first words in a reincarnation … it was close to a staple … although it was a little different.</p><p>But staples are important.</p>
<p>A bed with a luxurious canopy … there was nothing like that.</p><p>If there was a canopy, he wouldn’t be able to see the ceiling.</p><p>By modern Japanese standards, it was a shabby bed.</p><p>Straw was laid on a board and a piece of cloth was laid on it.</p><p>That said, considering it was a European pre-renaissance cultural level, the bed was relatively good.</p><p>It said something about his class too. As he was not in an aristocratic mansion.</p>
<p>He was wearing the same outfit he wore when he died on Earth. The same shoes. He didn’t bring anything else.</p>
<p>Ryo got out of bed and first took a walk around the house.</p><p>Bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom.</p><p>“A bath!?”</p><p>He never heard of a bath appearing in Europe before the Renaissance.</p><p>“Well, there were large baths during the Roman period so it can’t be said that there has been none. As a Japanese, I am immensely thankful … Ah, I wonder if Michael (pseudonym) made it for me because I am Japanese. Michael (pseudonym) … is a great man!”</p><p>Although it was still unknown if Michael (pseudonym) was even male.</p>
<p>That said, Ryo’s knowledge was very mistaken and there were public baths in medieval Europe too.</p><p>However, the general public’s knowledge of hygiene was poor so ironically those public baths were a hotbed for infectious diseases.</p>
<p>There were two books and a knife on the desk in the living room. Beside them was a piece of paper.</p>
<p>『The food can be found in the storage outside. It has been made into a freezer room so the food can be preserved. By Michael (pseudonym)』</p><p>“I knew he could read my thoughts …”</p><p>He didn’t want to make a capable man an enemy.</p>
<p>The books were not those heavy volumes stored in the valuable archives in university libraries … but ordinary books … right, books that can be said to have been made on Earth after the development of letterpress printing.</p><p>“Books? Not parchment but paper? Is this a world with paper?”</p><p>『Monster Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』</p><p>『Plant Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』</p>
<p>“This is …”</p><p>In other words, there was no such thing as the classic 『Appraisal』 skill commonly found in reincarnation stories.</p><p>“He did mention that there was no level or skill system …”</p>
<p>Both books were quite easy to read with illustrations.</p><p>He was very thankful for that.</p>
<p>The knife was about 20cm in blade length and it seemed to be quite well made.</p><p>What would you bring along if you are alone on an uninhabited island?</p><p>The staple answer will be a knife.</p><p>“Staple is royal road! Staple is supreme!”</p><p>Ryo slotted the knife on his belt for now.</p>
<p>Looking around, there was nothing else that stood out.</p><p>Then, he opened the door to the outside.</p>
<p>The image of a brilliant sun came into his eyes.</p><p>A carpet of grass surrounded the house.</p><p>And a forest directly ahead.</p><p>It fit the term dense perfectly. A forest which depths can’t be seen at all.</p><p>The same forest was in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>However, further beyond … perhaps it was quite a distance away but there were mountains that reached the heavens.</p><p>This transferred location seemed to have a warm climate but it was snowing near the top of the mountain.</p><p>“It looks like a place where dragons might appear … yeah, I’ll not approach that.”</p><p>Ryo pledged to himself out loud.</p>
<p>He was not yet hungry.</p><p>In that case, there was something he must do.</p><p>Or rather, it was something he definitely wanted to try after coming to this world of sword and magic.</p>
<p>Yup, to actually try to use magic.</p>
<p>“I can only use water attribute. And the image is important for magic.”</p>
<p>He somewhat put his right arm forward.</p><p>He imagined shooting water from his right hand and called out.</p><p>“&lt;Come out water&gt;!”</p>
<p>Splash.</p>
<p>A clump of water about the amount of a full glass came out from his right hand and fell to the ground.</p><p>It was his first experience of magic!</p><p>From an objective point of view, it was an extremely shabby display, but that was that.</p>
<p>Succeeding in his first magic, Ryo was struck with emotion.</p><p>“Magic truly exists in this world …”</p><p>Ryo continued to cast due to his excitement.</p>
<p>“&lt;Come out water&gt;”</p><p>“&lt;Come out water&gt;”</p><p>“&lt;Come out water&gt;”</p><p>…..</p>
<p>“Michael (pseudonym) said that the image was important. Maybe …”</p><p>The image of water coming out of his right hand was the same.</p><p>“&lt;Water&gt;”</p><p>In the same way, a clump of water appeared from his right hand and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“&lt;Water&gt;” (T/N: He said it in English)</p><p>Even then, the same clump of water appeared from his right hand and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Next, without saying a word, he chanted in his head.</p><p>(&lt;Water&gt;)</p><p>Upon doing so, the same clump of water appeared from his right hand and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“So there is no need to say it out loud. I yearned to chant some cool lines though …”</p><p>Men will always have some aspect of chuunibyou.</p>
<p>“Ah, I should have stored this in the bathtub. That was a waste of water.”</p><p>After that, he quickly moved to the bath.</p>

<p>Then, he continued his water magic training.</p><p>“Water could only make a full cup amount of water appear. I want to have something that allows water to continuously come out. About enough to fill the bathtub.”</p><p>The bathtub was made of stone and was quite well made.</p><p>The closest image would probably be those open-air baths in luxury hot spring inns.</p><p>Just relying on &lt;Water&gt; would certainly be a hassle.</p>
<p>“Thinking of continuous water flow, the first to come to mind will be a tap. No, wait, this is a bath. For a bath, it should be hot water. Right, I’ll try to release hot water.”</p><p>He made an image of hot water in his head.</p><p>He chanted out loud to solidify the image he had.</p><p>“&lt;Hot water&gt;”</p><p>When he did that, a clump of water appeared from his right hand and fell into the bathtub.</p>
<p>That’s right, not hot water but water.</p>
<p>“Eh? Maybe I have to imagine it better.”</p><p>He chanted with the image of the hot water in a bath.</p>

<p>“&lt;Hot water&gt;”</p><p>And then, a clump of water appeared from his right hand and fell into the bathtub.</p>
<p>That’s right, it was not hot water after all but just regular water.</p>
<p>“ … Yeah, let’s give up on hot water for today. This Rondo Forest is quite warm so a water bath is good too.”</p><p>Ryo didn’t hate hard work.</p><p>But he was a man that knew the usefulness of giving up.</p><p>Yup, not everything will work well from the beginning.</p>
<p>“&lt;Water supply&gt;”</p><p>Shaping his right hand like a faucet, a continuous stream of water appeared from his hand.</p><p>“All right, that looks good.”</p>
<p>It was true that his procurement of hot water failed but continuously releasing water from the first day should be in the category of considerable success.</p><p>At the very least, his drinking water and water bath were secured.</p>
<p>Of the problems faced in daily life, the remaining major one was …</p><p>“Fire huh …”</p><p>Right, from cooking to keeping warm or to rank up his water bath to a hot bath, a fire was needed.</p><p>It would be great if he could use fire attribute magic … but he could not hope for what was impossible in this world.</p><p>Ryo would have to live with water attribute magic for his entire life.</p>
<p>“How can I get my hands on fire …”</p><p>Was mankind’s first fire due to a tree burned by a lightning strike … or bestowed by Prometheus … either one was not plausible at the moment.</p>
<p>“It would have been easy if I had a flint.”</p><p>A quick glance told him that there was no flint in the house.</p><p>Striking the flint with the metal part of the knife would have generated spark.</p><p>Eventually he would have to find it from a nearby cliff or riverside … but that would have to be after he got used to life to some extent.</p>
<p>The fact that monsters don’t come within a radius of a 100 meters meant that there were monsters outside.</p><p>He felt that he should make some preparations before leaving the barrier (pseudonym).</p><p>Only after he gets better with water magic and find a way to make offensive water magic…</p> 
<p>At any rate, for now he would have to find another method to obtain fire.</p><p>Without a flint, the other method would have to be rubbing a hard stick against a soft stick to generate fire from the friction.</p><p>“Although I totally cannot imagine myself succeeding&#8230;”</p>
<p>After finally generating enough water to store in the bathtub, Ryo went out.</p><p>He collected firewood while making sure to not leave the barrier.</p>
<p>Along the way, he picked up tinder as well.</p><p>The tinder would refer to materials that can catch fire easily to start the fire. Withered grass.</p><p>If he crushed them, he could use them without issue … probably.</p>
<p>Among the pile, he seemed to have been lucky to acquire some black palm bark that came from palm-type trees similar but slightly different from the palms trees he recalled.</p><p>“Yeap, I recall seeing it in a video.”</p>
<p>Ryo’s survival knowledge was to that extent.</p><p>In the house Michael prepared, there was a sickle.</p><p>Even after taking into consideration the amount of firewood to use there, he was able to obtain a reasonable amount of firewood.</p><p>The wood he would use to cause frictional heat were the pine-like tree branches and the oak-like tree branches.</p><p>“Now!”</p>
<p>It didn’t even smoke.</p>
<p>Ryo worked harder.</p><p>An hour passed … two hours passed … and then he gave up.</p>
<p>“Let’s check the food inventory for the time being.”</p><p>It may be necessary to ration.</p><p>Ryo, who gave up on making a fire, headed to the storage outside the house.</p>
<p>The storage seemed like an ordinary small hut.</p><p>Upon opening the door, he noticed that the interior was cooling.</p><p>“Is this water attribute magic? Walls made of ice? This is just like what they call a cold room.”</p><p>Michael probably prepared it for him. In the future, Ryo may be able to use this kind of magic … maybe.</p>
<p>The second day after coming to 『Phi』, Ryo woke up with the rising sun.</p><p>The idea to get a fire going was already in his mind.</p><p>However, to realize it, he would have to get even better in water attribute magic.</p><p>Michael (pseudonym) mentioned that the laws of physics and molecular composition of Earth and 『Phi』was fundamentally the same.</p><p>Of course, 『Phi』had magic while Earth didn’t have magic. But apparently there was magic on Earth too in the past.</p>
<p>The molecular composition of water was H<sub>2</sub>O. That was probably the same in 『Phi』.</p>
<p>He brought out a pail from the bathroom.</p><p>“&lt;Water supply&gt;”</p><p>He collected about 10cm deep worth of water in the pail.</p><p>After that, he would have to solidify the water and make ice.</p>
<p>The mental image he had was to tightly squeeze and shrink the water.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>But, it didn’t go well.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s difficult. But I have to be able to make ice … this will likely be my weapon. I want to try making a spell like ice spears.”</p><p>Perhaps it was not enough to just squeeze the water. Maybe he needed to imagine taking heat away at the same time.</p><p>Thoughts such as those ran through his mind as he repeated trial and error.</p>
<p>After challenging countless times, a thin film of ice finally appeared on the water surface.</p><p>But he couldn’t make it completely solidify.</p>
<p>This time, he imagined the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules within the water in more detail.</p>
<p>There are two mechanisms by which ice stores thermal energy.</p><p>One is by molecular vibration.</p><p>The other is by changing the strength of the bonds between water molecules. In other words, enthalpy.</p>
<p>He bonded the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules together.</p><p>He connected the oxygen atom O of this H<sub>2</sub>O molecule with the hydrogen atom H of the adjacent H<sub>2</sub>O molecule.</p><p>A phenomenon called hydrogen bond was formed in his image.</p><p>At the same time, the molecular vibration stopped.</p>
<p>In the first place, the temperature of a substance is proportional to the magnitude of the amplitude of the vibration of the molecules that make up the substance.</p><p>Or rather, ‘temperature’ can be said to be an indicator of the intensity of vibration of a molecule.</p>
<p>The stronger the vibration, the higher the temperature of the substance and vice versa.</p><p>The state where the vibration of all atoms and molecules is almost zero is called absolute zero, -273.15 degrees Celcius.</p><p>That is why, theoretically, there is no temperature below absolute zero.</p>
<p>In his mental image, he made the vibrations of the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules zero.</p>
<p>At that instant, the water in the pail completely turned into ice.</p>
<p>“Alright, success! &#8230; Although I succeeded, I can’t get the ice out of the pail.”</p><p>He had to change the shape of the ice slightly.</p><p>While holding both hands over the ice, he imagined in his head. The ice was gradually scraped off around the edge.</p><p>Then, he took it out of the pail and held it in his hand.</p><p>A lump of ice with a diameter of 25cm and a thickness of about 10cm.</p><p>He held it in both hands and imagined deforming it in his head. He thickened the central part and thinned the periphery, making a convex lens.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, it finally reached a shape he was satisfied with.</p><p>“Fufufu, I won. The reason for victory was hydrogen bond!”</p><p>Who exactly was Ryo fighting against … no one knew.</p>
<p>Hydrogen bond forms the bond between water molecules but for example, a double helix DNA, is also connected by hydrogen bonds.</p><p>From science class, we learned that A-adenine and T-thymine, and G-guanine and C-cytosine are linked by hydrogen bonds to form the double-strand.</p><p>Hydrogen bond is amazing!</p>
<p>Now then, it was time to gather the sunlight with the created ice lens and burn the black palm bark.</p><p>Using ice to create fire. It felt a little immoral.</p><p>He was worried that the ice would melt but it didn’t seem to melt if he continuously pour magical power into it.</p><p>That aspect may be the difference between natural ice and ice created by magic.</p>
<p>The brilliantly shining sun. And the fairly large ice lens.</p><p>Using those, the palm bark was ignited in less than two minutes.</p><p>Ryo finally acquired a way to set fire.</p>
<p>“Magic sure is convenient.”</p><p>He could use magic to obtain the three elements of survival, fire, water, and food. Well, he did use quite a primitive method to create fire using magic …</p>
<p>“I wonder where does this water come from? I guess it comes from the moisture in the air … maybe?”</p><p>The Rondo Forest had a warm climate, or rather, the temperature was so high that it seemed like a subtropical climate. And there was high humidity.</p><p>That naturally meant that there was a large amount of water contained in the air.</p><p>Because of that, a beginner in water attribute magic like Ryo could quickly find the knack to release water.</p><p>Ryo thought so.</p>
<p>On Earth, even deserts have a few percent of humidity.</p><p>In other words, even the dry air of a desert contains moisture.</p><p>If he could extract that … magic is definitely convenient.</p>
<p>However … if that was not the case?</p>
<p>If he was not extracting water from the air but creating it from nothing?</p>
<p>Of course, it can’t come from nothing.</p><p>To be exact, when he mentioned nothing, it only meant there was no substance, but there was energy.</p>
<p>Michael (pseudonym) mentioned that the laws of physics were fundamentally the same on Earth and on 『Phi』.</p><p>In that case, Ryo thought that the physics formula effective on Earth would be effective on 『Phi』as well.</p>
<p>The famous Einstein formula that even ordinary people on Earth know.</p>
<p>E=mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>E: Energy; m: mass, c: speed of light.</p><p>“Energy is equal to the product of the mass and speed of light squared.”</p>

<p>To put it simply, it is possible to generate energy from matter.</p><p>A prime example would be nuclear power and the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>However, the focus here was the equals sign.</p><p>As learned in junior high school mathematics, the right and left connected by an equal sign are equal. They are equivalent.</p>
<p>In other words, if energy can be extracted from matter, matter can also be generated from energy.</p><p>Of course, even on Earth entering the 21<sup>st</sup> century, material production from energy has not been established as a technology.</p><p>At best, pair production has produced electrons and the like.</p>
<p>In the first place, a huge amount of energy is generated from even one gram of matter.</p><p>In other words, even if you could control an enormous amount of energy, you will only succeed in generating one gram worth of matter.</p>
<p>How enormous?</p><p>The atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima actually only weighed about 0.7 grams in terms of energy.</p><p>In other words, even if all that energy could be converted to mass … only 0.7 grams of matter would be produced.</p>
<p>However, there was this convenient thing called magic on 『Phi』.</p><p>Perhaps in the depths of magic there is also a technique to create matter from energy.</p>
<p>Not only ‘creating something from nothing’, that would lead to the establishment of creating matter from energy and even the mystery of the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>His dreams were expanding!</p>
