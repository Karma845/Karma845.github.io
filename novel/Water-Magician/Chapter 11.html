<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Endurance</h3>

  
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was running today too.</p><p class="calibre2">Or rather, he was walking today too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the sun rises quite early, even though it was in the middle of the morning, he had been moving continuously for quite a considerable amount of time.</p><p class="calibre2">About five hours on Earth time.</p><p class="calibre2">However, he did not always run at a constant speed like in a marathon and sometimes added in some interval running.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The outer edge of the barrier was about 600 meters and he ran quickly for two laps, did a slow pace run for the next lap, and walked for the subsequent two laps. <em class="calibre5">(TN: He took 5 hours to travel 3km?? Even by walking the entire journey it shouldn’t take 5 hours :x)</em></p><p class="calibre2">By doing so, even though he walked, he still moved for at least five hours.</p><p class="calibre2">And as he moved, he trained magic too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After morning training, Ryo’s body was already at the peak of fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he could not collapse then.</p><p class="calibre2">First was icing.</p><p class="calibre2">He cooled the elevated temperatures of his muscles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was truly living up to the name of a Water-Attribute Mage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He created a film of water encased in ice and cooled his muscles.</p><p class="calibre2">About 15 minutes of icing would cause blood vessels to contract.</p><p class="calibre2">After the icing is done, the blood vessels would dilate once more due to rebound and cause more than usual fatigue substances to effectively flow through the blood.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, he cooled down with calisthenics.</p><p class="calibre2">That also helped to prevent injuries … probably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At noon, he would eat the rest of his breakfast.</p><p class="calibre2">When making breakfast, he would prepare two meals. Since the preparations wouldn’t change much if he made one or two meals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, it was finally time to hunt.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a hunt but … lately, it became almost like a routine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, he would not fall into a pinch against Lesser Rabbits or Lesser Boars.</p><p class="calibre2">There wasn’t much difference against Normal Rabbits and Normal Boars either.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, that didn’t mean that he let his guard down.</p><p class="calibre2">And there was no telling what could happen if he came across an Assassin Hawk.</p><p class="calibre2">In that line of thought, it showed that the Assassin Hawk was truly a nasty enemy for humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, he had been struggling with his morning training regime which affected his afternoon activities but after getting used to it a little more, Ryo wanted to expand his activities a little more.</p><p class="calibre2">For now, it was either the East or North.</p><p class="calibre2">And eventually, Southwest … the sea!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup, eventually he would have to go to the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">Since he needed to procure salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Water and salt are absolutely necessary for human life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could produce water infinitely but he couldn’t do so with salt.</p><p class="calibre2">The miracle of God that turned Lot’s wife into salt in the Book of Genesis … Ryo could not do that. Or rather, it would be terrifying if he could.</p><p class="calibre2">To be honest, it would be safer to go to the sea and get salt normally via salt farms or other methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The salt that Michael (pseudonym) prepared was enough to last for more than a year at the current pace.</p><p class="calibre2">However, for Ryo who has never done salt farms or other methods, he wanted to know how much time it would take to obtain salt.</p><p class="calibre2">He wouldn’t want to panic when he was about to run out of salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, there was a possibility that he could eat seafood for the first time in a long time.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo loved meat but he didn’t hate seafood either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had been around two months since he started his training menu to build endurance.</p><p class="calibre2">Finally, his morning routine did not affect his afternoon activities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“All right, let’s go a little further today. First, I’ll need to leave a landmark.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying that, Ryo began building an ice tower within the barrier.</p><p class="calibre2">It looked more like a flag pole rather than a tower. Although it was about 100 meters tall.</p><p class="calibre2">When seen from a distance, it was a beautiful sight as the sun rays reflected off it.</p><p class="calibre2">“With this height, I should be able to see it from most places.”</p><p class="calibre2">Although Rondo Forest was a dense forest, there were still quite a few locations that could be called gaps in the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">With this height, it should be visible from about … two kilometers away?</p><p class="calibre2">For the time being, if he uses this as a landmark, he wouldn’t make a mistake in the direction to return to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was about 100 meters tall, it was quite suitable since it was made with an emphasis on speed.</p><p class="calibre2">The thickness of the tower was about 3 meters in diameter and was a cylinder shape.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a shape that wouldn’t fall over easily but … with Ryo’s magical power in effect, he somehow ‘knew’ that it would not fall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is different from the laws of physics that I know.”</p><p class="calibre2">As Ryo’s magical ability rose, he felt the differences from Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">Or it may be more accurate to say that the phenomenon that cannot occur on Earth has become possible. However, Ryo still had very little awareness of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His expedition tools were the same as usual.</p><p class="calibre2">His loincloth and sandals.</p><p class="calibre2">His usual knife-tip bamboo spear and hemp bag.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He swung a bamboo sword-like bamboo every day but he did not have a weapon that could be used as a sword.</p><p class="calibre2">For the time being, this new knife-tip bamboo spear had to remain as his physical weapon.</p><p class="calibre2">No matter how many times it breaks, he could just replace it as long as the knife portion is intact!</p><p class="calibre2">Extremely economical!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“All right, let’s head Northeast.”</p><p class="calibre2">There was quite a wide expanse of wetlands to the North.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t know the Eastern end of the wetland laid so he tried setting his course for Northeast.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be fine if he traveled and still came across wetlands.</p><p class="calibre2">That would confirm that the wetland extends considerably from East to West.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no particular change for about one kilometer from the barrier.</p><p class="calibre2">The only monster he encountered was a Lesser Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">As for the harvest, he obtained about ten Ichizuku and red fruits called Lindo that resembled apples.</p><p class="calibre2">“It looks and tastes like apples! I can make apple pies with this … of course, I can’t bake though!”</p><p class="calibre2">He was having a one-man comedy act … after reincarnating, Ryo was clearly having a lot of monologues.</p><p class="calibre2">After securing about 10 Lindo, he continued further Northeast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About two kilometers from home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Parin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall behind him broke with a single blow.</p><p class="calibre2">This was an expedition into the depths of the Rondo Forest so Ryo didn’t know what would happen and constantly moved with a thin ice wall behind him.</p><p class="calibre2">Although he called it thin, it was strong enough to withstand two shots of the Assassin Hawk’s invisible wind-attribute attack magic Air Slash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it was broken with one hit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body moved before he could think.</p><p class="calibre2">He dove diagonally to the right, fell with his shoulder to the ground, and made a full turn after softening the fall.</p><p class="calibre2">He got up and chanted as he looked behind.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Armor&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">His chest, waist, back of his hands, and legs were equipped with armor made of ice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, to prevent instant death upon hit, he found it better to have simple armor even if a full plate mail was not possible.</p><p class="calibre2">“Looks like a cobra … Kite Snake? It could deal direct attacks by swinging its tail like a whip. Or an Air Slash could be generated from the tail movement. And its ultimate weapon was the venom from its mouth. How troublesome.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looked just like a cobra as Ryo muttered.</p><p class="calibre2">And like a cobra, it had a hood on its neck.</p><p class="calibre2">But its size was unusual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t tell its total length … because it was coiled.</p><p class="calibre2">The position of the hood was about three meters from the ground. He had to look up quite considerably.</p><p class="calibre2">It was likely a direct attack from its tail that destroyed the ice wall with a single blow.</p><p class="calibre2">He experienced Air Slash many times when facing the Assassin Hawks.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a rather troublesome attack because it is invisible but it shouldn’t be possible to break his ice wall with a single blow …</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the very least, its tail attack could reach his current position so he was already in the Kite Snake’s range.</p><p class="calibre2">He poised himself and decided that he had to regain the initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Wall U-shape&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall surrounded the front, left, and right of the Kite Snake.</p><p class="calibre2">Originally he used the &lt;Ice Wall U-shape&gt; for retreating but now he could use it this way too.</p><p class="calibre2">And while chanting internally, Ryo jumped backward as soon as the Ice Wall was created.</p><p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall could at least survive one tail attack. In the meantime, he would fall back and leave the Kite Snake’s range.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Kite Snake’s movements exceeded Ryo’s expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of breaking the Ice Wall, it bypassed the Ice Wall and chased after Ryo as he retreated.</p><p class="calibre2">“As expected of a snake. It moves so fast on grass but!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">He froze the grass and turned it into an icy road.</p><p class="calibre2">The Kite Snake, who got on the Ice Bahn with strong momentum, could no longer stop itself.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">It could already be called Ryo’s specialty, the Ice Bahn + Icicle Lance.</p><p class="calibre2">16 Icicle Lances formed at an angle of 30<sup class="calibre6">0</sup> from the Ice Bahn to meet the sliding Kite Snake.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Bakin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What!?”</p><p class="calibre2">A boar would be pierced through but the Kite Snake snapped the Icicle Lances.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, with the tail attack that broke the Ice Wall initially.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Its sliding momentum was not stopping … in other words, the distance between it and Ryo was shortening at every moment. He first tried to stop that with an Ice Wall. But …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bakin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It broke once again from a tail attack.</p><p class="calibre2">“Right. &lt;Ice Wall 5 Layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Instead of the usual thin Ice Wall he always deployed, a 5 layer Ice Wall with a width of three meters, a height of three meters, and thickness twice as usual was formed.</p><p class="calibre2">That was a spell completely geared for defense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gakin. Dogo</p>
<p class="calibre2">It tried to break it as it did before with its tail but it could not break it with a single blow and only cracked the first layer. Its sliding body slammed into the Ice Wall and stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Ryo could not catch a breather.</p><p class="calibre2">As soon as it found that it could not catch Ryo by sliding, the Kite Snake manipulated its tail outside the Ice Wall and approached Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">All the while releasing Air Slashes as well.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Shield&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">A shield similar to a tennis racket was created in the air to prevent Air Slashes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that allowed the Kite Snake’s tail to close the gap.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a fatal mistake in choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall 5 Layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall 5 Layers was the most robust of all the defensive spells that Ryo had.</p><p class="calibre2">However, while a normal Ice Wall took below one second to form, the Ice Wall 5 Layers took close to one second.</p><p class="calibre2">Normally it could be said to be sufficiently quick, but in such a close-neck battle, one second was not quick at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And that was revealed this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he chanted for Ice Wall 5 Layers, it did not form in time.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though it reduced the Kite Snake tail’s momentum, it barely reached Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">“Gah”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo’s chest armor shattered.</p><p class="calibre2">He jumped backward to reduce the damage so he didn’t end up with a hole in his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he might end up with a terrible bruise or a cracked rib.</p><p class="calibre2">But Ryo did not feel the pain.</p><p class="calibre2">Like a battle junkie, it seemed that his brain was filled with adrenaline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He raised his left hand and chanted without a second’s break.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance 2&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The Icicle Lances fired from his left hand drew a trajectory and crossed the ice wall to aim for the Kite Snake’s head.</p><p class="calibre2">To intercept it, the Kite Snake quickly pulled its tail back.</p><p class="calibre2">And it intercepted it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo finally succeeded in retaliating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Armor&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">He regenerated the cracked chest armor.</p><p class="calibre2">Without it, he would have died.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, Ryo was 15 meters away from the Kite Snake.</p><p class="calibre2">There was an Ice Wall 5 Layer in front of the Ice Snake. Its height and width were three meters.</p><p class="calibre2">Below the Kite Snake was the Ice Bahn. But only about two meters in radius.</p><p class="calibre2">The Kite Snake had its hood out. It was about three meters in height and the Ice Wall was just about the same height.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I retaliated but I don’t want to engage in close quarters fight again.”</p><p class="calibre2">The Kite Snake’s tail was too vicious.</p><p class="calibre2">It could shoot Air Slashes from a distance and if you got close to it, it had the physical strength to destroy his Ice Wall in a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Kite Snake had the next move.</p><p class="calibre2">It leaped while its hood was flared.</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s with that!?”</p><p class="calibre2">It leaped over the Ice Wall 5 Layers and closed in on Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">However, before it reached the Ice Bahn, the Kite Snake moved sideways as if saying that it had already seen that technique before.</p><p class="calibre2">It changed from a direct attack to a curved attack.</p><p class="calibre2">It shot Air Slashes continuously while moving.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Shield 4&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo intercepted the attacks with four floating Ice Shield as the Kite Snake approached while moving left and right as if trying to feint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And finally, it released venom from its mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a far more widespread poison attack than Ryo had imagined.</p><p class="calibre2">The range was too wide that it was impossible to escape from.</p><p class="calibre2">Normally that would be checkmate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Ryo was not normal. And he was a Water Attribute Magician.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Squall&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The instant he chanted, heavy rain common in Southeast Asia occurred locally.</p><p class="calibre2">Centered on the Kite Snake in front of Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">The heavy rain battered the venom in the air and flushed it to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was probably the first time it encountered such a counter.</p><p class="calibre2">Although it was a different race, Ryo could tell that it was surprised.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Boiling Water&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">He chanted toward the Kite Snake drenched by the Squall.</p><p class="calibre2">His target was the water from the Squall on the Kite Snake as well as the water puddle below it.</p><p class="calibre2">He used to take a few minutes to boil water but now he could do it in less than a second like any other magic.</p><p class="calibre2">In other words, the Kite Snake was forced to bathe in boiling water all over its body in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gyoeeeeeee!”</p><p class="calibre2">As it screeched, he targeted the wide-open mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">And fired a thick Ice Spear.</p><p class="calibre2">The Icicle Lance pierced its oral cavity … and the Kite Snake died.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo unconsciously fell onto his backside and remained seated.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fuuu …. I was saved by bathing … This boiling water technique, I wouldn’t have learned it if I didn’t want to have a bath. I must thank Michael (pseudonym) for preparing the bathtub.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zukin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While feeling relieved, Ryo started to feel the pain in his ribs from the Kite Snake’s strike.</p>
