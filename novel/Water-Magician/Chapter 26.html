<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Slow Life Crisis</h3>

<p class="calibre2">The day after the battle to the death with One Eye, Ryo returned to the battlefield.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t have any specific reason for doing so. It was on a whim.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing the battlefield once more, he finally felt a sense of victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that was not a place for joy …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something landed in front of Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo’s mind turned blank the moment he saw it.</p><p class="calibre2">Except for just one phrase.</p><p class="calibre2">The end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Dragon ……)</p>
<p class="calibre2">A dragon that shined red and had a total body length of 50 meters.</p><p class="calibre2">His mind was entirely blank but it started spinning at high speed after a few seconds.</p><p class="calibre2">(Why is a dragon here? No, that doesn’t matter right now. I have to do something to escape. No, is it even possible to escape? That is impossible no matter how I look at it. Fight? No, impossible. Even if the world is overturned, it is impossible to fight that. There’s too much of a difference in our class as living organisms. No joke, it could kill me with just the tip of its little finger.)</p><p class="calibre2">He was thinking desperately so he didn’t catch it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;The human there.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">The voice that spoke directly into Ryo’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Mumu? Wasn’t this the method for telepathy with humans? It’s been a long time so I don’t remember. Human, can you hear me?&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? What? I hear something?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo finally returned to reality.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Ah, so you can hear me. It’s me, the dragon in front of you.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“This is telepathy … Ah, yes I’m sorry, my mind was shaken. I can hear you.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;That’s great that’s great, sorry for surprising you. I have something to ask you. Have you seen a bird that evolved from an Assassin Hawk around here?&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh …..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had more than seen it.</p><p class="calibre2">So much so that it was probably the One Eye that Ryo killed the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On one hand, it didn’t seem like it would be possible to lie and on the other hand, even if he did, it would be a disaster once he was exposed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I have.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo replied and told the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything from his fated connection with the one-eyed Assassin Hawk to the result of yesterday’s battle.</p><p class="calibre2">“If it was your kin, I am terribly sorry. I apologize.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo said and lowered his head.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Umu, I see. So you killed it.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">The dragon replied and thought for a while before opening its mouth. No, it spoke with telepathy.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;It’s okay, it was not my kin. It was just that the bird’s reaction suddenly disappeared yesterday. I would have known if someone from the dragon tribe ate it but that didn’t seem to be the case. I was curious as to why it disappeared so I came down from the mountain.”</p><p class="calibre2">It said and looked up at the east mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, the mountain that Ryo thought ‘Seems like there would be dragons living there’ actually had dragons living there.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. I certainly did kill that one-eyed Assassin Hawk.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;I’m content with knowing the cause of its disappearance. It was the first evolution in hundreds of years in this forest. But you were able to beat it. Didn’t it negate magic?&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it did! That was terrible! I’m a magician so magic nullification is breaking the rules.”</p><p class="calibre2">Yup yup, the dragon nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, its gaze suddenly stopped at Ryo’s waist.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;That thing on your waist … what a rare item you have.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Waist?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo took out Murasame and showed it.</p><p class="calibre2">By now, the initial fear of the dragon had disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo’s nerves may be thicker than he thinks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Oo, it is the Fairy King’s sword.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Fairy King? This was given to me by the Dullahan that appeared every night at the lake in the northern wetlands …”</p><p class="calibre2">In Irish folklore, Dullahans are fairies.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;I don’t know about Dullahans but if it gave that to you then that was the Fairy King. The one in this forest is the Water Fairy King, I’m sure of it.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I am a Water Attribute Magician so it gave it to me. Thanks to this sword, I was able to survive yesterday.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;I see, a Water Magician. That’s why the Fairy King favors you. But the Fairy King didn’t teach you Water Magic?&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? No … it taught me swordsmanship and did not show magic to me even once …”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;What? You’re a Water Magician but you learned the sword from the Water Fairy King? Not Water Magic? We-well, I’m not sure so maybe there is a relationship to it … That Fairy King has also lived for hundreds of thousands of years like us … At any rate, since you were given a sword, it certainly favors you. It’s not a bad thing.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">Fufufu, Ryo didn’t know what was interesting but the Dragon laughed.</p>     <p class="calibre2">“Um, I have some questions to ask but …”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Mu? I don’t mind, you can ask me anything.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">The dragon nodded magnanimously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wish to know the size of this Rondo Forest and what kind of place it is.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;What a vague question. Never mind. This forest, right, Rondo … yes that is what they call it since long ago. I can’t tell you the size. Since I do not know your units of measurement.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s right, that is correct … sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Umu. That said, in terms of size, it is about the size of a small continent. In the past, it was also called the Rondo subcontinent.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">“Continent …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo failed to imagine it.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, he did wish to Michael (pseudonym) for ‘a slow life where there are no people’ … but this was too extreme.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;A subcontinent. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides: east, south and west. To the north, there is a mountain range that runs from northwest to southeast and another that collides into it from the east to west. You can say that it perfectly covers the north side of this subcontinent. Therefore, humans do not come this way from the human settlements in the north. To my knowledge, you are the only person currently living in this Rondo subcontinent.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">Wahahahaha, the dragon laughed out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So this is such an isolated world …”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Hm, you’ve lived here without knowing? In the first place, where did you come from?&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t something to hide in particular so Ryo told it that he was reincarnated from a different world.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;That’s something rare too … occasionally people from other worlds come but …&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">At that moment, a roar was heard coming from the east.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Mumu, sorry but I have been called. I wanted to talk a little more but we’ll meet again.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">After saying that, it stood up ready to fly off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“U-um, please at least tell me your name. I am Ryo.”</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Ryo huh? I am Ruwin. We shall meet again, Ryo. Ah, but don’t come close to the east mountain. Some dragons attack without asking questions.&gt;&gt;</p><p class="calibre2">Ruwin said before flying off to the east.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Phew … dragons have such oppressive force. I wonder if its position is like a gatekeeper who surveys the surroundings … That’s why it had such a presence … I can’t imagine the top rank of that mountain. Yeah, I will make sure to keep away.”</p><p class="calibre2">He once again vowed strongly to his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, Ruwin, the 『Dragon King』, headed for the east mountain.</p><p class="calibre2">&lt;&lt;Even so, he was such a strange man. Or was he really human? Are there such humans? That’s the first time I’ve seen something like that in hundreds of thousands of years. Or was he a human mutant or an evolved species? I’ve never heard of such a thing though … Kukuku, anyway it is interesting. Even after living for so long, there are still things that I don’t understand … I think I can see why the Fairy King has his eyes on him. Thousands of years have passed since it came to this subcontinent … I think it was excited to meet something interesting after a long time too, umu, I can understand that feeling. However, I shouldn’t interfere too much, it would be a waste. Watching as a bystander seems to be the most fun, wahahahaha.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a long time before Ryo met Ruwin again.</p><p class="calibre2">As for the Dullahan who seems to be the Fairy King, Ryo would continue to practice swordsmanship as usual tonight.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, being taught Water Magic … didn’t happen after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">*Please read this novel in the original translator’s website to support my work*</strong></p></div>re2">Since the decisive battle with One Eye and the encounter with Ruwin … about 20 years had passed by Ryo’s experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And a crisis came knocking on Ryo’s slow life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, Ryo was heading to the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">He wanted to procure salt and try grilled saltwater fish for the first time in a long time.</p><p class="calibre2">He hadn’t met the Kraken since that time he dived into the sea and was about to be killed by it.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, that said, he had only been to the sea a couple of times a year …</p><p class="calibre2">After all, the memory of almost dying several times in the sea might have unconsciously influenced Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Despite being a Water Attribute Magician, the sea was his weakness …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, the sea is not my weakness. The Kraken is my weakness! I’ve already eaten that shrimp!”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, the shrimp that caused Ryo to faint the first time he dived into the sea. He had defeated it and ate it.</p><p class="calibre2">He also examined the structure of its one large arm closely.</p><p class="calibre2">The most surprising part was that despite emitting such powerful bubbles, it was not a monster but a normal shrimp.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He noticed that it was an enlarged version of the snapping shrimp found in the sea near Japan because it reminded him of a video he saw.</p><p class="calibre2">By engaging its overgrown claw, it would generate bubbles and the bursting of the bubbles would generate a shockwave.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a phenomenon called bubble burst or cavitation that would generate plasma and could reach extreme temperatures of 4400<sup class="calibre6">o</sup>C.</p><p class="calibre2">The snapping shrimp in the sea near Japan grows to about 5c in length but it is capable of generating plasma at that size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three states of matter, solid, liquid, and gas … and the fourth state called plasma.</p><p class="calibre2">The power of nature is terrifying because it can generate that with just the shape of a claw.</p><p class="calibre2">By eating such a shrimp, that fear was overcome!</p><p class="calibre2">However … he was still a long way from overcoming the fear of the Kraken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now then, the sight that Ryo saw of the sea … was messy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In contrast to the usual beautiful white sandy beach and the blue horizon beyond, there were things that weren’t natural and definitely manmade on the beach … and yes, it was strewn about …</p><p class="calibre2">It was as if a ship had wrecked and the debris had washed up on the shore.</p><p class="calibre2">And people were lying among the wreckage.</p><p class="calibre2">Three people?</p><p class="calibre2">It was the first time in 20 years (Ryo’s body clock) since transporting from Earth to『Phi』that he met humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo carefully approached and placed his hand on the nape of the neck to check for a pulse.</p><p class="calibre2">Two of them had already passed away.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining one, in his mid-20s, had dull red hair, a solid physique, and held a sword in his left hand that gave a sense of presence.</p><p class="calibre2">It was clear that he was a man who lived by the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Leaving him here would probably be bad for my mental health.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo had terrible thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Wagon&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">A cart made of ice with a total length of about 2 meters was created.</p><p class="calibre2">It could be called a self-propelled wagon as it could follow just simple movements behind Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Originally, it was conceived because he used to generate an Ice Bahn and slide his luggage over it but it became troublesome and would be too difficult to carry if he hunted too much prey in one go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He actually wanted to make something like a golem that could walk on two legs. It would be able to move on any rough terrain.</p><p class="calibre2">But he couldn’t get a golem to work after many tries and even now after 20 years, it still did not work.</p><p class="calibre2">For the time being, because he travels multiple times a year to and from this beach, he had built a cobblestone road. With that foundation laid, the &lt;Wagon&gt; could move sufficiently well.</p><p class="calibre2">He loaded the still-living man who appeared to be a swordsman and the items around him onto the wagon.</p><p class="calibre2">“Salt … I guess I can come back later for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Ryo noticed it when he was loading him.</p><p class="calibre2">There was a fairly deep cut on the swordsman’s left arm and blood was gushing out.</p><p class="calibre2">“Crimson blood … seems that his artery was cut. At this rate, he’ll die of blood loss … yeah.”</p><p class="calibre2">He looked around for something that could be used.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The basics of stopping blood flow was by compression.</p><p class="calibre2">Just pressing down on the bleeding point with a cloth or something is effective but … the items that drifted onto the beach were dirty and he worried about infectious diseases.</p><p class="calibre2">But other than that … there was no cloth or thread around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s no helping it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo muttered as he pressed down onto the sleeve of the swordsman’s clothes that was above the cut and started compression.</p><p class="calibre2">“60% of an adult’s body is made of water. Two-thirds of it is in cells and the remaining one-third is interstitial fluid and blood. That means that I, a Water Attribute Magician, can manipulate human blood too …”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo imagined it.</p><p class="calibre2">Within the swordsman’s arm in front of him.</p><p class="calibre2">He felt that he could see the inside of the swordsman’s arm through his hand … probably he saw it through the water in both their bodies …</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, he was able to form an image.</p><p class="calibre2">He tried concentrating on the blood vessels.</p><p class="calibre2">“Found the source of bleeding!”</p><p class="calibre2">Around the ruptured blood vessel, he coated the outside with a film of water. When doing so, he took special care to … carefully … not crush the blood vessels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I did it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Ryo’s image, the bleeding from the blood vessel stopped but the only way to see if it had actually stopped bleeding was to remove the hand that was applying pressure.</p><p class="calibre2">He slowly released his hand and watched.</p><p class="calibre2">Blood … did not ooze out!</p><p class="calibre2">“Phew. I somehow did it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Then, Ryo slowly returned home with the wagon containing the swordsman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel woke up.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked around.</p><p class="calibre2">“I was saved …?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His limbs were free. He wasn’t even chained.</p><p class="calibre2">The pendant that he always had on him was still there.</p><p class="calibre2">His trusty sword and leather armor were leaning right next to his bed.</p><p class="calibre2">His arms and legs could move without problem.</p><p class="calibre2">Clothes … he still had his pants on but he wasn’t wearing his shirt.</p><p class="calibre2">There was a deep wound on his left arm but it wasn’t bleeding.</p><p class="calibre2">His condition was generally good.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t seem to have been enslaved to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel got out of bed, stood up, and put on his sword on his waist.</p><p class="calibre2">“A private house … but it’s too big for one. Is it the village mayor’s house?”</p><p class="calibre2">He passed through the living room, opened the door, and went outside.</p><p class="calibre2">The sun was shining brightly and there was a large garden.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s not … a village? Where am I?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, you’re awake. I’m glad I helped you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel turned around in shock. He didn’t sense any presence.</p><p class="calibre2">But he was more surprised by the appearance of the man who called out to him.</p><p class="calibre2">He was one head shorter than Abel. In his late teens, with black hair, and dark skin probably tanned by the sun.</p><p class="calibre2">But above all, the only things he had on were sandals and a loincloth … and that was made by some tanned leather. He wasn’t wearing anything that could be called 『clothes』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Even slum kids would wear something a little more decent … no, that’s not the first thing I should say.)</p><p class="calibre2">“I am Abel. I believe you saved me. You have my thanks.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel said and bowed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, don’t mention it. I just carried you home after I found you washed up from the sea. But I was only able to help Abel-san, the other people had, unfortunately …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, the others were washed up too? Don’t worry, they were smugglers.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Smugglers?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo, who couldn’t grasp the situation well, tilted his head.</p>     <p class="calibre2">(If they were smugglers … then Abel-san who was washed up along with them is … what? A smuggler too? No, if he was a smuggler, he wouldn’t bother mentioning it. He talks with a blunt tone but he doesn’t look like a bad person. A blunt tone … oh, I can understand his language. I don’t think it is Japanese but I can understand it for some reason … I don’t know why but as expected of Michael (pseudonym), a capable man.)</p><p class="calibre2">“For now, have some food. Abel-san’s clothes are being dried here. I believe it is already dry. Oh, right, my name is Ryo. A pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His lifesaver named Ryo was strange in many ways.</p><p class="calibre2">First, food. There was no bread.</p><p class="calibre2">But he had 『rice』.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a grain produced only in the southern part of the central countries and Abel had eaten it before.</p><p class="calibre2">It was combined with various spices … how could he put it, he recalled that such combinations were usually exquisite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiced roast meat that Ryo gave him was surprisingly delicious.</p><p class="calibre2">The combination of firmed rice clumps 『onigiri』 and roast meat felt even more delicious than the combination of bread and meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The clothes that Ryo wore, or rather his loincloth, was made of tanned boar skin.</p><p class="calibre2">He apparently tanned it personally.</p><p class="calibre2">There certainly were traces of hardship.</p><p class="calibre2">But what surprised him the most was that he had no other clothes.</p><p class="calibre2">“You have no other clothes …?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, I couldn’t get my hands on cloth or thread so I couldn’t make any.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No no, even if you can’t make it, you can always buy …”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel regretted it after saying that.</p><p class="calibre2">Naturally, he couldn’t buy what he needed because he didn’t have money.</p><p class="calibre2">Those were words of insult toward his lifesaver.</p><p class="calibre2">“Putting aside a town, not a single person lives around here.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The answer was beyond Abel’s imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon further asking, he found out that this place was called 『Rondo Forest』 and that no one else lived around this area.</p><p class="calibre2">“Rondo Forest? Sorry, but I have never heard of this place. When I was on the boat, I heard them saying that they were being swept south …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s right. In the first place, what happened on the ship that Abel-san was on?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel talked briefly about what happened on the ship.</p><p class="calibre2">It departed from port earlier than planned. Because of that, Abel couldn’t get off.</p><p class="calibre2">They encountered a storm when out at sea and the mast and rudder were destroyed and at that point, they had been swept considerably south.</p><p class="calibre2">And unfortunately, two days later, they were struck by another storm and were swept even further south.</p><p class="calibre2">And in the end, the ship was destroyed by the Kraken.</p><p class="calibre2">“Kraken!”</p><p class="calibre2">Chills ran through Ryo’s body.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m surprised you survived …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, I guess I was lucky. After all, the others died, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel also wondered about Ryo’s weapons.</p><p class="calibre2">He had two knives on his left and right waist.</p><p class="calibre2">Even if he was armed with a knife, he had too little armor.</p><p class="calibre2">Just a loincloth was …</p><p class="calibre2">He knew that knife users or scouts prefer lighter equipment but that was too light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He said that there were no cities around and no one lived here.</p><p class="calibre2">But the exquisite roast meat was a slice of rabbit-type meat.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo probably hunted it.</p><p class="calibre2">In other words, he should be able to fight quite well. Otherwise, he would not be able to live in a land where there is a Kraken offshore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The roast meat just now was excellent. Did Ryo hunt that?”</p><p class="calibre2">He was curious but he hesitated from asking directly.</p><p class="calibre2">He decided to ask in a roundabout manner.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I often hunt them in the forest to the east from here. It is the thigh meat of the Lesser Rabbit.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Um … is Ryo a knife user? I think it is quite difficult to hunt a Lesser Rabbit with a knife.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel was not really good at asking in a roundabout manner. In the end, he just asked directly …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, I am a Water Attribute Magician. This knife can be said to be for self-defense or dismantling …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo answered a little shyly.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic users make up about 20% of the entire 『Phi』 population.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining 80% can’t use magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo, who remembered what Michael (pseudonym) said, felt bashful.</p><p class="calibre2">He expected reactions such as ‘Oh, you can use magic, amazing.’ or ‘So you are a chosen one.’ or ‘I yearn for that ability’.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But …</p><p class="calibre2">“Magic huh? Only half of the people can use it even in the central countries. Incidentally, I can’t use it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Half …”</p><p class="calibre2">(Michael … you said 20%! This is different!)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was depressed and displayed a ‘What a shock!’ expression from graphic novels.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? Ryo, what’s wrong?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, it’s nothing …”</p>
