<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; I’m craving River Fish</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“I feel like eating fish once in a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo muttered to himself one day after finishing his morning practice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Grilled fish would be nice. I’d love to have it grilled with salt. To be honest, I want to drizzle some soy sauce … but that is just wishful thinking since I don’t have soy sauce so I’ll compromise on that. All right, let’s have salt-grilled fish tonight for dinner!”</p><p class="calibre2">Now that he had decided on it, he should take action immediately.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no sea here but river fish should suffice.</p><p class="calibre2">That was because the images that came to mind when Ryo imagined salt-grilled fishes were grilled sweetfish and rainbow trout.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His choice for the tool to catch fish was his usual knife-tipped bamboo spear.</p><p class="calibre2">“I actually wanted to have a barbed tip that curved back at the end like a harpoon but … I’ll have to give up on that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fishing was previously something that Ryo would never opt for.</p><p class="calibre2">“This time I won’t need the hemp bag.”</p><p class="calibre2">With the knife-tipped bamboo spear in his hand, Ryo headed toward the river located to the south of his home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was absolutely not because he wanted to have fun.</p><p class="calibre2">Right, definitely not.</p><p class="calibre2">Probably … not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, it so happened that there was a crocodile at the river bank.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not listed in the 『Monster Encyclopedia: Beginner Edition』.</p><p class="calibre2">Therefore it was probably an 『animal』 rather than a 『monster』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, on 『Phi』, there were millions of types of existences that were not monsters, or in other words, ordinary animals.</p><p class="calibre2">The difference between monsters and animals would be the small stone called a 『Magic Stone』 located near the heart of monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">In addition, depending on the species, some monsters were capable of using 『Magic』.</p><p class="calibre2">And most of the time, monsters were more violent and stronger than ordinary animals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For that reason, in Rondo Forest where strong monsters roam, most ordinary animal types had been exterminated.</p><p class="calibre2">That was the reason why Ryo had not seen any animals in Rondo Forest until now.</p><p class="calibre2">However, now, there was an animal in front of his eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though it was a huge crocodile-type animal over 5 meters in length, it was still an animal …</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to a famous Japanese book on Earth … 『How to hold a crocodile』, the way to go was to approach it from behind.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a book a friend showed Ryo when he was a primary school student.</p><p class="calibre2">“That probably won’t come useful” … Ryo thought to himself so he didn’t read it properly.</p><p class="calibre2">Now he regretted it.</p><p class="calibre2">There really was no telling what would be useful where!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I don’t necessarily have to catch it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Right, it wasn’t as though the crocodile was coming toward him.</p><p class="calibre2">It had not noticed him yet so he just had to secretly move upstream such that it doesn’t notice him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Jiiiiiaaaaa”</p><p class="calibre2">“Guomooon”</p><p class="calibre2">After moving about 50 meters from the crocodile, Ryo heard the cries of beasts.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed that the crocodile he saw just now was fighting something.</p><p class="calibre2">Despite going through the trouble of gaining a distance from it, now he was curious as to what the crocodile was fighting.</p><p class="calibre2">He tried to secretly catch a glimpse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After creeping closer to look, Ryo saw a bull charge at the crocodile and pierce it with its horns, raising it above its head.</p><p class="calibre2">The crocodile seemed to have breathed its last breath.</p><p class="calibre2">“Horn Bison … as the name implies, I have to watch out for its horns. They often appear around rivers and swamps. I have to be aware of its charge using Wind Attribute Magic to wrap around its body. Oh. Right, let’s try my new technique.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo raised his left hand above his head and chanted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Guillotine&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">An Icicle Lance with a guillotine-shaped tip flew into the sky from his left hand and gained sufficient acceleration before dropping onto the Horn Bison’s neck from directly above.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, success.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo grinned.</p><p class="calibre2">The Horn Bison’s head was decapitated with a single strike and fell into the water as blood spurted out from its neck.</p><p class="calibre2">“Maybe I can use it to practice tanning cowhide.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo slowly approached the corpses of the Horn Bison and crocodile as he muttered that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Ryo then saw a scene …</p><p class="calibre2">Basha basha basha.</p><p class="calibre2">The Horn Bison head and crocodile body that fell into the water seemed to become smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hn? Hmm? What’s happening …”</p><p class="calibre2">He quickly gripped the Horn Bison’s torso and tossed it onto land.</p><p class="calibre2">Even then, there already were several fishes biting it.</p><p class="calibre2">“These seem like piranhas … they aren’t listed in the Monster Encyclopedia but … carnivores … they are probably related to piranhas.”</p><p class="calibre2">The piranha-like fishes had a body length over 40cm and possessed violent-looking teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, he stabbed at the ones biting to the Horn Bison with his knife-tipped bamboo spear.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, he froze the entire Horn Bison torso.</p><p class="calibre2">During that time, he caught glimpses of the Horn Bison head and crocodile body in the water become smaller …. before disappearing.</p><p class="calibre2">The piranhas, which seemed to have been attracted by blood, disappeared and the river returned to its previous tranquility.</p><p class="calibre2">“I definitely can’t play in the water here.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo swore firmly in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hunt ended in less than an hour but the sight of the piranhas was quite shocking. After all, the smell of blood attracted all kinds of monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">He had to keep that in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">He took the Horn Bison and piranhas and stored them in the storage in their frozen state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now then, he managed to acquire 『Fish』 in this round’s hunt.</p><p class="calibre2">It was different from the 『Sweetfish』 and 『Rainbow Trout』 that he imagined but it was still river fish.</p><p class="calibre2">For dinner, he would salt-grill the piranha and one great possibility was born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had fish.</p><p class="calibre2">He had salt too.</p><p class="calibre2">And he didn’t have soybean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that black liquid that can be said to be the heart of Japanese … 『Soy sauce』. The possibility to acquire that was born.</p><p class="calibre2">But he did not have soybeans.</p><p class="calibre2">Originally soy sauce was born from 『miso』 which is fundamentally made with soybean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, he didn’t have soybeans.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Although he didn’t have soybeans, there was a method on Earth to acquire 『soy sauce』 without soybeans.</p><p class="calibre2">That was 『fish sauce』.</p><p class="calibre2">As the word reads, it is a 『soy sauce』 made fundamentally with 『fish』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the soy sauce Japanese people are familiar with, it has a stronger aroma and often has a stronger taste.</p><p class="calibre2">But it was used for local cuisine all over Japan.</p><p class="calibre2">In other words, it was compatible with Japanese food!</p><p class="calibre2">It might not make it for tonight’s piranha salt-grill but someday, he could look forward to drizzling some soy sauce.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yup, I have to do this!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The method to make the fish sauce was extremely simple.</p><p class="calibre2">Pickle the fish with salt.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All he has to do was wait a few months for it to ferment naturally.</p><p class="calibre2">“The question would be what barrel to ferment them in.”</p><p class="calibre2">Barrels made with Water Attribute Magic could be created in an instant. The shape and size were up to him too.</p><p class="calibre2">But it would be an ice barrel so it would be cold …</p><p class="calibre2">For most storage, that coldness was not an issue, in fact, it was a huge merit.</p><p class="calibre2">But fish sauce required 『fermentation』.</p><p class="calibre2">A certain temperature was needed to allow the fermentation to occur to give rise to fish sauce.</p><p class="calibre2">If the ice container was too cold, fermentation would not occur … at the very least it had to be above room temperature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, the first step was to create a wooden barrel.</p><p class="calibre2">Naturally, Ryo had never created anything like that in his life.</p><p class="calibre2">Even if he tried his best, the bottom might come off or the contents might leak out.</p><p class="calibre2">For the time being, it would be great if there was a barrel-like tree somewhere.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see the candidates!”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, this was Rondo Forest.</p><p class="calibre2">Some of the trees had grown to be unimaginably thick as compared to those on Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">And they were right next to the home barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The diameter of the trunk was approximately 2 meters. 10 meters in height. It was a coniferous tree like cedar and cypress.</p><p class="calibre2">With heavy machinery like those on Earth … no, it might be quite troublesome to cut down a tree of that size even with heavy machinery.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, Ryo did not have any heavy machinery on hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, in exchange for heavy machinery, he had 『Magic』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, he could use Water Jet to cut through … but that was still impossible.</p><p class="calibre2">Although he had been practicing Water Jet ever since he came to 『Phi』, it still did not possess the strength to cut down trees.</p><p class="calibre2">However, Ryo had other means.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, the 『Guillotine』 that beheaded the Horn Bison in one hit.</p><p class="calibre2">“『Guillotine』”</p><p class="calibre2">Zashun</p><p class="calibre2">The guillotine dug roughly a meter into the trunk before stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We-well, I didn’t expect to cut it down in a single hit!”</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t sound very convincing but he continued to chant.</p><p class="calibre2">“『Guillotine』”</p><p class="calibre2">He fired off consecutive shots of the guillotine.</p><p class="calibre2">Finally, he managed to slice through and the conifer fell along with a resounding boom.</p><p class="calibre2">There was quite a lot of deforestation around the area affected but Ryo didn’t mind it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the fallen coniferous tree, he chose a one-meter-long section that would become the barrel and started cutting.</p><p class="calibre2">“『Guillotine』”</p><p class="calibre2">“『Guillotine』”</p><p class="calibre2">Here, he used the same consecutive shots of the guillotine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a diameter of 2 meters and height of 1 meter, visually it looked like a splendid but slightly large table was carved out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next would be to carve out the interior to shape the barrel.</p><p class="calibre2">The tool of choice was the &lt;Water Saw&gt;.</p><p class="calibre2">The &lt;Water Saw&gt; that he once failed to shoot out as an offensive spell.</p><p class="calibre2">He probably could use it as a ranged offensive spell now similar to the Icicle Lance but now he didn’t require that effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Saw&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">On his right palm, a rotating saw made of water was generated.</p><p class="calibre2">And he proceeded to carve the cut-out section of the coniferous tree.</p><p class="calibre2">It cut at a speed comparable to the chainsaws on Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">There was almost no resistance and no material stress either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took about an hour before he finally managed to carve out a satisfactory shape.</p><p class="calibre2">Visually it looked like a private open-air bath made of cypress wood in luxury hot spring inns.</p><p class="calibre2">He moved it home by creating Ice Bahn underneath the fermentation barrel. It was truly a convenient spell.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though the content has been hollowed out, due to the large size … it should weigh considerably heavy.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, Ryo noticed when he brought it home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This barrel … where should I put it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, it was too big to fit through the door.</p>
