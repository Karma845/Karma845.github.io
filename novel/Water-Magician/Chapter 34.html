<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; Abel's Sacrifice</h3>

 
<p class="calibre2">The next day, early morning.</p><p class="calibre2">The previous night’s lookout was Ryo for the first half and Abel for the second half too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Ryo woke up in the morning, Abel wasn’t in front of the bonfire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was swinging his sword in the distance.</p><p class="calibre2">His appearance was so sophisticated that it wouldn’t feel strange to called it a 『Sword Dance』.</p><p class="calibre2">Slowly, but without a momentary delay, the sword was swung to verify the body’s movements.</p><p class="calibre2">It was completely different from the basic movements in Ryo’s Kendo or Japanese swordsmanship.</p><p class="calibre2">However, those movements fascinated Ryo, even as an outsider of the swordsmanship of 『Phi』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Swordsmanship achieved by carefully pilling on every foundation and basics.</p><p class="calibre2">That may be the outcome of a person who has both the natural talent and the fruits of their efforts.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps Abel himself didn’t think that he was working hard.</p><p class="calibre2">‘This is the norm’ ‘Just ordinary’ … he probably thought that as he swung his sword … even though it would look to others that he was working hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just because you make an effort does not mean that you will get the results you want, when you want them.</p><p class="calibre2">Therefore, some people say, ‘Even if you make an effort, you will not be rewarded.’</p><p class="calibre2">It’s saddening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But to Ryo.&nbsp;He believed that hard work does not betray you.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It was certainly not always possible to get the desired result at the desired timing.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the result of the effort will surely come.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, it was also true that it wouldn’t make sense to some no matter how many times you say it … After all, people may not understand it unless they experience it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">People believe what they want to believe … that’s the kind of creatures people are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo watched Abel’s 『Sword Dance』 and thought that if people looked at a person like Abel up close, it might change them a little.</p><p class="calibre2">While fascinated and impressed, Ryo unknowingly analyzed and remembered each of Abel’s movements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, Ryo, you’re awake?”</p><p class="calibre2">After finishing a series of movements, Abel called out to Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, Abel had noticed that Ryo had been watching for a long time.</p><p class="calibre2">He was watching quietly and he wanted to move his body a little more, so he kept swinging his sword.</p><p class="calibre2">He had been used to being watched from a long time ago so it didn’t really bother him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s amazing. I thought Abel’s sword was nice, but it’s really sophisticated and beautiful.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo praised him from the bottom of his heart.</p><p class="calibre2">“Stop it. I’ve been doing it for a long time, so I just remembered with my body. I’ve sweat a little so I’ll go wash up in the river.”</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah, was he training in the morning because there was a river nearby? If he could bathe in the river, I wouldn’t have to use &lt;Shower&gt;. Abel is considerate for various things.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">For breakfast, they baked and ate the fish that Abel caught while bathing.</p><p class="calibre2">Breakfast was crucial.</p><p class="calibre2">That was an enduring fact from ancient times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The river seems to be flowing from the north, so perhaps we can try traveling upstream along the river?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I thought that was a good plan too.”</p><p class="calibre2">(Maybe …)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo thought to himself and decided to disclose the information to Abel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, this land we are in is surrounded by the sea on three sides, east, south, and west.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, so that’s why we’re heading north?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. However, there is a mountain range in the north. And another mountain range that spans from the east to west that intersects with it. That forms a sort of lid that covers the north. And humans live beyond that mountain range, on the northern side.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel had suspicions when he heard that.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ryo, I do not doubt you but … where is that information from?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s better not to ask. Just know that it is information from a being that is beyond human comprehension.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that said, Ryo stared fixedly at Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">At times like these, the eyes speak as much as the mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">He shouldn’t look away.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Looking at how Ryo was acting, Abel nodded.</p><p class="calibre2">“Okay, if that’s what Ryo says, I believe you. Either way, there’s no other information to rely on.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you, Abel.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo said and bowed his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I’m the grateful one. If you’re saying this at this timing, do you think that the river may be flowing from the mountain range to the north?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right. Well, it’s just a possibility. For now, keep in mind we’ll eventually have to cross the mountains as we head north.”</p><p class="calibre2">“All right.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two walked along the river toward the north.</p><p class="calibre2">After walking for a while, they encountered a Horn Bison drinking water.</p><p class="calibre2">The cow monster Ryo saw a long time ago that pierced a crocodile at a river near his house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That Horn Bison was mercilessly hunted by Abel for lunch that day.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo remembered when he met the Horn Bison.</p><p class="calibre2">It gouged the crocodile but there were piranhas in that river.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it seemed that there were no such devilish fish in this river.</p><p class="calibre2">Otherwise, Abel would have been eaten by piranhas as of last evening.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was only aware now that he had asked for something terrifying when he thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Ryo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, oh, what’s wrong with Abel?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you hiding something inconvenient for me?”</p><p class="calibre2">(Is he an esper!)</p><p class="calibre2">In Ryo’s heart, his face reflected the expression of the graphic novel-like 『Scream』 portrait.</p><p class="calibre2">At times like these, it was best to dodge the question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At times like these, the eyes speak as much as the mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">He shouldn’t look away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I- I have completely no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, your eyes are looking at me straight, but you’re sweating, your words are shaking, I can tell even if I try not to, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel was staring at Ryo intently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, Ryo desperately tried to dodge the issue, but after a while, he gave up and told Abel about the Horn Bison and Piranha.</p><p class="calibre2">“So there are such terrifying fishes …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course, I didn’t intentionally offer Abel as a sacrifice, okay?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Obviously … well, there weren’t such fishes yesterday or this morning, so perhaps they are not found in this river … Ryo, do you have anything else you should be telling me? Don’t hide any other information that could be life-threatening for me. Is that okay?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, okay. I will give Abel all the information I know.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, that was a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He didn’t tell him anything about the Dragon or Dullahan.</p><p class="calibre2">However, those were decided by Ryo as matters that would be better not told, different from the piranha incident that he had completely forgotten about and did not tell him.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo arbitrarily decided it that way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It goes without saying that Abel entered the river more carefully than yesterday when procuring food in the river that evening.</p>
