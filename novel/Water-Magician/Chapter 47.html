<h3>Chapter 47 &#8211; Victory Celebration</h3>

     
<p class="calibre2">“Then, to celebrate the end of Ryo and Amon’s course, cheers!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the dining room attached to the guild, a celebration was held by the four people from Room 10 of the dormitory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, the cafeteria did not serve alcohol nor could they bring some in.</p><p class="calibre2">In the first place, Amon was still a minor so he couldn’t drink alcohol either.</p><p class="calibre2">And so, all four of them had juices instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Niles and Ryo had apple-like Rindo juice, while Etho and Amon had orange juice.</p><p class="calibre2">Both were good for the body so they were quite popular with men and women adventurers.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Not only that, hunting a Soldier Ant in your first dungeon dive during the course’s practical … not bad, the two of you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Etho said with a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I only dealt the final blow; it was thanks to Ryo who stopped its movements.”</p><p class="calibre2">Amon said bashfully while holding a piece of chicken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Amon, you were able to defeat it with a proper swing of your blade so there is no need to be humble.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo praised Amon while eating a beef-like steak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, in any case, all is well since you guys were able to get a magic stone.”</p><p class="calibre2">Niles laughed heartily while holding a bone-in chicken thigh in each hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The food in the guild cafeteria was delicious.</p><p class="calibre2">And the serving was also large.</p><p class="calibre2">Although it was a restaurant that could be used not only by adventurers but also by the residents of the City of Rune, since the main customers were adventurers, the fundamental portions were huge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Our party will be taking a break tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, but what do the two of you plan to do?”</p><p class="calibre2">After finishing each dish, Etho asked Ryo and Amon while drinking a refill of his juice.</p><p class="calibre2">It was Friday night.&nbsp;Niles’ party rested on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d like to dive into the dungeon a little … but going alone is a bit … should I look for a random party?”</p><p class="calibre2">Amon was motivated because he didn’t want to forget the sensation he felt today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Amon, so fired up! That’s how a vanguard should be!”</p><p class="calibre2">Niles, as a Swordsman, seemed to care about Amon, who was an Apprentice Swordsman, as fellow vanguards.</p><p class="calibre2">“I understand your feelings, but there are many hits and misses when joining random parties …”</p><p class="calibre2">Etho did not recommend finding a random party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If that’s the case, do you want to dive with me? I’m thinking of taking a look up until the third floor.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Really!? Yes please, I would love to!”</p><p class="calibre2">Amon hopped onto Ryo’s suggestion immediately.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m a little worried that there were ants on the first floor.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, typically we only see things like bats on the first floor. Now that I think about it, didn’t we come across a Soldier Ant on the first floor too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, we did. When I asked the guild, it seemed that there had been occasional reports of encounters with Soldier Ants on the first or second floors in the past six months.”</p><p class="calibre2">Etho seemed to have sought confirmation with the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why are ants appearing even though they shouldn’t be there?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s because the ants are digging holes vertically and crawling up.”</p><p class="calibre2">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Niles, Etho, and Amon were surprised by the sudden intruder and looked toward the voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, I’m not impressed that you would scare newcomers as a veteran.”</p><p class="calibre2">Only Ryo wasn’t surprised because he was aware of the signs that Abel was approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">“Scare … I’m pretty sure all I did was answer the newcomer’s question accurately.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel sighed while making a bitter face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You guys are Ryo’s roommates, right? I’m Abel. Ryo’s strength isn’t bad, but he has a personality problem, so please try to put up with it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, are you trying to start a fight?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A provocation coming from Abel.&nbsp;Ryo accepted it and stood up.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, they were just fooling around.</p>     <p class="calibre2">“Ah, Abel … Abel from Crimson Sword! I’m Niles, a Swordsman. I’m just a fledgling F-rank adventurer who recently came to Rune, but you’re my idol! If it’s not too much to ask, could I please shake hands with you …”</p><p class="calibre2">Niles, who was feeling nervous, stood up stiffly at attention and introduced himself to Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, of course.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel held Niles’ hand and replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do your best. But don’t overdo it. After all, survival is paramount for adventurers, especially in dungeons.”</p><p class="calibre2">(I think the reason why Abel is so popular is that he can say these kinds of things smoothly while shaking hands.)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo thought to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Anyway, why is Abel in the guild at this time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was close to 8 pm.</p><p class="calibre2">Typically adventurers would finish their reports to the guild by about 6 pm and then either return home or go out for a drink.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, it was quite unimaginable to see them in the guild near 8 pm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I was significantly delayed by the request I picked up. I just only arrived back.”</p><p class="calibre2">Just as Abel explained, a voice echoed from behind Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah~! Abel, here you are!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was Rin, Abel’s Magician party member.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, didn’t I tell you that you have to report to the Guild Master. Don’t run away.”</p><p class="calibre2">The priest, Rihya, called out from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, you see, as a veteran, it is my duty to give guidance to newcomers …”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, Ryo and others. I’ll take Abel. Warren, hold Abel.”</p><p class="calibre2">After Rin said that, Warren, the Shield-Bearer, lightly lifted Abel onto his shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel was also quite tall, at about 190 centimeters, but Warren, who could be said to be a giant standing over 2 meters tall, could “lightly” lift him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, wait, Warren. I can walk on my own. Hey, put me down.”</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing the scene, laughter rose from the surroundings.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ryo, I’m sorry. We have to report to the Guild Master, so we’ll take Abel.”</p><p class="calibre2">As usual, Rihya’s voice sounded like ringing bells.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, of course. He’s the leader of the Crimson Sword so you can boil him or grill him however you wish.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ryo, you traitor! I said let me down Warren.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That was … an amazing sight …”</p><p class="calibre2">Amon said very calmly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, Rihya-san, just like an angel …”</p>

<p class="calibre2">Etho was muttering something.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel-san is really cool.”</p><p class="calibre2">Nile was lost in his own world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was there even a ‘cool’ element just now …</p>
