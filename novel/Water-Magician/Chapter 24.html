<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Final Battle Against the Assassin Hawk</h3>

 
<p class="calibre2">While hunting for meat in the east forest as routine, it appeared in front of Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Shield&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo sensed an invisible wind-attribute attack magic coming from in front and intercepted it with Ice Shield.</p><p class="calibre2">The opponent probably had no intention of killing him with that blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With its right eye shut …</p><p class="calibre2">“That Assassin Hawk? But its color is now completely black and more importantly, it seems bigger than before …”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, it was the Assassin Hawk that Ryo had life or death struggles with twice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first time, he crushed the Assassin Hawk’s right eye.</p><p class="calibre2">The second time, he defeated the disciple that the Assassin Hawk brought along.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To Ryo, it was the first opponent that made him conscious of death.</p><p class="calibre2">And not only once but twice.</p><p class="calibre2">They both felt that they were fated enemies.</p><p class="calibre2">But this time, it had a different dominating presence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like its physical transformation, there was a change in its presence or majesty …</p><p class="calibre2">It felt as though it had a different aura around it.</p><p class="calibre2">“There’s no mistaking that it has become considerably stronger. Did it evolve or something? At any rate, I won’t be able to escape and I don’t intend to escape either! &lt;Ice Armor&gt;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something invisible flew from One Eye toward Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">(A strengthened Air Slash? &lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">But the Ice Wall 5 layers were shattered in one hit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, Air Slashes continuously assaulted Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo evaded the invisible attacks.</p><p class="calibre2">And even as he evaded, he never took his sight off One Eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One Eye persistently attacked repeatedly from a long distance.</p><p class="calibre2">And Ryo dodged all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That exchanged lasted for about three minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">At the same time it released an Air Slash, One Eye disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Wall 10 layers&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">A powered-up version of the defense-specialized Ice Wall 5 layers.</p><p class="calibre2">One Eye charged in together with the Air Slash.</p><p class="calibre2">“A breakdown charge! What an enviable technique for Wind Magic users!” <em class="calibre5">(TLN: To recap, the ‘breakdown’ charge is&nbsp; Ryo’s own term. The previous time it was explained as having 3 clones firing ranged attacks and then following up with a direct charge)</em></p><p class="calibre2">Although that is a technique that only monsters can use … and something human Wind Attribute Magicians can’t …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as One Eye’s charge was about to be stopped by the Ice Wall,</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Icicle Lance 16&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">He shot Icicle Lances from the ground toward One Eye.</p><p class="calibre2">One Eye dodged it with instant lateral movements that completely ignored aerodynamics.</p><p class="calibre2">In that state, it swung its right wing against the Ice Wall 10 layers as though a boxer releasing a right hook.</p><p class="calibre2">“Shit.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo crouched down at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shari</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a sharp sound, the wings cut through the Ice Wall and continued over Ryo’s crouched head.</p><p class="calibre2">“So it can fight in close combat too …”</p><p class="calibre2">Cold sweat ran down Ryo’s back from the terrifying sharpness of the wings.</p><p class="calibre2">One Eye continued to fire Air Slashes consecutively from a close distance.</p><p class="calibre2">And Ryo endured by continuously generating Ice Walls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, Ryo did not remain pushed back.</p><p class="calibre2">Before it noticed, 16 Icicle Lances had formed in the air.</p><p class="calibre2">They free-fell vertically from directly above it.</p><p class="calibre2">It was the fastest ice spear that added gravity acceleration to the speed of a long-range attack.</p><p class="calibre2">However, One Eye showed that it could evade that as well.</p><p class="calibre2">It flew backward as if it was lightly backstepping.</p><p class="calibre2">As though it was conveying that ‘I had seen that technique before’.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, Ryo did kill One Eye’s disciple with Icicle Lances from the air.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the speed of the spears was completely different from back then …</p><p class="calibre2">For now, he had to return to square one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, the atmosphere around One Eye changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, the Ice Wall and the Ice Armor around him disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">(Guh. &lt;Ice Armor&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">The Ice Armor did not form even after chanting.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did it snatch my control!?”</p><p class="calibre2">He quickly tried to regain magic control … but something was different.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no ‘repulsion’ sensation that would always be there in such cases.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In retrospect, even when the Bait Ball and Kraken took control, he could at least still create the Ice Walls.</p><p class="calibre2">The created objects were taken control of.</p><p class="calibre2">But this time, the creation itself could not be done.</p><p class="calibre2">As if magic did not exist.</p><p class="calibre2">Or magic was made ineffective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t tell me this is magic nullification …?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He didn’t know if such a thing existed.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it was best to think of it that way.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, it was pretty bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(&lt;Water Jet 16&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">As expected, the Water Jets did not form.</p><p class="calibre2">“It gained such a troublesome skill after evolving …”</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, in the entry for Assassin Hawk in the 『Monster Encyclopedia Beginner’s Edition』, there was not a single mention of 『Magic Nullification』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, One Eye seemed to be accumulating something.</p><p class="calibre2">(Another new technique … it might be something dangerous from Wind Attribute Magic … Wind Attribute? No, no way …)</p><p class="calibre2">Was it a coincidence that he looked up at the sky and immediately let go of the knife-tipped bamboo spear he had in his right hand? Or was it due to his refined combat intuition from his daily interpersonal battle with the Dullahan?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, the sky flashed and lightning struck.</p>     <p class="calibre2">The lightning fell on the standing bamboo spear instead of Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">However, Ryo, who was right next to it, was blown away by the impact.</p><p class="calibre2">But he immediately got up.</p><p class="calibre2">If he showed even a small opening, One Eye would charge in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It probably saw him sway as he got up.</p><p class="calibre2">And it might have judged that his magic was sealed and that he no longer had a weapon.</p><p class="calibre2">Or perhaps it was thinking that even if the thunder didn’t defeat him, it managed to snatch his weapon away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One Eye charged in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo rolled to the left to dodge One Eye’s assault and pulled out Murasame that was on his waist.</p><p class="calibre2">The moment he pulled it out, he formed the ice blade and swung it sideways toward One Eye.</p><p class="calibre2">That seemed to have surprised One Eye. It moved quite a fair bit backward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Surprisingly, even though it moved backward, it didn’t retreat any further.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed to wish to settle the fight with close-quarters combat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was what Ryo wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As long as his magic was sealed, he had no way of surviving apart from relying on close-quarters combat.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, not all magic was sealed as he could still somehow create the ice blade on Murasame.</p><p class="calibre2">He found it perplexing but that wasn’t the time to think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One Eye had the hook that could cut through all 10 layers of his Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no telling if it was hiding anything else.</p><p class="calibre2">He had to sharpen all his senses.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, just like when he was facing the Dullahan.</p><p class="calibre2">However, when he thought about that, he was relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was what he had always been doing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, look straight ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of stillness.</p><p class="calibre2">While floating in the air, One Eye released a right and left hook.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo carefully received it with Murasame.</p><p class="calibre2">He did not dodge, but instead, received it.</p><p class="calibre2">He was confident that the ice blade on Murasame could defend against One Eye’s hook that could cut through 10 layers of Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">Far from breaking, it didn’t even chip.</p><p class="calibre2">Something flew from between its beak toward Ryo’s eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo shook his head and dodged it. It was probably some form of Air Slash.</p><p class="calibre2">An Air Slash that could be released with its mouth and not its wings.</p><p class="calibre2">But he didn’t dwell on it.</p><p class="calibre2">If his thoughts were entrapped, he would not be able to see what he needed to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing One Eye in close-quarters combat was quite troublesome.</p><p class="calibre2">Air Slashes from left-right hooks and the beak and each feather could be shot like a shuriken.</p><p class="calibre2">The speed of the shuriken was not fast but facing more means of attack from an opponent in close-quarters combat … that alone was enough to be troublesome.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo would have been defeated a long time ago if he had not been devoted to defense.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the diverse attacks including the shuriken were insufficient to break Ryo’s defense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One Eye’s attack and Ryo’s defense had been ongoing ever since the start of the close-quarters combat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps frustrated by his unbreakable defense, One Eye’s right hook was slightly overextended.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo took advantage of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He intercepted One Eye’s right hook slightly ahead than usual in a place where it could not channel much power to and parried it away.</p><p class="calibre2">Toward One Eye whose posture was broken, he mowed down sideways near its neck.</p><p class="calibre2">One Eye flew further backward but Ryo stepped in and followed up with a thrust.</p><p class="calibre2">While dodging even further backward, the Air Slash that it threw as a last resort with its beak was parried with Murasame and he thrust three times consecutively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But One Eye dodged them all.</p><p class="calibre2">After One Eye evaded the triple thrust, Ryo’s assault paused momentarily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, One Eye aimed a left hook at Ryo’s head.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo couldn’t prevent it.</p><p class="calibre2">He pulled his left foot half a step back.</p><p class="calibre2">He dodged it with footwork and by moving his center of gravity.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, this time, he shifted his center of gravity from his left foot to his right foot, took a large step forward with his right foot, released his right-hand grip from Murasame, and thrust out with his left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A one-handed left-hand thrust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He felt a solid response from Murasame in his left hand.</p><p class="calibre2">His thrust pierced exactly under its beak or, in human terms, around its throat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A fatal strike.</p><p class="calibre2">It fell to the ground and spat out blood from its beak but yet its one eye was trained on Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">There was still indelible hatred in its eye.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I am the one who took your life and the life of your disciple. I guess you can’t accept the outcome after fighting with all your might.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo did not let down his guard even though he was approaching casually.</p><p class="calibre2">“At the very least, I was able to grow because I met you. I am grateful to you for being the catalyst for my growth. You even evolved for revenge and your disciple. In honor of your proud appearance, I will give you a merciful end.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">On that day, one fate was extinguished.</p>
