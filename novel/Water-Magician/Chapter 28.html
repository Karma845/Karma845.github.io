<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; Two-Person Journey</h3>

  
<p class="calibre2">“Now then, shall we depart?”</p><p class="calibre2">After Ryo made a final check to ensure he didn’t forget anything, he announced to Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, let’s go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them were lightly equipped.</p><p class="calibre2">In the first place, Abel was shipwrecked so he didn’t have any luggage.</p><p class="calibre2">He only had his clothes, wallet, light armor, and sword.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo only had the robe he received from the Dullahan, loincloth, sandals, knife, Murasame, and seasonings.</p><p class="calibre2">Since they were crossing through a forest, having fewer luggage was better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Basically all our food will have to be procured. I have salt and pepper seasoning and I can produce water so there are no issues there but we will be hunting animals and monsters and eating wild fruits. Well, this forest has many living organisms so I believe there won’t be any problems.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Understood.”</p><p class="calibre2">“After heading north for some time, we will come across a fairly large wetland. I have traveled up to that point before so I know the situation. For now, there won’t be any significant monster encounters until we reach that point.”</p><p class="calibre2">While saying that, his first encounter with the one-eyed Assassin Hawk came to Ryo’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">At that time, he encountered it in this north forest.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Then let’s head for the wetland for now.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After leaving the barrier, the two of them were silent for a while.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was thinking of the house he lived in for a long time while Abel was worried about Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel finally couldn’t endure it and asked.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey, Ryo. I have something I wish to ask.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What’s that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Um … this might be a brash question so it is okay to not answer if you don’t want to … but where did you go last night?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel hesitated as he couldn’t help but to feel curious regarding the matter that he shouldn’t pry into …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s fine. Yesterday I went to my master’s place to let them know that I would be away for a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Master? Did that master give you that robe?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, you’re right. I received it as a farewell gift.”</p><p class="calibre2">At a glance, it looked to be of good quality but appeared to be a regular robe.</p><p class="calibre2">But Abel felt something was different about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel had grown up surrounded by quality and beautiful products.</p><p class="calibre2">Therefore, he had an eye for such items. That eye was telling him.</p><p class="calibre2">(That isn’t something ordinary.)</p><p class="calibre2">But he didn’t know what was extraordinary about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Um … does that robe have any special effects?”</p><p class="calibre2">Normally it would be taboo to ask such a question but it wasn’t taboo to ask someone within the party.</p><p class="calibre2">Without knowing the weapons, armor, or special skills of party members, they would not be able to cooperate during an emergency.</p><p class="calibre2">However, Abel asked Ryo simply because he wanted to know the true reason for the sense of incongruity he felt.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn~ I don’t think there is anything in particular. Because master didn’t say anything.”</p><p class="calibre2">The Dullahan had never spoken before.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, that was expected given that it didn’t have anything above its neck.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see …”</p><p class="calibre2">If the owner didn’t know about it, there was nothing he could do.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel wasn’t convinced but there wasn’t anything else he could do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the meantime, they arrived at the northern wetlands.</p><p class="calibre2">“For this wetland, we will detour to the left toward the west and then head north. I don’t know much about what lies beyond there so I think we should be more cautious.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, all right.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel nodded.</p><p class="calibre2">“I wonder if most magicians speak in coherent manners. My companion, a magician I have known from my hometown, speaks as Ryo does.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is that so … I have not met other magicians before so I can’t comment on that …”</p><p class="calibre2">(Not to mention other magicians, Abel is the first human being I have met.)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo thought to himself and smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They bypassed the northern wetlands and did not encounter any monsters even after leaving the wetlands northward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After proceeding further north, about mid-afternoon going to evening, they finally encountered a monster.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s a Lesser Boar.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Like mentioned yesterday, I’ll do it. Ryo, please watch from behind.”</p><p class="calibre2">Saying that, Abel drew his sword.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo did as he was asked and stood back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Ryo’s mind, the scene of his first battle after coming to 『Phi』 was being revived.</p><p class="calibre2">(Right, the opponent for my first battle was a Lesser Boar too. I was exposed to murderous intent for the first time in my life and got rooted. In the end, I defeated it by piercing it with Ice Bahn and Icicle Lance … so nostalgic.)</p><p class="calibre2">While Ryo was remembering, the battle began.</p><p class="calibre2">The Lesser Boar charged at Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Combat Art: Side Step.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel avoided the Lesser Boar’s charge by side-stepping to the side with minimal movement just before it reached him.</p><p class="calibre2">And while dodging,</p><p class="calibre2">“Combat Art: Perfect Pierce”</p><p class="calibre2">The blade pierced into the left ear of the Lesser Boar. The sword reached its brain and the Lesser Boar was killed without achieving anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was surprised. Not by that skillful execution … but by that 『thing』 he just learned.</p><p class="calibre2">(Combat Art!? What is that? That side-step to the side and that final pierce through the ear. So 『Phi』 has such things too.)</p><p class="calibre2">“Phew, this will be dinner for tonight. Hn? What’s wrong, Ryo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, no, that was the first time I’ve seen Combat Art so …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I see. Magicians can’t use it after all. It is unique to those who use weapons to fight such as swordsmen … something like a skill?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was thinking about something.</p>     <p class="calibre2">“More importantly, it is going to be evening soon so perhaps we should prepare for camp. I pierced the Lesser Boar through its ear so blood would flow out naturally but …”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s right. I recall a large tree beside a cave a little way back so we can set up camp in front of that. There should be enough space for a bonfire.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo set his thoughts aside for now and started thinking about what was more important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, right now the most important matter was having a meal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You have a keen eye. Then, shall we just disassemble and bring the parts where we will be eating there?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel took out a knife to disassemble the corpse there.</p><p class="calibre2">“Then I’ll gather dead branches and travel back to start the fire.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was a Water Attribute Magician who was good at starting a fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The roasted Lesser Boar thigh meat was delicious.</p><p class="calibre2">The combination with salt and black pepper was supreme.</p><p class="calibre2">But unfortunately, there was no rice.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though there was a certain amount of satisfaction, Ryo felt that something was missing.</p><p class="calibre2">On the other hand, Abel didn’t feel any of that and seemed quite happy.</p><p class="calibre2">That might have been the difference between those who stayed in one place until yesterday and those who have spent their time as adventurers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had only left his home for half a day and he was already feeling reluctant …</p><p class="calibre2">The importance of 『rice』 in the diet … could only be understood after it was lost.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(If this was the case, I should have brought rice even if it was a burden …)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was convinced even though he didn’t have an idea of how he could bring it.</p><p class="calibre2">Rice was important.</p><p class="calibre2">When he returns home, he’ll take good care of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, I’ll take a nap first. I don’t think I will sleep deeply but feel free to wake me up if anything happens.”</p><p class="calibre2">After saying that, Abel entered the cave beside the large tree.</p><p class="calibre2">The plan was for Ryo to wake Abel when the moon reached the middle of the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Now then, I have free time so I guess I can train my magic control.)</p><p class="calibre2">He had walked all day today and didn’t get to fight too so he had a lot of magical power remaining.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t know how much magical power he could recover by sleeping after this but he should recover the magical power consumed if it is limited to magic control training … Ryo somewhat thought to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the past, he used to train magic control by making huge five-story pagodas and Tokyo Sky Tree in his garden but recently he had taken a liking to making miniature Tokyo Towers.</p><p class="calibre2">As with most things, it was extremely difficult to make a large object small.</p><p class="calibre2">Even if the word 『miniature』 could be easily said, various techniques were required and it was necessary to pay close attention to everything from designing to manufacturing.</p><p class="calibre2">That 『close attention』 was 『control』 in magic so to speak.</p><p class="calibre2">Building a large Tokyo Sky Tree required a lot of magical power.</p><p class="calibre2">However, in terms of magic control, Ryo felt that producing a tiny Tokyo Tower could train it better …</p><p class="calibre2">Well, either way, both were training that he liked so he wasn’t particularly dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He slowly built a Tokyo Tower with a line of ice that was thinner than thread.</p><p class="calibre2">Right hand, left hand, right foot, and left foot, four towers all at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">It was no longer training with just one tower.</p><p class="calibre2">Training has to be tough.</p><p class="calibre2">Isn’t it important to create a training menu that is fun but also challenging?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While Ryo was building Tokyo Towers on his palms and in front of his toes, a few monsters caught Ryo and Abel’s scent and were approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel told him to ‘wake me up if monsters come’ but he still has to walk a long distance tomorrow so it would probably be better to let him sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo thought to himself and decided to settle it on his own.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, as long as it was not a particularly strong monster, he didn’t even have to move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He just had to pierce the monster from its right ear to its left ear with a Water Jet …</p><p class="calibre2">Earlier, Abel also pierced the Lesser Boar’s ear.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo knew from experience that it was easier to penetrate through the ears.</p><p class="calibre2">That meant that he could defeat the monsters without making any loud noises, that is, without disturbing Abel’s sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if he left the defeated monsters there, other monsters would quickly drag them away.</p><p class="calibre2">Although the blood from the monsters would gather other monsters … they would die before reaching anywhere near Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">The night forest was such a place.</p><p class="calibre2">As such, he kept only one Lesser Rabbit for the next morning’s meal and left the others to the providence of the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">If they were full, they probably won’t bother to attack Ryo and Abel either.</p>
