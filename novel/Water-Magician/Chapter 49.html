<h3>Chapter 49 &#8211; South Library</h3>

<p>Sunday, the next day.</p><p>As expected, it would not be a good idea to dive into the dungeon for two days in a row, so Amon started his training immediately.</p>
<p>In the early morning, he did practice swings before breakfast and after breakfast, he ran at the adventurer’s guild’s outdoor training ground throughout the morning.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t have much stamina yet so he ran slowly.</p><p>However, he did not stop and even if he had to walk sometimes, he kept moving for the time being.</p>
<p>It was also what Ryo used to do in the Rondo Forest a long time ago.</p>
<p>The motivated figure of the youngest member had a positive effect on the seniors.</p><p>Seeing Amon running, Niles and Etho also started running.</p><p>That said, the frail priest Etho immediately dropped out &#8230;</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ryo did not join them.</p><p>If they got a glimpse of Ryo’s bottomless stamina, they might even be discouraged!</p><p>However, he didn’t join them not because he was thinking about such things, but because he just had something else he wanted to do.</p>
<p>It was to find out about alchemy.</p>
<p>In the City of Rune, there were two large libraries, one in the south and one in the north.</p><p>The library in the south, which was close to the Adventurer’s Guild, had many books for beginners and the general public.</p><p>Ryo was told that, so he decided to go to the South Library first.</p>
<p>There was a large square in front of the library and also a fairly large bookstore next to it.</p><p>(There’s business to be made because loaning of books is prohibited by the library. So people would search for books in the library and buy them at the neighboring bookstore &#8230; a style of business that is unthinkable on Earth.)</p><p>The entrance fee to the library was 2,000 Florin.</p><p>If nothing went wrong, half of it, 1000 Florin, would be returned when he left.</p>
<p>The library was enormous.</p><p>Perhaps it was as big as the dome stadium that he was taken to when he was on Earth?</p><p>“This &#8230; I don’t think it’s possible to find it alone.”</p>
<p>He went back to the counter and asked for the location of introductory books related to alchemy.</p><p>“Please follow me.”</p><p>Then, a woman who seemed to be a librarian who was working near the counter guided him.</p><p>It seemed that it was far away from the counter.</p>
<p>They walked for more than five minutes and finally arrived.</p>
<p>“If you’re a complete beginner, I recommend reading this book and this one first. Also, as for beginner’s recipes &#8230; I think this is good.”</p><p>Then, the female librarian picked out three books for Ryo.</p>
<p>『Introduction to Alchemy』</p><p>『First Alchemy』</p><p>『Alchemy First Recipe Collection』</p><p>The authors were all Neil Andersen.</p>
<p>Ryo thanked her and moved to an empty seat with the three books.</p><p>The number of users was actually quite small.</p><p>The 1000 Florin fee was not cheap for the common people.</p>
<p>&#8211; All alchemy is performed through the use of magic circles or magic formulas.</p><p>-There are no restrictions on the materials used to draw the magic circle.</p><p>-The magic circle is activated for the first time by channeling the magic power through the magic circle that has been drawn.</p><p>&#8211; A magic circle can operate without receiving magical power supply from humans if the magic stone and the magic circle are connected and are very compatible.</p>
<p>And many other information.</p><p>Incidentally, it seemed that 『magic formula』 could only be used by advanced alchemists and above so it was not necessary at this stage. <em>(TLN: ‘</em><em>魔法式</em><em>’ can either mean magic formula or magic ritual/ceremony)</em></p>
<p>『Introduction to Alchemy』and 『First Alchemy』 were for beginners, so they explained from a logical point of view why alchemy was possible, what it was good at and what it was not good at.</p>
<p>『Alchemy First Recipe Collection』 had both a collection of recipes and also simple magic circles that could be used for alchemy.</p><p>Towards the end of the recipe collection, he also found recipes and magic circles for a few potions.</p><p>However, there was also a cautionary note.</p><p>『Because there is a high risk of running out of magical power, do not attempt unless you are a skilled Magician.』</p><p>(Ah, so that’s why so few people make their own potions &#8230;)</p>
<p>Ryo didn’t know how much magical power a skilled Magician would have, but if a lot of magical power was needed to make a potion, adventurers would naturally find it better to buy them instead.</p><p>(Well, as alchemy practice, it would be better to make something I need, such as potions necessary in dungeons, rather than to make something I don’t need.)</p>
<p>HeI was also happy to see the recipe for an antidote.</p><p>It seemed that there were several ways to make potions, but there were also recipes that could be made with ingredients that were easily gathered in the dungeon.</p><p>(Although it may be hard to gather the ingredients on the surface, these materials could be gathered in the dungeon by exploring up to the 5<sup>th</sup> floor. This might be a lucky chance.)</p> <!-- CJT Shortcode Block (35) - Mid - START --> <span id='csmi-2e176a73259cfff6be4ae98b9c7c6f72' class='csmi csmi-bid-35 csmi-Mid'><!-- Insticator API Fire Widget Ads Code --><div id="div-insticator-ad-3"></div> <script data-cfasync='false' type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/Insticator.ad.loadAd("div-insticator-ad-3");/*]]&gt;*/

<p>In the end, Ryo left the library two hours later.</p><p>He went straight to the neighboring bookstore and found the 『Alchemy First Recipe Collection』 for sale.</p>
<p>But &#8230; the price was 100,000 Florin &#8230; 10 gold coins &#8230;</p>
<p>(So expensive &#8230; No, I guess that’s normal for a book &#8230; But anyway, the money I have isn’t enough.)</p><p>It was a problem, and when he was thinking about what to do, he suddenly thought of it.</p><p>(The guildmaster said that one would be bought by the feudal lord, so the gold for that would be deposited quickly &#8230; I wonder if it’s already in.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, Ryo walked towards the Adventurer’s Guild. It was just one block north.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ryo was a little surprised to find the amount of money in his account.</p><p>It was purely from the sale of the Wyvern magic stone.</p><p>He probably didn’t have to work for money for quite some time.</p>
<p>There was no need to work hard for money &#8230; what a wonderful thing to hear!</p><p>It was fine to live however and do whatever he wanted &#8230; all hail Wyverns!</p>
<p>For the time being, Ryo took out about 15 gold coins and headed for the bookstore.</p><p>However, he noticed something when he left the guild.</p><p>(Eh? Isn’t it a little dark?)</p>
<p>The sun was out.</p><p>It was out, but &#8230; he felt that it was getting darker little by little.</p><p>(A solar eclipse &#8230;?)</p><p>The people of the City of Rune on the street also looked up at the sky with a hint of anxiety.</p>
<p>By the time Ryo arrived at the library square, the sun was completely hidden by the moon.</p>
<p>And the scenery of the world changed.</p>
