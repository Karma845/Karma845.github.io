<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Various Goals</h3>

<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> day since coming to 『Phi』.</p><p>Last night, he enjoyed the thigh meat of Lesser Boar.</p><p>The other parts he froze in ice and placed in the storage.</p>
<p>After one night, he calmly looked back on yesterday’s battle and broke into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The Lesser Boar was as its ‘lesser’ name implied, the weakest of boar-type monsters.</p><p>Of course, it was more troublesome compared to Slime or Lesser Rabbit but due to its brutal charge, it would be impossible for ordinary farmers or hunters to defeat it alone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was listed as the weakest rank in the 『Monster Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』.</p><p>“But I’m glad my first enemy was the Lesser Boar. There was a chance of encountering even stronger foes so I was lucky.”</p><p>Ryo was an optimistic person.</p>
<p>Although he could not launch the Icicle Lance, he could use it as a line of spears.</p><p>But even if he could use it, it used himself as the decoy to attract the enemy.</p><p>Because of that, he would take immeasurable damage if it failed.</p>
<p>What if the monster’s speed exceeded Ryo’s expectations?</p><p>What if there was a foe that wouldn’t slip on ice?</p><p>Also, it would be useless if he was attacked from the sky …</p>
<p>As expected, since he could finally use magic, he wanted to secure a method to safely hunt from afar.</p><p>Hunting on the edge every time would be too mentally draining.</p>
<p>The Water Ball could be launched but not the Icicle Lance.</p><p>After trying all kinds of theories, he concluded that water could be launched but ice could not.</p>
<p>They were both formed using water attribute magic.</p>
<p>Water Ball was (probably) made by gathering the moisture in the air and then launching it.</p><p>Icicle Lance was (probably) made by gathering the moisture in the air, freezing it, and then launching it.</p>
<p>“Hn? Icicle Lance has an extra step? Don’t tell me that, at my current ability, I can only use two-step processes …?”</p><p>He decided to prepare water first then try the ‘freeze and launching’ steps separately.</p>
<p>It would be bad if something happened to the pail so he made an ice bowl and stored water in it.</p><p>Placing his right hand over the ice bowl, he imagined in his head.</p><p>The image of the water freezing and launching along with the ice bowl.</p><p>“&lt;Icicle Lance&gt;”</p>
<p>Woosh</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t a spear, the frozen water stuck to the ice bowl flew about 10 meters.</p><p>“Alright, success!”</p><p>Something that didn’t work for dozens of days was resolved in an instant.</p>
<p>“So that’s the reason. The answer came quickly once I realized the important information.”</p>
<p>In this case for Ryo, instead of obtaining the necessary information, he acquired flint, concluded a battle outside the barrier, and came to this realization after relieving his mental stress … but it was a fact that he solved the problem so it was probably fine.</p><p>“I understand the reason. For now, it seems that it is not possible to perform three steps at once. Perhaps I will be able to do so after I am more proficient in water magic. It would be great if I can.”</p>
<p>It seemed that he won’t be able to launch ice for some time … in that case, water will have to be his means of long-range attacks.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, I have not tested the Water Jet recently.”</p><p>The Water Jet that he practiced hard on the third day of coming to 『Phi』 but was only able to focus it into the strength of a car wash hose and concluded that it could not be used for attacking.</p>
<p>“With creating ice, I’ve come to understand how to handle water magic so I’m sure it will be better than last time …”</p><p>With his right hand raised forward, he made a mental image of a water jet.</p><p>“&lt;Water Jet&gt;”</p>
<p>Shuu</p>

<p>Compared to before, the stream of water was much thinner and more vigorous.</p><p>“There’s progress!”</p><p>Next, he tried firing at the tree at the edge of the barrier.</p>
<p>Shuu … crack</p> 
<p>It still could not cut the tree … but the spot it hit was slightly gouged out.</p><p>“This could work as long as I practice …”</p><p>Ryo once again started practicing Water Jet.</p>
<p>Four days from then, Ryo practiced Water Jet all day.</p><p>Of course, he made sure to eat a proper breakfast and enter the bath.</p><p>He ate roasted meat for breakfast. Right, roasted meat in the morning. Breakfast is important after all!</p><p>His lunch was mostly dried meat.</p><p>And he entered the bath at night.</p><p>As for dinner … he always thought of practicing Water Jet a little before preparing but end up depleting his magical power and going to bed directly … without having dinner.</p><p>Perhaps that was why he always wanted to have a proper meal for breakfast the next day.</p>
<p>The result of four days of practice on Water Jet … was that its power had certainly increased.</p><p>But although it increased, it could not compare at all to the water jets on Earth …</p>
<p>He was able to gouge deeper into the tree trunk and was able to focus the jet into a smaller stream.</p><p>But it was still far from the image of ‘cutting’.</p>
<p>However, he acquired the skill to hit the spot he aims for with pinpoint accuracy.</p><p>If it was a stationary target 10 meters ahead, he would hit it without an error of 1mm.</p><p>“There’s no telling when it will come in handy. Right, I have to train to be able to shoot multiple jets at once, not only one.”</p><p>Ryo said and continued his training once more.</p>
<p>A positive mental attitude will save him.</p>
<p>His goal was to hunt safely.</p><p>Obtaining food every day by putting your life on the line … was not a slow life!</p>
<p>Becoming able to hunt safely and leaving the barrier was part of life too … once he was able to do so, Ryo wanted to expand his diet.</p><p>Currently, he could only eat monster meat seasoned with salt and roasted or dried meat.</p><p>He wanted some other flavor … right, he wanted to have some fruits eventually.</p>
<p>In the 『Plant Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』, pepper was called 『Pepper』 too and could be found in 『Phi』.</p><p>After living here for about two weeks, Ryo felt that it was a location similar to that between the Tropic of Cancer and Equator on Earth.</p><p>From the direction of the vortex when water flows, it seemed that he was in the Northern hemisphere.</p><p>The height of the sun and the humidity meant that he was close to the Equator.</p>
<p>In that case, there should be spices!</p>
<p>Although there were hundreds of kinds of spices, Ryo only knew pepper, red pepper, Japanese pepper, and ginger.</p><p>He was never very knowledgeable about cooking in the first place so that couldn’t be helped.</p><p>Among them, he had personally seen the trees where pepper grows from.</p><p>They would grow in a bunch like grapes.</p><p>(I can probably identify that inside the forest!)</p>

<p>Well, he would only be able to get his hands on it after he can leave the barrier with more peace of mind.</p>
