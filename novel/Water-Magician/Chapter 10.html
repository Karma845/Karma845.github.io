<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Assasin Hawk II</h3>

   
<p class="calibre2">The day after he succeeded in firing the Icicle Lance, Ryo went hunting in the Eastern forest as usual.</p><p class="calibre2">He could now send the Icicle Lance flying.</p><p class="calibre2">To be honest, he could win even against a Greater Boar.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s what he thought.</p><p class="calibre2">He was filled with confidence.</p><p class="calibre2">He felt more motivated than ever before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was not a Greater Boar that attacked Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Invisible Wind Attribute magic attacks, Air Slash, were flying at him from the front and back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Even though one was already troublesome! &lt;Omnidirectional Ice Wall&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">An ice wall one meter wide and two meters tall covered Ryo’s front, back, left, and right to defend against the Air Slashes.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo held the front part of his knife-tipped bamboo spear that had broken off from the middle with his right hand.</p><p class="calibre2">The part from the middle to the end, the butt end so to speak, had already been dropped somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ice wall was transparent. As such, he could see the other side of the wall.</p><p class="calibre2">An Assassin Hawk was flying in front of his ice wall.</p><p class="calibre2">An Assassin Hawk with a closed right eye due to injury.</p><p class="calibre2">That was the Assassin Hawk that Ryo almost died to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, another Assassin Hawk was flying behind Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">Both hawks maintained their distance from Ryo and only attacked with Air Slashes.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, the nasty fact was that one of them always remained in and attacked from Ryo’s blind spot.</p><p class="calibre2">And most of the time the one-eyed Assassin Hawk would face him head-on while the newcomer Assassin Hawk would attack from his blind spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall in front cracked after receiving the third Air Slash.</p><p class="calibre2">At that moment, Ryo raised his left hand at the one-eyed hawk, and countless lines of water shot out.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Water Jet 32&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">But with some uncanny aerodynamic characteristics, as though it performed instantaneous lateral movement, it dodged by moving out of the effective range.</p><p class="calibre2">And then … the Ice Wall protecting Ryo’s back also broke after receiving the third Air Slash from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, Ryo had not had the chance to catch his breath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, he had been running around to avoid the Air Slashes from front and back while trying to retaliate.</p><p class="calibre2">However, putting aside avoiding his opponent’s attacks, Ryo’s attacks were all dodged like the example given above.</p><p class="calibre2">His bamboo spear was sacrificed to defend against an Air Slash that he couldn’t avoid and he withdrew like a turtle into his Ice Wall shell to regain his breath but the Ice Wall broke with three Air Slashes.</p><p class="calibre2">Every time his Ice Wall broke, he would counterattack only once before regenerating the Ice Wall.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“I want to flee but … I’m sandwiched front and back and have no path to escape.”</p><p class="calibre2">The newcomer was perfectly behind Ryo, that is, it was going around Ryo’s blind spot and attacking while denying his retreat path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo honestly did not know how much magical power he had left.</p><p class="calibre2">At the current pace, he could probably persevere by repeatedly casting Ice Wall and Water Jet but … he was getting tired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">『Tiredness will lead to mistakes.』</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a battle against the inevitable fatigue.</p><p class="calibre2">And he would die if he made a mistake.</p><p class="calibre2">That in turn caused even more fatigue to accumulate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What should I do?”</p><p class="calibre2">He regenerated the Ice Wall and organized the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, Ryo had only shown his Ice wall and Water Jet.</p><p class="calibre2">And he knew that it could avoid a simultaneous salvo of 32 Water Jets.</p><p class="calibre2">The victory condition this time was not to defeat the enemy but to escape into the barrier.</p><p class="calibre2">To achieve that, it may be better to deal damage to it such that it would withdraw like the last time, even if the damage wasn’t fatal.</p><p class="calibre2">“Should I lure it?”</p><p class="calibre2">The moment Ryo muttered that, the front and back Ice Walls broke at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo fired &lt;Water Jet 16&gt; at the one-eyed hawk without delay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And then he ran.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the one-eyed Assassin Hawk dodged the Water Jets.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, Ryo thrust out this left arm while running and attempted to release magic.</p><p class="calibre2">But at that instant, he stumbled.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The newcomer Assassin Hawk dove toward Ryo as he stumbled.</p><p class="calibre2">It must have been impatient because of the Ice Walls and Air Slashes.</p><p class="calibre2">It charged in as if it was shouting ‘I got you!’.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that was Ryo’s aim all along.</p><p class="calibre2">After stumbling, he rolled to the left and dodged the assault of the newcomer from behind.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, Ryo thrust his half-length knife-tipped bamboo spear at the newcomer that was directly next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, he was about to thrust but he stopped his spear and rolled further left.</p><p class="calibre2">By a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one-eyed Assassin Hawk struck the spot where Ryo was.</p><p class="calibre2">As though it saw through Ryo’s trap.</p><p class="calibre2">Furthermore, it didn’t stop after its assault and immediately flew backward.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed that it had learned from its previous experience.</p><p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the newcomer Assassin Hawk also returned to the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gyieiiiiegyigyue~”</p><p class="calibre2">The one-eye seemed to be lecturing the newcomer.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was telling it not to let its guard down.</p><p class="calibre2">And once again, the one-eye faced Ryo directly and the newcomer positioned itself in Ryo’s blind spot behind him.</p><p class="calibre2">They were both 20 meters away from Ryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo slowly stood up without breaking line of sight with the one-eyed Assassin Hawk.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Omnidirectional Ice Wall with additional ceiling&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing it, it felt like the newcomer Assassin Hawk was sneering.</p><p class="calibre2">It was dangerous a while ago but it was disappointed that he reverted to this method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Newcomer-kun, you are already dead. I want to say that aloud but the one-eyed guy has a good intuition so I’ll refrain. … You will move to that spot without fail by centering on me.)</p><p class="calibre2">The instant Ryo had that thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Icicle Lances rained over the newcomer’s head.</p><p class="calibre2">There were 256 lances.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a rain of shining ice that fell with a radius of 30 meters centered on the newcomer Assassin Hawk.</p><p class="calibre2">“Gyiiiiaaaaaa”</p><p class="calibre2">The newcomer tried to move and dodge but the range was too wide.</p><p class="calibre2">Multiple lances injured its wings and it was knocked to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">All of the Icicle Lances were formed in midair and fell by free fall.</p><p class="calibre2">Even if he could fire Icicle Lances now, he could only consciously control one at a time.</p><p class="calibre2">That one lance had already been formed outside the Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire.”</p><p class="calibre2">Without straying, it pierced the head of the newcomer Assassin Hawk that had been knocked down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Guaaaaa”</p><p class="calibre2">The one-eyed Assassin Hawk screamed out.</p><p class="calibre2">Its eyes glaring at Ryo showed the same hatred, no, even more hatred than the previous time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their eyes met for just a few moments.</p><p class="calibre2">The one-eyed Assassin Hawk turned around and left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Phew … I somehow survived. But this Icicle Lance from the air, free-falling spears of light looked quite cool. All right, this shall be one of my decisive techniques.”</p><p class="calibre2">Although it was a tough battle that he was prepared for death, he was completely fine when it was over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo managed to survive the battle with the fated Assassin Hawk but the challenges were apparent. It was the need to strengthen his physical aspect, or rather, his physical body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the early stages of the battle, he ran around and caused his breathing to become rapid and it took a considerable amount of time to regulate his breathing.</p><p class="calibre2">This time the one-eye focused on maintaining a distance as it attacked so he was able to buy time with Ice Wall but that would not always be the case.</p><p class="calibre2">“Stamina is important.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo said with a clear voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day onward, the flow of a day in Ryo’s life changed a little.</p><p class="calibre2">First, after waking up would be some calisthenics. He would do it for 30 minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">Flexible muscles would prevent injuries.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo had, by no means, a flexible body but he knew that flexibility would be achieved by anyone if they did it every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, lunch.</p><p class="calibre2">Lunch was essential. The foundation of a day. He ate a proper meal.</p>     <p class="calibre2">After eating, he would read or practice magic until his digestion was complete.</p><p class="calibre2">After about 30 minutes, he would run around the outer edge of the barrier. Walk. Earnestly … walk.</p><p class="calibre2">While using magic to create ice and water in his hands, he would run … and when he got tired, walk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the afternoon, once every two days, he would leave the barrier and hunt in the Eastern or Northern Forest.</p><p class="calibre2">Since then, he had not encountered the one-eyed Assassin Hawk.</p><p class="calibre2">But Ryo knew that the battle would eventually have to be settled.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not a theory.</p><p class="calibre2">That was just how it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hunting and procuring food, he would return and practice magic.</p><p class="calibre2">On the days he does not go out to hunt, he practiced magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And before entering the bath, he would perform 1000 swings.</p><p class="calibre2">Not with a baseball bat.</p><p class="calibre2">He would use a bamboo sword cut out of bamboo, adjust the weight with ice, and swing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo attended the Kendo dojo from the first grade of elementary school to the winter of the third grade of junior high school.</p><p class="calibre2">He joined with an attitude to play.</p><p class="calibre2">He had never participated in any competitions either.</p><p class="calibre2">During junior high school, while his friends were participating in school club activities, Ryo would be part of the go-home club and visit the Kendo dojo in the district martial arts center on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p><p class="calibre2">The martial arts center coach was a junior high school student.</p><p class="calibre2">When Ryo became a high school student, he was advised to practice at the prefectural police headquarters but he refused.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t hate Kendo but he did not want to do it that seriously either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His reflexes were decent. He liked baseball, soccer, and basketball. Whether it was watching or playing.</p><p class="calibre2">But he couldn’t get into anything.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was never completely absorbed in doing anything for his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t as though he hated working hard. He knew its value.</p><p class="calibre2">So he tried doing whatever came to mind.</p><p class="calibre2">He wrestled with hard work.</p><p class="calibre2">And then he was able to do it.</p><p class="calibre2">After that, even though he didn’t exactly lose interest, he never tried to push to the limits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was by no means a genius.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, he could get most things done to a satisfactory degree if he put in some serious effort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after coming to this world, that changed a little.</p><p class="calibre2">The experience that transformed Ryo was 『Magic』.</p><p class="calibre2">He may not have a teacher but that might have been for the better.</p><p class="calibre2">It might have been better that he didn’t have anything such as a spellbook.</p><p class="calibre2">For the first time in his life, Ryo was absorbed in using magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t get good at it easily.</p><p class="calibre2">There was a mountain of things he didn’t understand.</p><p class="calibre2">But that was fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there were many other things needed to make the most out of that magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He almost died because he didn’t have stamina.</p><p class="calibre2">His bamboo spear breaking in half made him realize his lack of skill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stamina could be acquired by running. Anybody could acquire it just by running.</p><p class="calibre2">The methodology had already been established on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was something to be aware of.</p><p class="calibre2">That would be stress fracture.</p><p class="calibre2">The bones below the knee could break … calcium intake was required but … he didn’t have milk which boasts the best absorption rate.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, small fish with the bones included … would have to eventually be the main means of acquiring it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was there any other way to prevent stress fractures other than food?</p><p class="calibre2">Of course.</p><p class="calibre2">That was calisthenics … stretching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flexibility is versatility!</p>
<p class="calibre2">So today, he ran as well … he walked when he was tired. But he didn’t stop. He kept walking.</p><p class="calibre2">He kept moving to strengthen his cardiopulmonary function.</p><p class="calibre2">Stretch, run and walk.</p><p class="calibre2">Just by continuously doing that, anybody could gain stamina.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The issue apart from stamina … was his skill with the bamboo spear.</p><p class="calibre2">But he’ll give up on that.</p><p class="calibre2">In the first place, he decided on the knife-tipped bamboo spear because he wanted to deal the final hit from a longer distance.</p><p class="calibre2">He had never even seen a video about how to handle a spear.</p><p class="calibre2">Then what should he do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, he had done Kendo before.</p><p class="calibre2">He had not held a bamboo sword in the last five years … but he did in the past for nine years.</p><p class="calibre2">His body still remembered it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Swordsmanship and Kendo were different things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was probably true.</p><p class="calibre2">However, Kendo did not begin from nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">Its origin was obviously from Swordsmanship.</p><p class="calibre2">In that case, the thing Ryo had to do was not difficult.</p><p class="calibre2">All he had to do was reverse the flow that changed Swordsmanship to Kendo.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not an easy matter but it was possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it didn’t matter even if he couldn’t.</p><p class="calibre2">Fundamentally it was a sword meant to be used as a means for magic.</p>

<p class="calibre2">His main forte was Water-Attribute Magic and Ryo was a Water-Attribute Mage after all.</p>
