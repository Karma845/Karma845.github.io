<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Wood Processing</h3>


<p class="calibre2">“Now that I’ve gotten my hands on rice, I kind of want to have miso soup but … that is probably impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo previously speculated that the house was located between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer judging from the surrounding conditions.</p><p class="calibre2">In fact, he harvested pepper and wild rice to back that speculation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, there was something essential in making miso soup.</p><p class="calibre2">And that would, of course, be ‘miso’.</p><p class="calibre2">Soybeans were needed to make that miso.</p><p class="calibre2">But the origin of soybeans was from East Asia such as Japan.</p><p class="calibre2">The Rondo Forest was too hot.</p><p class="calibre2">And the humidity was high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soybeans grow easily in well-drained land … therefore when soybeans are sown in a field, high ridges are created to allow good drainage.</p><p class="calibre2">With those conditions, it probably doesn’t grow in the wild.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, I can’t help it. It’s already good fortune that I obtained rice.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The barrier with a 100-meter radius around the house was large enough for regular life.</p><p class="calibre2">However, if he planned to create a field … it was too narrow.</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems like I will have to make it outside the barrier. Moreover, if I do so, I will have to cut down the trees and clear a space …?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultivating new land quickly with magic and sword …</p><p class="calibre2">“A pity that Water Jet can’t cut trees yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">On Earth, people would usually cut trees with a chainsaw.</p><p class="calibre2">At sawmills, a giant rotating saw would be used to cut the wood.</p><p class="calibre2">“Perhaps instead of a water jet, I could make a rotating saw made of water and use it as a long-ranged attack.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">He imagined it in his head. The image of a circular saw with a 10 cm radius forming on his right palm and starting to rotate.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Saw&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Just like he imagined, a rotating saw made of water was formed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, fly forth!”</p><p class="calibre2">Basha</p><p class="calibre2">The moment it left his hand, it splashed to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah …”</p><p class="calibre2">He collapsed to his knees and hung his head.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo remained frozen in that posture for about ten seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He spoke while maintaining that posture.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s think through the process.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Generate water.</p><p class="calibre2">Rotate the water that formed.</p><p class="calibre2">Make it fly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, a three-step procedure. I guess I still can’t perform a three-step procedure.”</p><p class="calibre2">He verified while hanging his head down. But then, Ryo abruptly stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not yet. It is not yet the end.”</p><p class="calibre2">Spitting out the phrase of some scarlet comet, Ryo approached a tree outside the barrier.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, he cast once more.</p><p class="calibre2">“Water Saw.”</p><p class="calibre2">However, this time, instead of letting it fly, he maintained it in his palm and struck it against the trunk of the tree.</p><p class="calibre2">Gyuiiiiin</p><p class="calibre2">It successfully cut through the trunk at the same speed as a chainsaw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This looks useful when processing wood.”</p><p class="calibre2">That said, at present, even if he cut something, he had no adhesive or nails …</p><p class="calibre2">“Whereas wood joinery without relying on adhesive or nails … yup, that would be impossible.”</p><p class="calibre2">The task would likely be too difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rotary motion …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo suddenly froze.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Isn’t something strange?”</p><p class="calibre2">The &lt;Ice Roller&gt; that he used when tanning the leather of the Lesser Boar came to Ryo’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“The process of the Ice Roller was …”</p>     <p class="calibre2">Gathering the water molecules in the air.</p><p class="calibre2">Freezing the gathered water molecules.</p><p class="calibre2">Rotating the frozen roller.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A three-step process … seems like it … but it worked …?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a major issue in his understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">He formed an icicle lance in his right hand.</p><p class="calibre2">“Rotate on the spot.”</p><p class="calibre2">It rotated like a flying bullet.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shuu .. bot</p>

<p class="calibre2">As usual, it fell to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">However, today Ryo was not depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He generated an elongated ice bowl in his left hand. He filled it with water.</p><p class="calibre2">And targeting it as it was filled with water.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The icicle lance was created while still attached to the ice bowl.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire.”</p><p class="calibre2">The ice bowl flew forward at considerable speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was &ndash; breathe. He adjusted his breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, I can fire it. I am different from the past.”</p><p class="calibre2">That was close to self-suggestion … but it was very important.</p><p class="calibre2">Because that had crushed a hardened misconception within Ryo’s imagination.</p><p class="calibre2">He imagined in his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Generation of the icicle lance.</p><p class="calibre2">And the image of sending that spear flying from his right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He repeated over and over until he could almost see an illusion in front of his eyes. He imagined it clearly.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">An icicle lance was formed in front of his right hand.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire.”</p><p class="calibre2">It flew forward with great speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This … I don’t know when it started but at the very least, before I tanned the leather, I had the means to fire it forward.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The image was crucial in magic.</p><p class="calibre2">For good and for bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thought that ‘I can’t fire the icicle lance’ was stuck inside Ryo’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, he probably couldn’t have fired it the first few days after reincarnating.</p><p class="calibre2">However, as a result of the training that followed, he learned the technique to fire it.</p><p class="calibre2">But, it seemed that the thought that he ‘could not fire’ impeded him.</p><p class="calibre2">Could that be called a mental block?</p><p class="calibre2">“What did I work so hard for … That said, I can be sure that I acquired a lot of power. This is a win!”</p>

<p class="calibre2">The next day, Ryo was in a desperate situation.</p>
