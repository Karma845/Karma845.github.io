<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Plow?</h3>


<p class="calibre2">Ryo somehow managed to reach home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He froze the Kite Snake corpse and kept it in the storage.</p><p class="calibre2">He didn’t think of eating the snake.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when his university friend from Southeast Asia told him ‘It looks pale but it is quite delicious~’, he didn’t feel like eating it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was a possibility that he could use it as some kind of material … like those snakeskin wallets or bags on Earth …</p><p class="calibre2">“A bag huh … well, there’s no issue with the hemp bag … and more importantly, I don’t have thread or string. I could use ivy as a replacement for string but I would need it for clothes as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Regarding ‘Clothes’, it was still extremely difficult to achieve this in his slow life in Rondo Forest.</p><p class="calibre2">As for ‘Food’, apart from the Ichizuku, he also obtained the ‘Rindo’ that is similar to apples during this excursion.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a long sought-after new fruit.</p><p class="calibre2">Enriching his food choices was important in achieving his slow life!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That said, my encounter with the Kite Snake … was a close shave.”</p><p class="calibre2">That was the first time Ryo encountered a monster that used poison.</p><p class="calibre2">Although it was described in the ‘Monster Encyclopedia &ndash; Beginner Edition’ to ‘Spit poison’, the area of the poison, so large that it could be called a poison mist, was completely outside his expectations.</p><p class="calibre2">“The ‘Squall’ that I made for watering ended up playing an important role in the fight … I seriously don’t know what would end up being useful in which situation.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">The Water Attribute Magic ‘Squall’ that brought down the Kite Snake poison spread across the air and washed it away was originally imagined as water coming out of a watering can.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, the water pressure was a little stronger, the volume was greater, and the area was wider.</p><p class="calibre2">That Squall was meant for the Ichizuku from his previous harvest that he transplanted.</p><p class="calibre2">Although he could find it if he entered the forest, it would be nice if he could pluck them from his garden when he has cravings for it at night … he planted them for such simplistic reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it was natural cultivation without any pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or organic fertilizers!</p><p class="calibre2">Since it was tastier that way.</p><p class="calibre2">It definitely was not because he didn’t have any of that! Definitely not!</p><p class="calibre2">If he was pursuing mass production then a large amount of fertilizer might be a better method.</p><p class="calibre2">But for a slow life … that was not necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there was a field of ‘Food’ that was not progressing well even if he took it slowly.</p><p class="calibre2">It was his field.</p><p class="calibre2">He had stored a fairly large amount of ‘paddy’ rice that was for planting or eating.</p><p class="calibre2">They were all obtained from the wetlands in the Northern forest.</p><p class="calibre2">However, what Ryo wanted was to improve it with a field.</p><p class="calibre2">And for that, he needed to make a paddy field.</p><p class="calibre2">He needed it but … if he could use Earth Attribute Magic, he might have a spell like ‘Plow’.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Even without that, he could make a hoe and plow manually.</p><p class="calibre2">But Ryo only had Water attribute Magic.</p><p class="calibre2">“Land reclamation without Earth Attribute Magic, without farming tools like a hoe or plowing horses …”</p><p class="calibre2">He could not imagine himself succeeding with those restrictions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, he tried launching Icicle Lances at the planned paddy field site.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance 2&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">It was barely noticeable.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s drop it from the sky. &lt;Icicle Lance 128&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">128 Icicle Lances formed in the sky 20 meters up and freefell to the planned paddy field site.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Zusa zusa zusa</p><p class="calibre2">They pierced the ground.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Yeah … pierce … that’s all. I wonder if there is a way to make them rupture after piercing…”</p><p class="calibre2">He was about to imagine one of the lances exploding …</p><p class="calibre2">“Before that, I should set up a shield.”</p><p class="calibre2">He was standing in his garden within the barrier so he didn’t even have his Ice Armor on.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall 5 layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">It was the sturdiest shield he had and he separated himself from the (planned) explosive.</p><p class="calibre2">The Ice Wall was originally transparent as well so it didn’t impede his work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once again … he made a mental image of one of the Icicle Lances exploding.</p><p class="calibre2">Bakin.</p><p class="calibre2">Exploded … or rather, the ice shattered and scattered around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That wouldn’t help with the plowing …”</p><p class="calibre2">He targeted two Icicle Lances and imagined them exploding into even finer ice crystals.</p><p class="calibre2">Toshin.</p><p class="calibre2">The ice shattered and scattered around once again but … compared to before, the scattered ice was smaller.</p><p class="calibre2">“I knew it wouldn’t help with plowing …”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He guessed that having the ice shatter was insufficient.</p><p class="calibre2">Instead of shattering, he wanted them to ‘explode’.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If it is an explosion with water, I recall the experiments that caused water to explode by adding sodium metal. But that was not realistic here. In that case, steam explosion …?”</p><p class="calibre2">A steam explosion was a phenomenon that happens when a high-temperature substance such as magma comes into contact with a low-temperature substance such as groundwater, causing the water to instantaneously become water vapor and explode.</p><p class="calibre2">The ‘explosion’ phenomenon occurs because when water turns into water vapor, its volume expands by 1700 times.</p><p class="calibre2">“But I don’t have any high-temperature substances. No, if I instantaneously convert the Icicle Lance into water vapor, it should cause the same phenomenon as a steam explosion.”</p><p class="calibre2">It could be done with the same image of increasing the vibrations of the water molecules as when he first made boiling water.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Increasing the vibrations would cause the temperature of the substance to increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once it goes beyond 100 degrees, it would turn into steam …</p><p class="calibre2">If more heat was added to the steam, steam that goes beyond 100 degrees would reach a state called superheated steam.</p><p class="calibre2">On Earth, there were microwave ovens on sale that function using superheated steam.</p><p class="calibre2">In that sense, it was a very common phenomenon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He tried it with all the remaining 126 Icicle Lances but he couldn’t make them explode.</p><p class="calibre2">At a glance, it felt like he could easily cause a steam explosion but unfortunately, his fundamental knowledge was flawed so a steam explosion would never occur.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo’s chemical knowledge was insufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the first place, an ‘explosion’ was a phenomenon that occurs as a result of a sudden generation or release of pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s ice … yeah.</p>
