<h3>Chapter 32 &#8211; Golem Nest</h3>   

 <p class="calibre2">The two walked along the wall.</p><p class="calibre2">After walking for about two hours, the wall gradually became lower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The wall is getting lower little by little but it still seems impossible to climb.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s difficult. Perhaps it will work out if we don’t rush and keep going like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">The height of the wall was getting as low as 30 meters, but it still seemed difficult to climb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(It feels as if the wall was gouged out by a huge laser. Maybe a Light-Attribute Magician can use that kind of magic.)</p><p class="calibre2">No one answered the question that was raised in his head.</p><p class="calibre2">But even if he did voice it out, no one would be able to answer it either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After walking for about another hour, the wall suddenly ended.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is the wall finally over?”</p><p class="calibre2">“So the other side of the wall was not a forest, but grasslands.”</p><p class="calibre2">As Ryo commented, the grasslands spread out as far as the eye could see, apart from some rock masses that were about a meter high.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a significant change, given that they had been walking through a dense forest until they hit the wall.</p><p class="calibre2">“The outlook is good, but … well, it doesn’t matter either way. We have no choice but to head north anyway.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then, let’s go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was around the time after they set foot in the grasslands and walked for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kakin</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel, the vanguard, pulled out his sword, swung it, and slashed something that had flown over.</p><p class="calibre2">“…… Stone?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel murmured.</p><p class="calibre2">With that as the trigger, thumb-sized stones flew toward Abel from the front.</p><p class="calibre2">He avoided them or knocked them down with a sword and squinted forward.</p><p class="calibre2">He saw it firing a rock from about two meters away.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">A wall of ice created by Ryo formed in front of Abel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel, who no longer had to worry about the stones due to the Ice Wall, looked even more intently.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ryo, this is bad. We seemed to have entered a Rock Golem nest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Golems have nests?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo, the rearguard, ran up to Abel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Adventurers call the place where golems appear in large numbers, 『Nest』. Apparently, that is the case here. It’s my first time experiencing it too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Even with knowledge of it, there were times when it didn’t help.</p><p class="calibre2">“That rock-like thing is a Rock Golem?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that’s it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I thought that golems would have hands and feet more like humans …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo’s knowledge came from Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though there was no historical fact that there were golems on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A 『golem』 is a moving mud doll that originally appeared in Jewish folklore.</p><p class="calibre2">Well, housing a soul in the soil and moving it or making it from a person, they remained in myths and folklore all over the world, so perhaps there used to be golems on Earth …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, those that are moved via alchemy have that shape. I’ve heard that there is a country in the west that has a golem squad. But, naturally occurring golems have various shapes … I guess the golems here formed from those rocks.”</p><p class="calibre2">As soon as Abel said that, he turned around and slashed with his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kakin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Golems were firing stones behind too.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Ice Wall&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo created an Ice Wall behind as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now that I think about it, there were such rocks in the place where we passed by. Did they wake up?”</p><p class="calibre2">“A pincer attack after leading us in? Lumps of soil shouldn’t use their heads that much.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it possible to defeat golems with a sword?”</p><p class="calibre2">Incidentally, Ryo had no knowledge at all on them because the golem-type monsters were not listed in 『Monster’s Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』.</p><p class="calibre2">“I won’t know until I try it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I guess.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, this may be a good experience. I’m attacking the one nearby. Ryo can stay here.”</p><p class="calibre2">After saying that, Abel went out from between the front and back Ice Walls and ran towards the Rock Golem which was approaching from the front to the right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, the Rock Golem had the appearance of a 『rock』, but it was getting closer and closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Since it is a rock, it probably can’t be cut with a normal Water Jet. Abrasive Jet likely can cut it … but it doesn’t feel like it will cut in an instant … I’ll try it later.)</p><p class="calibre2">While Ryo was thinking about that, Abel slashed into one of the Rock Golems.</p><p class="calibre2">“Combat Art: Perfect Pierce”</p><p class="calibre2">As he approached, he activated the combat art and thrust with his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zaku</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel’s partner, his magic sword, coupled with the effects of the combat art, pierced the Rock Golem’s body.</p><p class="calibre2">He pierced it and mowed it down sideways.</p><p class="calibre2">Ordinary creatures would die from that but … the golem was already repairing the location where it was cut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Damn”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel kicked the golem that was restoring itself with his foot before heading back to the Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">He did so to earn some time before it could fire the stones.</p><p class="calibre2">Getting shot from behind while running would be difficult to dodge.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps the golem couldn’t shoot stones while it was toppled over as Abel was able to safely return to the Ice Wall.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“It doesn’t work, they can repair themselves.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, I saw it. The golems current moving, including the one Abel attacked, are seven in front and five behind.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Twelve in total huh … the prospect of escaping is a bit slim.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, it’s impossible to escape. Hmm~ there is an attack I want to try … can I try it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo said and looked up at the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">“Either way, I am out of means. I’ll leave it to you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then. &lt;Ice Wall 10 layers&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">Upon Ryo’s chant, Ice Walls formed 『parallel to the ground』 40 meters above the golems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And then, they fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanied by a roaring sound, the soil and grass were blown up many meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo and Abel weren’t hurt because they had a defensive ice wall, but the place where the Ice Wall 10 layers fell was terrible.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, the Rock Golems that the walls of ice fell on … there were no fragments of them left.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed to have crushed two golems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Weapons that rely on mass are scary.”</p>     <p class="calibre2">Yes, what Ryo did was nothing special.</p><p class="calibre2">He just created Ice Walls in the sky and dropped them.</p><p class="calibre2">He used 10 layers because he imagined that 10 layers would be heavier…</p><p class="calibre2">The Icicle Lances from the sky and this new attempt, it seemed that Ryo may have a liking toward dropping things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was content with the result but Abel remained stunned and couldn’t move.</p><p class="calibre2">It took about 5 seconds for him to move once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ry-Ryo … What was that just now?”</p><p class="calibre2">“See, this Ice Wall in front of us, I just created it in the sky and dropped it. It’s extremely simple but it worked.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo smiled broadly to reassure Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though the weapon utilizing mass produced an effect that was stronger than expected … Ryo thought that it would be cooler to show that everything was as expected.</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems that I killed two of them but I guess I can kill the others in the same way too.”</p><p class="calibre2">After saying that, Ryo generated Ice Wall 10 layers in the sky one after another, dropped them, and pressed them against the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo noticed.</p><p class="calibre2">Only the Rock Golem that Abel kicked down had stopped moving since then.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, I’ve defeated 11 for the time being.”</p><p class="calibre2">“11? Hn? But there were 12?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, the one that Abel kicked down first had stopped moving.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo said and pointed to the golem that Abel kicked down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah … it certainly isn’t moving.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After dispelling the defensive Ice Wall, the two of them approached the toppled golem.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel touched the golem with the tip of his sword but there was no reaction at all.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why did it stop moving…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Maybe it stopped working due to Abel’s terrific kicking technique. Abel should stop being a swordsman and become a grappler!”</p><p class="calibre2">“What is a grappler? In any case, it wasn’t such a great kick.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel’s kick was more of a knock-down kick rather than a damaging kick.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a push with the sole of his foot … almost like a professional wrestling kick.</p><p class="calibre2">Against a human opponent, just kicking the solar plexus would deal damage, but such a kick would not deal any damage to a golem made of stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perhaps …”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo crouched down and carefully examined the lower part of the Rock Golem, which was originally in contact with the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">He was hypothesizing if the golem was supplied with some sort of energy from the ground and could only receive it with the lower part of the golem.</p><p class="calibre2">The source of that suspicion was the non-contact smartphone charging technology.</p><p class="calibre2">He remembered wondering on Earth if he installed that technology on the floor or the walls of his house, he wouldn’t need a power outlet for home appliances … when he saw the golem that turned over and stopped moving, his mind went to that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the golem … there was certainly something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, look at this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo showed Abel the spot.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is that … a magic stone?”</p><p class="calibre2">A small glimpse of a yellow magic stone was visible from the part where the golem was originally in contact with the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">“Should we dig it out of the golem?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah. But a Rock Golem is tough. My combat art Perfect Pierce could do it but …”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s okay, it will take some time but there is a spell that is just right for this in Water-Attribute Magic. &lt;Abrasive Jet&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">A spell that he thought wouldn’t be useful for defeating Rock Golems, but would be just right for dismantling, even if it took some time.</p><p class="calibre2">Since he didn’t know how big the buried magic stone was, he carefully scraped off the surrounding rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After about 10 minutes, he succeeded in retrieving the magic stone.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a palm-sized yellow magic stone.</p><p class="calibre2">“This is … pretty big.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was a shocking magic stone even for Abel, who had defeated countless monsters and gathered countless magic stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The value of a magic stone was determined by its size, color, and shade.</p><p class="calibre2">The larger the size, the greater the value.&nbsp;Generally, stronger monsters have larger magic stones.</p><p class="calibre2">The colors had their corresponding magical attribute.&nbsp;Red for fire, blue for water.</p><p class="calibre2">And the shade depends, in general, on how long the monster lived since it was born, the duration, and its experience.&nbsp;The more experience it has, the darker it becomes, and the darker it is, the higher the value.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The size is perfect. The color is yellow, so it has Earth Attribute. Its shade is also surprisingly dark. It probably defeated the monsters that intruded here for a long time.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel said while looking at the golem’s magic stone.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ooo, so this is the loot for this battle. Abel should carry it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, since my clothes don’t have pockets.”</p><p class="calibre2">“O-oh.”</p>
