<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Sea … Heaven and Hell</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Ryo had completely mastered Water Jet and Abrasive Jet.</p><p class="calibre2">Hunting with magic could be said to have become considerably easier.</p><p class="calibre2">When that happened, an insatiable ambition for something that has not yet been conquered was born.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, it was the sea!</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sea was 500 meters to the southwest of Ryo’s home.</p><p class="calibre2">Michael (pseudonym) told him.</p><p class="calibre2">Once he was accustomed to Water Attribute Magic, he could harvest salt from seawater.</p><p class="calibre2">Although his salt stockpile was used quite liberally for the fish sauce barrel, he still had enough to easily last him for another half a year.</p><p class="calibre2">However, it was necessary to verify how much salt could be harvested from the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, there was also seafood.</p><p class="calibre2">He could certainly eat fish by catching freshwater fish from the river.</p><p class="calibre2">Although they were piranha-like fishes.</p><p class="calibre2">However, saltwater fishes from the sea had their distinct tastiness too.</p><p class="calibre2">Moreover, there were shellfishes, sea urchins, squids, octopuses, and such … well, he’ll have to dive to get them.</p><p class="calibre2">But that was okay, he grew up in the country so he was good at swimming!</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the southwest, after 400 meters from the barrier, a white sandy beach stretched across his sight.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a scene exactly like Phuket Island or Bali Island!</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, Ryo had never been to those places … he had only seen images of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Images are important!</p>
<p class="calibre2">He forgot the time for a while and just stared but he suddenly pulled himself back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Salt, I have to try harvesting it.”</p><p class="calibre2">First, he created a one-meter diameter ice bucket and an ice pail to scoop up seawater.</p><p class="calibre2">Scoop up seawater with the ice pail and pour it into the ice bucket.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pour.</p><p class="calibre2">Pour.</p><p class="calibre2">Pour.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the bucket was mostly filled, he imagined removing the water from the ice bucket.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Dehydration&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The water was removed, leaving white grains and slightly colored grains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He licked the white grains.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yup, it’s salty. This is salt.”</p><p class="calibre2">Success!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And these with the color … oh, this is sand.”</p><p class="calibre2">Because he gathered seawater from near the sandy beach, the sand floating in the seawater was poured into the bucket.</p><p class="calibre2">“So I can acquire just salt if I gathered water from somewhere further away from the beach.”</p><p class="calibre2">Since it was an experiment, for the time being, he dumped the ice bucket and the salt in it into the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">He aimed for the rocky area that could be seen to the north.</p><p class="calibre2">“It would be great if I can get my hands on some seafood.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When he reached a rocky spot, he took off everything he was wearing and jumped into the sea without hesitation.</p><p class="calibre2">A mesmerizing world just as he had imagined came into view.</p><p class="calibre2">The water was crystal clear and he could see the bottom of the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">There were colorful fish, coral, and other marine life that Ryo didn’t recognize.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, Ryo found one. A delicious-looking fish!</p><p class="calibre2">He returned to the surface of the sea to take a breath before kicking the surface once more and headed toward the bottom of the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">In his right hand was his trusty knife-tipped bamboo spear.</p><p class="calibre2">The white fish was about 50cm in length and looked like a sea bream.</p><p class="calibre2">He pierced it with one thrust using his knife-tipped bamboo spear like a harpoon.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a brilliant stab.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in that instant … the world changed.</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, that was how it felt to Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">The sea that was heaven to him up until that point had transformed into hell in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was floating. And he had forgotten.</p><p class="calibre2">That this was not Earth. This was 『Phi』.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, it was a sea inhabited by monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The instant Ryo killed that sea bream-like fish in the sea, he had become the sea’s enemy.</p><p class="calibre2">The colorful fishes fled and Ryo was forced to realize that the world had changed.</p><p class="calibre2">(This is bad. I should run.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was too late.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Ryo turned around, there was a school of fish called a Bait Ball.</p><p class="calibre2">The bait ball formed when sardines swarm in a spherical shape to counter tuna and other predators.</p><p class="calibre2">Sardines may still appear cute but the Bait Ball forming in front of Ryo appeared to be formed by monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, 『appeared to be』.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo did not recognize the monster.</p><p class="calibre2">There was not a single sea monster recorded in the 『Monster Encyclopedia Beginner’s Edition』.</p><p class="calibre2">There was just one line.</p><p class="calibre2">Please refer to the 『Monster Encyclopedia Sea-Dweller Edition』 for monsters that live in the sea.</p><p class="calibre2">It affirmed that there were monsters in the sea and that there were quite many types such that a separate book was made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, Ryo’s chances of winning were much lower.</p><p class="calibre2">『If you&nbsp;know&nbsp;the&nbsp;enemy&nbsp;and&nbsp;know&nbsp;yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.』</p><p class="calibre2">Just like the phrase from Sun Tzu, Ryo always had information on the enemies he battled so far.</p><p class="calibre2">Because he prepared using the Monster Encyclopedia Beginner’s Edition』.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when he faced that Assassin Hawk, he was able to fight because he had information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, he had no information on his enemy at all.</p><p class="calibre2">『If you&nbsp;know&nbsp;yourself but not the&nbsp;enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.』</p><p class="calibre2">His chances of winning had dropped to 50% instantly …</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was also such a phrase in the world of war.</p><p class="calibre2">『Opportunities of time vouchsafed by Heaven are not equal&nbsp;to advantages of situation afforded by the Earth, and advantages of situation afforded by the Earth are&nbsp;not equal&nbsp;to the union arising from the accord of Men.』</p><p class="calibre2">Putting aside the opportunities of time vouchsafed by Heaven.</p><p class="calibre2">The opponent had a geographical advantage.</p><p class="calibre2">The sea was the home ground of sea monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo, who couldn’t even breathe, was nothing more than a foreigner.</p><p class="calibre2">Harmony of men. That splendid formation of a Bait Ball … showed that their communication was perfect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seemed to be no chance of winning.</p><p class="calibre2">(The smartest thing to do in a tight situation is to retreat.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that was when Ryo noticed something strange.</p><p class="calibre2">(I can’t kick the water … I can’t even push the water with my hands.)</p><p class="calibre2">His body was not sinking.</p><p class="calibre2">But he could not grab the water and was unable to move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo was a Water Attribute Magician.</p><p class="calibre2">Even if he was a foreigner in the sea, he couldn’t understand the situation where he could not even grasp water.</p><p class="calibre2">The enemy did not wait idly as Ryo fell half into panic.</p><p class="calibre2">Monsters charged out from the Bait Ball like a missile or torpedo and flew toward Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">(&lt;Ice Wall&gt;)</p><p class="calibre2">It was hard to comprehend forming an Ice Wall in the sea but for the time being, as he couldn’t move to dodge, he had no choice but to defend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after a couple of the monster torpedoes deflected off the Ice Wall, he lost control of the Ice Wall.</p><p class="calibre2">It was stripped off in front of Ryo and disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">(My control of the Ice Wall was stolen?)</p><p class="calibre2">The monster torpedoes continued without interruption.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo continuously created Ice Walls to defend against that but they were peeled off from in front of Ryo and disappeared into the sea within a second of formation.</p><p class="calibre2">(Adding to the phenomenon where I can’t grab the water, I see. They have taken control of the water around me.)</p>     <p class="calibre2">Ryo was a Water Attribute Magician.</p><p class="calibre2">And he had trained his magic control to quite an extent.</p><p class="calibre2">Molecular control had significantly improved Ryo’s magic control skill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this time the opponent was a bad match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Monsters in the sea … at the genetic level, they had the technique to use Water Attribute Magic.</p><p class="calibre2">They had used magic control of Water Attribute Magic as part of their lives for generations.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though he trained at an unrivaled level, Ryo, a newcomer who just became a Water Attribute Magician just a few months ago, could not match up to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the enemy numbered in the thousands.</p><p class="calibre2">Since they formed a Bait Ball, he could not see their actual numbers but it was probably at least a thousand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The formation of Ice Walls barely defended against the monster torpedoes.</p><p class="calibre2">Although they were dispelled almost immediately after formation, he formed them just before the torpedoes collided so the Ice Walls that had served their purpose could be dispelled.</p><p class="calibre2">Defense was not an issue but the problem was oxygen.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of his daily training, he could last for about four minutes without breathing.</p><p class="calibre2">However, in this situation, it was 『only four minutes』.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How should he overcome it?</p><p class="calibre2">(For the time being, the water around my limbs, I wonder if I can put them under my control.)</p><p class="calibre2">When he tried to use magical power to touch the seawater around him, he felt a repelling force.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a similar sensation as when he previously tried to thaw the meat frozen in the storage by Michael (pseudonym).</p><p class="calibre2">However, the force was much stronger this time.</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, for now, it seemed unlikely that Ryo would be able to snatch the control back from the opponent.</p><p class="calibre2">As expected of monsters living in the sea. Or perhaps it was due to the numbers?</p><p class="calibre2">At any rate, there was no chance of winning by scrambling for magic control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He specifically explored the seawater under the control of the enemy.</p><p class="calibre2">(It’s limited to around my hands and feet huh? And it is quite thin. Well, even if it is thin, I can’t grasp it so isn’t it a fairly efficient method? It’s a shot in the dark but I have no choice but to try! The principle should be the same as Water Jet so it should work!)</p>
<p class="calibre2">He imagined it in his head while continuing to generate Ice Walls almost unconsciously.</p><p class="calibre2">The image of firing out Water Jet from the soles of both feet.</p><p class="calibre2">However, this time, instead of the usual thin stream, it would be a thick gush.</p><p class="calibre2">It was similar to when his Water Jet could not take shape in the beginning and was about the size of water coming out of a carwash hose, and he attached 32 to each leg.</p><p class="calibre2">The momentum would be on par with the Water Jet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&lt;Water Jet 64&gt;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after chanting, Ryo’s body rose at once due to the repulsive force of the Water Jet that was ejected toward the seabed.</p><p class="calibre2">He reached the surface of the sea in an instant.</p><p class="calibre2">And he burst out of the surface with that momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that was not the end.</p><p class="calibre2">He took a breath and once again plunged his head into the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was aiming for a surprise attack on the Bait Ball from directly above it.</p><p class="calibre2">Sure enough, the Bait Ball was confused due to Ryo’s sudden rise and disappearance.</p><p class="calibre2">No matter how perfect the group of monsters can communicate, they could not deal with situations that they had never experienced before.</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo plunged directly from above while they were in that state.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, he thrust his knife-tipped bamboo spear many times.</p><p class="calibre2">And added in some side-sweeping motions.</p><p class="calibre2">He expected some resistance when swinging the spear in the sea but it was not that much.</p><p class="calibre2">It damaged quite a number of the monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed that the monsters were able to handle powerful magic control but their physical endurance was the same as an ordinary fish.</p><p class="calibre2">With a single sweep of a bamboo spear, they fell out.</p><p class="calibre2">It took less than a minute for the Bait Ball to crack and the monsters that formed it to flee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Phew, I somehow did it.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ryo let his guard down.</p><p class="calibre2">The enemy was not just one group.</p><p class="calibre2">The entire sea was Ryo’s enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The best option would have been to escape to land the first time he reached the surface.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, it was too late.</p><p class="calibre2">From the shadow of the rock next to him, a shrimp about a meter-long appeared.</p><p class="calibre2">(Only the claw on its right arm is unusually large … what’s that? Bubbles?)</p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment later, Ryo lost consciousness.</p>
