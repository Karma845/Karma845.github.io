<h3>Chapter 30 &#8211; Lizardman</h3>


<p class="calibre2">“Here, for lunch, we have mountain bandit roast-style bird meat and flame-grilled boar cheek meat.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both were grilled meats …</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, black pepper also has the effect of relieving fatigue, so please eat all you can eat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“O-ou.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was enjoying the bird meat that he had not had for a long time.</p><p class="calibre2">Compared to rabbits and boars, it was less likely to encounter bird-type monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">Although there were many things on Abel’s mind, eating when it was the time to eat was an essential ability for an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">For now, he focused on eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a while, only the chewing sounds of the two people echoed in the clearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel, who was considerably tired from using two 『Sword Arts』, felt that he was no longer tired by the time he finished eating.</p><p class="calibre2">The two of them drank the water prepared by Ryo and sighed with satisfaction.</p><p class="calibre2">“I would be so satisfied if the time now was right before evening and we could set up camp here.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo smiled wryly at Abel’s words.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel wants to join his friends as soon as possible, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Even so, this is probably going to take weeks, isn’t it? There’s no point in rushing.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, it is true that we don’t know how long it will take. That said, we can still walk for half a day, so let’s go.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo stood up while saying so.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right then.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel replied and stood up as well.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey, this is a journey to send Abel back to your friends …”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey, Ryo, about that battle just now …”</p><p class="calibre2">As usual, Abel was in front and Ryo was at the back.</p><p class="calibre2">Since it was a dense forest and there was a possibility of getting separated, Ryo followed directly behind Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, what about it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“How did you prevent the Assassin Hawk’s attack? It has that invisible Wind Magic and assault charge, right? And the charge comes at a speed which is impossible to avoid by visual reaction.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel had his gaze forward as he asked Ryo while walking.</p><p class="calibre2">“I prevented them using Water-Attribute Magic, Ice Wall, which is a spell that creates a wall of ice.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hoh, so there are such spells too?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, look behind.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel looked back as he was asked.</p><p class="calibre2">There was nothing in particular, with Ryo within an arm’s reach.&nbsp;But … he felt something was off.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm? This is …”</p><p class="calibre2">Knock knock</p><p class="calibre2">Abel noticed the ice wall and knocked on it.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s extremely transparent.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, it’s hard to notice, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">(I see. Did the Assassin Hawk charge into this transparent wall and kill itself?)</p><p class="calibre2">“Water Magic is amazing too. Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone who uses Water Magic, so I don’t know much about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">The magicians Abel knew were Fire, Wind, Earth, and Light.&nbsp;There were quite a few magicians among those four attributes, but none of Water and Darkness.</p><p class="calibre2">Darkness was quite special so there were almost no users in the central countries as a whole.&nbsp;Water was …</p><p class="calibre2">“I was told that Water Magic wasn’t suitable for combat, but it seems quite useful. I’ll complain to gramps when I meet him the next time.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm? Abel, did you say something?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, no, I’m just talking to myself, don’t mind me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was something that worried Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">It was the monster in the forest beyond the opening where they engaged with the Assassin Hawk.</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, it was not a monster that Ryo had ever encountered.</p><p class="calibre2">When the battle between Ryo and the Assassin Hawk began, that monster did not exit into the clearing and eventually returned to where it came from.</p><p class="calibre2">From the 『Feel』, it wasn’t a large monster.</p><p class="calibre2">In fact, they were passing through the area where the monster was supposed to have been, but the branches were not broken.&nbsp;If it was a large monster, they would have been broken.&nbsp;It was such a dense forest after all.</p><p class="calibre2">(Well, there’s nothing I can do even if I think about it?)</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s useless to think about it, don’t think about it.</p><p class="calibre2">This was one of Ryo’s specialties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can hear something from the front.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel whispered to Ryo.&nbsp;Ryo nodded in reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, the forest opened up and a wetland seemed to spread far into the distance.</p><p class="calibre2">And unlike the wetlands of the Dullahan … there was a lizardman there.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lizardman …”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel said with a frown.</p>     <p class="calibre2">Lizardmen lived in groups.</p><p class="calibre2">That meant that there was likely a lizardmen settlement in the depths of that wetland.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lizardman … a monster that lives in clusters in swamps, and when it grows up, its tail molts and is used as a spear. They can’t communicate with humans and would attack unconditionally when they see humans. That’s because our internal organs are one of their favorite foods.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel looked at Ryo in surprise.</p><p class="calibre2">“You know about them well. Have you fought Lizardmen before?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That was just written in the book 『Monster’s Encyclopedia: Beginner’s Edition』 that I had at home. I have never fought them.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo shook his head and answered.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Lizardmen do not use magic but they are pretty annoying opponents in the wetlands. And because they form clusters, there are always a large number of them so I’m reluctant to fight. Let’s take a detour.”</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, Ryo didn’t disagree with that.</p><p class="calibre2">And so the both of them headed to the west, which was also downwind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After walking a considerable distance away from the wetlands, they started walking north again.</p><p class="calibre2">To be honest, they didn’t know how big the wetland was, but they both wanted to stay as far away as possible from the wetland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But … that wish was soon crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Abel, it seems that the Lizardmen noticed us.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Seriously? Will they attack us here?”</p><p class="calibre2">It was a dense forest.&nbsp;At least, it was not a wetland, so if it was a lone Lizardman, it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, you can fight without worrying about me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, okay. Don’t overdo it. Make use of that wall you showed me before.”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel somehow felt that Ryo would be okay.</p><p class="calibre2">(He lived alone in this forest. I just have to beat the monsters in front of me, attract their attention, and prevent them from going past me as much as possible!)</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vanguard of the Lizardmen appeared while they were communicating.</p><p class="calibre2">“As long as I don’t know the number of enemies, I’ll save on using Combat Arts.”</p><p class="calibre2">He stepped in on his own and mowed it down with his sword in a horizontal line.&nbsp;The lizardman died with that single blow.</p><p class="calibre2">Then, he continued with a thrust at the enemy to the right and killed the second one.</p><p class="calibre2">Even after that, Abel moved deftly to prevent from being surrounded and defeated the Lizardmen without taking too much risk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even without using Combat Arts, Abel was an excellent swordsman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(Abel is amazing. He’s not in danger at all. Those sophisticated movements are definitely not self-taught and he probably received proper training from a young age …)</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo was honestly impressed.</p><p class="calibre2">That was the figure of a first-class swordsman who had piled on training and effort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even Abel couldn’t handle them all, and about two of them headed toward Ryo.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m okay!”</p><p class="calibre2">Ryo shouted to Abel.</p><p class="calibre2">Abel glanced at Ryo and immediately began dealing with the Lizardmen around him.</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance 2&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The two ice spears fired from Ryo’s hand pierced the Lizardmen’s foreheads without missing their mark.</p><p class="calibre2">“It feels like I shot Icicle Lance for the first time in a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When he thought that it was about to end, he sensed something different was approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, something big is coming mixed with Lizardmen.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Without a chance to rest his hand used to defeat the Lizardmen, Abel saw the Lizardmen incoming.</p><p class="calibre2">The big thing that was coming …</p><p class="calibre2">“Lizard King! Why would such a big shot appear? Just laze at the back of the settlement!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lizard King … it was the 『Higher position』 of Lizardman, of which only one exists in a settlement.</p><p class="calibre2">It does not refer to a change that could be called an evolution of the species such as a 『Higher rank』but was more of a manager.&nbsp;Its equivalent would be the 『King』 and 『Village Chief』 in the human world.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the individual who becomes a Lizard King has a larger body and above all, greater fighting power.</p><p class="calibre2">Such an individual becomes the king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There are four remaining Lizardmen and the King? That’s a little troublesome.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, please kill the King. I will defeat the rest with magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, but Ryo’s staff …”</p><p class="calibre2">“&lt;Icicle Lance 4&gt;”</p><p class="calibre2">The four ice spears that came out of Ryo’s hand pierced the foreheads of the four Lizardmen other than the King, just like the previous two ice spears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Abel was stunned.</p><p class="calibre2">“Just now, he shot out four, but … I think I recall Rin saying that there are no spells capable of simultaneous invocation … No, perhaps there are such spells in Water-Attribute Magic? Or it’s possible because it is not simultaneous? Hmm?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Abel, the Lizard King is coming.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abel came back to his senses with Ryo’s warning.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ll think later. First, defeat the King.”</p>
