<h3>Chapter 23: Female Knight, Play Pretend
</h3>

<p>&quot;Haa ~ ~ ~ ......&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha let out a heavy sigh.</p>





<p> Her work is over. Staggering down the wide corridor.</p>





<p> She greeted the soldiers and maids she passed along the way, but otherwise, she was lost in thought.</p>





<p> Of course, it was about Keith.</p>





<p> The ridiculous promise she had made a few days before.</p>





<p> And the outrageous lasciviousness that she had exposed a few days ago.</p>





<p> Both of these things were dominating her thoughts, to the point that she was distracted from everything else.</p>





<p> The promise she made to Keith was to &quot;be honest and feel good&quot;.</p>





<p> That meant that she had to accept Keith and perform that lasciviousness in a normal state.</p>





<p> Smile, spread her legs, beg him, take it into her mouth, and even kiss him......</p>





<p> If she hadn't done that, whatever attitude she had when she did, she could have said, &quot;This is my normal attitude!&quot; she might have been able to say.</p>





<p> However, once she had been shown that way, the &quot;honest&quot; state of mind becomes a reality.</p>





<p> That was Keith's goal, but of course, Aisha was unaware of it.</p>





<p> For Aisha, who had no idea what the actual act between lovers was like, that figure she showed was nothing but a slut.</p>





<p> She is convinced that smiling at a man and asking him to make her feel good is an act she should not do.</p>





<p> It was an idea that she kept who had remained a virgin for 53 years, seeking purity and cleanliness in the act between a man and a woman.</p>





<p> Of course, this is not to say that she had no sexual desires.</p>





<p> She was interested in it to an excessive degree.</p>





<p> However, Aisha's masturbation material consisted of slightly erotic novels for women, in which the heroine was always gently caressed and penetrated by a handsome man.</p>





<p> There was no description of a woman asking for &quot;more&quot; or licking a man's penis.</p>





<p> The female part of Aisha.</p>





<p> The true nature of Aisha, which she revealed when she thought she had been made crazy by the drug.</p>





<p> The female part of herself that was so far removed from the beautiful world of a story.</p>





<p> She didn't want to know. She thought she should not know.</p>





<p> Every time she writhed in agony thinking about it, she wanted to die.</p>





<p> But she held on because if she held on just one more time, everything would be over.</p>





<p> He told her that if she slept with Keith one more time, he would give her the crystal.</p>





<p> It might be a lie.</p>





<p> He might not give it to her.</p>





<p> But it was worth the gamble.</p>





<p> It would be better than what she had now.</p>





<p> She made up her mind, but she couldn't finish the thought that a few seconds later she would be the one to do that lasciviousness again.......</p>





<p> As a result, even when she was on duty, her eyes were blank, and Naia was worried about her.</p>





<p>&quot;Crystal... if I get it... I'll definitely kill him.&quot;</p>





<p> She muttered as she squeezed the hilt of her rapier.</p>





<p> But for today, she would go back to her room and rest.</p>





<p> She may not be able to sleep, but at least her body needs to rest.</p>





<p> When she looked up at the corridor in front of her room, Aisha screamed, &quot;Hiii!&quot;.</p>





<p> Keith is waving his hand in front of Aisha's room with a smile.</p>





<p> Aisha rushed over to him, her face turning pale.</p>





<p>&quot;Wha!... what are you doing!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha whispered, looking around.</p>





<p>&quot;What do you mean, I'm trying to get you to fulfill your promise.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Then tell me a few days in advance! Coming here suddenly!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh ~ ~ ~, when would you make a full appointment then? Aisha-sama's puss...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's mouth was sealed after saying that much.</p>





<p>&quot;Idiot, idiot, idiot!!! Your voice is too loud!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha tried her best to listen carefully for the footsteps of the patrolling soldiers coming from the corridor, but her heartbeat was too loud.</p>





<p>&quot;F-for the time being, let's get inside the room!!&quot;</p>





<p> She let Keith into her room, but the next moment she wondered if she had lured the man into her room. She felt her blood boil.</p>





<p> As she looked at Keith, he looked around the room and took a deep breath as hard as he could.</p>





<p>&quot;It smells like Aisha-sama.&quot;</p>





<p> He smiled.</p>





<p>&quot;Don't sniff, you idiot!!&quot;</p>





<p> She shut her mouth in a panic at her own outburst.</p>





<p>&quot;The muffling tool! You probably brought it! Activate that!!&quot;</p>





<p> Yelling in a whisper.</p>





<p> Keith said, &quot;Yes, yes&quot; as he pulled the magic tool out of his pocket and activated it.</p>





<p> And as soon as Aisha was relieved.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh!! Nnh... fuu! Chu...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith held Aisha in his arms and took her lips.</p>





<p>&quot;Chu... chu, chu, nchu... nwa! Stop!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha pushed Keith's body away.</p>





<p> She wiped her lips with her hand and glared at Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;What are you doing so suddenly!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? You told me to activate the magic tool, so I thought you already want to start...... no?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Of course not!! I'm trying to keep our voice leaking outside!! Is that all you think about?!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What, is that so... so what is it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah... well, w-why are you in my room! If you want to talk, we can talk in your room!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, that's...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith is muttering.</p>





<p> Actually, he thought it was time to call Aisha, and he told Lou he wanted to use the room.</p>





<p>&quot;I won't leave again. If you want, you can do it in her room, nyaa!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hey, you worthless cat! Is that what a familiar would say to its master!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;......If you try to force me out of the room, nyaa......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What? What are you going to do?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'm going to be very, very rough on you, nyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What the hell&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;!!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'm going to do something to you that will make you too stinky that they won't be able to get in the mood!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hey, don't idiot! Make sure to bury it in the sand!!&quot;</p>





<p> It was due to their arguments, but he can't say it because he's too embarrassed.</p>





<p>&quot;I wanted to come to Aisha-sama's room.&quot;</p>





<p> A lie. So as not to shove it in his face further.</p>





<p>&quot;So... are you ready to be honest?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face fell as she was so cut off.</p>





<p> Honest... herself... to Keith...</p>





<p> Smiling at the sight of Aisha, who looked like she was about to fall apart, Keith pulled out a magic tool from his pocket.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha-sama, look.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looks up. She frowned, not knowing what it was.</p>





<p>&quot;It's a modified version of the promised copy crystal.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face hardened in surprise at those words.</p>





<p> That thing?</p>





<p> That was the source of Naia's and her own sorrow.</p>





<p> She was about to slice Keith's arm with her rapier when she thought of that, but Keith sensed it and said.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, I've applied transfer magic to it, so if you try to harm it or take it from me, it will be transferred to the right place.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Guh!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha bit her teeth and removed her hand from the hilt of her rapier.</p>





<p> Keith breathes a sigh of relief.</p>





<p> He's using transfer magic, but the destination was his own room. In other words, he was bluffing.</p>





<p>&quot;So, what are you going to do? Will you be honest as you promised? Or you want to give up?&quot;</p>





<p> She had to do it.</p>





<p> I have to do it. To get it.</p>





<p> It was for Naia's sake and for her own.</p>





<p> But...... she remembered herself a few days ago.</p>





<p> The way she looked, the way she sounded, the way she acted.</p>





<p> I can't do it. I just can't do it.</p>





<p> Aisha's face was clouded by the contradictory feelings.</p>





<p> Keith smiled at the expression on her face, knowing that things were going as he had expected.</p>





<p> Keith wants to see Aisha in agony, and today he wants to see her embarrassed.</p>





<p> He had a scenario for that.</p>





<p> Keith took a breath and then said</p>





<p>&quot;I guess, it's a no...&quot;</p>





<p> Having said that, he put the magic tool back in his pocket.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>





<p> And Aisha tried to stop his hand, but.</p>





<p>&quot;Can you do it?&quot;</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&quot;It's selfish of you to want it when you can't do it, Aisha-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Kuh&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> Keith paused.</p>





<p>&quot;Then... I'll make it a little easier for you.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face lit up.</p>





<p>&quot;How about we play pretend from now until the morning?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Play... pretend?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, me and Aisha-sama&quot;</p>





<p> When Naia was much younger than she is now, she used to play with her a lot.</p>





<p> An adult wanted to play pretend with her.</p>





<p>&quot;...I don't know.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I understand. If you play this game with me until morning, I will give you this magic tool.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Wha!!? Real...ly?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Really.&quot;</p>





<p> There is no way this is such a convenient deal.</p>





<p> Aisha thought desperately. And.</p>





<p>&quot;You're going to tell me to be a slut or a slave, that kind of thing.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I won't do that. I won't ask you to be anything sexual at all.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;T-that's a lie!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I swear.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith raised his hand with a serious face and swore.</p>





<p> Aisha watched as he did so.</p>





<p>&quot;T-then, what are we pretending to be?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled at her words.</p>





<p>&quot;Playing lovers.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face tensed up. Then, with a small shudder.</p>





<p>&quot;Don't mess around!! Why would I, even if we're pretending, become lo-lo-lovers!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;If you can't, that's okay. I'll go back.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith simply says so and tries to leave the room.</p>





<p> As he turned his back, Aisha said &quot;Ah&quot;.</p>





<p> Thoughts race through Aisha's brain.</p>





<p> Will there ever be another chance to get that magic tool?</p>





<p> Would she have to live her whole life in fear that there was a magic tool with a video of Naia's perversion somewhere?</p>





<p> She didn't want that. She can't do that.</p>





<p> But no matter what she does, she can't accept her true self again with a straight face.</p>





<p> Then...... she just has to pretend until morning. That's all there is to it.</p>





<p> And if they were pretending to be lovers, she can say no even if she's asked to say or do something strange.</p>





<p> Because that's what a lover is supposed to do.</p>





<p> As she made up her mind.</p>





<p>&quot;...If you tell anyone about this.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Who's going to believe this nonsense about me and Aisha-sama playing lovers?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;......It's only till morning.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith nodded happily. And.</p>





<p>&quot;For now, please wear the dress you wore the other day.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Why!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Because it was cute.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Like I said, why!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;If your lover says it's cute, she usually wears it, right? It's a date.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Guh...!!&quot;</p>





<p> To be honest, she wanted to refuse, but she didn't want to invoke her right of refusal at such an early stage and have him think, &quot;What's the matter with you, you're not doing anything for me&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;Wait a minute!!&quot;</p>





<p> With that shout, Aisha took out the dress she had put in the closet and headed for the bathroom.</p>





<p> Keith sits down on the bed and waits, and Aisha comes out after getting dressed.</p>





<p> He gazes at her with satisfaction.</p>





<p>&quot;It's cute, after all.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Shut up&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha stood with a discouraged look on her face.</p>





<p>&quot;Come, sit beside me.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith urged her to sit down on the bed.</p>





<p> She was fidgeting with her hands.</p>





<p>&quot;A lover... I wonder if we'll be going to do that thing... then.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I've said it many times, but I don't want to receive mana from Aisha-sama, who cries and hates it. But if I try to make you feel good by tricking you, you don't want it either. So I thought I should just play along with you from the beginning. What do you think?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't know!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I thought hard, but...... well, let's give it a try anyway.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith then pulled a small box out of his pocket and handed it to Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;What...... is this?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's a present for my lover.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Present?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha opened the box with trepidation.</p>





<p> Inside was a small mithril ring.</p>





<p> The surface was carved in the shape of an ivy plant.</p>





<p>&quot;I made it. It's pretty good, right?&quot;</p>





<p> He did not say that he made it with the little bit of mithril he had left.</p>





<p> Aisha was perplexed by the sudden handing of the ring.</p>





<p>&quot;Hmph! You must have put a curse on it to make me feel lusty.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, of course not. See?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith then put the ring on the ring finger of Aisha's right hand.</p>





<p>&quot;Do you like it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-It's normal.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith looked at Aisha with a smile, not knowing what to say and giving him such an incomprehensible impression.</p>





<p> Aisha was staring at her right hand.</p>





<p> It was the first time in her life that she received a ring from a man.</p>





<p> No, she's been given gifts several times, but she refused them all.</p>





<p> But now this was a gift from her lover, even if they were just pretending. There was no way she could refuse.</p>





<p> The ring that he put on made her heart flutter strangely for some reason.</p>





<p> Aisha didn't understand the meaning of this stirring in her heart.</p>





<p> That was because he was a bit nice.</p>





<p>&quot;What! Why are you staring at me!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I was staring at Aisha because she's so cute.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Wha... ah... you idiot!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Why?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;W-w-what's up with you calling me that way!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That way? I mean, lovers don't call each other with a &quot;sama&quot;, right? Or are you the type of woman who gets excited when your lover calls you with &quot;sama&quot;?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's...... true.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Then you'll be Aisha until morning, and...... I'll be Keith, not you or a lowlife.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Am I going to say your name too!?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;When you called out to me.&quot;</p>





<p> She would not call out to him even if she were to die! Aisha swore to herself.</p>





<p> Keith was staring at Aisha again.</p>





<p> Aisha was tickled by his gaze.</p>





<p>&quot;Why do you keep staring at me!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Present... Isn't it normal to say thank you if you get something from your lover?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Thanking...... you gave it to me without my permission! I won't thank you for that.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Guha! Shock!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith then collapsed on the bed with a thud.</p>





<p> While glancing at Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;...If you don't thank me, I will smell the bed.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Stop, idiot!! You idiot!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha desperately tried to pull Keith up from the bed, but he held on hard.</p>





<p>&quot;Sniff*, sniff*!! Sniff*, sniff*!! Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ the smell is good... I'm about to get an erection&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Stop!! Stop!! I understand!! I'll thank you!! I will do it!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Then, it's okay.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith sat up on his knees. He looked at Aisha and waited.</p>





<p>&quot;...Sorry. Thank you.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Simple!!! Shock!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;D-don't fall down!! Don't smell it!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Then, let's do this...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What do you want me to do!! Tell me clearly!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiles, as though he's been waiting for those words.</p>





<p>&quot;... Speaking of a way to thank a lover... that would be a kiss.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Wha!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha is speechless.</p>





<p> Gazing at Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Why don't you go and do it on your own like you did earlier!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh ~ ~ ~, that doesn't mean anything. As a thank you, Aisha will kiss me. That would be normal.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't know!! I can't!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Sho...!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Don't fall down!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha grabs Keith's arm and pulls desperately to keep him from falling.</p>





<p> The force of the pull knocked them both off-balance, and they lay their bodies on top of each other on the bed.</p>





<p> Keith on the bottom, Aisha on top.</p>





<p> Aisha's silver hair fluttered over Keith's face. It was a bit of a surprise.</p>





<p> Keith's hand extended to Aisha's cheek. If she tried to avoid it, she can avoid it, and she just has to get up in the first place.</p>





<p> However, Aisha's body did not move away from Keith as if she had frozen.</p>





<p> While touching Aisha's brown, soft cheek.</p>





<p>&quot;...... Kiss me...... then I won't do it again.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...That's a promise.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Promise.&quot;</p>





<p> With those words, Aisha slowly lowered her face.</p>





<p> Halfway there, she realized that maybe this &quot;playing lovers&quot; is more dangerous than the last one.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Chu...&quot;</p>





<p> Their eyes were closed and their lips overlapped.</p>
