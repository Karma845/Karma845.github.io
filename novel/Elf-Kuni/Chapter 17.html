<h3>Chapter 17: Maid, Drunk</h3>



<p> There is a bubbling sound of something boiling.</p>





<p> The smell that fills the air would gnaw at one's throat and stain one's eyes.</p>





<p> When Lou returns to the room, it screams at the smell.</p>





<p>&quot;Funya! Funyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Immediately covering its nose with its paw, Lou went to the source of the smell, the bathroom.</p>





<p> There, Lou's master is again cooking something in the [witch's pot].</p>





<p>&quot;Master! Are you cooking puke, nyaa!?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Who would cook such a thing.&quot;</p>





<p> While saying that, Keith stirred the contents of the pot with a spoon so that they would not curdle.</p>





<p>&quot;W-what the hell is that, nyaa!? It's making me sick, nyaa!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's my special energy potion.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Energy potion?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith has been enjoying the situation so far with the over-the-counter drugs.</p>





<p> But those are not free.</p>





<p> The more he took, the more he has to spend.</p>





<p> Although the salary of a court mage is not low, he never knows when and for what reasons he may have to flee the country.</p>





<p> He had to keep his expenses down as much as possible for that time, so he thought that a cheaper and stronger homemade energy potion would be better.</p>





<p> However, looking at the energy potion that was being made, Lou said.</p>





<p>&quot;Drink this, nyaa!? Are you going to drink this stuff, nyaa!?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Don't say that! It makes me not to!!&quot;</p>





<p> It certainly takes courage to drink it.</p>





<p> It is a mixture of mandragora, mermaid blood, and newborn dragon urine, mixed with several medicinal herbs, but it smells and looks bad.</p>





<p> Compared to this, Naia and Aisha's urine seems to be easier to drink.</p>





<p>&quot;I can't take it anymore, nyaa! My head hurts, nyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Lou screamed and went out the window.</p>





<p> Lou decided not to come home tonight.</p>





<p> Keith stared sadly at the finished potion.</p>





<p>&quot;I don't want to drink this... I don't want to drink thisss...&quot;</p>





<p> He slumped his shoulders in front of the pot and muttered.</p>





<p> However, it is certain that he has to go to Aisha's room.</p>





<p>&quot;...Is it easier to drink this if I add fruit juice?&quot;</p>





<p> That idea is dangerous.</p>





<p> Even if one put a poop on a curry, it will only become poop with curry.</p>





<p> It is impossible to change the original into something tasty as long as the original has not been changed in any way.</p>





<p> But Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Did we have any fruit or something?&quot;</p>





<p> After searching the room and finding that there were no fruits, he left the room and headed for the palace kitchen, activating the deodorant magic tool.</p>





<p> To get fruits.</p>





<p>&quot;What would be good... apples?... or lemons?&quot;</p>





<p> He walked down the corridor, thinking.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> When he was heading to the kitchen, he thought that only a few people were left to make food for the guards.</p>





<p> However, the place is as busy and lively as a normal battlefield.</p>





<p> The kitchen is filled with the voices of cooks scolding young underlings and servants carrying out the finished dishes one after another.</p>





<p>&quot;What... is there a party?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Tonight is the servants' party.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Fuwaa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith turned around, startled by a voice coming unexpectedly from behind him.</p>





<p> There she was, as he had expected.</p>





<p>&quot;B-Berna-san.&quot;</p>





<p> Berna stood there.</p>





<p> She was dressed in her usual maid costume, with her usual expressionless face.</p>





<p> While suppressing his heart pounding.</p>





<p>&quot;P-party?&quot;</p>





<p> In response to Keith's question, Berna nodded her head.</p>





<p>&quot;The event is held every year after the banquet, with King Mashua's permission. The main purpose is to consume the food and alcohol left over from the banquet without letting it spoil, but everyone is happy as they get to enjoy luxury food that they normally can't eat.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Haa ~ ~ ~&quot;</p>





<p> The cooks' and servants' expressions were not the serious expressions from their daily work, but a glow of anticipation for the party that was about to begin.</p>





<p>&quot;I see, I see.&quot;</p>





<p> They seemed to be enjoying themselves, but it was none of his business, so he just took a piece of fruit and was about to leave.</p>





<p>&quot;Would you like to attend?&quot;</p>





<p> Berna asks, tilting her head.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Ah, but I will only get in the way...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, most of us are grateful to the mage who enabled the princess to use magic. So please join us. If you don't have any plans.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith is troubled.</p>





<p> In fact, the food on the dinner party was so lavish that he didn't feel like eating at all.</p>





<p> However, he was drooling over the dishes that were now being served.</p>





<p> Thinking about it, he hadn't eaten dinner today in order to make an energy potion.</p>





<p> And on top of that, free booze. There's no way he would refuse.</p>





<p>&quot;Alright, I'll join.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, this way, please.&quot;</p>





<p> She took him to a storage room in the basement.</p>





<p> The servants, whose job it was to clean the dusty place, had cleaned it perfectly and set up tables and chairs to make it a venue.</p>





<p> Food and drinks were served one after another, and cheers echoed in the room.</p>





<p> It was a nostalgic atmosphere.</p>





<p> It reminds him of the party after the presentation of the research that was often held in the magic society.</p>





<p> Among the elves who were in the room was Worland-san.</p>





<p>&quot;Oh, Sorcerer-san! You came too?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;As I said, Worland-san, I'm a mage. I already told you that sorcerer is different, old man!&quot;</p>





<p> Worland-san, who finished drinking up, put wine in Keith's hand and said, &quot;Well, drink! Drink it!&quot;. He keeps on offering him the wine.</p>





<p> He was like a grandpa.</p>





<p> And then he leaves to talk to another elf.</p>





<p>&quot;Geez&quot;</p>





<p> He drank the wine and sat down at a nearby seat, and Berna sat down beside him.</p>





<p> It was better than having someone he didn't know at all, but it made him a little nervous.</p>





<p> The elves came to Keith one after another, talked to him, and left.</p>





<p> All of them said things like &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;you are amazing,&quot; which made him feel a little embarrassed.</p>





<p> But of course, some of the elves didn't talk to him, and some just stared.</p>





<p> Keith, who knew it was inevitable since he was working in an elven kingdom, did not mind and enjoyed the food and drinks.</p>





<p> The food was supposed to be made with the ingredients used at the dinner party, but it was strange because it tasted many times better.</p>





<p> He exchanged a few words with Berna, who was beside him, but only for a moment.</p>





<p> Even so, she pours him sake when his cup is empty, and when his plate is empty, she asks if he would like something to eat and took the food.</p>





<p>(She is the No. 1 elf I'd like to have as a wife.)</p>





<p> He looked at Berna while muttering to himself.</p>





<p> Her blonde hair, cut at the shoulder, is darker in color than Naia's, but shines beautifully.</p>





<p> Her face still gives the impression of being young, but she is an adult woman.</p>





<p> If she were a human, she would be around 20 years old, a little older than Aisha.</p>





<p> Does that mean she was around 70?</p>





<p>&quot;She is about the same age as my father......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes? What is it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, it's nothing.&quot;</p>





<p> The face that turned toward Keith was not like that of royalty, but it was beautiful.</p>





<p> There was the daintiness of a flower blooming in the field.</p>





<p> Her cheeks were slightly flushed.</p>





<p>&quot;Are you, um, drunk?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, I'm fine.&quot;</p>





<p> Since her tone is normal, he said, &quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>





<p> Then three elves in their maid's clothes went to Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Mage-sama, are you drinking?&quot;</p>





<p> They sat down at a nearby seat.</p>





<p>&quot;This is good, isn't it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I've always wanted to talk to mage-sama ~.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Are? You're out of alcohol.&quot;</p>





<p> They each say such things and talk to Keith.</p>





<p> Hometown, career, how he enabled Naia to use magic, etc.</p>





<p> Keith responded to it but concealing the hard-to-say part.</p>





<p> The three elves were all beautiful, and drinking with them made him feel as if he were in a nightclub.</p>





<p> As he did so, the sound of a violin began to ring out in the back.</p>





<p> As those who wanted to dance joined, one of the three, Sasha, looked like she wanted to mingle.</p>





<p>&quot;Hey, hey, let's join!&quot;</p>





<p> But then, with a slam, Berna plopped down on the table.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith was startled.</p>





<p>&quot;Acha, she must have gone over her limit.&quot;</p>





<p> Krone, the oldest of the three, muttered.</p>





<p>&quot;Limit?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yeah, Berna doesn't seemed to get drunk at all, but when the amount of alcohol she drinks exceeds her limit, she falls asleep anywhere.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...It's a surprising weakness.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;She is not aware that she is drunk, so we usually stop her when her face turns red.&quot;</p>





<p> It was at the point where Keith had asked her earlier.</p>





<p> He should have stopped her.</p>





<p> He was thinking about that as he watched Berna sleeping peacefully at the table.</p>





<p>&quot;Sasha, your room is right next to Berna's, right? Take her home.&quot;</p>





<p> Krone told Sasha, who wanted to join in the dancing.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh ~ ~, I want to dance!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You're being selfish!&quot;</p>





<p> Della, another elf who had been watching the exchange between the two women.</p>





<p>&quot;Do you want me to take her home?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Della and I will switch with the girls on the night shift after this, right? They're looking forward to it.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;All right, Sasha, then.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ehh!! Kronee.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Don't give me that look.&quot;</p>





<p> As the three of them were arguing.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, I'll take her back if you want.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said to them.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> Keith, carrying Berna on his back, is walking down the corridor.</p>





<p> Berna's room is a room in a servant-only residence, which was built outside the palace.</p>





<p> While walking toward there, Keith was seriously wondering whether he should attack the elf on his back or not.</p>





<p> It was against Keith's principles to attack a drunken woman.</p>





<p> It is a despicable act! He thought to himself.</p>





<p> But isn't it shameful for a man not to eat what was being served to him?</p>





<p>&quot;What should I do? I wonder if I should eat you.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith walked down the corridor muttering such a thing to Berna, who was sleeping peacefully despite her chastity being in danger.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh, nnhh...&quot;</p>





<p> He heard a voice.</p>





<p> Berna seemed to wake up.</p>





<p> Berna felt that she is being carried by someone.</p>





<p>&quot;... Mage... sama...?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith answered as he looked forward.</p>





<p>&quot;Um, I...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You fell down drunk. I'm on my way to take you back to your room.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;</p>





<p> As Berna was about to get off after saying that.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, no, You're swaying at your feet, so I'll carry you like this.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;But.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's fine, Berna-san is light.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, no.&quot;</p>





<p> As he walked forward, Keith thought that he had lost the chance to eat Berna, but at least he could enjoy the feeling of Berna's body.</p>





<p> Although slender, Berna's hips are surprisingly soft and ample.</p>





<p> Her breasts were flat.</p>





<p> The two of them were not talking when she woke up, but suddenly Berna said.</p>





<p>&quot;Um, Mage-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? What is it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry, can you let me down?&quot;</p>





<p> Oh no, she must have found out I was enjoying the feel of her ass.</p>





<p> He thought so.</p>





<p>&quot;Oh, is something bothering you?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No... um...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Toilet...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's! Ah, I'm sorry!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith panicked as he let go of Berna.</p>





<p>&quot;But there are no toilets near here...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yeah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> It is true that there is a long distance from their current position to the servants' restroom.</p>





<p> He didn't know if it was because of alcohol or urine, though it's the usual expressionless expression, but Berna, who has a slightly red cheek and rubs her thighs, is kind of cute.</p>





<p>&quot;Can't help it...... Berna-san.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's a little uncomfortable, but you'll have to put up with it.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> The moment the question mark appeared on Berna's face, the two bodies wrapped in a ring of magic disappeared.</p>





<p> They appeared on Keith's room</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> Berna looked around, slowly opening her closed eyes in the dazzling light.</p>





<p> It's a strange room.</p>





<p> The room was filled with the smell of a man.</p>





<p> Feeling a bit of motion sickness, she turned her head toward Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Oee!! Ugueee!!!&quot;</p>





<p> He was vomiting profusely into a trash can.</p>





<p>&quot;Mage-sama.&quot;</p>





<p> Berna hurriedly rubbed his back.</p>





<p>&quot;Now, in my room, oee! You can use it, oee! Guee!!&quot;</p>





<p> She looked at the mage who had used magic to bring her to the toilet and vomited, as though she were looking at something strange.</p>





<p>&quot;...I'm sorry, I'll borrow it.&quot;</p>





<p> Berna went to the toilet.</p>





<p> Keith, who had just vomited back most of what he had just eaten, smiled quietly, thinking that this must be a sign that he must eat her.</p>





<p> Vomit is all over his mouth and tears welled up in his eyes.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> At the same time, Aisha's room.</p>





<p> Aisha was sitting on her bed, legs dangling.</p>





<p> She was wearing the dress that Keith liked, and took a bath using rose oil.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith... he's not here yet.&quot;</p>





<p> She mumbled and waited for her beloved, worrying if he would like the frilly underwear she had just put on.</p>





<p> But the lowlife is trying to eat another woman in another room...</p>
