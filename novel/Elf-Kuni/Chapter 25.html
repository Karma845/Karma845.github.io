<h3>Chapter 25: Female Knight, Treated Kindly 2</h3>

<p>He lay Aisha down as if he were gently handling a treasure, and placed a pillow on her back.</p>

<p> Then he undressed and moved between Aisha's legs.</p>



<p> When he gently pushed her legs open, Aisha's secret flesh was wet enough.</p>



<p> Keith gripped his penis and traced it across Aisha's labia.</p>



<p> There was an itchy sensation as the glans rubbed against its petals.</p>



<p> He then pushed the tip into the hole and gently pushed his hips forward.</p>



<p> She could feel the penis slipping in. And a numbing sensation ran from Aisha's womb to her brain.</p>



<p>&quot;Haa!... hii...!&quot;</p>



<p> When it was all the way in, it instantly turned into warmth.</p>



<p> Keith looked at Aisha, whose mouth had gone slack, and pulled the bedsheets over them and covered himself and Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;Wh... what?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's nice to be wrapped up like this.&quot;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jL5rS98/Manga-Zip-info-0329.jpg" width= "345;" height= "480;"></img>

<p> While saying so, he began pistoning slowly.</p>



<p> He puts his hands below Aisha's armpits and moves his hips forward.</p>



<p> The bed shakes gently, and the movement provides a good stimulus.</p>



<p> As Keith had said, she felt more comfortable when she was wrapped in bedsheets.</p>



<p>&quot;Fuhaa, fuwaa! Nhh, nnh... different... why is this so different!&quot;</p>



<p> Gentle pistons, gentle hip movements.</p>



<p> One can see on Keith's face that he is trying very hard to make Aisha feel good.</p>



<p> A little less strain on Aisha and to a place where she feels good.</p>



<p> While knocking on the back with the tip of his penis and pulling his hips gently.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah! Ah! Ahh!! Deep! Feels warm!! Why, unlike before, it's not even that intense!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith was pleased with the look on her face and her words.</p>



<p>&quot;I knew it... kuh!! Aisha liked, ah, this better!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith repeats gently going in and out while enduring the lusty feeling of Aisha's pussy.</p>



<p>&quot;This one? Fuuwa!! Auu!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith slowed down his hips movement.</p>



<p>&quot;I'm sorry. I've been so rough with you until now and I thought...... Aisha would be happy, but ..... on the contrary, I made you cry.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Me&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I made a mistake because I wanted Aisha to feel good a lot. You really liked it gentle...... will you forgive me?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;For...... me?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I will be nice to you a lot from now on...... I won't trick you or make you cry anymore. So, Aisha...... please feel good a lot.&quot;</p>



<p> Then he resumed the movement of his hips.</p>



<p> A sense of happiness along with pleasure came to fill Aisha's body.</p>



<p> For her...... he is only trying to make her feel good.</p>



<p> He apologized for what happened the other day and said he was wrong.</p>



<p> That he tricked her, that it was his fault.</p>



<p> But this, those words just now, is supposed to be in the middle of a play.</p>



<p> But that apology seemed real. He told her that he would continue to do so. It wasn't just for now.</p>



<p> But when this act is over, if she got the crystal, Keith...</p>



<p> Her head, in the throes of pleasure, is not thinking straight.</p>



<p> So, for now, Aisha decided to enjoy it.</p>



<p> All of that can be considered after this time with Keith is over.</p>



<p> After she got all the good feelings that make her feel awesome and happy and not hate herself.</p>



<p>&quot;Hyaa!! Ahh!! Nhh! Ah!! Amazing, deep, it's warm...... it's gradually......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Here? Kuh! Does it feel good here?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith re-positioned his penis.</p>



<p>&quot;Kyaa!! There!! Fu! Fuu!!&quot;</p>



<p> Last time, Aisha was seeking Keith's penis.</p>



<p> But now, she wanted Keith from the bottom of her heart.</p>



<p> She wanted to accept Keith more. She wanted to connect with Keith more.</p>



<p> What should she do about that?</p>



<p>&quot;Ah! Ahyaa!! Nhh, ah! Ahh!!!&quot;</p>



<p> Looking at his face. Keith's face.</p>



<p> The man was sweating and moving his hips to make Aisha feel better with a desperate look on his face.</p>



<p> She wanted it. She wanted more, Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;Kei... th.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Haa, haa... eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Keith...&quot;</p>



<p> She called his name in a voice that she was not sure if Keith even heard.</p>



<p> The name she thought she would never call.</p>



<p> But that's all it was.</p>



<p>&quot;A-Aisha... are you about to cum? Ugh!, inside, amazing... it's undulating so much.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Haa! Haa!!...... Cumming...... this is amazing! Cumming...... scary, I'm scared.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's fine. I'm here. That's why, here!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith then thrusts his penis gently into the deepest part of her vagina, near the womb.</p>



<p>&quot;Gyuu!! Kuhaa!!! Ahh!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Cum, I'm watching. Cum, Aisha!! Aisha!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ahh!! I'm scared!! I'm scareed!! This is scaryy!! Hii... kuh, ahhh!!&quot;</p>



<p> It was not a violent wave.</p>



<p> And yet, the sensation was even greater than last time. Aisha cried out in fear.</p>



<p> Then, as if asking for help.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith! Keithh!!&quot;</p>



<p> She called out his name. Properly so that he can hear it.</p>



<p> She put her arms around Keith's neck, her legs around his waist.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith!! Scary! Help me, Keith!! Hyaaa!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha!! It's fine!! Cum!! Cum!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith's hips moved faster.</p>



<p> The soft flesh of her vagina is pushed away, and his penis is penetrating deeper and deeper.</p>



<p> The vaginal hole tightened up as it was convulsing.</p>



<p> Aisha closed her eyes tightly, and with a voice that sounded like it was being squeezed out from deep in her throat, she said.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith!! Ahhhhh!!!...... Kuhaaaahhh&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;!!!!......&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha climaxed, tensing up her entire body and even her vaginal flesh.</p>



<p> Calling Keith's name, clinging to him.</p>



<p> She climaxed not as a slut, but as a woman.</p>



<p> Aisha had not yet realized that she was truly taken by Keith.</p>



<p> Keith looked at Aisha, who looked at him with vacant eyes.</p>



<p>&quot;You're covered in sweat...... so am I.&quot;</p>



<p> When he said so, he then pulled himself out of Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;I will prepare the bath. Please wait.&quot;</p>



<p> He headed for the bathroom.</p>



<p> Aisha looked sideways and saw that Keith's cock was erect and twitching.</p>



<p> She had noticed that he did not cum inside her.</p>



<p> The current sex is something that only satisfies Aisha.</p>



<p> When this is over...... when morning comes, she will kill Keith. She vowed to do so.</p>



<p> Then, wouldn't it be a good thing to give him one last good look?</p>



<p> When Keith returned after preparing the bath, Aisha was sitting on the bed.</p>



<p> She was on one knee, the other leg outstretched.</p>



<p> The bloodshot pink of her brown middle crack is exposed.</p>



<p>&quot;A... Aisha?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Kei... Keith, in that state... m-mana hasn't been sent properly... right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Alright... You can use it... but don't be rough with it.&quot;</p>



<p> Then she spreads her vaginal hole with her own hand and showed it to him.</p>



<p> It was different from the last time she begged. It was more like a lover's language.</p>



<p> Keith swallowed hard.</p>



<p> His erect penis twitched and quivered as if in response to Aisha's appearance.</p>



<p>&quot;The bath... it will get cold.&quot;</p>



<p> He smiled and said so, when he approached Aisha, he kissed her lightly and moves forward to a sitting position.</p>



<p> Aisha greeted him with her hands behind her back.</p>



<p> The second time they joined. As his penis is swallowed by the meat hole.</p>



<p>&quot;Whoa... it's amazing. It's undulating from the penetration... and getting wetter.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Kuh! That kind of thing... don't say that, you idiot... uhaaa!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, but, really... kuh! Ah... it looks like it's coming out soon, haha.&quot;</p>



<p>As he was laughing, Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;M-me too... even though I just climaxed... it looks like it's coming again.&quot;</p>



<p> She was beautiful, smiling as she said so.</p>



<p> She moved her hips in a circular motion, making a messy wet sound while making sure that the joints were visible.</p>



<p> The glans rubbed against the vaginal flesh, and soon the feeling of ejaculation rose.</p>



<p> He held back a lot during the earlier penetration, so he was nearing his limit.</p>



<p>&quot;Haa, haa! Ahh!! Keith, are you feeling good? Inside me?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, kuh!! Very...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see... it feels good.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha looks happy.</p>



<p> Keith concentrates on the movement of his hips.</p>



<p> Soon, an irresistible feeling rushes up to his waist.</p>



<p>&quot;A-Aisha! It's coming out... kuh, w-where should I put it out?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha was puzzled for a moment, then.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah, eh... inside... it's okay. The ovulation day... is a long way off.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Is that okay?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yeah... Keith. Let it out. Inside me...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Then, I won't hesitate...!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith began to grind his hips, and.</p>



<p>&quot;Ugh! Whoa!!!! Ah!!!&quot;</p>



<p> He thrust his hips all the way in and spurted the seed juice into Aisha.</p>



<p>She felt the warmth of it on her belly.</p>



<p>&quot;Uu... ah... hot!... awesome, Keith... this is amazing.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha muttered to herself as she held her stomach.</p>



<p> After ejaculating, he pulled back his hips and pulled out his penis, and thick semen came pouring out.</p>



<p>&quot;Amazing, it's coming out...&quot;</p>



<p> It was an amazing amount just for her.</p>



<p> When Keith smiled at her for accepting it, a pillow flew out.</p>



<p> Bufu*! When he received the pillow on his face.</p>



<p>&quot;D-don't get me wrong!! We're playing lovers, so I don't have a choice!! Really, don't get me wrong!!!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha yelled at him and headed for the bathroom.</p>



<p> She went to the bathroom, feeling Keith's eyes on her as he smiled behind her.</p>



<p> For the first time, she felt like she was being &quot;embraced&quot;.</p>



<p> She had no idea it would feel so good and satisfying.</p>



<p> Aisha despised those who were love-crazed, but if that thing was to be given to her all the time, she didn't know what she would do.</p>



<p> It was a feeling of satisfaction.</p>



<p> When she returned to the room after taking a bath and changing clothes, Keith was sleeping.</p>



<p> She looked at the side table and saw that there was a magic tool, the copy crystal.</p>



<p> The fact that it was not in the same position as before suggests that Keith must have moved it.</p>



<p> She touched it fearfully.</p>



<p> It did not teleport.</p>



<p> Keith had kept his promise.</p>



<p> A smile broke from her mouth.</p>



<p> Aisha did not know whether it was the relief of knowing that she had the magic tool in her possession or the joy of knowing that Keith had proven he was a man of his word.</p>



<p> Anyway, now she has it.</p>



<p> With that in mind, she picked up her rapier and sliced the magic tool in half.</p>



<p> The magic tool made a noise and broke. She felt that it was safe.</p>



<p> After that, she turned to Keith. Keith was still asleep.</p>



<p> She turned the tip of the rapier toward Keith.</p>



<p> If she killed Keith, that was the end.</p>



<p> No one would know about her own perversity and Naia-sama's perversity will disappear from this world.</p>



<p> There will be no more worries!!</p>



<p> With that thought, she raised the rapier.</p>



<p> At that moment, something shouted in her head. &quot;Don't kill him&quot;.</p>



<p> Why? For what reason?</p>



<p> The reasons why one should kill are innumerable. Then what are the reasons why one shouldn't kill?</p>



<p> Aisha spat.</p>



<p> That's right. Keith is the court mage.</p>



<p> Wouldn't it be bad if he suddenly died or disappeared?</p>



<p> Wouldn't it unnecessarily disrupt the country?</p>



<p> That's no good.</p>



<p> That's right. That's no good.</p>



<p> That's why...... one has to make proper preparations so that they won't be in trouble if Keith suddenly disappears.</p>



<p> Until that preparation is done, she must not kill Keith.</p>



<p> Aisha's face was smiling when she came to that realization, but she didn't realize it.</p>



<p> Aisha sheathed her rapier and put it back.</p>



<p> She &quot;had no choice&quot; but to lie down next to Keith to rest for a few hours before the morning.</p>



<p>&quot;Sleeping in another person's bed... this good for nothing guy.&quot;</p>



<p> She muttered to herself and gently put her hand on Keith's body.</p>



<p> Keith, however, had decided to sleep, dripping with cold sweat.</p>



<p> While hiding his staff under his body so that Aisha would not see it.</p>



<p> If he was about to be killed, he planned to return to his room by teleportation.</p>



<p> The magic tool he gave to Aisha was the real thing, by the way. It was the real thing, but he kept a copy of it.</p>



<p> The method is simple. If the device itself can't be copied, all one has to do is play the video and copy it.</p>



<p> The quality of the image will be poor, but it won't be unwatchable. Of course, it can also be used to threaten people.</p>



<p> He was going to use it this time if he was about to be killed, but it looks like he won the bet.</p>



<p> Aisha completely likes the lovey-dovey situation.</p>



<p> He preferred the disordered Aisha, but that can be worked out in time.</p>



<p>(But still, all this flirting is exhausting.)</p>



<p> Keith, with the aftermath of winning the bet and Aisha sleeping happily next to him, started to fall asleep.</p>









<p>...</p>









<p> The next morning, Keith was woken up just before five o'clock.</p>



<p> With a drowsy eye, Aisha urged him to return to his room.</p>



<p> Like what happened yesterday didn't happen.</p>



<p> However, Keith decided to go back to his room, assuming that the fact that he was not dead was proof that everything was fine.</p>



<p> He got dressed and went to the door.</p>



<p>&quot;Don't let the patrolling soldiers see you.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I understand.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...And, if you decided to come here again, you'd better let me know in advance...... you can't just show up so suddenly.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Don't get me wrong! I'm a substitute for Naia-sama!! Yes, I'm a substitute!! That's why it can't be helped! Understand!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...I understand.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;And um... and... when we do it... don't be rough, okay?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith hugged Aisha and kissed her.</p>



<p>&quot;Yes. I'll be gentle. Aisha-sama.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Aisha... is good... when it's only us.&quot;</p>



<p> In Keith's chest, Aisha said so.</p>



<p> She saw Keith off as he left and began to get ready for the morning.</p>



<p> She went to Naia's room at 7:30 as usual.</p>



<p> At almost eight o'clock, the maids arrived. Berna, standing next to Aisha, whispered to her.</p>



<p>&quot;You're in a good mood.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I-I don't think so.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see... ara? How rare. You're wearing a ring. You usually don't wear any kind of jewelry because you say it's too much of a distraction.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha hastily hid her right hand.</p>



<p>&quot;I-It's not like that!! This is... a memento of my father's! I found it yesterday! Then...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>



<p> Berna said nothing more.</p>



<p> There was only an embarrassed Aisha.</p>



<p> It was eight o'clock.</p>
