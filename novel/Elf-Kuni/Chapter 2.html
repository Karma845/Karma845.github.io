<h3>Chapter 2: Female Knight, Sulking
</h3>





<p>  Aisha woke up a little before five o'clock.</p>





<p> Due to a long-standing habit, her body naturally wakes up at this time without the use of an alarm.</p>





<p> She opens her eyes and notices that she is holding something.</p>





<p> It was a man's arm.</p>





<p> She was naked with nothing on, and she was sleeping with a man's arm pressed against her breasts.</p>





<p> The owner of that arm was, of course, Keith.</p>





<p> When she looked at his face, she saw that Keith was sleeping with a silly look on his face.</p>





<p> When he came to her suddenly at midnight last night, she said, &quot;Tell me in advance! I have plans too!&quot; and he said, &quot;I'm sorry. I just wanted to see Aisha&quot;, she was shocked as if something had pierced her chest, and she let him in the room as it was.</p>





<p> After that, it was like an avalanche, as they kissed while drinking the alcohol he had brought, and then they fell into the act of supplying him with mana.</p>





<p> It's always like that these days.</p>





<p> She thought it was going to get sore.</p>





<p> She knew she shouldn't allow this to happen.</p>





<p> But when Keith called her &quot;Aisha&quot; and caressed her tenderly, her heart can't reject it.</p>





<p>&quot;What am I gonna do to you... you lowlife.&quot;</p>





<p> She whispered to the sleeping Keith in a sullen tone.</p>





<p> But there is no sense of rejection or disgust in them as before.</p>





<p> As she tightened her hold on Keith's arm a little more, her gaze drifted downwards.</p>





<p> Keith's penis was in a morning erection, making a tent under the bedsheets.</p>





<p> It made her feel lustful.</p>





<p> It was something Aisha would never have done before.</p>





<p> She reached under the bedsheets and gently gripped his erected penis with her hand.</p>





<p>&quot;Nnhh...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith moaned.</p>





<p> Is he awake? She looked at him, but he was still asleep.</p>





<p> Relieved, she started to move her fingers.</p>





<p> When she twirled her fingers, his penis twitched and reacted. She found it interesting.</p>





<p>&quot;This, this, this always scares me.&quot;</p>





<p> She continued caressing the penis while talking in a voice that would not wake Keith up.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh... ah...&quot;</p>





<p> It was unbearably amusing to her, hearing Keith raise his voice.</p>





<p> The trembling of the penis soon became stronger and stronger.</p>





<p>&quot;Gonna surrender? Fuu, how pitiful. The thing that was tormenting me......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... What... are you doing?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Uhii!?&quot;</p>





<p> The sudden voice took her by surprise.</p>





<p> When she looked, Keith was awake. It's not surprising after all that.</p>





<p> Aisha tried to remove her hand from his penis in a panic, but Keith stopped her with his own hand.</p>





<p> Aisha's hand, wrapped by Keith's hand, was still holding his penis.</p>





<p>&quot;T-this is! I-It's not what you think!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha tried desperately to find an excuse, but she can't think of a good one.</p>





<p>&quot;Not? What is? You're playing a prank on a man's morning wood, Aisha.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'm not! It's not a prank... I mean, after all we did yesterday, you're getting big again! So, you know...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Oh, you got interested and checked it out.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, that's right!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't think so&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith got up and climbed on top of Aisha.</p>





<p> He did not put his weight on it but put enough pressure on it so that she would not escape.</p>





<p> He rubbed and licked Aisha's breasts as she squealed, &quot;Kyaa!&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;Hey! Don't! Nhh! It's morning, you know!! What are you, uhaa!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Even though it's morning, chu, chu, hamu, hamu, Aisha is playing a prank, rero, rero, on someone's cock.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's not! Ahh! I, haa!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith took his mouth off her hardening nipples and raised himself up, showing his erect penis to Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;It's Aisha's fault I'm like this...... what are you going to do about it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It was like that when I woke up!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;But it was Aisha who made it uncontrollable.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...It's morning, you know.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Is that...... a no?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith asks, sounding like an abandoned dog in the rain.</p>





<p> Aisha made a slightly grumpy voice.</p>





<p>&quot;Just once... okay?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith nodded &quot;yes&quot; to her words and began to caress Aisha.</p>





<p> The caresses she received on her body, which was still a little fuzzy from sleep, felt nice and fluffy.</p>





<p> He gently rubbed her nipples while sucking them like a baby.</p>





<p> Aisha's large, taut breasts changed shape in Keith's hands as he sucked and squeezed them.</p>





<p> While enjoying it, Keith rubbed his erect penis against Aisha's leg.</p>





<p> He was letting Aisha know that he was ready for battle.</p>





<p> Then he brought one hand down and touched her pussy.</p>





<p> It's not wet, but it's already warm.</p>





<p> He gently caressed the clitoris in Aisha's favorite manner.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh, nnhh...&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha rubbed her legs together.</p>





<p> In between, he was caressing the clitoris, gradually shifting its position down, a little at a time.</p>





<p> Eventually, the tip of his middle finger touched the pussy hole and sank inside.</p>





<p>&quot;Haa...&quot;</p>





<p> The pleasure is not rough, but easy to accept, and it gradually relaxes Aisha's body.</p>





<p> With the birds already chirping outside, the caresses that she was being engrossed in seemed to be doing something somewhat naughty.</p>





<p> That raised Aisha's lust.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha, it's getting really wet...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said as he let his fingers, soaked with love juices, rubbed inside her vagina.</p>





<p>&quot;Haa... nhh!... Because... it feels good.&quot;</p>





<p> Her voice was sweet and rough.</p>





<p>&quot;Can I insert it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.&quot;</p>





<p> After making sure Aisha nodded, Keith moved his body and let Aisha hold her legs.</p>





<p> With her hands around her knees, Aisha widened and exposed her vagina and positioned herself to receive Keith.</p>





<p> The pink inner flesh stirred obscenely, splitting the silver pubic hair.</p>





<p> He poked the tip of his penis into the hole and entered all at once.</p>





<p>&quot;Ahh... there it is...&quot;</p>





<p> A voice leaked.</p>





<p> Aisha closes her eyes.</p>





<p>&quot;Haaa... nghh... haa.&quot;</p>





<p> The two of them remained silent for a while.</p>





<p> Their fuzzy mind is slowly awakened while checking their body temperature transmitted by each genital.</p>





<p> Then they quietly began to grind their hips.</p>





<p> It was not a serious, rough sex.</p>





<p> Doing it slowly while checking each other.</p>





<p> Keith kissed Aisha as he covered her. And Aisha accepted.</p>





<p> Their tongues intertwine and their hips move together, and soon their voices start leaking out.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, ah, nhh, nhh, nhh... kuh.&quot;</p>





<p> The soft vaginal flesh is even softer than before, and it moves like it has a will and is entangled around Keith's penis.</p>





<p> Keith also responded to that stimulus.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu, guh! Ah, nnh.&quot;</p>





<p> Both of them are breathing erratically and moaning, as they are desperately seeking each other.</p>





<p> The next moment, as their hips moved forward, their speed became faster and faster, and they both moaned.</p>





<p>&quot;Guaa!! Sorry... I'm, cumming!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said so and made a scream.</p>





<p> A hot liquid overflowed inside Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;Kuh... ah... hot... semen...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh!... nhh... that felt good...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith looked at Aisha's face as he thrust his hips into her.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry... I climaxed alone.&quot;</p>





<p> He smiled shyly.</p>





<p> And Aisha said.</p>





<p>&quot;Did it feel good?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Very.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Okay, then it's good.&quot;</p>





<p> She smiled back at him and put her lips on his.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p> Aisha is smiling faintly, turning red as she recalls what happened earlier.</p>





<p> Looking at her face, Berna asked.</p>





<p>&quot;Did something good happen to you?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha is startled by those words.</p>





<p>&quot;There's no way!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looked around in a panic, her voice too loud, and talked again.</p>





<p>&quot;There is no such good... thing.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>





<p> Berna said nothing more.</p>





<p> It was Berna's belief not to get too deeply into others' affairs.</p>





<p> Aisha, however, was a little perplexed when she was confronted with the fact that she was in her fantasies.</p>





<p> I'm daydreaming? Me? That's absurd!</p>





<p> She desperately denied Berna's words.</p>





<p> Yes, that's right. I'm not daydreaming.</p>





<p> I'm just smiling at Keith's incompetency.</p>





<p> After all, I hold all the rights to Keith's life.</p>





<p> If I wanted to kill him, I could do so at any time.</p>





<p> Keith visiting Aisha's room and drowning in Aisha's body without knowing it is funny, pathetic, and...... adorable......?</p>





<p> No, it's not!</p>





<p> Aisha shook her head.</p>





<p> That's not true. It's not.</p>





<p> She told herself that, took a sigh, and looked forward.</p>





<p> She had to concentrate on her work.</p>





<p> It was already eight o'clock. Yes, she must focus.</p>





<p> Aisha entered Naia's room with the maids who had gathered at the door.</p>





<p> Naia's schedule for the day consisted of lessons in ceremonial etiquette in the morning and singing lessons in the afternoon.</p>





<p> Singing is important for elves to use high-level spirit magic.</p>





<p> But apart from that, Naia loved to sing.</p>





<p> So even though she didn't have lessons from Keith today, she seemed to be enjoying it.</p>





<p> After a day of watching, Aisha watched Naia go to bed as it was time for her to sleep, then bowed her head and turned to leave the room.</p>





<p> That's when a voice called out to her.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It looks like you're feeling better.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?... ah.&quot;</p>





<p> She was puzzled when she realized that Naia is referring to the time when she was having a hard time thinking about what would happen to her because of Keith.</p>





<p> She can't say that she was feeling better because she made out with Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;U-um, well.&quot;</p>





<p> She was looking around for the right words.</p>





<p>&quot;That's good. Get better.&quot;</p>





<p> She almost cried when she saw Naia's face smiling at her like that. But.</p>





<p>&quot;I was right to consult with Keith-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> Consult with Keith? Why is Keith's name mentioned here?</p>





<p> Her heart raced at the sudden mention of Keith's name.</p>





<p>&quot;Um, what do you mean by...&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha asked.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p> An idiot was walking down the corridor, humming a tune.</p>





<p> Keith.</p>





<p> The purpose, of course, is to go to Aisha's room.</p>





<p> Two days in a row is physically demanding, but today, he was on his way to using the finished product that he had requested.</p>





<p>&quot;I really need to start making some energy pills ~ ~ ~.&quot;</p>





<p> He skipped down the corridor with a smile on his face.</p>





<p> The reason why the soldiers didn't get suspicious is because he is wearing the [Marici Heavenly Cloak] that Keith took from Aisha.</p>





<p> Recently, he always uses it when he goes to Aisha's room in the middle of the night.</p>





<p> When he arrived in front of Aisha's room, Keith switches his manner to the character he created.</p>





<p> He knocks on the door.</p>





<p> However, there is no reply.</p>





<p> The door, which would normally open immediately, did not.</p>





<p> Thinking it's strange, he knocks again.</p>





<p> It still didn't open, so he wondered if she was asleep.</p>





<p>Though, he was sure that she had come back at this hour.</p>





<p> So, there was a possibility that she was sleeping or taking a bath.</p>





<p> While he was wondering what to do, the door opened.</p>





<p>&quot;What, you're awake?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith froze when he saw Aisha's face while saying that.</p>





<p> She is glaring.</p>





<p> She is glaring at him.</p>





<p>&quot;U-um...&quot;</p>





<p> He was about to say something, but.</p>





<p>&quot;What do you want...&quot;</p>





<p> What's going on? What happened?</p>





<p> That's what he wanted to ask.</p>





<p> What happened to that mood we had this morning?</p>





<p> Why has my likability suddenly dropped so low??</p>





<p> Panicking, he tried to figure out why, but he has no idea.</p>





<p> But he thought it would be best to get into the room first.</p>





<p>&quot;For... now, um.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;We did it this morning...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yeah, but.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Sigh*&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha returned to her room, leaving the door open without saying a word.</p>





<p> Apparently, he was told to do as he pleased. Keith obediently enters the room.</p>





<p> Aisha was wearing a long, thigh-length sweater.</p>





<p> She was probably wearing hot pants underneath, but they were hidden by the hem of the sweater, giving the impression that she was not wearing them, which was erotic.</p>





<p> The color was cream, which combined well with her brown skin.</p>





<p> Forgetting Aisha's sullenness, he put his things on the floor, hugged her from behind, and said.</p>





<p>&quot;It looks good on you. It's cute.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Enough.&quot;</p>





<p> He was interrupted when he said it was cute.</p>





<p> Aisha untied herself from Keith's arm and said.</p>





<p>&quot;Enough with that words... don't worry about it anymore.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Um... what do you mean?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Don't pay me any mind. Use me as you like.&quot;</p>





<p> She's been calling him by his name until this morning and now it's back to &quot;you&quot;.</p>





<p> And although the way she spoke was different from the disgust and contempt she had at first, it still had a distant ring to it.</p>





<p> Aisha lay down on the bed and said nothing more.</p>





<p>&quot;...What's wrong? Did I do something?&quot;</p>





<p> It was so unnatural and inexplicable that Keith had to ask.</p>





<p> Aisha on the bed bit her lip a little, then.</p>





<p>&quot;Naia-sama told me everything.&quot;</p>





<p> She only said that.</p>





<p> Keith's heart nearly stopped.</p>





<p> Hear? All of it?</p>





<p> That I'm still doing it to her using her ass??</p>





<p> No, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>





<p> If that were the case, Aisha would have killed Keith by now.</p>





<p> But it hasn't happened.</p>





<p> Heard? Heard what?</p>





<p>&quot;Hear... what is?&quot;</p>





<p> He asked with a dry mouth.</p>





<p>&quot;...... Naia-sama asked you, right? To check me out.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ha?&quot;</p>





<p> The words, which were so far from what he thought, made him let out a silly sound.</p>





<p>&quot;You don't have to fool me. Naia-sama told me that when I was having trouble...... because of you, Naia-sama asked you to check on me.&quot;</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&quot;Then the next time you came, you became kind to me... I know. You were nice to me because Naia-sama asked you, right?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said nothing.</p>





<p> Aisha, deciding that his reaction indicated that it was true, chuckled to herself.</p>





<p>&quot;Even though, I didn't know that, I didn't even doubt your kindness to me... which is ridiculous.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha continues to look away from Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;You... calling me cute or that you like me... seriously... I... I... look like an idiot.&quot;</p>





<p> Then, covering her face with her hands.</p>





<p>&quot;Everything... everything, it's all because Naia-sama ordered you... uu...&quot;</p>





<p> Then her shoulders started to tremble.</p>





<p> Aisha thought so, that all the favors that were directed at her were actually orders from someone else.</p>





<p> In fact, it was from a more ghastly idea, but Aisha, who didn't know it at all, cried because of her feelings for the first time in her life.</p>





<p> Like a girl.</p>





<p> Keith, who almost laughed at her appearance like that of a child, however, straightened his expression and said.</p>





<p>&quot;Do you really think so?&quot;</p>





<p> He asked while sitting on the bed.</p>





<p>&quot;Do you really think I'm kind to Aisha... because the princess ordered me?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... It's because of that... right?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't think so... it just happened that when I realized that Aisha liked it gentle, the princess asked me to do so.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... It's a lie.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's not a lie.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's absolutely not true.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith gently stroked Aisha's head.</p>





<p>&quot;You don't trust me?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... You'll try to trick me like that again... always, always tricking me... you're going to mess me up... I don't trust you anymore.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith stood up without saying a word to Aisha, who refused to face him.</p>





<p> Aisha felt even sadder when she realized that he couldn't say anything because it was the truth.</p>





<p> She could feel that Keith was silently looking down at her.</p>





<p> But she had no intention of trusting or believing him anymore, no matter what he said or did.</p>





<p> That was what she had decided.</p>





<p> To such Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;...You're wearing the ring, right?&quot;</p>





<p> At these words, Aisha looked at her right ring finger.</p>





<p> The mithril ring that Keith gave her.</p>





<p> The ring had already become a part of her body.</p>





<p>&quot;I-I'll return this thing!! You probably made this thing to get me in a good mood anyway!!&quot;</p>





<p> She said and tried to remove it.</p>





<p>&quot;The Princess asked me to look after Aisha two days before I gave it. I can't make that in two days.&quot;</p>





<p> Indeed, the ring was so elaborate in design that it was unlikely to be made in two days.</p>





<p> But Aisha, on the other hand.</p>





<p>&quot;Then, you made it to give it to someone else!! And you gave it to me as if it was for me!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;The size should match Aisha.&quot;</p>





<p> That's right.</p>





<p> The ring is completely fitted on Aisha's finger.</p>





<p> It is hard to believe that it was made to fit someone else's finger.</p>





<p>&quot;I made it to give it to Aisha. I made it just for Aisha. I didn't lie about the time and effort I put into it. I have actual proof.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looked at her finger.</p>





<p> A small, beautiful ring was shining.</p>





<p>&quot;If you still don't trust me...... I understand. I won't come here anymore...... and I won't...... speak to you anymore.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled sadly.</p>





<p>&quot;It's fine. I'll keep my promise... and as for the mana, well...... I'll get down on my knees and ask someone to do it.......&quot;</p>





<p> With that, he left the room with his things.</p>





<p> But he stopped a little in front of the door.</p>





<p>&quot;Then...... this is the end, right?&quot;</p>





<p> Then he left the room.</p>





<p>&quot;The... end?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha muttered to herself in the room where Keith had disappeared, on the bed where his scent lingered.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p>&quot;Come, come, come, come, come, come, come...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Master, what have you been mumbling about all this time, nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p> Lou asked Keith, who was sitting on a chair and staring at the door of the room.</p>





<p> Keith did not look away from the door for even a second.</p>





<p>&quot;Wait a minute! My future night life is at stake right now!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I've got it all set up... the problem is whether it will work after that... come, come, come, come...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't know what to do to this guy, nyaa.&quot;</p>





<p> Lou said so and began eating the crunchy-type cat food.</p>





<p> At that moment, there is a knock at the door with a very unreliable sound.</p>





<p>&quot;Nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p> When Lou looked up.</p>





<p>&quot;Yesss!!! It's here!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith made a gut-punch pose and stood up.</p>





<p> He then switched off the muffling tool and headed for the door.</p>





<p> He slaps his grinning face a couple of times to fix it and slowly opens the door.</p>





<p>&quot;... Aisha.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said in a deliberately surprised voice.</p>





<p> Aisha was standing in front of the door.</p>





<p> Aisha's face broke into a sobbing mess, and she jumped into Keith's chest.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry... I'm sorry...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith gently closed Aisha's lips with his own as she apologized in a voice that sounded like it was scraping from the back of her throat.</p>





<p> He then wiped her tears away with his fingers.</p>





<p>&quot;I knew...... that you would believe me.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha cried again and buried her face in his chest as Keith smiled at her.</p>





<p> As he hugged Aisha, Keith struck a gut-punch pose and made one of the rare smug faces.</p>





<p> There it was, the worst lowlife.</p>
