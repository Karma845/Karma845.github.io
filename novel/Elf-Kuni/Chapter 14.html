<h3>Chapter 14: Female Knight's Determination</h3>

<p>Aisha couldn&apos;t believe what she was seeing.</p>





<p>It wasn&apos;t that she couldn&apos;t believe it. It was that she did not want to admit it.</p>





<p>She felt that if she admitted it, something important inside her would be destroyed at once.</p>





<p>Therefore, she desperately tried to deny reality.</p>





<p>Was it a dream? Delusion? Illusion magic? Hypnotic magic?</p>





<p>It doesn&apos;t matter. She wanted it to be any of them.</p>





<p>It better be one of those!!</p>





<p>But the smell, the sound, the breeze hitting on her skin told her that the scene is real.</p>





<p>The precious, lovely Naia...... That Naia that she would protect even at the cost of her own life.</p>





<p>She is dressed like a beast and being violated by a mage.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!! Keith-samaa!! It feels so good!! Doggy style!! It&apos;s so amazing!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Uh! Princess!! You like the doggy style huh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I like it!! I like this!! I love it!!! Deep inside!!! Cock deep inside!!!&quot;</p>





<p>Dressed like a whore, sounding like a whore, and looking more obscene than a whore......</p>





<p>Is she being raped?</p>





<p>No...... That&apos;s not the face of a woman being raped, that&apos;s the face of a female welcoming a male.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhoooo!! Here! It&apos;s here!! That white color is here!! My mind is turning white!!!&quot;</p>





<p>With her nipples fully erect, love juices dripping from her crotch, and her hair shaking...... Naia is delighted.</p>





<p>&quot;Amazing cock!! Keith-sama&apos;s cock!! Keith-samaaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Princess!! It&apos;s coming out!! The medicine is coming out!!!! The cock&apos;s medicine is coming ooout!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Let it out!! Please let it out!! Let the medicine out deep inside my stomach!!!&quot;</p>





<p>She felt nauseous.</p>





<p>She felt dizzy.</p>





<p>Her ears are ringing.</p>





<p>The reason she didn&apos;t collapse on the spot was so that no one would know she was there.</p>





<p>Why is she looking at this nightmarish scene?</p>





<p>Does she have to watch it?</p>





<p>Let&apos;s go back to two days ago.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p>In the midst of the crowd, Naia nervously looked at her palm.</p>





<p>Could she do it?</p>





<p>Sweat slowly flowed out and her breathing became erratic.</p>





<p>So she looked for Keith.</p>





<p>The black-robed mage standing in his place as the court mage.</p>





<p>He smiled at her when she look at him.</p>





<p>&quot;Do your best.&quot;</p>





<p>Seeing Keith&apos;s mouth move like that, gave her courage and confidence.</p>





<p>She took a deep breath and calmed her mind.</p>





<p>Just as she always does. Just like when she&apos;s practicing.</p>





<p>She told herself, and begin to gather mana into her palm.</p>





<p>She could feel the warm flow of power solidify on her palm.</p>





<p>When it became a mass, she put the magic script of wind on it.</p>





<p>The mana is then converted into magic. The wind lifted Naia&apos;s light body up into the air, albeit only a little.</p>





<p>The platinum hair that flew up, sparkled and looked very beautiful.</p>





<p>When she landed on the ground, Naia breathed a sigh of relief and bowed her head, which was immediately greeted with cheers and applause.</p>





<p>As Naia was accepting the applause with a happy and embarrassed look on her face, Queen Mia came running to Naia.</p>





<p>And hugged Naia&apos;s small body tightly.</p>





<p>&quot;You did well. It&apos;s great... really.&quot;</p>





<p>Mia&apos;s eyes were filled with tears.</p>





<p>&quot;Mother.&quot;</p>





<p>Naia was also happy and hugged her mother&apos;s body back.</p>





<p>Mashua, her father, gazed dazzled at the scene as he walked over to Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith. I&apos;m very grateful to you for giving Naia magic in such a short period of time. As Naia&apos;s father, I thank you. Thank you so much.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, what I did is insignificant. It is all due to her innate talent.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hahaha, don&apos;t be so modest. Let everyone applaud my daughter and the mage once again!!&quot;</p>





<p>The king&apos;s voice was heard by his subjects, and they applauded.</p>





<p>The princess, who had never been able to use magic, now used it, albeit only a little.</p>





<p>Some of the vassals who had been able to use magic for many years and the maids who knew of Naia&apos;s suffering were even in tears.</p>





<p>However, there were more than a few who did not find it amusing.</p>





<p>They were happy that Naia was able to use magic, but they were annoyed that it was with the help of a human. Such are the people.</p>





<p>And among those who were not amused was Aisha.</p>





<p>She frowned and stared at Keith with a bitter expression on her face.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p>&quot;Generally! The king is too lenient with that mage!!&quot;</p>





<p>A maid offered a cup of tea to Aisha, who complained as though she were drunk.</p>





<p>She gulped it down and said, &quot;Puhaa!&quot; and gasped for breath.</p>





<p>&quot;Bringing a human being of unknown origin into the palace, and now he&apos;s Naia-sama&apos;s teacher! What if it&apos;s a mistake!?&quot;</p>





<p>As she poured the second cup of tea into Aisha&apos;s teacup, Berna, the lady&apos;s maid, said.</p>





<p>&quot;But isn&apos;t it true that the princess is now able to use magic?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hmph! Naia-sama is a brilliant woman! She would have been able to use magic sooner or later without the help of that human!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Haa.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;As if it was thanks to that human... Ahhhhh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>As she looked at Aisha, who was shouting and drinking tea, Berna said nothing more, thinking that no matter what she said, in the end, she wouldn&apos;t accept Keith, as usual.</p>





<p>The two of them were in the waiting room near Naia&apos;s room.</p>





<p>While Naia is studying, Berna is usually in the waiting room.</p>





<p>However, since Aisha is on guard duty, it is normal for her to stay by Naia&apos;s side even when she is studying.</p>





<p>Only when it&apos;s Keith&apos;s turn to teach her that she was kicked out.</p>





<p>In the beginning, she always stood in front of the door, but Naia told her to stay further away from the door, so she ended up staying there.</p>





<p>From there, they could rush to the door if they heard anything suspicious, and they could also keep an eye on anyone trying to get to Naia&apos;s room.</p>





<p>So she&apos;s always letting out her frustration or complaining, and Berna is getting tired of it.</p>





<p>&quot;The problem is that Naia-sama hid from me that she was able to use magic in the first place! I have to know everything about Naia-sama! And yet, she kept it a secret...... I&apos;m sure that mage must have told her to hide it from me...... I&apos;m sure that&apos;s what he did! Aaah!!</p>





<p>She would be beautiful if she didn&apos;t bark...... Berna sipped her tea as she thought that.</p>





<p>&quot;I was just about to say a few words to her earlier, but she went to the mage and is still studying magic! I wanted to praise Naia-sama too! I wanted to say well done!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I forgot, the magic stone in the bathtub is about to run out.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Are you listening!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, yes. I&apos;m listening.&quot;</p>





<p>Meanwhile, in Naia&apos;s room.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess. You did a great job today!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Haa... yes, I did my best!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Both the king and the queen were so happy... I was impressed too.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Me! Too!! I&apos;m happy... I&apos;m so happy!!!&quot;</p>





<p>Keith looked at Naia&apos;s broken words with a grin.</p>





<p>Naia is now naked and straddling Keith.</p>





<p>Of course, while being penetrated.</p>





<p>She moved her body around to find a comfortable spot, but in the process, Keith thrusts up from below, causing her to scream each time he does so.</p>





<p>Holding hands with Keith and putting her weight on him, her hips would slightly jump and sway.</p>





<p>But the biggest problem was Naia&apos;s body.</p>





<p>Naia now had letters written all over her body.</p>





<p>They are not the same as the letters used to correct the mana channels.</p>





<p>They are secret letters that each magic society has developed on its own.</p>





<p>The letters were created so that only those who belonged to the magic society could decipher the writings.</p>





<p>Keith used them to write obscene words on Naia&apos;s body, such as &quot;I love cock,&quot; &quot;slut elf princess,&quot; and &quot;cum addict&quot;.</p>





<p>He tricked Naia by telling her that he would use her mana to write spells on her tired body.</p>





<p>The erotic graffiti princess created in this way is penetrated from below while thoroughly enjoying it, using a cushion as a pillow.</p>





<p>Naia, who had no way of knowing that such a thing was written on her body, was trying to cum with all her might to send mana to Keith&apos;s penis.</p>





<p>She was told a lie that if she climaxed with his penis inside her, she could send the accumulated mana to his penis more efficiently.</p>





<p>So it&apos;s okay to feel good. It&apos;s better to cum.</p>





<p>Thinking so, she kept moving her hips.</p>





<p>&quot;Fua! Fua! Fuaa!! Ah!! There!!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia found a nice spot, squeezed her crotch shut, and wiggled her hips so that the cock will hit that spot.</p>





<p>&quot;It feels so good there!! Keith-sama!! There, it&apos;s good!! Ahyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Oh!! Kuh!! Princess, it&apos;s intense!! The princess is really a slut.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Slu, hyaa!! Slut? Nkuh!! Nhh!! What is that?? Ahhh!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;By slut... I mean a woman who is very good at sending mana.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I&apos;m, hyauaah!! a slut?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes. Please tell it yourself. I&apos;m a slutty elf.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hahyaa!! Ukyaa!! Ukyu !! I&apos;m a slutty elf!! Nhaa!! A slutty elf!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That&apos;s right!! Nahh!! Say a slutty elf that loves cock!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ahhhhhh!!! Slut, nkuhh!! Slutty elf!! Cock!! Love cock!! Keith-sama&apos;s cooock!!! Nhaaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p>Squeezing Keith&apos;s hand and straining her legs.</p>





<p>&quot;Cum!!! Pussy cumming!!! Hyaaaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p>Keith felt her vagina twitch and spasm.</p>





<p>The sensation was so good.</p>





<p>&quot;Ohoou!! Nghh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>While raising his voice, he desperately endured the ejaculation, laid down Nia&apos;s body, and pulls out his penis, bringing it to her face as she gasps for air with an upturned face.</p>





<p>Then, he worked on his cock, which was erected with reddish-black blood vessels showing on it, and let out his semen on Naia&apos;s face.</p>





<p>&quot;Oh!! Oooohhh...!!! Kuh ~ ~ ~! Haaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p>The semen gushing from the tip of his cock stained Naia&apos;s pretty face.</p>





<p>Naia, with thick semen, was beautiful and lewd.</p>





<p>&quot;Medicine... a lot on my face... hot... haa.&quot;</p>





<p>Naia happily scooped up and licked the semen from her face with her fingers.</p>





<p>Looking down at the elf princess with obscene graffiti all over her body, Keith&apos;s penis began to harden once more due to satisfaction and excitement.</p>











<p>...</p>











<p>&quot;Uh oh...&quot;</p>





<p>Keith said in the bathroom.</p>





<p>He had washed Naia&apos;s body and removed the water-soluble ink, but her skin had turned slightly red in the shape of the letters.</p>





<p>The ink was gentle to Keith&apos;s skin, but it seemed to be irritant to the soft skin of the elf princess.</p>





<p>Naia looked at him curiously.</p>





<p>&quot;Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>





<p>Then, he took out a milky lotion for skincare from his bag and applied it all over her body.</p>





<p>Then, as a thank-you for enabling Naia to use magic, he uses a 30-centimeter-long staff made from a manticore tail string that Mashua gave him to use a recovery spell.</p>





<p>A soft warmth enveloped Naia, and the next moment the red rash had disappeared.</p>





<p>Keith breathed a sigh of relief and made a mental note, &quot;I&apos;ll improve the ink&quot;.</p>





<p>After changing Naia&apos;s clothes and cleaning up, Keith left the room.</p>





<p>Aisha saw him from the waiting room and went to Naia&apos;s room.</p>





<p>The room was completely deodorized with magic tools and there was no smell.</p>





<p>&quot;Sniff*... Hmm?&quot;</p>





<p>The nose of the desert elf, a hunter of the desert, caught a strange smell.</p>





<p>&quot;Naia-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hmm? What?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What did you apply on your body?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>It was the smell of milky lotion that Keith had put on her skin to heal the rash.</p>





<p>The sweet smell of the lotion, mixed with several medicinal herbs and magic synthesized substances...... different from Naia&apos;s usual smell, and Aisha&apos;s nose detected it.</p>





<p>When that was pointed out to her.</p>





<p>&quot;T-that&apos;s. Keith-sama, um... um...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Did that mage do something to you!?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, he didn&apos;t!! It&apos;s not that!!!&quot;</p>





<p>It is difficult to determine how much is okay to talk about and how much is not, and Naia mumbled.</p>





<p>&quot;That&apos;s um... a secret to Aisha!&quot;</p>





<p>After saying that, she ran to her desk and started reading a book Keith had left behind, called &quot;Simple Magic you can Learn in just 30 Minutes Today&quot;.</p>





<p>After that, no matter how many times she asked, she was told it was a &quot;secret,&quot; and a seed of doubt began to grow in Aisha&apos;s mind.</p>





<p>What was that mage doing to Naia-sama?</p>





<p>How is he teaching her magic?</p>





<p>Once a question arises, the next question is born in a chain of questions.</p>





<p>Even after returning to her room, it continued.</p>





<p>She heard that some mages were involved in forbidden spells.</p>





<p>What if Keith is giving Naia magic with the help of some forbidden spells......?</p>





<p>The fear of that thought shook Aisha&apos;s body.</p>





<p>She has to find out.</p>





<p>She must be sure!!</p>





<p>But how?</p>





<p>Naia would never show Aisha her lessons with Keith, and there was no way that Keith would use such a terrible evil method in the presence of other people.</p>





<p>Then how?</p>





<p>Alone in the dimly lit room, she remembered her father&apos;s words.</p>





<p>&quot;There are times when a guard must do whatever to protect their lord, even if it is an act that their lord disliked.&quot;</p>





<p>Mashua and Mia welcomed her father, a wandering warrior, and herself, and gave them jobs.</p>





<p>Naia, the daughter of these two, whom Aisha must protect even at the cost of her own life.</p>





<p>What is there to hesitate about?</p>





<p>Even if it is an act out of chivalry, for Naia-sama&apos;s sake!</p>





<p>Aisha made up her mind and pulled out her father&apos;s belongings from his bag.</p>





<p>A black, stained cloak.</p>





<p>It is a magic item called the [Marici Heavenly Cloak].</p>





<p>When his father was young, he fought against the assassination group &quot;Ninja&quot; and robbed one of them.</p>





<p>When wrapped in this cloak, it activates the effect of concealment, which cannot be detected even with the magical eye or sixth sense.</p>





<p>It is a first-class assassination equipment, but Aisha&apos;s father never used it in his life, and he had strictly ordered Aisha not to use it either.</p>





<p>&quot;Father, please forgive me.&quot;</p>





<p>Aisha muttered and put it in her bag.</p>





<p>The next day, it was also another day to take Keith&apos;s lesson.</p>





<p>As usual, a few hours before Keith&apos;s arrival, Naia was so excited and nervous that she didn&apos;t hear what anyone was saying to her.</p>





<p>Aisha, trying to keep a cool head, unlocked the bathroom window that day.</p>





<p>Then, a few minutes before Keith arrived.</p>





<p>&quot;It&apos;s almost time for the mage to arrive. I know it&apos;s a little early, but excuse me.&quot;</p>





<p>Naia wondered why she would leave the room before Keith arrived, but she said she had some business to attend to and left the room.</p>





<p>She took her bag from the waiting room and put on the cloak after making sure no one was looking.</p>





<p>She hid her rapier in the wall and put the kukri knife on her waist instead.</p>





<p>She ran soundlessly down the corridor.</p>





<p>On the way, she passed a few maids, but no one seemed to notice her.</p>





<p>When Aisha reached the bathroom side of Naia&apos;s room, she opened the window and went inside.</p>





<p>She crept toward the living room, trying not to make a sound.</p>





<p>Then she saw it.</p>





<p>The only reason she didn&apos;t scream was because she was stunned.</p>





<p>She was stunned to see Naia kissing the mage.</p>





<p>And it was not a gentle kiss like a child would do.</p>





<p>The two kissed each other with their tongues entwined in a deep kiss.</p>





<p>Aisha&apos;s hand reached for the knife at her waist.</p>





<p>Being insolent to the princess! She was about to run toward him, but.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama... Keith-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>Aisha&apos;s movement was stopped by the sweet voice that Naia produced.</p>





<p>Who is that? Who is that over there? Who is that elf with the flirtatious voice?</p>





<p>Her knees trembled as she couldn&apos;t believe what she was seeing.</p>





<p>And while she was doing so.</p>





<p>&quot;Cock, did you have another buildup after it let out so much medicine yesterday?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, it seems to be gaining strength......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Not good!! We have to hurry! Munch*! Chu! Gucho, gucho!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa!! Instant blowjob...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Rero! Nghh, bero, rero, rero ~ ~...&quot;</p>





<p>She crouched down at Keith&apos;s lower body and sucked the filthy thing between his legs.</p>





<p>&quot;Ooohh... ah, I mustn&apos;t, I forgot.&quot;</p>





<p>Keith pulled a magic tool out of his bag.</p>





<p>He had improved it since then and extended the range of its effect to the entire room.</p>





<p>Just so he could do things while moving around the room, but if he hadn&apos;t done that. Aisha wouldn&apos;t be able to hear Naia&apos;s obscene sounds from where she is.</p>





<p>After that, the lasciviousness continued right in front of Aisha&apos;s eyes.</p>





<p>Naia happily drank up the filth that came out of the filth, took off her clothes, and put her hands on the wall.</p>





<p>Keith was licking her pussy, but when it was now completely ripe, he continued by fucking her.</p>





<p>On a sheet on the floor, they fuck each other like dogs.</p>





<p>Aisha watched as Naia finally climaxed, screaming like an animal.</p>





<p>After the scene was over, Aisha slipped out the door quietly so that they would not notice her as they soaked in the bathtub in the bathroom and made noises of joy.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry... I feel sick... I&apos;ll hand the job over to another knight, please tell Naia-sama that.&quot;</p>





<p>And then she walked away.</p>





<p>She looked so pale and her eyes were like dead fish that Berna was concerned and offered to accompany her, but she refused.</p>





<p>She handed over the job to one of the knights and returned to her room.</p>





<p>She lay still on the bed and thought.</p>





<p>Why? Why?</p>





<p>Why did Naia-sama do that to that lowly being......!</p>





<p>And why didn&apos;t I tear them apart and kill that lowly being?</p>





<p>......Let&apos;s be calm.</p>





<p>If she killed him, others will hear the commotion and come straight to the room.</p>





<p>If that happened, Naia-sama&apos;s state will be revealed.</p>





<p>That&apos;s no good. That&apos;s why she didn&apos;t call anyone. That was right.</p>





<p>But when she was wondering why Naia-sama...... she came up with an idea.</p>





<p>Brainwashing magic.</p>





<p>She had heard that there are wicked groups that manipulate people by drugging and stimulating their brains with magic.</p>





<p>If that was the case, Naia-sama must have been subjected to it.</p>





<p>Slowly and gradually, while pretending to teach her magic, he entangled her like prey in spider threads.</p>





<p>And that dainty, beautiful, and kind lady.......</p>





<p>Just as she was thinking that, there was a knock at the door.</p>





<p>She reached for her rapier and.</p>





<p>&quot;Who is it!!&quot;</p>





<p>She said it in a strong tone.</p>





<p>&quot;It&apos;s me.&quot;</p>





<p>A small voice answered.</p>





<p>&quot;N-Naia... sama?&quot;</p>





<p>She got up in a hurry and opened the door.</p>





<p>There, standing in front of her, instead of the lecherous bitch, was the usual pretty girl.</p>





<p>&quot;W-why did you come to a place like this...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Berna told me that Aisha went back to her room with a very pale face...... are you okay?&quot;</p>





<p>Naia looked up at Aisha with an anxious look on her face.</p>





<p>She took the trouble to show herself, worried about Aisha.</p>





<p>She tried her best to hold back the tears that were threatening to overflow at her kindness.</p>





<p>&quot;I&apos;m fine! I had a little bit of a cold and I didn&apos;t want to infect Naia-sama...... so I&apos;m fine!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I see, I&apos;m glad, but don&apos;t push yourself too hard, okay?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Well then, I&apos;m sorry for disturbing you while you&apos;re resting.&quot;</p>





<p>She waved her hand and watched Naia return back with a knight escort until she is out of sight, then bows her head and closes the door.</p>





<p>In her room alone, Aisha&apos;s face was surprisingly refreshed.</p>





<p>When she took a breath.</p>





<p>&quot;All right, let&apos;s kill that lowlife!&quot;</p>





<p>That&apos;s what she said.</p>
