<h3>Chapter 9: Princess, I Mourn You 1</h3>

<p>In the middle of the night, Lou woke up to the smell.</p>



<p>Getting up, Lou found a yellowish smoke-like substance wafting through the room.</p>



<p>&quot;Funyaa!&quot;</p>



<p>Frowning at the exquisite stench, Lou searched for the source of the smell.</p>



<p>When Lou went to the bathroom, Lou found its master, Keith, sitting on the floor, boiling something in a small [witch pot].</p>



<p>&quot;Master, are you making poo-, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Who would make something like that?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith answered without looking behind him. He was wearing a mask to cover his nose and mouth.</p>



<p>&quot;But it smells so bad. I think my nose is going to bend.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Mana.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What&apos;s inside the pot, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith counted down his fingers to Lou&apos;s question.</p>



<p>&quot;Dragon gallstone, Phoenix&apos;s expelled perit, virgin Dragonute&apos;s menstrual blood, Leviathan&apos;s ambergris, and......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s all Master&apos;s treasure!&quot;</p>



<p>All of the items Keith just mentioned are first-class magic items.</p>



<p>It is even said that if one got one of those items, one could buy a castle.</p>



<p>The reason why Keith has such items is because he took them from the treasury when he was kicked out of the magic society.</p>



<p>He packed his bag with small, expensive items to sell for emergencies.</p>



<p>The treasury was locked in a way that even the best of thieves could not open, but once &quot;Keith the Little Man&quot; got his hands on it, it was not even a challenge.</p>



<p>He&apos;s generously using the items that he couldn&apos;t sell until now.</p>



<p>The amount of the mixture was reduced to about one small bottle, the fire was turned off, and the mithril given by Worland-san, the gardener of the palace, in exchange for a back pain medicine was put in.</p>



<p>&quot;The country of the elves... I have never seen such a high-purity Mithril.&quot;</p>



<p>He put a piece of the mithril in the potion. A sound was heard, and the smoke, an even worse smell wafted into the area.</p>



<p>&quot;My eyes, my eyes――――!!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith was hit in the face with the smoke, and he thrashed around.</p>



<p>Seeing its master, Lou decided to sleep outside today, holding its nose with its paw.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>The next day, Keith went to Naia&apos;s room, ruminating over the scenario he had come up with.</p>



<p>To be honest, he did not think that the scenario he had thought of would work.</p>



<p>However, that was where Naia&apos;s naivete would come in.</p>



<p>He knocked on the door and made a sad face on purpose as he entered the room.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia, who was next to Aisha, rushes over.</p>



<p>Aisha, who had a bitter look on her face, couldn&apos;t utter the words &quot;get out of here&quot;, so she said, &quot;excuse me,&quot; and walked out of the room.</p>



<p>Naia noticed Keith&apos;s dark expression.</p>



<p>&quot;Is something wrong? Are you not feeling okay......?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;N-no... don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</p>



<p>With that said, he turned his head away and began his usual preparations.</p>



<p>Naija frowned and made a confused face.</p>



<p>Keith usually smiles at Naia when he comes into the room, but today his expression is gloomy.</p>



<p>Did I do something to embarrass Keith without my knowledge?</p>



<p>Or did I do something to make him dislike me?</p>



<p>Just thinking about it made her heart pound and her head dizzy with anxiety.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama... Is there something...&quot;</p>



<p>She was afraid to ask, but she was even more afraid not to know about it.</p>



<p>So she mustered up the courage to speak up.</p>



<p>&quot;Well then, I want you to get naked and lie down.&quot;</p>



<p>The procedure was different from usual.</p>



<p>Normally, she would first put on the clothes Keith made for her, then take the medicine, and after that, the treatment.</p>



<p>But today, he wanted to do the treatment right away.</p>



<p>He wanted to get it over with as soon as possible......</p>



<p>He wanted to get away from her as soon as possible......</p>



<p>He doesn&apos;t even want to see her face......</p>



<p>Tears began to well up in her eyes as she thought of that, but she did not want to be thought of as &quot;troublesome&quot; and be hated even more.</p>



<p>So Naia desperately held back her tears and took off her clothes.</p>



<p>She stripped naked and lie down as she had been told.</p>



<p>When she pressed her face against the pillow, tears came out by themselves.</p>



<p>She had been looking forward to spending time with Keith so much, but now it was so hard.</p>



<p>When she thought about what she had done to make Keith dislike her, there were quite a few things that came to mind, and she hated herself for it.</p>



<p>Cursing herself in her mind, Naia shed tears.</p>



<p>Keith, who gave Naia such a sense of uneasiness, smiled when he felt she was wondering what it was.</p>



<p>So far, so good. The trick is working.</p>



<p>With that in mind, he took out the liquid he had made last night.</p>



<p>It was in a small bottle, and its color was poisonous.</p>



<p>&quot;It smells a little, Princess, but it is not harmful to your body, so please bear with it.&quot;</p>



<p>When he called out to her, he did so in the most casual way he can.</p>



<p>He did so on purpose, but Naia, who did not understand, was shocked by it as well.</p>



<p>&quot;... Sob*... Yes. I understand.&quot;</p>



<p>When he opened the lid of the bottle, a sharp smell wafted out.</p>



<p>Keith put the liquid on a quill he had made from a griffon feather.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to write something on your back now. It would feel a little scratchy.&quot;</p>



<p>His manner was like that of a doctor.</p>



<p>In fact, at this moment, Keith was in serious mage mode, not his usual perverted self.</p>



<p>His face was somewhat tense.</p>



<p>Keith wrote letters on Naia&apos;s white back.</p>



<p>A mixture of ancient elven script and modern magical script.</p>



<p>He had tried various methods and had concluded that this was the best.</p>



<p>The letters were drawn from the neck down along the spine and around the waist in a pattern that was more like a design than a letter.</p>



<p>He just kept on writing, sweating, and not talking.</p>



<p>Naia felt like she was being crushed by the sickening sensation of the sharp object moving around on her back and the fear that Keith would not speak to her.</p>



<p>When he had finished writing the magic circle on her back, Keith put away the quill and bit the tip of his tongue to draw blood, which he put onto his hands.</p>



<p>When a single line of blood forms on each palm.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, you would feel a little numb, but it won&apos;t take long.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Y-yes.&quot;</p>



<p>After confirming the reply, Keith placed his hands on the magic circle on Naia&apos;s back and let out a voice that sounded like it was squeezed from the back of her throat.</p>



<p>A string of unspoken sounds. A magic language. He piled them on top of each other.</p>



<p>Eventually, the letters he had written began to glow a pale red.</p>



<p>Then it gradually gets stronger and stronger until, bam!</p>



<p>&quot;Hyauu!!!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia screamed as electric shock surged through her back.</p>



<p>The letters on her back disappeared as if they were absorbed into her body.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, it&apos;s over.&quot;</p>



<p>Naia looked up at the gentle voice.</p>



<p>There was the usual Keith, smiling.</p>



<p>&quot;Um... Keith-sama...&quot;</p>



<p>Grabbing Naia&apos;s hand as she got up and sat down, Keith put the paper in her hand.</p>



<p>A butterfly-shaped paper.</p>



<p>When Keith controlled the flow of mana, it floated up.</p>



<p>&quot;Eh? Ah... waa.&quot;</p>



<p>Naia was surprised and smiled as she watched the paper butterfly dance.</p>



<p>She felt something warm come out of her palm, and she knew it was making the butterfly float.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Congratulations. The princess is now a mage.&quot;</p>



<p>Yes, the treatment is essentially just that.</p>



<p>Bringing the body&apos;s mana channels into a correct alignment.</p>



<p>All that is left to do is to accurately recognize the incorrect or stagnant placement, create the correct layout for that person, and then correct it with a potion that is effective in moving the channels.</p>



<p>It takes a lot of time and money to check the placement and prepare the magic potion, but the process is simple.</p>



<p>He had already confirmed the placement by playing around with Naia&apos;s body for a month, and the ingredients for making the potion were from the stolen items, so there is no problem.</p>



<p>If that was the case, he could have done it the day after he first palpated Naia&apos;s body.</p>



<p>But he had tricked Naia, who did not know that, into doing such things.</p>



<p>&quot;Is it true? Really, I...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s true. You can&apos;t do any high-tier magic yet, but over the next three years or so, as you get used to it, you&apos;ll be able to use the sacred magic.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia was so happy that she hugged Keith.</p>



<p>He had held her body before, but this was the first time he was hugged by her.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m so happy... Keith-sama, thank you...&quot;</p>



<p>With a naked Naia in his arms, Keith is here to win the game of a lifetime.</p>



<p>Yes, he has plans to take the country&apos;s elven princess&apos;s virginity!!!</p>



<p>Keith patted Naia&apos;s head and said.</p>



<p>&quot;Then this is a goodbye, Princess......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>For a moment, Naia froze, not understanding what Keith had said.</p>



<p>Eventually, she understood the meaning of the words and her expression clouded.</p>



<p>&quot;Eh? Eh? Why... why? Why is Keith-sama...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;After filling the Princess&apos;s body with mana and loosening the hardened mana channels, I fixed them in their proper alignment....... All done. That&apos;s as far as I can do.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;B-but! You said it would take about three years to get used to it! I want to study with Keith-sama!!! Besides, Keith-sama is the court mage of this country, so even if he&apos;s done with me......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s not that!!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia&apos;s body froze at the sudden words.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to yell at you... It&apos;s not that...&quot;</p>



<p>Naia looked like she was about to cry as Keith looked down with sadness in his eyes.</p>



<p>&quot;Then why? D-do you hate me now?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s not!!... like that...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Then!!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith paused for a moment.</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s the magic tool.&quot;</p>



<p>He muttered the words.</p>



<p>&quot;Magic tool, the one which give a potion?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What happened to it?&quot;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&quot;Please tell me!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Actually&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>Keith stared straight at Naia&apos;s face.</p>



<p>&quot;That magic tool has begun to fuse with my body!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;T-that&apos;s!!&quot;</p>



<p>A normal person would have a bad hunch over that.</p>



<p>That hunch was probably right on the money.</p>



<p>Keith began to explain.</p>



<p>&quot;That magical tool, apparently, while it was giving the princess a medicine, it also sucked your mana and started growing....... I knew that there were tools with a will in them, but I didn&apos;t think that tool had a will.... Last night, as I was preparing for today, I was suddenly attacked by that magic tool, and the next thing I knew.......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama... let&apos;s go to the doctor quickly!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, it would be useless...... because it embedded itself deeply that if I try to take it out forcefully, my life will...... and if I leave it alone, I will eventually......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama... no... no way.&quot;</p>



<p>There is a reason why Naia believed the story.</p>



<p>The fact is that in this country, the fusion of magic tools and their users is not an uncommon story.</p>



<p>In order to avenge his father&apos;s death, the prince put on armor made by a mad dwarf and fought against a nation, only to be swallowed by the armor and finally disappear into the sleeping forest in the far west. The story is told in fairy tales, such as &quot;Cloud the Beast from the Sleeping Forest&quot; and &quot;The Prince of the Elves&quot;.</p>



<p>The king of the elves, who controlled the soldiers to protect the elven lands from the human invasions, let the control devices fuse with the soldiers and sank them into the sea. He was called &quot;Jonal the heartless&quot;.</p>



<p>And that Jonal was also Naia&apos;s father&apos;s uncle.</p>



<p>The story of the fusion with magic tools is not so rare.</p>



<p>Naia knew how frightening it was.</p>



<p>&quot;So, I will leave this country before my heart is consumed by the magic tool, and I lose sight of myself and harm the princess.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No... that&apos;s.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Princess!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith hugged Naia tightly.</p>



<p>&quot;Please forgive my rudeness when ...... I came to the room earlier, but I was so sad to have to say goodbye to the princess...&quot;</p>



<p>Naia was ashamed of herself at these words.</p>



<p>She didn&apos;t know that Keith was in such pain, and thought that he disliked her...... it was all about herself.</p>



<p>Yes, it&apos;s all her fault.</p>



<p>If she had not wanted to use magic, Keith would not be in this situation.</p>



<p>She had killed Keith herself. The gentle Keith, her precious Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry... Keith-sama... I&apos;m sorryy...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s fine. It&apos;s fine, Princess.&quot;</p>



<p>After a brief embrace, Keith let go of Naia.</p>



<p>&quot;Then I think it&apos;s time for me to go.......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, you can&apos;t go......! Stay! Stay here! I&apos;m sure I can find the cure! No, if I can&apos;t do it, I&apos;ll ask the whole country to find it!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Cure... huh...&quot;</p>



<p>Naia did not miss Keith&apos;s mutterings.</p>



<p>&quot;Is there a cure!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, there is no fundamental cure...... but there is a way to stop the erosion of the magic tool.......&quot;</p>



<p>Naia&apos;s face lit up with joy.</p>



<p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you say so! Let&apos;s do it!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, I can&apos;t do it alone...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;If so, let me help you!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... No, that kind of thing...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I can do it! I will do anything! For Keith-sama, I......&quot;</p>



<p>Naia said as she grabbed Keith&apos;s hand with both of hers and held it tight.</p>



<p>She can help Keith.</p>



<p>This time she will help Keith.</p>



<p>Just thinking about it, Naia&apos;s body was filled with strength.</p>



<p>Keith looked at Naia and muttered softly to her.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, have you ever heard of the magic technique called supplementary rectification script?&quot; (???)</p>



<p>&quot;&hellip;&hellip;N-no, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;P-please tell me! What is...&quot;</p>



<p>Naia asked as if clinging to him, and Keith was puzzled for a moment before he answered.</p>



<p>&quot;It is a secret technique handed down in [Traditional Eastern Magic], in which a woman transmits the mana she has kneaded inside her body to other things.&quot;</p>



<p>It&apos;s a big lie.</p>



<p>Originally, supplementary rectification script is a type of Taoist sexual practice in which the man does not expel the mana he has kneaded within himself to the woman, but returns it to his own body, receiving the woman&apos;s mana in the process.</p>



<p>But of course, Naia doesn&apos;t know that.</p>



<p>&quot;I-Is such a thing possible?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, it is possible. If one do this, or...... If one could send its mana to the magic tool, it should be able to stop it from eroding me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Let&apos;s do it! No, I will do it!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No! It is dangerous!...... I didn&apos;t explain it well enough. In order to perform this magic, one must insert the magic tool into the woman&apos;s body.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Inside... the body?&quot;</p>



<p>Not knowing where it will be inserted, Naia was puzzled.</p>



<p>Inside the body? Is it different from what she always does, putting it in her mouth?</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, it&apos;s here.&quot;</p>



<p>That said, Keith gently touched Naia&apos;s crack.</p>



<p>&quot;I-Inside here!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Is it okay, princess. Excuse me.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith sat Naia down and spread her legs in an M-shape.</p>



<p>With a hand mirror he had brought along, he carefully showed Naia her own vagina.</p>



<p>&quot;Can you see it?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Y-yes...... that&apos;s where the baby...... comes out.&quot;</p>



<p>It seems that she knew.</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, it is. Is it alright? A tremendous power is used in creating one life. But one has to convert it all into mana and send it out.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Here... the magic tool...&quot;</p>



<p>Will it break?</p>



<p>I don&apos;t know how it will be done, but will it affect my own baby that I will have someday?</p>



<p>Such thoughts ran through her head.</p>



<p>&quot;Right? So it&apos;s okay...... don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith smiled momentarily as he said so.</p>



<p>Thinking only about herself again......</p>



<p>Naia looked up.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama... I&apos;ll do it... I&apos;ll save Keith-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Prin... cess.&quot;</p>



<p>Got lured iiiiin!!!!</p>



<p>She&apos;s been deceiveeed!!!!</p>



<p>Keith&apos;s thoughts jumped.</p>



<p>Now all that&apos;s left is to decide how to claim the thing between his legs as a magic tool.</p>



<p>Keith remade his face,</p>



<p>&quot;Really, are you sure?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes!... I&apos;m scared, but I&apos;ll do it for Keith-sama&apos;s sake!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Princess!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>They embrace each other like in the final act of a three-act play.</p>



<p>&quot;We don&apos;t have time! Let&apos;s do the magic now!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia rushed him, thinking about the remaining time.</p>



<p>As for Keith, it&apos;s funny because it&apos;s the same as being told to fuck her quickly.</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, Princess...... but before we do that, you should see the magic tool that has fused with me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s all right. It&apos;s fused with me, so it&apos;s not like it&apos;s going to blind you. But...... can the princess endure its fearless form?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I-It&apos;s alright, I&apos;ll endure it!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see!!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith stood up as soon as he said that and took off his pants.</p>



<p>&quot;Eh? Eeeehhhh!!!&quot;</p>
