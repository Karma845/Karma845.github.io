<h3>Chapter 9: Female Knight, Serve</h3>







<p>  Five days after Aisha lost a bet to Keith.</p>



<p> That night, after her work, Aisha changed her clothes and went to Keith's room.</p>



<p> She had been told to come to Keith's room.</p>



<p> The reason why it was on that day was that the next day was Aisha's day off.</p>



<p> Even though she was a full-time escort knight, she won't be on duty all year round.</p>



<p> Aisha was fine with that, but she was forced to take two days off a month by Naia's instructions.</p>



<p> In the past, she had nothing to do and had a whole day to spare, but recently, every time she has a day off, she is either called by Keith to spend the whole day doing something or go out on a date in the city.</p>



<p> Although Aisha herself did not know it as a date.</p>



<p> The next day was her day off, and Aisha was on her way to Keith's room to do the punishment game of &quot;do what I say for a day&quot;.</p>



<p> Aisha's face is pouting with anger.</p>



<p> The reason for her anger is that she can't believe she lost to Keith, no matter how many times she thinks about it.</p>



<p> How is it possible for that perverted, sex-crazed demon to go two weeks without doing anything?</p>



<p> She thought so, but the magic was real from what Aisha could see, and there was no sign of cheating on Keith's part.</p>



<p> And first of all, it was true that she had masturbated, and it was embarrassing to the point that she shed tears as she was deeply criticized for it.</p>



<p> So, she had no choice but to accept the punishment, but for some reason, she was not convinced.</p>



<p> She couldn't help but feel that there must be some terrible injustice hidden behind it.</p>



<p> However, when Aisha gave him a suspicious look, Keith said, &quot;It was hell not to get mana from Aisha for two weeks,&quot; and asked her for a short but intense &quot;mana supply&quot; after that.</p>



<p> Aisha, completely fucked by Keith for the first time in two weeks, found herself unable to say anything, and today was the day.</p>



<p> Aisha was fed up with herself, but she went to Keith's room again tonight.</p>



<p> It was completely in the form of a woman who has fallen for the wrong guy.</p>



<p> She proceeded down the corridor, being careful not to be seen.</p>



<p> When she arrived at the front of the room, she checked both sides and knocked, and Keith opened the door and welcomed her in.</p>



<p>&quot;I've been waiting.&quot;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p> He kissed Aisha's pretty lips as she stared at him with a pout.</p>



<p>&quot;Shall we go then?&quot;</p>



<p> In those words.</p>



<p>&quot;Where are we going...?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's something you'll have to see when we get there.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Wait? Do you have any idea what time it is? What time is the curfew?&quot;</p>



<p> The palace closes its gates between the arrival of the soldiers on night patrols and the soldiers going out for morning patrols.</p>



<p> During that time, no one is allowed to go out unless it is a serious matter, such as a death in the family.</p>



<p> That is all for the palace's protection.</p>



<p> Aisha said.</p>



<p>&quot;That's not a problem.&quot;</p>



<p> Keith then took a large suitcase and put his hand on Aisha's shoulder.</p>



<p>&quot;It might be a little uncomfortable, but bear with it.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p> He took his magic staff and kneaded mana, creating a ring of light around them with magic language on it.</p>



<p> The moment it spun at high speed, the two disappeared along with the light.</p>









<p>...</p>









<p> Aisha thought she felt a white light that made her eyes burn.</p>



<p> When it disappeared and she could see the scenery around her, it was not Keith's room as before.</p>



<p> It was a room in a mansion somewhere.</p>



<p> A canopied bed was placed in the spacious room, with a soft carpet underneath. There was a luxurious embroidered curtain on the window.</p>



<p> It was a bedroom.</p>



<p> The furniture and furnishings in the room indicated that it was a room in a very high-class mansion, although it was less prestigious than Naia's room.</p>



<p> Aisha was surprised at the sudden change of location, but it did not take her long to realize that it was the &quot;transfer magic&quot; used by the mage.</p>



<p> When she thought about it, she noticed that she had nausea and as though her senses are out of control, which is peculiar to the use of transfer magic.</p>



<p> She tried to question Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;Gueeee!!!&quot;</p>



<p> He was vomiting profusely into a trash can.</p>



<p> Aisha rubbed Keith's back.</p>



<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I'm sorry... I can't get used to that magic, really not good, oee! Guee!!!&quot;</p>



<p> Then don't use it. She was rubbing his back while thinking that. Eventually, he had spit it all out, and with tears in his eyes, he said, &quot;I'm going to rinse out my mouth,&quot; and Keith took the trash can and headed out.</p>



<p> Aisha, meanwhile, looked around the room to check where she was.</p>



<p> From the looks of it, it was definitely the residence of an elven nobleman.</p>



<p> She wondered why she had been brought here, but there was a problem than that. Just as she was about to say it, Keith returned.</p>



<p> He looked strangely refreshed.</p>



<p>&quot;I'm sorry to keep you waiting.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's fine, but where are we?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's a nobleman's mansion on the west side of Seimrad...... You see, it is Count Myuralt's, who died out due to lack of heirs.&quot;</p>



<p> When she was told that, Aisha had an idea of where it was.</p>



<p> She had never visited there, but she knew that the count's mansion was there.</p>



<p> However, the place must have been quite dilapidated. When she thought so.</p>



<p>&quot;I have made the acquaintance of the person who owns the rights to the house, and since it was a good opportunity, I rented it.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;An acquaintance?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You see, he is the parent of one of the daughters I rescued from the basilisk when I first came to this country.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;A-ah... no, that's fine, but why did you bring me to such a place?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I wanted to have some fun in the bedroom of a nobleman's house.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha's head began to hurt as Keith smiled and said.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah! I'm an escort knight, even though I'm on a break! We can't leave the palace without permission!! &quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's fine. I've told my cat to tell me if anything happens using telepathy, and then we can use the transfer magic to get back to the palace.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's not the problem!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Please... just for one day! I promise I'll never do this again!! So, okay?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha was vulnerable to his pleading eyes.</p>



<p>&quot;N-no! I'm a knight!! My duty comes first!!&quot;</p>



<p> She crosses her arms, turns away, and strikes a pose that says &quot;you can't make a face like that&quot;.</p>



<p> Keith turned his head to Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;I won...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I won the bet... and Aisha lost...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Are you a child!!? I said I'd do whatever you want, but my work comes first!! I'm not allowed to do anything that might interfere with that!! You're a grown man and you know what I'm talking about, you idiot!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;By all means!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith stared at Aisha and then sighed, &quot;Haa&quot;.</p>



<p>&quot;I see, then it can't be helped.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha was relieved to hear him say that.</p>



<p>&quot;You'll listen to me?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, you're on duty.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's right, I'm on duty!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;But it was a lot of work to fix up this place ~ ~&quot;</p>



<p> It is true that the room has been repaired and furnished to a much degree than the other rooms in the mansion.</p>



<p> It was not something that could be done overnight.</p>



<p> The fact that he started fixing the room right after the bet meant that he had already factored in the fact that Aisha was going to lose.</p>



<p> It's too bad Aisha didn't realize that.</p>



<p>&quot;T-that's...... fuu! It's Keith's fault for not getting help from other people!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's right... but it's a shame... I've prepared various things.&quot;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p> Keith glances at the luggage he brought with him, &quot;Don't get tied down, me!&quot; Aisha shouts in her mind.</p>



<p> Keith looks at her.</p>



<p>&quot;No, you have work, right? That's right... Aisha is a knight.&quot;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&quot;It can't be helped. Then, I'll invite &quot;someone&quot; else. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha's pointed ears reacted to those words.</p>



<p>&quot;Wait a minute... someone else...?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Who is this other person? Who are you going to invite and what are you going to do?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith senses a subtle fixation in her eyes as she asked.</p>



<p>&quot;Eh? Did I say that?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...You did. You said it. You definitely said it!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Is that so? I don't remember. Well, that's okay. Then I'll use transfer magic, so put your hand on my shoulder.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Wait! Say it properly! Who are you going to invite and what are you doing here!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha must have misheard me or something. I'm not bringing anyone here.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha thought that his face had that strangely kind smile he had when he was tricking her.</p>



<p> Who would Keith bring here? It can't be Naia. It's impossible, no matter how she look at it.</p>



<p> If so, who is it? Someone she knew? Someone she doesn't know? Who would come here? And what are they going to do?</p>



<p> In this room... in this bed...</p>



<p> When she imagined Keith entwining with a woman she didn't even know on the bed, she felt not disgust, but a different sensation that made her heart ache.</p>



<p> That's... that's... absolutely...</p>



<p> Aisha grabbed Keith's sleeve as he was getting ready to leave.</p>



<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha looked at Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;...If you get something from...... Lou-dono, we'll go back right away, right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Really?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Do you think I would lie to Aisha?&quot;</p>



<p> He always does.</p>



<p>&quot;... Only one day... right?... We'll be here only until tomorrow... so don't bring a woman... here.&quot;</p>



<p> Keith gently hugged Aisha's body.</p>



<p>&quot;I'm not bringing anyone in here but Aisha.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;......That's a promise.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes&quot;.</p>



<p> As he kissed Aisha on the cheek, Keith made a gut-punch pose making sure that Aisha wouldn't see it.</p>



<p> And suddenly with a cheerful voice.</p>



<p>&quot;Then, let's do the punishment here!!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha looked up, her face slightly moist with tears.</p>



<p>&quot;Ha? I thought the punishment was to spend the day here?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith wagged his finger from side to side and clicked his tongue.</p>



<p>&quot;This is just the stage for the punishment! My room and Aisha's room don't have the right atmosphere, so I prepared a special stage for that.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Special... what do you mean?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha cowered away from Keith's body.</p>



<p>&quot;Fufufufufu...... In the meantime, let's get you dressed, shall we?&quot;</p>



<p> When he said that, he took out the clothes from the luggage he brought.</p>



<p> When she saw that, Aisha's face froze in astonishment.</p>



<p>&quot;T-that's!?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith smiled wickedly at her words.</p>



<p> A few moments later.</p>



<p>&quot;Oooooh! It looks good on you, Aisha!!</p>



<p> Aisha stood there with a look of utter shame on her face as she heard Keith's cry.</p>



<p> Looking at her own appearance.</p>



<p>&quot;...What is this?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh? You don't know? It's a maid's clothes.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I can tell!!&quot;</p>



<p> No wonder Aisha said so.</p>



<p> Certainly, it is a maid's clothes.</p>



<p> It's a maid's clothes, but not the kind of maid that would serve an aristocrat.</p>



<p> It is erotic clothing that has been completely remodeled.</p>



<p> The headdress is proper, but the skirt is too short and the breast part is open.</p>



<p> The garter belt is of first-class silk and is of such high quality that it cannot be called work clothes.</p>



<p> He had the good taste to put it on a brown, silver-haired elf.</p>



<p> Keith felt like praising himself.</p>



<p>&quot;The noble's mansion...... and the brown elf's maid...... such a place in paradise.&quot;</p>



<p> Keith became a little weird.</p>



<p> Looking at that face.</p>



<p>&quot;What are you going to make me do by making me dress like this?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Of course, I'm going to make you serve me for a day!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ha?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith came up with the idea of having Aisha dress up as an erotic maid and serve him for a day.</p>



<p> To do that, he took a gamble, rented a house, repaired the inside, and even had Kiki Mora make a maid's outfit.</p>



<p> He made no compromises at all.</p>



<p> Just the thought of having that chivalrous Aisha serve him...... gives him a hard-on!</p>



<p> But Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;Don't mess with me!! Why would I be your servant!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's because of the bet!! It's the punishment!!</p>



<p>&quot;Don't say that!! You idiot!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I'll say it!! The promise!!...... you made a promise, but you won't keep it?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ugh!&quot;</p>



<p> When she was told that, she argued.</p>



<p> She backed off and wanted to say &quot;No, no!! It's a no, after all!!&quot;.</p>



<p> As if to push Aisha into a corner, Keith said.</p>



<p>&quot;It's just for one day. For one day, Aisha will be my maid.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;A maid...... but you're going to make me do some nasty things, right!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What kind of maid is that if she doesn't do anything nasty!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's not a maid! It's something else, you idiot!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Anyway, Aisha is going to serve me in that outfit for the rest of the day!! That's your punishment!! You understand!?&quot;</p>



<p> It was a mess, and she was really not happy about it.</p>



<p> But, once she put on the outfit, Aisha felt that she had already half-accepted the situation.</p>



<p> But in reality, she wanted to flirt in the room all day long... Aisha shook her head.</p>



<p> Aisha, who is not honest enough to say how she really feels, has become troublesome.</p>



<p>&quot;Ahh!! I understand!! It's only one day!! And I won't listen to any weird orders even if it kills me!! Hmph!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's fine!! I did it!! My personal maid!! Uhahaha!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith was frolicking around like a little kid, but then he suddenly turned serious.</p>



<p>&quot;No way... I can't believe I forgot this!!&quot;</p>



<p> He pulled a pair of glasses out of his pocket, put them on Aisha, and said.</p>



<p>&quot;...It's complete.&quot;</p>



<p> Brown erotic maid with glasses.</p>



<p> The appearance even felt divine.</p>



<p>&quot;Aishaaa!!!! My Aishaaaa!!!&quot;</p>



<p> He hugged her and shook his hips like a dog.</p>



<p>&quot;That again!!! Stop!!! Stop it!! Don't hit my crotch!!!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith pulls away from Aisha as if he's just realized what's happening.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah!! I almost lost my reason again...... damn it! This is the magic of the maid's uniform!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You already lost it!! You idiot!!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha added a Tsukkomi as usual.</p>



<p>&quot;Hey! How dare you talk to me like that!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha is a maid, right? You're supposed to talk like a maid!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;A-and how do I do that!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I don't know! Instead of I don't know, that's right!? Please call me master from now on.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Don't be stupid!! Why should I call you that?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Don't call me [you]!! I'm your master!! Are you going to back off even though it's the first step of being a maid? You're gonna back off!?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha, while seriously thinking of slapping Keith's disgusting face and words, tried her best to endure the embarrassment and humiliation, and then she said.</p>



<p>&quot;... M... Master.&quot;</p>



<p> The erotic maid shyly said &quot;Master&quot;.</p>



<p> Today is Maid's day.</p>



<p>&quot;Aishaaa!!! My erotic maaiiid!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Enough alreadyyy!!!!&quot;</p>


<p> And so began Aisha's punishment.</p>
