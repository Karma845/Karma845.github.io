<h3>Chapter 1: A Great Rise from a Con Artist</h3>

<p>In the palace, which is majestic and splendid but not glamorous or unpleasant, a man&apos;s appointment ceremony was about to take place.</p>



<p>His name is Keith Brockhound. A mage.</p>



<p>He is a little over 30 years old.</p>



<p>He has dark hair, dark eyes, and a medium build. Compared to those around him, he had an ordinary appearance.</p>



<p>But it is no wonder since he is surrounded by elves.</p>



<p>This is Seimrad, a small Elvish country on the western continent.</p>



<p>A country that was made by elves for the elves.</p>



<p>In such a situation, there is only one human man.</p>



<p>And he is appointed to the position of a court mage.</p>



<p>To find out how he came to be entrusted with such a great position in the land of the elves, we have to go back in time about a month ago.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>A man is walking through the forest.</p>



<p>He is walking along an unfamiliar animal trail, whimpering.</p>



<p>He has black hair, black eyes, black clothes, black leather shoes, and even his cape is black.</p>



<p>A man who dresses in a way that in any other world would tell one to stop dressing in their mid-teens.</p>



<p>He is Keith.</p>



<p>He is not using a staff made of wood, which is as tall as he is, for magic, but for assisting him in walking.</p>



<p>&quot;You&apos;re pathetic, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>A voice comes from somewhere.</p>



<p>It sounds like a boy&apos;s voice.</p>



<p>Looking closely, a cat is cuddling Keith&apos;s feet.</p>



<p>&quot;The person who was a regular mage of the magic society &quot;Spirit of Dawn&quot; is now being chased for selling fake amulets is truly pathetic.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Shut... up, worthless cat.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t shut up! And the reason why you got kicked out of the group is also pathetic! You peeping tom!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith used to be a mage belonging to a legitimate magic society.</p>



<p>However, he was expelled from the group just a year ago and is now a wanderer and a fraud selling ineffective charms, amulets, and elixirs.</p>



<p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it...... I&apos;ve come up with a way to make money, and it&apos;s human nature to want to do it.&quot;</p>



<p>The method Keith came up with was a combination of thoughtography and automatic writing, which simply means that he would draw a precise picture of a woman&apos;s embarrassing appearance and sell it.</p>



<p>It was sold. It really was getting sold.</p>



<p>After all, how could the grand master&apos;s expressionless secretary actually be wearing such bold underwear......</p>



<p>Or that the innocent-looking elf girl was actually comforting herself night after night with her delicate fingers.......</p>



<p>There&apos;s no reason why they wouldn&apos;t sell.</p>



<p>It was a success!! But then he was easily exposed and kicked out of the group.</p>



<p>The group probably didn&apos;t want such a stupid incident to become public, so they made a reason saying it was for personal reasons, and expelled him from the group.</p>



<p>And so it went, and now he is a fraud. It&apos;s not even funny.</p>



<p>This time, too, he had sold talismans under the false pretense of fulfilling their love, But he have been chased by the Knights of the Church and nearly put to death.</p>



<p>He managed to escape into the forest, and it had already been four days since he lost his way. He was about to die for real.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m hungry...... my legs hurt...... my back hurts...... and my heart hurts the most.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You deserved it, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>The cat with a composed expression is Lou and is Keith&apos;s familiar.</p>



<p>A low-rank cat fairy [Cait Sith], can&apos;t use magic properly and has a strange way of talking.</p>



<p>But it was able to catch mice, so unlike Keith, it wasn&apos;t hungry.</p>



<p>&quot;...I&apos;m gonna eat you, you worthless cat.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m not so worthless as a cat to be caught by master.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith couldn&apos;t say anything as it was true.</p>



<p>The sun was just above the horizon when Keith reached his limit and sat down.</p>



<p>It will be the last time he would drink water, as he had drunk water three hours earlier.</p>



<p>&quot;Not good... I&apos;m really going to die.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It was a short relationship, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith had no strength left to argue against Lou, who put its paw on his shoulder.</p>



<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>



<p>Lou&apos;s ears twitched.</p>



<p>&quot;Master, there&apos;s someone here.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith&apos;s face rose in hope as he was told.</p>



<p>&quot;Which way!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;This way, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith chases after Lou as hard as he can.</p>



<p>He almost fell down many times on the way, but when he passed through the trees, he found that there was indeed someone there.</p>



<p>No, technically speaking, it was not a human, but an elf.</p>



<p>Blond hair, blue eyes. White skin and good looks. And pointed ears.</p>



<p>They were definitely elves.</p>



<p>The elven women were running around screaming.</p>



<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>



<p>When he looked behind them, there was a large lizard monster.</p>



<p>&quot;Basilisk......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Unyaa!?&quot;</p>



<p>Basilisk, a monster identified as a dangerous monster.</p>



<p>A creature with a magical eye that says it will turn someone to stone if one looked at its eye.</p>



<p>Turning to stone, it then slowly prey on it.</p>



<p>Chased by such a monster, the elven women were running for their lives.</p>



<p>Keith turns around as if he has lost interest and tries to walk away.</p>



<p>&quot;Nyaa!? You&apos;re not going to help, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Me? Why? I&apos;m starving and I can&apos;t waste any more energy.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Waste...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ah ~ ~, that&apos;s right. Encountering a basilisk in such a nice forest, those elves&apos; lives were over. I can&apos;t be burdened with other&apos;s karma.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...Unyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It is the will of the great ether. May they rest in peace.&quot;</p>



<p>As its master turned to leave, Lou said.</p>



<p>&quot;But if you help them, you might get some food.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Twitch*.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You&apos;re their savior, nyaa. You might even get some money...... maybe.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;.........Knowing what is right and not doing it is an action of a fool. Let&apos;s go, worthless cat!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;ll be right here cheering for you.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Just come!&quot;</p>



<p>Grabbing its neck as he ran at terrifying speed.</p>



<p>&quot;No, nyaa!! I don&apos;t want to be turned to stone, nyaa!!!&quot;</p>



<p>To Lou, who was putting up a desperate resistance.</p>



<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry! If you turned to stone, I&apos;ll sell you to an antique store and tell them it&apos;s a money-saving magic item!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want that, nyaaーーーーー!!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith appears dashingly at the spot where one of the elves fell and stood in front of her.</p>



<p>Lou, holding its eyes with its paw.</p>



<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t see it! I didn&apos;t see it!!&quot;</p>



<p>Is trying to protect itself from the basilisk.</p>



<p>Keith, on the other hand, closed one of his eyes and reached into his shoulder bag, pulling out a palm-sized flute from the inside.</p>



<p>While doing so, his eye meet those of the basilisk, but only a slight pain comes over Keith, but it has no effect.</p>



<p>Keith puts the flute in his mouth and blows as hard as he can.</p>



<p>&quot;Kokeeーーーーーーーーー!!!&quot;</p>



<p>The flute produced a rooster-like sound.</p>



<p>As soon as it echoed, the basilisk foamed at its mouth, slumped down, and ran away.</p>



<p>&quot;Ooh, it worked...&quot;</p>



<p>Keith muttered, looking at the flute.</p>



<p>Lou is still repeating, &quot;I didn&apos;t see it, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;How long are you going to keep doing that, you worthless cat?&quot;</p>



<p>At its master&apos;s words, it released its paw and looks around.</p>



<p>&quot;Master, I didn&apos;t turn to stone, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s natural. I&apos;m not going to let that happen.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Magic, nyaa! As expected of Master, nyaa!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s not magic or anything, you idiot. It&apos;s just a one-eyed spell to block magical eyes...... It&apos;s common knowledge where I come from.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;But it was magic that made it go away, right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;This?&quot;</p>



<p>Saying so, he showed Lou the flute in his hand.</p>



<p>&quot;It was 30 Rig from a festival stall. I just added magic to it...... But I didn&apos;t think it would really work.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...You tried it for the first time, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yeah, it works, and I&apos;m surprised too.&quot;</p>



<p>He&apos;s the kind of guy who says horrifying things.</p>



<p>That thought made Lou break out in a cold sweat.</p>



<p>The two...... one person and one animal were approached.</p>



<p>&quot;Um&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>Looking back, the four elves stared at Keith with tears in their eyes.</p>



<p>&quot;Thank you very much!&quot;</p>



<p>Saying so, Keith replied.</p>



<p>&quot;...Do you have any food?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith said apathetically.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>Now, here comes the interesting part of this thing called fate.</p>



<p>One of the four female elves Keith rescued turned out to be the daughter of an influential person in Seimrad.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to Keith, he had actually entered the forests of Elven territory after running away from the Knights.</p>



<p>Keith was taken to the girl&apos;s house, where he was treated neither good nor bad.</p>



<p>He was happy as long as he could eat, but when the girl&apos;s father asked questions at the dinner table, he replied that he was a wandering mage for some reason and that he was happy if he could help others.</p>



<p>As a result of his lie, the elf, whose name was Sak, took a great liking to Keith and said, &quot;I can make you a court mage with my own power!&quot;. Boasting it.</p>



<p>A human as a court mage of the Elven nation?</p>



<p>Keith had never heard of such a dream, and he had made a random remark like, &quot;Ahーー, I wish I could do thatーー&quot; but three of the other four people he saved also had influential parents who were a member of the government or military officers.</p>



<p>Moreover, since all of them were grateful to Keith, the scenario progressed very quickly, and as a result, the unemployed fraudster became a court mage of the Elven Nation.</p>



<p>Lou was proud of it and said, &quot;You should be thankful to me, nyaa&quot;.</p>



<p>And so we come to this day, and the look they gave to Keith, who was receiving such an appointment, is half expectant and half disgusted.</p>



<p>The elven society is originally a very closed society, and it is usually unthinkable to welcome a stranger...... and a different race.</p>



<p>However, the current king, Mashua, and his wife, Mia, are reformists who advocate coexisting with humans, and they were very moved by Keith&apos;s actions in helping the people.</p>



<p>With their words, about half of the elves in the room were acknowledging it but reluctant to it.</p>



<p>Feeling their stares and silent pressure, Keith asked himself, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;.</p>



<p>He admitted that this is a big success.</p>



<p>However, elves, who are a fairy species, are not only incomparable to him in terms of mana, but they are also skilled in magic. What should he do in such a country?</p>



<p>Perhaps a clown? Am I now a clown?</p>



<p>A kind of twisted thought runs through his mind.</p>



<p>But he can&apos;t turn it down because he is getting food and more than anything else, he has a place to sleep...... not some con artist.</p>



<p>So when Keith saw Lou standing tall with a fluent and proud look on its face, he wanted to hang him up.</p>
