<h3>Chapter 20: Female Knight, Deceived Again</h3>



<p> The feeling of tears falling on his chest.</p>





<p> The way she trembled, afraid to ask for an answer.</p>





<p> The frightened look on her face, like a lost child.</p>





<p> Keith looked up at Aisha and asked.</p>





<p>&quot;What do you think, Aisha?&quot;</p>





<p> On the contrary, he asked back.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha, do you think I did something like that with Berna-san?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha shook her head.</p>





<p>&quot;... I don't know... I don't know.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Is... that so.&quot;</p>





<p> Dexterously changing from the cowgirl position to the missionary position, Keith pulled his penis out of Aisha's vagina.</p>





<p> The semen flowed out of Aisha's vagina.</p>





<p> She felt the loss of Keith leaving inside her. Tears welled up in Aisha's eyes as she realized that this was goodbye.</p>





<p> She wanted to cry out to Keith as he got off the bed, &quot;Don't go.&quot;.</p>





<p> Stay with me more. Hold me like you always do.</p>





<p> Was it wrong of me to confirm it?</p>





<p> Even if he was in such a relationship with Berna, would I have been less sad if I had continued to be deceived?</p>





<p> She thought so.</p>





<p> Not knowing what was right anymore, Aisha covered her face with her hands and continued to cry.</p>





<p>Then.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha.&quot;</p>





<p> A gentle voice calls out.</p>





<p> Keith's voice. It was the voice of her beloved.</p>





<p> She looked up, her vision blurred by tears, and there was Keith, smiling at her.</p>





<p> Looking down at Aisha, Keith held a long, thin box in his hand.</p>





<p> He held it out to her.</p>





<p>&quot;This, can I give this to you?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha wiped away her tears, got up, and took it fearfully.</p>





<p>&quot;Sob*... what... is this?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Please open it.&quot;</p>





<p> When Aisha opened the box as she was told, she found a necklace inside.</p>





<p> It is made of mithril and is small in size, but it is shaped like a lily.</p>





<p> The emblem on the lily shows the integrity of the knight.</p>





<p>&quot;T-this is...&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha said, looking alternately at the pendant and keith.</p>





<p>&quot;I gave you a ring before, but you've been wearing it for a long time, so I was happy...... that's why I made another one.&quot;</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&quot;I really wanted to give it to you, but it took me so long to make it...... on that day...... the day we were supposed to meet...... I escorted Berna to her room, and then I decided to go finish it, but....... I fell asleep......&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's tears had stopped. She stared at the necklace.</p>





<p> And with a raspy voice.</p>





<p>&quot;Th... then, with Berna?&quot;</p>





<p> When he hugged Aisha, who asked him a question, he whispered in her ear.</p>





<p>&quot;Do you really think I would do something like that with someone other than Aisha?&quot;</p>





<p> He said so strongly.</p>





<p> Aisha's whole body weakened at those words.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu... uu... uee... Keith... Keith!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's hands go around Keith's back.</p>





<p> They hug each other tightly as if they are checking each other's body temperature while still naked.</p>





<p> Keith wrapped his arms around Aisha, who was crying in his chest.</p>





<p>(I'm so glad&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;!! I'm so glad I made the necklace&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;!!!)</p>





<p> He shouted in his mind.</p>





<p> Originally, he had planned to give it to Aisha as a normal gift to please her and ask her to do something more erotic than usual.</p>





<p> However, when he remembered that he had forgotten his promise, he decided to pretend that he had fallen asleep while making it and had brought it with him.</p>





<p> However, when Aisha's words earlier revealed that she found out that he had gone to the party and sent Berna back, Keith changed his mind.</p>





<p> First, he thought.</p>





<p> How far did she know? Does she know that he spanked Berna's ass?</p>





<p> But if so, Aisha wouldn't have cried and asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;.</p>





<p> Then he has to come up with an excuse based on that.</p>





<p> He had 0.02 seconds to make that decision.</p>





<p> He desperately pulled out all the excuses he could think of that would make Aisha happy in his mind, and piled them up to create a story.</p>





<p> That was what he had just done.</p>





<p> But he didn't say anything wrong or lie.</p>





<p>On the day I promised, I sent Berna to &quot;Keith's&quot; room and finished the necklace, but I fell asleep &quot;with Berna because I was tired of sex&quot;.</p>





<p> I'm not lying, just omitting parts of the explanation.</p>





<p> At least, that's what Keith thought.</p>





<p> Besides, &quot;I didn't do lovely dovey sex with anyone other than Aisha&quot;, is not a lie either.</p>





<p> Just perfect!!</p>





<p> It's a train of thought deserving he should just drop dead.</p>





<p> But Aisha believes the story given to her by Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry... Keith... for doubting you... uwaa...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith gently strokes her head.</p>





<p>&quot;No. It's my fault I fell asleep that day......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's... uu.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith thought that if this continued, they would continue to blame each other, so.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha...... why don't we start over?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Let's redo...... what we were supposed to do that day, and let's do it now.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha smiled happily at those words.</p>





<p>&quot;But, we've already done it twice...... and your body is going to break again, right?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looked anxious, and Keith laughed out loud and said.</p>





<p>&quot;Sure, two times in a row...... but I'm sure I can make Aisha feel good.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh... ah, Keith!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith lays Aisha on the bed and sits down beside her and begins to caress her.</p>





<p> He takes the hardened nipple on Aisha's breast in his mouth.</p>





<p>&quot;Nchu, chupo, Aisha's breasts... beautiful... and cute.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Ahh!! Afuee!! Cute... what is?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nipple. It's not too big, but it's still erect, it's responsive, and it's so delicious.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Fuaa!! T-that's weird, don't say it!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looked so happy while saying that.</p>





<p>&quot;Chupu... Shall I make it big?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Fuee?&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; wha!!?&quot;</p>





<p> When she understood the meaning of the words, Aisha's face turned bright red.</p>





<p>&quot;T-that's!! But... but...&quot;</p>





<p> At the moment, many fantasies ran through Aisha's mind.</p>





<p> The image of herself pregnant, the half-elf child to be born, Keith to be her husband, a family.</p>





<p>&quot;Uaa, uaaaa...&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha, about to panic.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry! It's a lie! It's a lie! It's a joke.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-it's a lie!?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha was shocked, but Keith didn't know what to say.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha's breasts are mine and mine alone!!&quot;</p>





<p> He sucks her nipples as if he wants her mother's milk, which she can't produce.</p>





<p> On the other hand, Aisha is relieved that he said that he is joking, but she was also somewhat disappointed.</p>





<p>(Baby with Keith?...... No! Don't imagine it!! Don't imagine......)</p>





<p> She tried her best to command her body, but one fantasy after another made her vagina wet and her womb ache.</p>





<p> Without a doubt, Aisha's body wanted to get pregnant. It wanted the seed of the lowlife in front of her.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuiii!!&quot;</p>





<p> Thinking of that, her nipples became even more sensitive, and she couldn't stop herself from screaming.</p>





<p> Although he was puzzled by the sudden increase in sensitivity, Keith just kept licking the sensitive nipples.</p>





<p> When one were dealing with small breasts like Naia and Berna, one sometimes finds oneself longing for large breasts.</p>





<p>(Grandma used to say that balance is the most important thing.)</p>





<p> That is definitely in a different sense.</p>





<p>&quot;Hamu!! Nchu, chuppo, chupo, chupo!! Jyuzo! Chu, jyuzo!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Fuhii!! Good!!! Uaa!! Keith!! Ahh!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Uooh!! What's wrong? It's just the breasts, but it's amazing...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Keith is!! Because Keith is saying weird things!! Stupid!! Idiot!! Ukyaaa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha climaxed lightly even though her nipples were only kneaded.</p>





<p> In that state.</p>





<p>&quot;Weird?... I see.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled wickedly at the thought.</p>





<p>&quot;You mean you want me to have sex with Aisha's body...... by seeding it?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face contorted in shame.</p>





<p>&quot;!!? Stupid !! Idiot!! That's wrong!! That's... I said that it's wrong!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh ~ ~, because, look.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith inserted his finger into Aisha's vagina.</p>





<p> Even without touching the clitoris or other parts of the vagina to loosen it, the inside of the vagina was already slimy and coated with her love juices. The combination of Aisha's love juice and Keith's semen made it wet.</p>





<p>&quot;It's all wet and swollen. I'm sure your womb is coming down quite a bit, right? It definitely wants to get pregnant, you know?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Wrong!... Wrong!! Whoa!!!&quot;</p>





<p> While further scratching and unraveling the well-prepared vaginal hole, he folds his fingers and scratches at the weak spot.</p>





<p>&quot;Hoee!! Hohyaa!!! Stop it!! It's sensitive!! Wait!! Hohee!!! Nkyuu!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Oooh! It's so tight. Ah ~ ~, I want to shove it in...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What a mean thing to say!! Ukyaa, don't say that, idiot!! Aah!! Uaa! Uaa!!! I'm cumming again!!! Uuuu!!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Bending her body, Aisha climaxed.</p>





<p> This time it was a proper vaginal climax.</p>





<p> After pulling out his fingers and wiping them, which were covered in love juices and semen, with the sheets, Aisha, exhausted from her second climax, was turned on her side and Keith lay down behind her.</p>





<p> He lifts one of Aisha's legs, opens her slick pussy hole, and inserts his penis into her from behind, which is still erect, though not as hard and vigorous as before.</p>





<p> The penis went into the well-lubricated vaginal hole.</p>





<p> Keith then whispered in Aisha's ears from behind.</p>





<p>&quot;It feels so good...... inside Aisha's......... uu, ah, it's going to melt.&quot;</p>





<p> He exaggerates a little, which causes Aisha to cower and get goosebumps.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu... ahhn... ahh...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's mellowing out, you know? And it's so swollen...... it's begging for semen. Do you want a baby that soon?&quot;</p>





<p> The word &quot;baby&quot; makes her squeal.</p>





<p>&quot;That... is... there's no way! Who would want your baby...&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha said while making a messy face.</p>





<p>&quot;Well...... that's just fine then, it's the third time and it's going to take a while to let it out, so I'll keep fucking Aisha until she says she wants it.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Ehh? Ah, no, that's!! Kyaaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith begins to move his hips from a shallow supine position.</p>





<p> Then, the tip of the penis hits Aisha's vaginal weak point perfectly.</p>





<p> While rubbing it repeatedly, Keith whispered to Aisha from behind.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha, please let me hear more of your voice. Aisha's voice is so cute...... and I can't wait to smell your scent while I fuck you.&quot;</p>





<p> He kissed her neck and lick it with his tongue. Then he pulls his mouth away again.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm so happy to be able to do this with Aisha. I love you, Aisha. I love you so much.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Stop it!! Don't say that!!! Hahyaa!! It's not stopping!!! This feeling!! Kuhaaa!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha, are you going to cum? I want to see it, I'll make Aisha cum... okay?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, nooo!! That's, because!! I will want it!!! You did a lot of things for me, I, I!! Aaahhh!!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha climaxed. However, Keith continues to penetrate her vagina, which is tightening spasmodically.</p>





<p> This time, he put his hand on her clitoris, peeling it and playing with it.</p>





<p>&quot;Ooh!! Oaahh!!! Keith, stop!! Are you an idiot!! I just came!! But you're still!!! Fugii!!&quot;</p>





<p> Hearing Aisha's screams, Keith did not let up his attack.</p>





<p> It continued for nearly an hour.</p>





<p> Even without changing positions, his penis managed to hold it just by slowing down his hips.</p>





<p> All the while, Aisha continued to cum continuously.</p>





<p> Still unable to shake off the happiness of being held by Keith, Aisha continued to take it, saying &quot;No,&quot; and kept climaxing.</p>





<p> With her face slick with tears and drool, Aisha, completely exhausted from the continuous climax, finally.</p>





<p>&quot;... Keith, please, stop... I, should just, say it, right? Keith's baby, I want it.&quot;</p>





<p> With her mind blank that she could not think of anything.</p>





<p> She finally said her true feelings.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha's! Kuh!! Can I put my baby seed inside your knight pussy?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Half-elf... kuh! Will you give birth to it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Uooh!! Aisha is volunteering to be seeded!! It's too erotic!! This is! As expected, it's not good!!! Shit!! Prepare for it!! Get pregnant!! Knight's pussy!!! Get pregnaaant!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Fugyuuu!!!&quot;</p>





<p> The last thrust was for direct ejaculation by pushing it against the womb.</p>





<p> The womb, which had been completely filled with semen, and the juice was pumped into the un-ovulated baby room one after another.</p>





<p>&quot;Ooh! Oooh!! Uooohh...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith praises himself for enduring and feeling the numbness of his penis, he exclaims in his mind, &quot;Three times in a row, I'm still so young!&quot;.</p>





<p> He let it all out and his tired body slumped down as it reached its limit.</p>





<p>&quot;Haa, haa... ejaculating into a pussy that wants to get pregnant is different...... feels like, it's the true value of a pussy, right?&quot;</p>





<p> Saying something stupid, he slept, holding Aisha in his arms, who fell unconscious from the shock of ejaculation.</p>















<p>...</p>















<p> 4 o'clock at dawn.</p>





<p> Keith woke up to the sound of water and looked around to find Aisha no longer in his arms.</p>





<p> Light was leaking from the bathroom.</p>





<p> He woke up feeling tired and peeked into the bathroom to find Aisha had just gotten out of the bathtub and was wiping herself down.</p>





<p> Aisha looked at her body in the mirror and put on the necklace that Keith had given her around her neck.</p>





<p> It was the necklace in the box that she had been clutching while she was being fucked.</p>





<p> She moved her neck several times to make sure it was the right angle, and let out a happy yet embarrassed smile.</p>





<p>&quot;It looks good on you.&quot;</p>





<p> When Keith called out to her, her body trembled.</p>





<p> And.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, this is... I thought... I'll at least try it.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;I'm happy.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-I see.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha touched the necklace.</p>





<p>&quot;And not only that, but what you said.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Said?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You want my baby.&quot;</p>





<p> As soon as he said that, Aisha's whole body turned red.</p>





<p>&quot;Awawawa, wrong, you idiot!! It's wrong!!! Totally wrong!!! Because Keith wouldn't stop if I didn't say that!! So...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? What about getting you pregnant?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-it's a lie, idiot!! D-don't fool me!! Idiot!! Idiot!!! Hmph!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled at the childish tone of her voice.</p>





<p>&quot;I see, that's a lie.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's right!! Don't get me wrong!! Just because I gave in just a little, s-suddenly getting pregnant... it's a bad idea!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Is that so.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's right!!! First of all, my ovulation period is still far!! No matter how much you let out, I can't get pregnant......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, I thought you want to get pregnant, so I used ovulation induction magic......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Y... es?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's ovulation induction. It's a simple application of healing magic, you know?...... Are? It's not good......&quot;</p>





<p> After a few moments of silence.</p>





<p>&quot;Uwaaaa!!! What are you doing!!! You stupid!!! Idiot!!! Uwa, uwa, what should I do? What should I do?? Should I eat sour food?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, that would only make you want to eat one...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-I-I'm not even married, you know!! Uwa!! Uwaaa!! Ah!? G-getting a cold tummy is not good, right??&quot;</p>





<p> Keith couldn't hold back his laughter at her panicked gestures.</p>





<p>&quot;Ku... kuku. Ahahahaha.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;W-what are you laughing at!! It's Keith's child, you know!! You're going to be a father!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's a lie. I can't use that kind of magic without any preparation. Ahahaha.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;A lie&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes. It's a lie... Ah, I laughed too much and I'm getting a stomachache.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha looked down, but when she looked up, she had an ogre-like expression on her face.</p>





<p>&quot;You...... You don't seem to know the difference between a good lie and a bad lie... Come over here, I'll hit you.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha's... face, scary... very scary.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Shut up, you lowlife!! After all, you are a lowlife!!! Always upsetting me!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's punch approached him.</p>





<p>&quot;It hurts!! It hurts quite a lot!!!&quot;</p>





<p> As he took it in his body, he held it in a desperate embrace.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but Aisha doesn't want to get pregnant with my child either, so that hurt me a lot.&quot;</p>





<p> Hearing that, Aisha muttered.</p>





<p>&quot;That's!!! That's not what I meant...... now is not the right time...... there's an order to...... things.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? What is it? I can't hear you, your voice is so quiet.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Shut up!! Shut up!! You're a man who can't keep his word!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa! That hurts...&quot;</p>





<p> The argument between the two echoes in the bathroom at dawn.</p>





<p> The voice of a woman who truly loves the man and the voice of a man who is relieved that he was able to deceive her.</p>
