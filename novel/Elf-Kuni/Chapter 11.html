<h3>Chapter 11: Princess's Reason</h3>

<p>The bathroom is filled with the sound of churning water.</p>



<p>Keith and Naia are soaking in the bathtub with bubbles floating in the rising steam.</p>



<p>Naia is sitting on Keith&apos;s waist facing him, and Keith is holding her light body but not inserting himself into her.</p>



<p>They are just facing each other and holding each other.</p>



<p>Naia is happy to be hugging Keith, but she is also very embarrassed about being naked.</p>



<p>They have already had sexual intercourse, but Naia did not know what that means.</p>



<p>So, she is very embarrassed to be in this kind of situation, as though they were lovers. &quot;Is it okay?&quot;, she wondered.</p>



<p>Keith finds Naia so cute that he sweetly bit and nuzzled her red, pointed ears.</p>



<p>&quot;Ahyuu... Keith-samaaa!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry. The princess was just too cute.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Uu... hauu...&quot;</p>



<p>When he told her that she was cute, she didn&apos;t know what to look like, so she put her hands around Keith&apos;s neck and hugged him tightly, hiding her face.</p>



<p>After sending mana to the magic tool fused to Keith&apos;s body―― at least that&apos;s what Naia believed―― the two decided to wash their sweaty bodies.</p>



<p>Naia couldn&apos;t move because of the numbing pain and fatigue, so Keith prepared the bath and took her in a princess carry.</p>



<p>Incidentally, preparations for bathing in this world differ considerably between ordinary families and the royal and noble classes.</p>

<p>Ordinary families carry water by hand to fill the bathtub and heat it. Naturally, that was time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p>



<p>The royalty and nobility, however, use spirit stones.</p>



<p>Firestones are crystallized with the power of the spirits, and only a little bit of mana is needed to manifest fire for firestones and water for waterstones, according to their attributes.</p>



<p>Using these stones, the waterstone is first thrown into the bathtub to release water, and then the firestone is thrown to warm the water.</p>



<p>This way, it takes no time or effort, and one can take a bath whenever one like.</p>



<p>The spirit stone itself is not so cheap, so it cannot be used repetitively, but there is no problem if one only uses it for bathing.</p>



<p>In Seimrad, the manufacture and sale of the spirit stone is a core industry of the country.</p>



<p>As Keith washed Naia&apos;s body, he kept saying things like, &quot;The princess saved my life,&quot; &quot;If it weren&apos;t for her, I wouldn&apos;t be here,&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m happy to serve her&quot;.</p>



<p>But Naia, who thought it was true, was really happy to think that Keith was grateful to her and that she had been able to help him.</p>



<p>The pain that had threatened to tear her stomach was gradually subsiding with each word of gratitude.</p>



<p>After they finished washing their bodies, they got into the bathtub together.</p>



<p>The bathtub was big enough for the two of them, but when Keith said, &quot;It&apos;s too small, so you&apos;re on top of me,&quot; Naia could not resist the desire to do so.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry, that must have hurt.&quot;</p>



<p>As they hugged each other, Keith suddenly scowled and said so.</p>



<p>&quot;No! It&apos;s fine! And I did the breathing method that&apos;s not kissing...... and it made me feel so much better!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Does it still hurt?&quot;</p>



<p>When he said that, Naia wondered if she would say &quot;ouch&quot; and get him to do the breathing method that&apos;s not kissing...... again. She thought.</p>



<p>It doesn&apos;t really hurt that much anymore, but when she say it hurts, it hurts. No, it definitely hurts. So that was not a lie.</p>



<p>Telling herself.</p>



<p>&quot;A little... bit... maybe...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Is that so&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Um... so please let&apos;s do the breathing... again... please...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith realized that Naia is asking for a kiss.</p>



<p>&quot;I understand.&quot;</p>



<p>He then put his lips on top of hers.</p>



<p>&quot;Nhh... chyu... chu, hamu, rero, chu...&quot;</p>



<p>Soon their tongues entwined, and they continued to taste each other&apos;s saliva.</p>



<p>As the time for Aisha to enter approached, Keith and Naia left the bathtub and wiped themselves down.</p>



<p>They leave the room making sure that Aisha is not inside, but they can&apos;t have the two of them smelling the same soap and looking suspicious.</p>



<p>When she finished wiping herself down, Keith said.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, please put your hands on the edge of the bathtub there and turn your buttocks toward me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?...... um, like this?&quot;</p>



<p>Naia was embarrassed, but did as she was told and stuck her buttocks out.</p>



<p>She had thin legs and a buttock that did not have much flesh on it yet.</p>



<p>The opened vaginal hole and the slightly tinted, tightly closed butt hole were now fully visible through the widened valley in the middle.</p>



<p>He felt the urge to do mischievous act on her, but he held back.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to apply a medicine to the cut inside you, Princess, so it may hurt a little, but please bear with me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Y-yes.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith took the medicine out of the bag he has prepared for today―― a mixture of jackalope&apos;s milk and medicinal herbs.</p>



<p>He licked the index finger of his right hand, covered it with saliva, and slowly inserted it into Naia&apos;s vaginal opening.</p>



<p>&quot;That&apos;s!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia raised her voice as the pain of touching the wound hit her.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Can&apos;t endure it?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No... I&apos;m okay.&quot;</p>



<p>Hearing Naia&apos;s reply, Keith bent his finger slightly and pulled it out.</p>



<p>Then, his own semen mixed with the blood from the deflowering came out in a sloppy mess.</p>



<p>Although it had dripped out while she was washing herself, he brushed off the little bit of semen that was still there and wiped it off with a disposable handkerchief to make sure it was clean.</p>



<p>He then applies medicine to his entire middle finger and inserts it into the vaginal hole once more.</p>



<p>If he did this, the wound should close and would be ready to use again tomorrow.</p>



<p>He can&apos;t wait to make this elven princess cum as soon as possible.</p>



<p>He wanted to give her an orgasm of a different dimension from the clitoral stimulation.</p>



<p>For that reason, Keith is a man of discipline who never neglected taking care when the act is done.</p>



<p>Afterwards, when they were leaving the room after changing their clothes.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, keep it a secret that my body is fused with a magic tool.......&quot;</p>



<p>He told her.</p>



<p>&quot;I know! It&apos;s a secret between us!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes. Of course, also the method that the Princess is doing for me......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>



<p>Patting the head of such an honest and nice girl, Keith left the room.</p>



<p>In the room alone, Naia let out a small laugh of happiness.</p>



<p>She was able to help Keith.</p>



<p>She became an important person to Keith.</p>



<p>It made her happy. She was so happy!</p>



<p>Why does Naia feel so much for Keith?</p>



<p>It starts with her childhood feelings.</p>



<p>Naia is 24 years old this year, but her mental age is much younger.</p>



<p>Elves grow normally until they are about 10 years old, and then they grow slowly as they get older.</p>



<p>Naia looks to be in her early teens, but she will probably spend another 50 years in this appearance.</p>



<p>The average life span of an elf is 600 years, and the noble race lives a little longer, up to 800 years.</p>



<p>However, the number of the races has been reduced due to several wars and interbreeding with humans and other races, and it is rare for an elf to live that long nowadays.</p>



<p>Under such circumstances, Naia&apos;s father and mother were pure-blooded noble elves, and their child was the object of the nation&apos;s longing.</p>



<p>However, they married at the age of 120 and were unable to have children.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that as an individual&apos;s life expectancy increases, his or her ability to have children decreases.</p>



<p>The people of the country, as well as the vassals, were overjoyed at the birth of their only daughter, Naia.</p>



<p>However, as a result, everyone became overprotective.</p>



<p>She made no friends of the same age and was rarely allowed out of the palace.</p>



<p>The only people she met were the palace workers, the soldiers, and the guests and teachers who visited the palace.</p>



<p>The only knowledge she was given is history, ancient scripts, and etiquette. It is no wonder that Naia remains mentally young.</p>



<p>And for Naia, the inability to use magic was a big problem.</p>



<p>Elven royalty performs magic at ceremonies and other events, but Naia couldn&apos;t do it.</p>



<p>She practiced over and over again, but she could not even create a small breeze.</p>



<p>The disappointment of the teachers was great when they found out that Naia was &quot;defective&quot; because they had high expectations for her.</p>



<p>Although his father, mother, and loyal subjects told her not to worry, she could not help but feel as if she were worthless.</p>



<p>Naia was comforted by stories.</p>



<p>Ancient myths told by her father and mother. Heroic tales told by soldiers. The folk tales told by the elders.</p>



<p>All of them excited her, but most of all were the stories of the mages.</p>



<p>The mage, who overcame many difficulties with the hero Feron created [Souma of Dawn].</p>



<p>[Eran the Great Raven], the mage who rescued the fairy princess Mel from Zagan, the corrupt king who lives on the island of emptiness.</p>



<p>Every time she heard these tales of heroism, her heart beat faster and faster.</p>



<p>Perhaps it is because they were an existence that was greatly far away from Naia, who could not use magic.</p>



<p>Alone in bed at night, Naia would repeat her girlish daydreams.</p>



<p>But every time she dreamed of adventure, someone in her mind would whisper to her that she couldn&apos;t do it, that there was no such hero now.</p>



<p>And Naia herself was about to agree with that voice.</p>



<p>Then that incident occurred.</p>



<p>Inside the palace, the soldiers were making a fuss, saying &quot;There is a mage who defeated the basilisk&quot; and &quot;There is a mage who saved the girls who were in trouble&quot;.</p>



<p>At first, she thought it was a lie. She thought it couldn&apos;t be true. She thought there was no such person.</p>



<p>However, the parents of the girls who were saved by the mage came to the palace to talk to her.</p>



<p>The mage appeared dashingly in front of them who had run out of strength and fallen down (she had just fallen down) and repelled a basilisk with unseen magic (he simply blew a flute filled with mana).</p>



<p>Sark, the owner of the house where the mage is staying, says, &quot;He is a wonderful man of character and personality, and it is rare to find such a virtuous person&quot;.</p>



<p>She wanted to meet him. She wanted to talk to him. She thought so.</p>



<p>When the idea of making him a court mage came up, it was Naia who was the first to agree.</p>



<p>And she said to her father, &quot;I want to learn magic from that person&quot;.</p>



<p>If he was the same mage as the legendary one, he would surely be able to teach her to use magic as well.</p>



<p>As it turned out, Keith really did teach Naia magic.</p>



<p>Like the mage from myths, he appeared dashingly and saved her.</p>



<p>Naia had no idea that this was the difference between Keith, who specialized in medical magic and the elves who were not so good at it, but he really seemed to be a great mage who could be given two names.</p>



<p>The man of her dreams appeared in front of her, saved her, and did something nice for her that no one had ever taught her.</p>



<p>What girl (mentally) wouldn&apos;t fall in love with that?</p>



<p>A secret, a time that was just for the two of them, between her and Keith.</p>



<p>That dreamlike time that lasts as long as Keith is fused with the magic tool......</p>



<p>It&apos;s horrifying not knowing the truth.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>There was a knock at the door and a voice said, &quot;Excuse me. It is Aisha&quot;.</p>



<p>She tightened her face and said, &quot;Come in,&quot; so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>



<p>Aisha, a knight with brown skin, silver hair, a military uniform, and a rapier on her waist, entered.</p>



<p>She was about to tell her that she had learned to use magic, but then she remembered Keith&apos;s words that she should surprise her by showing it in front of everyone next time.</p>



<p>&quot;What wrong?&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha asked, a question on her face.</p>



<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>



<p>Naia tried to walk away with a smile, but her lower body was a little sore, and she walked like a crab.</p>



<p>&quot;W-what&apos;s wrong!? Are you okay??&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I-I&apos;m... fine.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Sniff* sniff*... Naia-sama, did you take a bath?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?... Ah, yeah... it&apos;s because... I&apos;m sweating.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;N-No way! In front of that mage!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No! Alone!!&quot;</p>



<p>Seeing Aisha sigh in relief, Naia&apos;s heart fluttered at the &quot;secret&quot;.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>&quot;Ufu... ufu... ufufufufufufufu.&quot;</p>



<p>Remembering what had happened with Naia, and fantasizing about what was to come, Keith lay down on his bed and laughed out loud in a sickening voice.</p>



<p>&quot;...Master has left for an unknown planet, nyaa!&quot;</p>



<p>Lou, who knew nothing, stared at him with tears in its eyes.</p>
