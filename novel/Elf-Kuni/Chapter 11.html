<h3>Chapter 11: Princess, Spilled the Tea</h3>



<p> Keith is walking down the hallway toward Naia's room, tapping his hips.</p>





<p> It had been ten days since he had enjoyed the maid play with Aisha.</p>





<p> In fact, Keith had missed two of Naia's lessons after that.</p>





<p> Needless to say, the cause is that he overdid it.</p>





<p> It made it difficult for him to go to the bathroom, and more importantly, his penis was so overused that it had no other use than to pee.</p>





<p> It was the first time in Keith's life that he had not had a morning wood.</p>





<p> So for ten days, he took an energy pill, put on medicine like the one he had made for Worland-san for his back pain, and spent time quietly.</p>





<p> Lou said, &quot;You know what they say about getting what you deserve, nyaa?&quot; But he could only say, &quot;Sorry,&quot; as he had been receiving the cat's massage once a day.</p>





<p> So, on the day when his back finally felt better and he was able to get up in the morning, Keith sent word to Naia that lessons would resume.</p>





<p> He immediately received a reply from Naia saying that she would reschedule her other plans and asked him to come today, so he was on his way to her room.</p>





<p> Incidentally, Keith had not even seen Aisha for the past 10 days.</p>





<p> Aisha was too shy to come to see him.</p>





<p> Personally, he would have liked to be nursed by her and at least enjoy saying some verbal abuse, like, &quot;You're like a succubus sucking off a man's cum,&quot; but he guessed Aisha probably knew that.</p>





<p> Keith walked down the hallway and took another bottle of energy drink, just in case, and slowly, arched his hips and back as he reached the front of Naia's room with renewed energy.</p>





<p> He knocked on the door and waited for an answer before entering, and suddenly, he felt a jolt that almost made him fall over.</p>





<p> What? He thought and saw Naia clinging to his chest.</p>





<p>&quot;P-princess?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith called out to Naia, who was trembling.</p>





<p>&quot;Thank god... you're feeling fine... uuu.&quot;</p>





<p> She mumbled that without showing her face as she hugged him.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm fine. Just like I said, it's just a cold.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;But... but...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Thank you for your concern. I'm fine now...... therefore, let me see your smile, Princess.&quot;</p>





<p> At Keith's words, Naia raised her tear-streaked and snotty face, making a strong but smiling face.</p>





<p> If it were just the two of them, they would have definitely kissed each other.</p>





<p> At that thought, he wondered why Aisha didn't respond to Naia hugging him.</p>





<p> He looked around the room and saw that Berna was leaving the room with her head bowed.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess, where's Aisha-sama?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith asked as he wiped Naia's tears and snot with a handkerchief he was carrying.</p>





<p>&quot;Sob*... Aisha suddenly left the room to go to the bathroom just before Keith-sama arrived. That's weird, she could have used the one in my room.&quot;</p>





<p> She ran...</p>





<p> The next time he visits Aisha in the middle of the night, Keith decided to torment her.</p>





<p> She sat Keith down in the chair, and when she sat down in front of him, Naia asked him how he had been for 10 days. And, &quot;Are you fine not resting more?&quot; She asks him a lot of questions.</p>





<p> He answered politely and asked her how she had been for the past 10 days.</p>





<p> Naia was talking as if they were in a long-distance relationship, even though it had only been 10 days.</p>





<p>&quot;Um, Keith-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I...... can make some herbal tea for you to drink, Keith-sama...... would you like to drink it?&quot;</p>





<p> Naia said while fidgeting.</p>





<p>&quot;Tea for me?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith did not know why she was embarrassed as she nodded her head.</p>





<p>&quot;Thank you very much. Of course, I am delighted.&quot;</p>





<p> He answered.</p>





<p> In response, Naia was delighted with a smile on her face.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll prepare it right away!&quot;</p>





<p> She brought a tea set.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh!? The princess is going to make the tea?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes!!&quot;</p>





<p> Naia began to prepare the tea with her eyes burning with enthusiasm.</p>





<p> Her movements are not good and it is a little frightening to watch.</p>





<p> It was impossible for royalty to make tea by herself.</p>





<p> So, he had assumed that she was going to call Berna back and ask her to make the tea.</p>





<p>&quot;U-um, princess? Would it be okay if I brew it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No! Keith-sama, please sit down!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>





<p> Naia brewed tea with sweat on her forehead and a serious expression on her face.</p>





<p> Unbeknownst to Keith, in Seimrad, giving a man a cup of tea that one has blended is an act of courtship.</p>





<p> Nowadays, it is not such a serious matter, and young people give it to each other lightly, but it was still a big decision for Naia.</p>





<p> When she heard that Keith had caught a cold, she wanted to go visit him, but Aisha told her, &quot;Absolutely not!&quot;, Aisha stopped her.</p>





<p> No matter how many times she told her, she would not listen.</p>





<p> Naia, who did not know that there was a secret behind the scenes, cried and pleaded to her, and even tried to sulk, but to no avail.</p>





<p> So she asked Berna for advice.</p>





<p>&quot;Herbal tea is good for colds. Why don't you give it to him?&quot;</p>





<p> She learned how to blend and make herbal tea from her advice.</p>





<p> It took her a few days to learn how to make it, and by the time she did, she received word that Keith had made a full recovery.</p>





<p> Still, she wanted to at least make herbal tea for Keith to drink, so she endured her embarrassment and told him.</p>





<p> Keith, who of course did not know about that, was watching her nervously, as he watched her dangerous hand movements.</p>





<p> It might be similar to a parent watching their child cook for the first time.</p>





<p> Eventually, she somehow brewed the tea.</p>





<p>&quot;Oooh!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith couldn't help clapping.</p>





<p> Naia smiled shyly and spilled the tea as she presented it to Keith.</p>





<p> When she said, &quot;Ah&quot;, the tea was soaking Keith's clothes from his chest area.</p>





<p> The tea was not that hot, at least not as hot as it had been, as Naia had taken a long time to brew it.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, ahh, Keith-sama!! I'm sorry!! I... I!!&quot;</p>





<p> But Naia, on the other hand, was apologizing repeatedly to Keith with a face that looked as if she was about to say, &quot;I'll apologize for killing myself&quot;.</p>





<p> Keith smiled at Nia.</p>





<p>&quot;No, don't worry about it, my clothes just got wet.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;But! Ah... why, I...&quot;</p>





<p> Naia was about to enter a spiral of self-loathing.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess. Thank you for making tea for me. I didn't get to drink it today, but will you make it again next time?&quot;</p>





<p> Next time.</p>





<p> Keith was saying that he would drink Naia's tea next time.</p>





<p> Naia understood that, and she shed a few tears at his kind words.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama... why?... why are you so kind to me?&quot;</p>





<p> That is, to eat you!! (In a sexual sense)</p>





<p> He can't say that though.</p>





<p>&quot;It's because I care about you, Princess.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's words, uttered with a smile that would make a man want to vomit, struck Naia in the chest with the force like that of a crossbow.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith hurriedly stopped Naia, who was about to hug him.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! No! You'll be stained with tea!!&quot;</p>





<p> At those words, Naia gave up with a look of regret.</p>





<p> Keith felt relieved.</p>





<p>&quot;I need to change my clothes and wash up, so I'm going back to my room.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> It is the leisure time that Naia, who really wanted to see Keith, had to ask him to make a little time for her.</p>





<p> If Keith went back to his room, changed, and come back, it would take more time.</p>





<p> Thinking so, Naia desperately thought of a way.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama! Please take a bath in my room!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Um, um, uh...&quot;</p>





<p> I want to stay with you as long as possible.</p>





<p> It is okay that she expressed it with that feeling alone, but when she thought about it, there is no point in washing only the body since there are no spare clothes.</p>





<p> She understood that, but she still want Keith to stay by her side a little longer.</p>





<p> Naia was disgusted with herself for putting her own feelings first in a situation like this, and she wanted to run away right now.</p>





<p>&quot;...With the princess?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Bath... Would you like to take a bath together?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith asked.</p>





<p>&quot;Y-yes!!&quot;</p>





<p> She nodded vigorously.</p>





<p> Naia, who had been so shy about serving him tea, was not embarrassed about taking a bath with him.</p>





<p> Keith smiled wickedly in his mind as he looked at the princess, whose ethics were steadily getting out of order.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> Two naked people stand in the bathroom.</p>





<p> Keith and Naia.</p>





<p> It was a very terrible scene, even after seeing it again and again, a 30-year-old man and a beautiful girl in her early teens.</p>





<p> Keith's penis had already begun to collect blood and was gradually becoming erect.</p>





<p> Keith was not going to show his warlike state here, so he tried his best to keep it under control and filled the bathtub with hot water.</p>





<p> Naia's bathroom is, of course, much larger than that of Keith and Aisha's.</p>





<p> Before Keith entered the bathroom, he patted his chest with his palm after making sure that Naia would not notice.</p>





<p> When he entered the bathroom, Naia screamed.</p>





<p> Keith's chest is bright red.</p>





<p> Naturally, it was because he hit his chest, but Naia, who did not know that, could only think it was because of the spilled tea.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!! Your chest!! Ahh!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, I thought it was a little hot... but I'm fine, with this much.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;But, that's...&quot;</p>





<p> Naia once again turned pale at what she had done.</p>





<p>&quot;It's fine, because I have some medicine.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;R-really!?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes... but if you like, please apply it, princess...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Of course!! I will do it!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I see! Thank you, princess.&quot;</p>





<p> Naia decided to do anything, as Keith pat her on the head.</p>





<p>&quot;Then wait a moment while I prepare it.&quot;</p>





<p> With that said, he put his fingers to his temples and closed his eyes.</p>





<p> Naia looked at him curiously, then Keith opened his eyes, took out his magic staff, gathered mana with it, and put magic language on it.</p>





<p> Then something appeared on the bathroom floor.</p>





<p> Naia was astonished.</p>





<p>&quot;It's transfer magic.&quot;</p>





<p> He explained.</p>





<p> Transfer magic is a magic that transports something to a specific location, but it cannot be used indefinitely.</p>





<p> The object on the floor was in Keith's room, and Keith had set it up so that it could be brought to him at will, as long as it was in his room.</p>





<p> He has to think of the exact place where the object is placed.</p>





<p> Naia then picked it up.</p>





<p>&quot;What is this?&quot;</p>





<p> As Naia squatted down and lifted the flimsy object, Keith said.</p>





<p>&quot;This is how you use it.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith took it from Naia and cast magic into the small magic circle attached to the bottom.</p>





<p> Then, air accumulated inside it in an instant and expanded.</p>





<p> It was an air mat.</p>





<p> Yes, when asked to take a bath, Keith decided, &quot;Today is a mat-play day!&quot;.</p>





<p> His body, squeezed by Aisha, would need the gentleness of mat play.</p>





<p> The mat is made from the skin of aquatic horses (seahorses) and was originally developed for nursing care, but since the establishment of a store in the commercial city of Teiren that offers a special bathing service for men using these mats, they have been widely used for this purpose.</p>





<p> The reason why Keith has it is that he made it himself with the intention of using it with Aisha someday.</p>





<p> But he never thought he would try it out with Naia, and Keith thought that an Ero God was watching over him after all.</p>





<p> Keith then sat down on the mat.</p>





<p>&quot;This is a magical tool made for lying on the bathroom floor.&quot;</p>





<p> He explained that to Naia and invited her to sit on it.</p>





<p> Naia, who sat on it, smiled happily at the fluffy touch.</p>





<p> Princess bitch is pleased with the sex mat... It's too good.</p>





<p> His penis was about to lose its patience.</p>





<p>&quot;Well then, princess, I'm going to wash first. Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>





<p> Then she touched his chest with the lathering soap.</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa!!&quot;</p>





<p> He moaned deliberately.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!?&quot;</p>





<p> Naia called out in surprise.</p>





<p>&quot;S-sorry... it's because of the burns... kuh!!&quot;</p>





<p> The truth was that he hit it, so there was no way that was the case, but Naia, believing him to be right, was already crying.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry... Keith-sama... awa, auu.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It seems I can't wash well by myself because it hurts....... Princess, I'm sorry, can you wash me?&quot;</p>





<p> Hearing that suggestion.</p>





<p>&quot;Sob*! Keith-sama's body?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes... such a rude request... really.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, I'll do it!! Please let me do it!!&quot;</p>





<p> Taking advantage of the helpless princess's guilt.</p>





<p> It is the worst kind of behavior for an adult.</p>





<p> But the pure-hearted Naia believed Keith and immediately put soap on her hands to wash him (or so she thought).</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, princess, by hand...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Um, then where?&quot;</p>





<p> She was confused, but Keith smeared the soap all over her body.</p>





<p>&quot;Kyauu!!&quot;</p>





<p> Naia screamed at the sudden ticklishness.</p>





<p>&quot;K-Keith-sama?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I think it's best to wash my body with your own body.&quot;</p>





<p> He was telling her a big fat lie as he applied soap to Naia's loli body.</p>





<p> While tracing her slender waist as if squeezing it with his hands, he went to her breasts, where his index finger tormented her poor sunken nipples.</p>





<p>&quot;Ukyuu!! Heaa!! Auu.&quot;</p>





<p> Nipples popped out! And then, the hand went to her crotch.</p>





<p> While playing with her clitoris, his other hand rubbed her breast.</p>





<p> When her clitoris became erect, he peeled off the foreskin and flicked the small pink clitoris with his finger.</p>





<p>&quot;Hihee!! Ukyuu! Ukyuuu!!!&quot;</p>





<p> The caresses on Naia, with her hands on Keith's shoulders and her hips shaking, were stopped.</p>





<p>&quot;Then, please.&quot;</p>





<p> He lay down on the mat.</p>





<p> Naia said, &quot;Eh? Eh?&quot; and is embarrassed. Then, Keith said.</p>





<p>&quot;The princess would lie on top of me and rub your body against mine as you washed me.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ehh!?&quot;</p>





<p> Naia exclaimed in surprise.</p>





<p>&quot;...Can't do it?&quot;</p>





<p> She heard Keith's voice. Then she thought about it.</p>





<p> It was to heal Keith's body.</p>





<p> She had spilled the tea on him. It was for Keith, who was suffering because of it.</p>





<p>&quot;No, I can do it!&quot;</p>





<p> With these determined words, Naia climbed on top of Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;E-excuse me.&quot;</p>





<p> When her plump legs and crotch rested on his abdomen, Keith became fully erect.</p>





<p>(You've finally regained your vigor. My beloved thing......)</p>





<p> He said in his mind.</p>





<p> Then, he laid Naia on top of his body as if he was gently holding her.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah...... it doesn't hurt, Princess.&quot;</p>





<p> Naia looked happy as he said that, even though it didn't hurt or itch to begin with.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm glad...&quot;</p>





<p> He heard a relieved voice.</p>





<p> So Keith also whispered softly into Naia's ear.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess... please&quot;</p>





<p> At these words, Naia slowly began to rub his body.</p>
