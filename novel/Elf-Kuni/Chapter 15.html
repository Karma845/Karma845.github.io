<p>Chapter 15: Special Edition: Widow, Fell Victim</p>



<p> The morning sun shines in the clear blue sky and a fresh breeze blows through the trees.</p>





<p> The air was telling Lou that another good day had begun.</p>





<p> With these thoughts in mind, Lou took its daily morning walk.</p>





<p> Lou walks around the palace garden within a 500-meter radius from Keith's room and returns.</p>





<p> It is a cat's territorial instinct.</p>





<p> Lou had been doing that routine as long as it was not raining.</p>





<p> Walking along the same path as usual.</p>





<p> However, the cat noticed a different atmosphere than usual.</p>





<p> There was a sense of urgency and tension in the air from within the palace.</p>





<p>&quot;Funya?&quot;</p>





<p> Tilting its head, Lou returned to the room and called out to its master, who was lying on his bed in his underwear, reading a book.</p>





<p>&quot;Master, master.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith, without taking his eyes off the book.</p>





<p>&quot;What is it, worthless cat.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;There's a ruckus in the palace, nyaa. What's going on, nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p> At Lou's words, Keith put the book down on his chest.</p>





<p>&quot;What, you didn't know? There's a banquet today.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nyaa.&quot;</p>





<p> The banquet is a big party held once a year at Seimrad.</p>





<p> The main purpose is to invite guests from various countries and deepen their friendship among them.</p>





<p> Even King Mashua, who does not like such events, holds this one on a grand scale once a year.</p>





<p> For this reason, preparations for meals, the preparation of the hall, and security procedures for the guests must begin several months in advance.</p>





<p> Especially this year, it was even more extensive than usual because of Naia's performance.</p>





<p> The real show is finally coming.</p>





<p> No wonder the air was tense.</p>





<p> In the midst of all this, Keith, who was lying sloppily on the bed in his underwear, was told.</p>





<p>&quot;...Master's not doing anything, nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Me? What am I supposed to do? The princess has her own singing teacher, and the palace is perfect in terms of magic defense. There is nothing to do.&quot;</p>





<p> Yes, that's right.</p>





<p> The court mages are consultants when there are problems or matters involving magic, and he is clearly a hindrance at this dinner party.</p>





<p> If he wandered around, he would be told to go away.</p>





<p> At best, he just needed to remember the seating order and the progress of the dinner party. So, he had no choice but to stay in his room.</p>





<p>&quot;Good for you, nyaa.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I think so too.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said and started reading again.</p>





<p> It felt like he had been doing that for almost a week.</p>





<p> Naia was going to perform, so she would practice singing and learn etiquette for the next few days.</p>





<p> Aisha has been meeting with the soldiers to go over security procedures and guarding until dawn.</p>





<p> So he hasn't seen them for almost a week.</p>





<p> Keith has no choice but to watch Aisha's videos and jerk off, but he is longing for some body warmth.</p>





<p>&quot;I want to fuck her tight pussy while hugging the princess's loli body...... I want to fuck Aisha's pussy while sucking her big breasts.&quot;</p>





<p> As usual, he turned the pages of an erotic book while thinking such a disgusting thing.</p>















<p>...</p>















<p> One of the soldiers came to the room in the afternoon.</p>





<p> He said that it was time for the mage to seat at the dinner party.</p>





<p> It was only natural, since he was from the country that would be welcoming the guests.</p>





<p> Keith agreed, took a bath, shaved his beard, and changed into an outfit that had been tailor-made for the occasion.</p>





<p> The outfit is a Seimrad-style adaptation of the uniform of the [Spirit of Dawn], to which he belonged, and everything from the fabric to the threads is first-rate.</p>





<p> By the way, the color is black. This was the one thing he could not give up.</p>





<p> Putting it on and brushing his hair.</p>





<p>&quot;Master! You look like a low-level evil leader, nyaa!! This can't be right!! This isn't how you look like, nyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Lou said as he left the room, Keith vowed to make Lou his next stringed instrument.</p>





<p> He walked down the corridor to the venue absentmindedly.</p>





<p> When he arrived, everything was already ready inside.</p>





<p> As he was thinking about where his seat was, a voice called out from behind.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!!&quot;</p>





<p> When he turned around, he saw Naia running to Keith with a big smile on her face.</p>





<p> She was about to hug him, but because of the makeup she was wearing, Naia tried her best to restrain herself.</p>





<p> She looked like a pretty flower in her dress, and the light makeup made her face look just a little bit more mature.</p>





<p>&quot;You look even more beautiful today.&quot;</p>





<p> Naia was beaming with delight at such compliments.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama looks great too! It's cool!!&quot;</p>





<p> That was what Keith said.</p>





<p> However, he wondered what he could do with her tiara, long gloves, and dress to make her look erotic.</p>





<p> When he was thinking about that.</p>





<p>&quot;Sing... I'm sure I'll be able to sing well! So... please listen, okay?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>





<p> Naia tried to take Keith's hand as he nodded.</p>





<p>&quot;Naia-sama! Please get ready!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha, who had been watching the two with a scowl, interrupted them.</p>





<p> When stopped, Naia muttered to Aisha, &quot;Meany&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;Please watch me! Without fail, okay!?&quot;</p>





<p> While saying so, Aisha pulled her away.</p>





<p> Keith, who smiled bitterly when he saw Aisha's pouty face, was amused by her unusual, formal knight attire.</p>





<p>&quot;I like that one too......&quot;</p>





<p> That seems to be all he can think about.</p>





<p> Soon after, guests from various countries arrived at the palace one after another.</p>





<p> The races were varied, ranging not only from elves to sub-dragons, to fishmen, to beastmen, to dwarves.</p>





<p> Mashua, Mia, and Naia welcomed them all.</p>





<p> Keith was amazed at the king as he watched from a distance.</p>





<p> Among the guests were some famous people that Keith knew, and when he saw Mashua chatting with them in a friendly manner, he thought to himself that the king of a small country could not be underestimated.</p>





<p> As the guests arrived one after the other, he suddenly heard a commotion and saw Naia embracing a small elven girl in joy and excitement.</p>





<p> Behind her came a woman, also an elf, who was chatting with Mia in a friendly manner. When Keith saw that.</p>





<p>&quot;Who is that ...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith muttered to himself.</p>





<p>&quot;It's Roana-sama and Erne-sama.&quot;</p>





<p> A voice suddenly came from behind him and he shouted, &quot;Whoa!&quot;. He screamed.</p>





<p> He turned around with his heart pounding.</p>





<p>&quot;B-Berna-san.&quot;</p>





<p> Dressed in her maid's uniform, Berna stood with her usual expressionless face.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry I startled you. I apologize.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;N-no, it's fine... By the way, Roana-sama and Erne-sama is?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Roana-sama is the queen's sister, and Erne-sama is her daughter.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hee...&quot;</p>





<p> That being said, looking at them again, Roana and Erne certainly looked a lot like Mia and Naia.</p>





<p> They have translucent white skin and platinum hair.</p>





<p> But what makes Roana different from the other two is that she has large breasts for her slender body.</p>





<p> Watching Roana exchange words with Mia and Naia with a soft smile.</p>





<p>&quot;Berna-san, um.&quot;</p>





<p> He turned around to look at her.</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa! She's not there!&quot;</p>





<p> There was already no one there.</p>





<p> It was like a ninja, moving without letting her presence known.</p>





<p> Thinking of that, Keith turned his gaze back again.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> When all the guests had arrived and the courtiers were seated, King Mashua gave a speech.</p>





<p> Keith was lulled to sleep by the sound like that of a principal's speech, but he endured it and ate his food after the toast was given.</p>





<p> The original purpose of the dinner party, which is to deepen relationships, does not concern a human being, let alone a court mage.</p>





<p> Therefore, he continued to eat and drink while the guests were enjoying their conversation.</p>





<p> After a while, the sound of the court musicians' instruments stopped and Naia stood up, looking embarrassed.</p>





<p> Naia's song would now begin as Mashua introduced her.</p>





<p> Naia took a deep breath and looked for Keith with her eyes.</p>





<p> The black mage sitting at the end of the table was gently watching over the princess.</p>





<p> At least that's how it seemed to Naia.</p>





<p> Naia felt her courage rising and sang a song as she spun softly.</p>





<p> As usual, as she had practiced, she did not mind the stares of others. Because Keith had trained her.</p>





<p> So, for the sake of his beloved Keith, her father, and mother, Naia sang.</p>





<p> While singing along the way, she would invoke the sylphs and put mana on the song.</p>





<p> Then, the sound of the song made the Sylphs start to dance happily.</p>





<p> A success. It was a success!</p>





<p> The sylphs danced more happily when Naia's singing voice became more joyful.</p>





<p> The guests, who had thought it was just a singing performance as before, were surprised.</p>





<p> Naia, who could not use magic, had called the sylphs to dance.</p>





<p> The appearance was unmistakably that of an elf.</p>





<p> When the song was over and the spirits went away, Naia bowed her head and the place was filled with thunderous applause.</p>





<p> Mashua ran up to Naia and patted her on the head, while Mia and Roana sat next to each other and shed tears.</p>





<p> Even Aisha was happy, tears in her eyes.</p>





<p> Keith was sleeping because he drank too much.</p>















<p>...</p>















<p> Keith woke up when the dinner party was over and it was time to escort the guests to the guest house.</p>





<p> Waking up to the sound of people moving about, Keith downed the remaining liquor in his glass and went back to his room.</p>





<p> Naia seemed to have gone to see the guests off and was unable to meet him.</p>





<p> He returned to his room, took a bath, and relaxed his body, which was stiff because he had fallen asleep in an uncomfortable position.</p>





<p> When he got out of the bath, Lou was fast asleep.</p>





<p> Keith lay down on the bed to sleep, and as he lay there groggily, he was awakened by a knock at the door.</p>





<p> He looked at the clock and saw that three hours had passed since he had returned to his room.</p>





<p> Did Aisha come?</p>





<p> He thought so, but he knew that Aisha would never come to Keith's room on her own unless it was something serious. So he asked.</p>





<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>





<p> He called out.</p>





<p>&quot;I apologize for coming so late at night.&quot;</p>





<p> He heard a woman's voice. But he didn't recognize the voice.</p>





<p> Suspicious, he put on his clothes and opened the door to find an elven woman he had never seen before standing there.</p>





<p> She was dressed in a maid's uniform, but it was of a slightly different design from that worn by the maids who were working in the palace.</p>





<p>&quot;Um&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> The elf bowed her head.</p>





<p>&quot;I am a servant of Roana-sama, and my master insists on speaking with the mage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;With me?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes. I know it's a bit late at night, but she wants to see you. How about it? Will you accompany me?&quot;</p>





<p> Roana wants to see me?</p>





<p> Several question marks popped into his head.</p>





<p> To Roana, Keith was nothing more than a mage in the employ of her relatives.</p>





<p> What does she want with a human mage she has never even spoken to?</p>





<p> The situation was so confusing that he was starting to get a little scared.</p>





<p> But he couldn't say no to her.</p>





<p>&quot;C-can you give me a minute?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith, who was always a bit scared, put all the small magic tools he could use in his bag, and also his magic staff.</p>





<p>&quot;Thank you for waiting.&quot;</p>





<p> With that, he headed for Roana's room with the maid.</p>





<p> She was assigned a room in the palace, not in the guest house.</p>





<p> When they arrived there, the maid knocked on the door, and a voice came from inside, saying, &quot;Come in&quot;.</p>





<p> The voice was gentle and calm.</p>





<p> When he entered the room, he found Roana sitting in a chair drinking a cup of tea, dressed in casual clothes.</p>





<p> Once again, she was a beautiful elf.</p>





<p> She was only five or six years older than Keith in appearance, but being Mia's older sister meant that she was at least 300 years old.</p>





<p> She looked slender, but her breasts were large.</p>





<p> It was hard not to look at her.</p>





<p> Roana smiled at Keith and said.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm sorry for calling you late at night. I really wanted to talk to the mage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, that's okay.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don't think I would be able to talk to you during the daytime with Erne around.&quot;</p>





<p> Certainly, she was a lively girl when she was with Naia.</p>





<p>&quot;Where is this Erne-sama?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;She said she was going to sleep with Naia.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana smiled at him bitterly.</p>





<p> Keith was urged to sit down and sat down on the chair in front of Roana.</p>





<p> Roana had the maid brew Keith's tea.</p>





<p>&quot;Fiel, I'm sorry, but could you give us a minute?&quot;</p>





<p> She said to her maid, Fiel, with an apologetic look on her face. Then Fiel bowed and left the room.</p>





<p> They were left alone.</p>





<p> What? What's going to happen?</p>





<p> No matter how many times he thought about it, he couldn't come up with the right answer.</p>





<p> He was suddenly summoned to a situation where he was alone with a person with whom he had no connection, and all that came out was cold sweat.</p>





<p> That's why he stared at Roana.</p>





<p> At first, he was thinking of saying, &quot;Why did you call me here?&quot;, But then he was struck by Roana's beauty.</p>





<p> There was an adult beauty that was different from Naia's childlike, dainty impression of a young girl.</p>





<p>&quot;What's wrong? Is something on my face...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;S-sorry. I was just admiring your beauty.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana looked at him for a moment, then giggled and said, &quot;You're good&quot;.</p>





<p> The expression on her face was really cute.</p>





<p> Keith took a sip of his tea.</p>





<p>&quot;So, what did you want to talk about?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I wanted to thank you. I heard that you helped Naia to use magic, mage. Thank you so much.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana bowed her head.</p>





<p>&quot;No, I did what is natural for a court mage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, it made Naia happy...... and not only Naia, but Mia and King Mashua as well, look so happy...... all thanks to you, mage.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith did not feel bad when he was told that much.</p>





<p>&quot;Naia is always talking about you, mage, at dinner, and after the dinner party. She keeps telling us how great you are. Erne was so jealous.</p>





<p> Roana remembering it, smiled happily.</p>





<p> Keith is relieved from the bottom of his heart that the princess didn't say anything strange.</p>





<p> Roana looked really happy.</p>





<p>&quot;I couldn't have a lot of kids... and I thought of Naia as my own daughter, and that's still the case when Erne was born. So really...&quot;</p>





<p> Her hand grabbed Keith's.</p>





<p>&quot;Thank you, mage.&quot;</p>





<p> He looked straight into her beautiful eyes and was a little embarrassed.</p>





<p> Keith slowly removed his hand and.</p>





<p>&quot;If I am able to repay even a small favor to the king who made a human like me as a court mage, then that is enough for me.&quot;</p>





<p> And doing those things to the princess and her escort knight, it would balance out.</p>





<p> But of course, Roana didn't know that.</p>





<p>&quot;You're really a wonderful person, as Naia said.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, no, that's.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith sipped his tea and searched for the right words.</p>





<p>&quot;B-by the way, Roana-sama's husband is.......&quot;</p>





<p> When she heard that, Roana's cheerful face seemed to fade for the first time.</p>





<p> Did I ask a bad question? Keith thought to himself.</p>





<p>&quot;My husband passed away. Ten years ago.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's okay. It's my fault for still dragging it out after ten years.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana smiled bitterly, and Keith wondered whether it was better to ask more about this or to find something else to talk about.</p>





<p>&quot;Um...... was it an accident or something?&quot;</p>





<p> He decided to ask.</p>





<p>&quot;No, it was from old age.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Old age!?... Ah, he's a very old husband, huh.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana looks 35 or 36 years old in human age.</p>





<p> The average life expectancy for a half-elf is in the late 300s or 400s.</p>





<p> The average lifespan of a noble elf is 800 years, and a normal elf is 600 years old, so she must have married an elf nearly twice her age. But.</p>





<p>&quot;My husband is younger than me, you know.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana said, as though she was reminiscing.</p>





<p>&quot;Younger?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;My husband was a human, just like the mage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh!?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith was surprised.</p>





<p> He had never heard of a noble elf marrying a human.</p>





<p>&quot;My husband is a merchant who came to this town to buy magic stones and happened to meet me. He asked me to marry him the same day we met. At the time I kept saying I would never get married, but the next thing I knew......&quot;</p>





<p> Then Roana looked sad and lowered her eyes.</p>





<p>&quot;He said he would always protect me...... and that he would never leave me alone, but then he easily became old and died.......&quot;</p>





<p> Keith can hear her sniffling.</p>





<p> Keith couldn't say anything, as he was deep in thought.</p>





<p> Roana looked up, her eyes welling up with tears, but her face was bright.</p>





<p>&quot;But he left me the store, and he gave me the treasure called Erne. I am grateful.&quot;</p>





<p> Her face was beautiful as she said that cheerfully.</p>





<p> Goosebumps.</p>





<p> Keith thought as he looked at her face.</p>





<p> An elf who loved a man of the same race as him.</p>





<p> And living a good life with her only daughter.</p>





<p> A widow elf with a slender and lovely body, who hid her sorrows inside and tries her best to live for the man she loved.</p>





<p> What can he do for her?</p>





<p> Isn't it to comfort her? (In a sexual sense).</p>





<p> Keith decided to do so.</p>

  



<p> Keith was looking at Roana with a serious face.</p>





<p> Roana noticed that his gaze was different from the previous one.</p>





<p>&quot;Mage? Um...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I see you've had a hard...... time.......&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's voice sounded downcast.</p>





<p> Roana panicked.</p>





<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry. I didn't call you here to talk about this.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No. I'm glad I heard it... Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to hear more about you and your husband.&quot;</p>





<p> Smiling at Keith, Roana muttered, &quot;That's&quot;.</p>





<p> She called him to thank him, but it pains her to hear him being sad about it.</p>





<p> But Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;I want to hear your story, Roana-sama.&quot;</p>





<p> When he said that and looked at her.</p>





<p>&quot;Well then.&quot;</p>





<p> She began to talk about her memories of her late husband.</p>





<p> She looked happy and amused, her face shining like that of a girl.</p>





<p> As the conversation proceeded, Keith took out a bottle of liquor from his bag.</p>





<p> It was a fragrant herbal liquor, light in the mouth, and easy to drink.</p>





<p> As she sipped it from her teacup, Roana felt better while talking about the past.</p>





<p> Of course, the drink helped, too.</p>





<p> Her cheeks were slightly flushed, which made her look even sexier.</p>





<p> When the conversation eventually turned to the store she was managing.</p>





<p>&quot;It must be a lot of work, isn't it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Not really. The employees are all good people, and there are no bad people among my clients. All of this is thanks to Kurt.&quot;</p>





<p> Kurt was the name of Roana's late husband.</p>





<p> In the past hour or so, Roana had become quite comfortable with Keith, telling him her husband's name and becoming frank in her language.</p>





<p>&quot;But you're the owner, right? Don't you get tired after a while?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's... maybe a little.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith looked like he was thinking about it for a moment, and then.</p>





<p>&quot;Well, I can give you a massage if you'd like.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I know an elf who is good at doing massage and she taught me how to do it.&quot;</p>





<p> It was Aisha.</p>





<p>&quot;I've done it before and it's quite popular.&quot;</p>





<p> It was Naia.</p>





<p> Roana was puzzled by Keith's suggestion.</p>





<p> She felt uncomfortable about being touched by a man she had just met today.</p>





<p> However, she guessed it was the fact that he listened to her story and the effect of the alcohol.</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Is it alright?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith nodded, stood up, walked behind Roana, and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll do it.&quot;</p>





<p> After saying that, he gently pressed the nape of her neck.</p>





<p> Repeating it at a moderate rhythm, being careful not to do it only in the same place.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> A moan-like voice escaped from Roana's closed mouth.</p>





<p> Roana's breasts were really big as he peeked over the top while listening to it.</p>





<p> Keith continued the shoulder massage, hoping to rub those twin hills, which could be seen through the clothes, as soon as possible.</p>





<p> Pressing the muscles with his thumbs, he worked his way up to the neck.</p>





<p> When he pressed at the base of her head.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh!&quot;</p>





<p> A voice leaked.</p>





<p>&quot;Did that hurt?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;N-no ... it feels good.&quot;</p>





<p> He wanted to hear it in a sexual sense.</p>





<p> Being careful not to let the cries of his heart come out on his face, he pushed the lymph located under Roana's pointed ears to the base of her neck.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah...... that feels so good.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's face loosens.</p>





<p> Why is this elf so erotic!</p>





<p> While enduring an erection, he pressed the muscle under the shoulder blades with his finger.</p>





<p>&quot;It's really stiff.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes, it's pretty hard to rub from here...... to the waist, would you lie down on the bed, Roana-sama?&quot;</p>





<p> That startled Roana, and she tried to resist, but.</p>





<p>&quot;Come on, quickly now.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh, ah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> Drawn by Keith's arm, she sits down on the bed.</p>





<p> There, too, she still thought this was a bad idea.</p>





<p>&quot;M-mage-san... um.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Keith.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You can call me Keith.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Kei... th.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiles and lays Roana down on the bed.</p>





<p> He then sits down next to her, puts his hands on her hips, and pushes in with just enough force that it would not hurt.</p>





<p>&quot;Kuh!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's shoulders jerked at the sensation.</p>





<p> Keith's thumb moves from her waist to her spine.</p>





<p> The fingers pressed repeatedly, gradually moving toward her large, round buttocks.</p>





<p> When the muscles of her buttocks were rubbed with his entire palm in a stroking motion.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu...!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana bit the pillow as she almost let out a husky yelp.</p>





<p> If Keith's hands had been more sexual in nature, Roana would have been able to tell him to stop, but his hands were only massaging her.</p>





<p> And she was terribly ashamed of herself for feeling it.</p>





<p> Despite the embarrassment, Roana's female parts were getting a little warmer.</p>





<p> Just when he thought he couldn't go any further, Keith's hand pulled away.</p>





<p> Was it over?</p>





<p> Roana was relieved to think so, but at the same time, she frowned at the feeling that it was not enough from deep within her.</p>





<p> But Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Please lie on your back.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;On my back... eh?&quot;</p>





<p> The front of the body. Roana had no idea what part of her body he was going to massage.</p>





<p> But Keith turned her over surprisingly easily, smiled at her confusion, and began to massage the front part of her body.</p>





<p>&quot;This is where it works best.&quot;</p>





<p> With that, he slipped his hand under the hem of her one-piece sleepwear and touched the groin at the base of her thigh.</p>





<p>&quot;Hii!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's fingers stroked Roana's groin with a disgusting touch.</p>





<p> It felt half good and half disgusting to have a man she had only known for a short time rubbing that part of her body.</p>





<p> But that did not stop Roana from saying.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith! Stop it!!&quot;</p>





<p> She exclaimed, glaring at him with moist eyes.</p>





<p>&quot;I-I will not tolerate any more rudeness!&quot;</p>





<p> She said that in a trembling voice, but still firm.</p>





<p> The dignity of a noble-born, not a mother who ran a store and lived in the city.</p>





<p> And yet Keith kept grinning.</p>





<p>&quot;Rude? I'm just giving you a massage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You don't have to do that! And your hand... I don't like it!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith laughed at the words.</p>





<p> As if to reveal the true nature of a lowlife.</p>





<p>&quot;What's so funny!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, how can you call someone disgusting after getting you so wet&quot;</p>





<p> Keith pulls his hand out and his fingers are wet.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>





<p> It seems that he is only caressing her pubic area, and Keith's finger is stroking Roana's crack through her panties several times.</p>





<p> Roana, who hadn't been touched by others for a long time, didn't understand it.</p>





<p> Roana was stroked on her ass and, for a short time, got wet by being sexually touched on her important part.</p>





<p> But she was desperate not to admit it. She didn't want to.</p>





<p>&quot;No... I...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No doubt. Roana-sama's pussy became wet just from the massage.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith slowly strokes her groin to prove it.</p>





<p>&quot;I think this is the part Roana-sama wanted to be massaged the most, right?&quot;</p>





<p> At that, she screamed, &quot;No!&quot;, and pulled away from Keith.</p>





<p> Then, fixing her clothes and hugging herself with both hands as if to protect herself, she looked at Keith with tear-stained eyes.</p>





<p>&quot;I will not allow you to touch my body any longer! I will call someone!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith sighed at these words of rejection.</p>





<p>&quot;Why? It felt good, didn't it? Don't you want to feel good?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No!! I don't feel good!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You're so stubborn. Why won't you admit it? You felt it, didn't you?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I didn't feel it!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You were so wet..&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I wasn't! That's a lie!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You know better than anyone that it isn't a lie, right?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Stop it!! Stop it already!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana, shaking her head, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>





<p>&quot;......Why are you so desperate?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... I'm... Kurt's wife! I can't betray him!... No way.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Betray huh...&quot;</p>





<p> As Keith approached Roana, who had retreated to the headrest of the bed, he said.</p>





<p>&quot;You mean you can't betray your husband, who swore to protect you, Roana-sama?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;That's right!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Never?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled cruelly at Roana, who looked at him with a determined gaze.</p>





<p>&quot;But he died leaving Roana-sama... The one who betrayed first was your husband, right?&quot;</p>





<p> The expression disappeared from Roana's face.</p>





<p> He said the words she did not want to hear.</p>





<p> It was what Roana herself had been thinking for a long time.</p>





<p> When Roana was reluctant to marry him, Kurt swore he would never leave her alone.</p>





<p> But then he did a cruel thing and let her take care of him in his old age.</p>





<p> But she told people about Kurt because she wanted someone to say that he didn't betray her, that he left his family.</p>





<p> She wanted them to say that Kurt didn't betray her, that he didn't break his promise.</p>





<p> But Keith simply told Roana what was in the depths of her mind.</p>





<p> As he approached the tearful Roana.</p>





<p>&quot;So it's okay for you to betray your husband, too, Roana-sama......&quot;</p>





<p> With that whisper, he put his hand under the hem of Roana's skirt, went inside her panties, and began to caress her secret part.</p>





<p> There was no resistance.</p>





<p> The love juices had stopped, but he slowly teased it with his hand to get it wet again.</p>





<p> As he stroked the clitoris, he could feel its softness on his fingertips.</p>





<p> He stroked it slowly and carefully and touched her clitoris.</p>





<p>&quot;...Fu.&quot;</p>





<p> A breath escaped from Roana's nose.</p>





<p> The clitoris was just the right size, neither too small nor too large.</p>





<p> When he rubbed the tip that was sticking out of its foreskin, his face approached Roana's face.</p>





<p> Her sad face was so beautiful that he brought his lips close to hers for a kiss.</p>





<p>&quot;...No! Don't...!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana turned her face away from him and resisted.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith... stop... please.&quot;</p>





<p> She had let him caress her secret part so much, and now she didn't want to kiss him.</p>





<p> Keith almost laughed at her strange idea of chastity.</p>





<p>&quot;Then it's okay if it's not a kiss, right?&quot;</p>





<p> He stood up and took off his pants and took out his penis.</p>





<p> He thrusts it, which was still semi-erect, into Roana's face.</p>





<p>&quot;......!&quot;</p>





<p> He heard her gasp, but he didn't care, he put his hand on Roana's head.</p>





<p>&quot;Not a kiss......&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's face contorted as the scent of the male genitalia hit her nose.</p>





<p> The reddish-black male genitalia. The smell of it is so strong that for some reason it made her salivate.</p>





<p>&quot;I...... nh.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana put it in her mouth without saying a word.</p>





<p> The thick penis gradually grew in her mouth.</p>





<p>&quot;Roana-sama's mouth is warm.&quot;</p>





<p> She closed her eyes and continued to caress the penis in her mouth, trying not to look at the happy Keith.</p>





<p> As the hardness and size of the penis increased, her mouth became more and more painful.</p>





<p> The taste of pre-cum stimulated her tongue.</p>





<p>&quot;You are quite used to it, did your husband trained you?&quot;</p>





<p> She glared at Keith at those words. She didn't know that the way she was staring at him was arousing Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Don't be that way, staring at me so much... oh, ooh! The sucking... awesome.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's hips trembled as her tongue teased the tip and licked the glans while her cheeks narrowed.</p>





<p>&quot;Too... good.&quot;</p>





<p> The overflowing saliva made a sound with the movement of Roana's head.</p>





<p>&quot;Jupu, jupu, juppo! Juzo, juzoju.&quot;</p>





<p> The chaste widow's sucking face had a destructive power that made him almost release it just by looking at her.</p>





<p> Keith was pleased by the deft use of her tongue.</p>





<p>&quot;Uhh... whoa, it's coming out...&quot;</p>





<p> As she watched Keith writhe in agony, Roana also felt that his penis was nearing its limit.</p>





<p> It suddenly became funny when she remembered the way the blowjob that she hadn't done in a long time, the penis and the appearance.</p>





<p> Then, placing her hand on the base of his penis, she narrowed her lips more and increased the speed of her head.</p>





<p>&quot;Oooh! Fuoo!!... kuh, ah...!!&quot;</p>





<p> As soon as Keith held Roana's head, his penis twitched and ejaculated.</p>





<p>&quot;Ngh!! Nhh!! Nnh...&quot;</p>





<p> The semen that spurted out stained Roana's mouth.</p>





<p> It was a nostalgic taste.</p>





<p> By the time she thought she should take her mouth away, the ejaculation was over.</p>





<p> She looked for the trash can and spat the semen in her mouth, and Keith pushed her down on the bed.</p>





<p>&quot;It's my turn to make Roana-sama feel good.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana turned her head away, unable to look at any other man's face but Kurt's as he lay on top of her.</p>





<p> Kissing her neck, Keith undressed Roana.</p>





<p> She lifted her back and in turn, he removed the sleepwear she was wearing.</p>





<p> He looked down at Roana's body and swallowed his saliva.</p>





<p> Her breasts were bigger than Aisha's, and her waist was plump.</p>





<p> Her buttocks were taut and had the perfect shape that only a woman who gave birth to a child could have.</p>





<p>&quot;Amazing...... too erotic...... I don't know how you managed to stay away from men for 10 years with a body like this.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana made no reply to the words that could be taken as contempt.</p>





<p>&quot;......Are you going to not talk all the time?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;......You should be able to do it without talking.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Well, if you say so.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith unclasped Roana's front-hook bra, exposing her breasts to the open.</p>





<p> Her large white breasts are soft like a slime, and the nipples are slightly enlarged due to breastfeeding, but they are not misshapen.</p>





<p> He rubbed her breasts with his hands as if he were wrapping them. Massaging them.</p>





<p> He didn't touch the nipples while he rubbed the large breasts with his hands.</p>





<p> When he carefully rubbed the soft fat that seemed to produce a sound.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu!... Nfu.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana exhaled, covering her face with her arms.</p>





<p>&quot;Does that feel good?&quot;</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p> He sucked on her nipple without saying a word as he further abused her silent treatment.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah!! Nhh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Chubo!! Chu, chu, chuppu.&quot;</p>





<p> While licking her nipple and rolling it with the tip of his tongue, he sucked it, even her areola.</p>





<p>&quot;Fua!! Ah!! Kuh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Chupu, it's wonderful that your nipples are so sensitive after having a child, Roana-sama's body is wonderful.&quot;</p>





<p> Saying that, he licked and sucked her nipples again.</p>





<p> Both nipples were licked and sucked again.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/J5Dy8xW/Manga-Zip-info-0245.jpg"></img>


<p> When he felt that the nipples were erect enough, he took his mouth away, pinched them with his fingers, and pulled a little harder.</p>





<p>&quot;Kuhii!! Whoa!!&quot;</p>





<p> The scent of elven nectar wafted from Roana's crotch as he pushed her body down, kneading her erect nipples, which were wet with saliva.</p>





<p> Keith raised himself up.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll undress you, okay?&quot;</p>





<p> Saying that, Roana lifted her hips and Keith lowered her panties.</p>





<p> He then split her knees and inspect the center of her crotch.</p>





<p> Platinum pubic hair was only thick on the clitoris's upper side, but not dense.</p>





<p> Below that, the clitoris was hidden but soft, and it was starting to get erect, though not yet enough.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll spread it ~&quot;</p>





<p> He opened it lightly and found the fleshy meat wet with nectar.</p>





<p> The vaginal hole was undulating and moving softly.</p>





<p>&quot;Ooh, beautiful...&quot;</p>





<p> He expected it to be a little darker since it gave birth to a child, but she is a noble elf, it is a noble thing there too.</p>





<p> He was thinking of touching her clitoris but he puts his finger inside.</p>





<p>&quot;Ow!!......&quot;</p>





<p> Roana raised her voice a little.</p>





<p>&quot;It's all closed up tight...... you haven't fingered it in ten years?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Yes.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana answered with a small voice.</p>





<p>&quot;Okay, I'll loosen it.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith then pulled out a bottle of oil from his bag.</p>





<p> He swallowed down a mouthful of the oil, which was made of natural ingredients and safe to put in the mouth, and with it in his mouth, he placed a pillow on Roana's waist to lift her up a little and began to lick it.</p>





<p> He licked the vaginal hole with his oil-soaked tongue to loosen it, and then pushed his tongue.</p>





<p> Oil spills from the edge of his mouth, but he didn't care and continues licking.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Kuh!! Aaahhh!!! Ah! Ahh!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana started to moan with her hips lifting.</p>





<p> She moaned with a sweet voice. It was just as he had expected.</p>





<p> Keith smeared oil on the vaginal wall while pushing his tongue to loosen the flesh.</p>





<p> When he ran out of oil, he refilled it from the bottle and resumed licking.</p>





<p> He continued to lick without pause.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah!! Kyaa!! Uaa! Ah!!&quot;</p>





<p> When his tongue had fully penetrated, Keith looked up, wiped his mouth, rinsed his mouth with water from the jug, and spit it out into the trash.</p>





<p> Then he strips naked and lubricates his penis, which has regained its hardness from the vaginal licking.</p>





<p>&quot;Can I insert it? If you really don't want to, I won't.&quot;</p>





<p> He removed the pillow from Roana's waist, moved his own hips forward, and stroked her pubic area with his penis as he asked her that question.</p>





<p> Their genitals, wet with oil, made a wet sound.</p>





<p> Roana said nothing, but clutched the sheets as she listened.</p>





<p>&quot;Is it alright? You won't resist? You won't refuse? I'm going to insert my penis, you know?&quot;</p>





<p> Tears were choked by Keith's amused words, but the redeveloped vagina was still aching, and Roana herself couldn't help it.</p>





<p>&quot;Then, I won't hesitate...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled and thrust his hips.</p>
<br>
<p> The thick penis pushed densely into the lubricated, wet vaginal hole.</p>





<p> The sensation of thick flesh, different from that of a tongue or fingers, made Roana's body feel a slight pain, a numbness, and a feeling she had almost forgotten.</p>





<p> The feeling of having two sex organs join together. The pleasure that made her heart melt.</p>





<p> She felt self-loathing at the thought of being penetrated by a man she had just met, a man she did not love.</p>





<p> She exhaled and prevented herself from making a sound during penetration.</p>





<p> But when Keith's penis was fully inside her vagina and she felt an aching sensation coming from her crotch.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu... nhh, ah...&quot;</p>





<p> A sigh escaped from her throat involuntarily.</p>





<p> Keith looked at her with amusement.</p>





<p>&quot;Roana-sama's pussy, it's stiff, but it's good...... I think it would be better if I loosen it a bit more.&quot;</p>





<p> He said that and began to thrust his hips slowly.</p>





<p> The speed of his hips gradually increased as the sound of oil, rather than love juice, echoed through the room.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah... nhh!! Ah! Ahh!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana couldn't stop herself from raising her voice as her legs were held and the penis began to move in and out faster.</p>





<p> The pain was gone, and instead, the feeling of the penis stimulating her vaginal walls began to reach her brain as pleasurable information.</p>





<p>&quot;Fua!! Haa... nhh, haa... haa... nnhh!!&quot;</p>





<p> As she moved harder, Roana's ample breasts began to sway and change shape.</p>





<p> Watching that, Keith changed the position of his thrusts, changing the movement from just back and forth thrusting to stimulating the upper part of her vagina.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah!! Ahhn!!! Nhh!! Nhh!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's hand squeezed the pillow under her head.</p>





<p> Closing her eyes and shaking her head from side to side, she tried desperately to endure the pressure on her weak points.</p>





<p>&quot;Roana-sama why are you holding back? You can let loose, you know?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith didn't stop thrusting, and when he smiled and said to her.</p>





<p>&quot;No... ah!! Ahh!! Noo!!&quot;</p>





<p> The situation came to a point where she can't go back anymore. Still, in the depths of her heart, there is a voice saying that she shouldn't do it, that it's the only thing she should not do.</p>





<p> Roana felt as if that voice was right, and she continued to endure, shaking her head frantically, trying to discard the information being sent from her vagina to her brain.</p>





<p> Keith was so amused by the sight of Roana that he almost laughed, moving his hips down and moving in and out.</p>





<p> Keith began to stimulate Roana's clitoris by rubbing it.</p>





<p> Roana, who was being stimulated on her vagina and clitoris at the same time</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Ahhh!!! Aaaahhhhh!!&quot;</p>





<p> She screamed and lifts her hips several times, opening her closed eyes to look at Keith.</p>





<p> A man other than Kurt is inside her, spreading her legs.</p>





<p> And yet it feels so good. So much so that her hips lift and screaming.</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Ah! Ahh!! No! Stop! No more!! Even though I don't want it!! Kyaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith felt her vaginal flesh suddenly begin to twitch and tighten.</p>





<p>&quot;Nope!! Too late!! I'm already near my limit!!! Look!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Agaa!!! Ahh!! Aahhh!!! No!! Noo!! Help me!! Kurt!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith, who is in a position to make Roana, who calls her dead husband's name, cum, unleashes one last attack on her and estimates the moment of climax from the undulation and tightness of her vaginal flesh.</p>





<p> He stirred the folds of her vagina, which had loosened and become coated with her love juices, with his penis, and just when he thought Roana was about to climax.</p>





<p>&quot;Like I said, your husband left you and died.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah... aaahhhhh!!!!&quot;</p>





<p> With despair, Roana climaxed.</p>





<p> Tears flowed unceasingly.</p>





<p> While her mind was in such despair, only her body was filled with satisfaction.</p>





<p> It had been more than 10 years since she had sex.</p>





<p> The last time she had sex was six months before Kurt's death, when he suddenly asked her to hold him.</p>





<p> At that time, she welcomed Kurt with care so as not to burden him.</p>





<p> Her heart was satisfied, but her body was not. She was not satisfied. And she had always wanted to be satisfied.</p>





<p> That's why it was so easy for her to fall into the arms of this man.</p>





<p> It made Roana laugh to think that her body was seeking something like this after all.</p>





<p> So she cried while laughing.</p>





<p> She felt Keith's penis still hard inside her without ejaculating.</p>





<p> She couldn't control her vagina, which was wriggling around trying to make the penis ejaculate.</p>





<p>&quot;I also want to cum... can I use Roana-sama's thing?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith said to her as if her vagina was an object.</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Go ahead.&quot;</p>





<p> Without looking at his face, she said casually.</p>





<p> She didn't care anymore.</p>





<p> It has been ten years since Kurt died. It only seemed like a year for the noble elves, but she was already inviting another human&#8213;&#8213;&#8213; and a human she just met.</p>





<p> Keith heard Roana's words with pleasure.</p>





<p>&quot;I see. Well then.&quot;</p>





<p> He then lifted her legs and put them on his shoulders, and began to thrust deeply into her.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Agu!! Agaa!!!!&quot;</p>





<p> As soon as he thrust deep into her vagina, near the opening of her womb, she felt a sensation like an electric current running through her body.</p>





<p>&quot;Wha? Eh? Ah! Ahh!! Hyaguu!!! Hii!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana screamed and grabbed the sheets.</p>





<p> Her mind and body were confused by the sensations she had never felt before.</p>





<p>&quot;Wha? What!? This! Higuu!! Aahhhh!!! Kuh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah ~ ~ ~, you gave birth, after all, so you're ready for this position.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith muttered to himself as he continued to pound away at Roana's depths.</p>





<p> He had no intention of ejaculating after the first insertion.</p>





<p> He had done it to loosen her vagina and to remind her body of climax.</p>





<p> And to stimulate the womb that came down with it.</p>





<p> He felt the tip of the glans and poked her womb, shaking it.</p>





<p> While kissing the leg on his shoulder, he kept stimulating her.</p>





<p>&quot;Ooh!! Oohh!! Ahhh!! Nghh!!! Ahhh!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's beautiful face contorted and she screamed like an animal, her body shaking with the sensation.</p>





<p> The first womb pleasure in her life.</p>





<p> Waves of pleasure that she had never experienced during sex with Kurt hit her.</p>





<p> Every time her womb was shaken up, she felt a jolt that shook her depths.</p>





<p> After a few more of that, Roana felt that her body, which had just climaxed, was about to cum, and she cried out in horror.</p>





<p>&quot;Stooop!!! Stop that!! Please!!! Ah!!! Higuu!! Guaahh!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I can use it... whoa! You said that, right? Kuh!! Ahh ~ ~, developed pussy feels so good. It's soft and fluffy inside.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No!! This is!! This is no good!!! Agyaa!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's too late... for that!!&quot;</p>





<p> He leaned his upper body, bending Roana's body and going even deeper.</p>





<p>&quot;Uu!! Uuuu!!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Looks like Roana-sama is going to cum again.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No! I don't want to... this is ... uaa!! Aahhh!!!&quot;</p>





<p> She climaxed a second time.</p>





<p> But Keith does not stop moving his hips.</p>





<p> Her pussy flesh was squeezing and tightening, unlike before, and Roana was saying, &quot;Ahh! Ahh!&quot; and tears streamed down her face as she looked at the ceiling, but he did not stop poking her womb.</p>





<p> Even after reaching a blank-mind climax, Roana realized that Keith was trying to corrupt her.</p>





<p> So, like a child, she contorted her face and cried out.</p>





<p>&quot;Please... stop already... uu...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled at that.</p>





<p>&quot;I'm not going to stop, I haven't cum yet, you know? You're the one who came twice, and I only climaxed using your mouth, so I'm not going to hold back, you know?&quot;</p>





<p> He then rotated his hips in a circular motion, kneading her vagina, this time with a deep thrust.</p>





<p>&quot;Besides, I'm getting ready to cum inside you, Roana-sama.&quot;</p>





<p> A storm of semen was about to hit Roana, to the point of no return.</p>





<p>&quot;No... I don't want that... I'll do anything, so stop already...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hee...&quot;</p>





<p> Keith stopped moving his hips at Roana's words, and then he removed her legs off his shoulders and returned her to a normal position.</p>





<p> He then put his hands around her waist and lifted her light body up.</p>





<p> Keith's face appeared right in front of her.</p>





<p> She was now in a sitting position facing him.</p>





<p> Breathing heavily, Roana stared at him.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll stop. So please move and make me cum, Roana-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Th...... that's.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It's a promise, but you'll do anything, right?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith says in a light tone as he holds and secures her waist.</p>





<p> She was puzzled by it.</p>





<p>&quot;Well, what I did earlier, I can do it again, you know?&quot;</p>





<p> A threat.</p>





<p> Roana shook her head very slowly.</p>





<p>&quot;I'll do it... I'll do it...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Please.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith put his hands behind his back and looked at her.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu, nhh... fuu!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana moves her body slowly up and down.</p>





<p> The movement was frustrating.</p>





<p>&quot;I can't cum unless you do it faster.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Th... that's! Because... uu!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith's penis was now as deep inside Roana as it had been a moment before.</p>





<p> If she moved a little faster, she would cum again.</p>





<p> When he thought so, he realized that Roana would maintain that movement until the end.</p>





<p> But it's too late.</p>





<p> She was moving her body up and down slowly, trying not to climax with a frown on her face.</p>





<p>&quot;It's so frustrating!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith lifts his hips from below and thrusts upward.</p>





<p>&quot;Gahh!!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith thrusts his hips up and down again and again, making Roana's throat show, and she gasps.</p>





<p>&quot;Look! You're an ex-wife, you know! That's no way to make a man cum!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Stop!! Hauu!! Haguu!! ...!! I'll move!! I'll do it properly!!&quot;</p>





<p> The thrusting stops.</p>



<p> Roana regains her breath and speeds up her up-and-down motion.</p>





<p> Her face is contorted with pain from pleasure, her platinum hair is disheveled, and sweat showed on her face.</p>





<p>&quot;Fua! Fuaa!! Fuu!! Fuu!!! Nhh!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith smiled happily as he watches Roana move just to make Keith ejaculate while exhaling.</p>





<p> His penis was softly loosened and entwined with vaginal flesh that had experienced several climaxes and regained its old state.</p>





<p> Keith still held on to the feeling of being rubbed by the folds of her vagina, and the ejaculation rising from the satisfaction of Roana's contorted face.</p>





<p> When it didn't come out, Roana said.</p>





<p>&quot;Why? Why! Cum quickly!!!&quot;</p>





<p> She couldn't take it anymore.</p>





<p> She couldn't control her desire to cum.</p>





<p> So she shouted.</p>





<p> Then Keith responded to her pleas.</p>





<p>&quot;It feels so good......... I might cum if you kiss me...&quot;</p>





<p> He said in a playful manner.</p>





<p> Roana shook her head no, crying like a child.</p>





<p>&quot;Well, good luck, Roana-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Uu... uu... uaa... if I kissed you... you'll cum, right?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Probably.&quot;</p>





<p> I don't think so.</p>





<p> Keith smiled as he muttered that in his mind.</p>





<p> Keith put his hands around Roana's waist.</p>





<p> Roana put her arms around Keith's neck.</p>





<p>&quot;Haa... chu.&quot;</p>





<p> Their lips met.</p>





<p> It didn't take long for Keith's tongue to enter Roana's mouth.</p>





<p>&quot;Fu! Nchu, rero, chupa, chu, chu, chu, rero.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's tongue made few movements as if rejecting it, but Keith's tongue moved wildly to compensate and intertwine with hers.</p>





<p> As they drank each other's saliva, Keith began thrusting his hips up from below.</p>





<p>&quot;Fubuu!!? Ah, nchu!! Rero, chu, chu, chu!! Nhh, stop, nchu!!&quot;</p>





<p> Hugging and kissing Roana's slender but plump body, he thrusts violently.</p>





<p> Roana also has her hands around his neck, their appearance can only be seen as lovers.</p>





<p> Understanding that, and knowing that Keith was trying to make her cum again.</p>





<p>&quot;Liar!! Nchu!! Rechu, chu!! Cumming!!! Guiiiii!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith held Roana's hips with so much force that he felt as if he might break them, and never let go of her lips, which were about to part. She climaxed again.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/rFdRtDN/Manga-Zip-info-0256.jpg"></img>


<p> After pulling his penis out of Roana, who was leaning against him, Keith lay her down and thrust her ass up into the air.</p>





<p> He kissed her cunt, which was all red, bloodshot, and swollen.</p>





<p>&quot;Well, how many times will this used pussy be used before I let it out?&quot;</p>





<p> He whispered that to her vagina and then thrust his swollen glans into her.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> For the next hour, Roana continued to be penetrated by Keith.</p>





<p> He stopped counting the number of times she climaxed after the fifth time.</p>





<p> Toward the end, her gasps were so abrasive that she could only say &quot;Ahh&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;.......&quot;</p>





<p> Even so, her body continued to climax over and over again, as if she had accumulated all of that for the past ten years.</p>





<p> Keith changed his position every time he felt himself about to cum, rubbed her breasts, kissed her, and held it in.</p>





<p> Roana did not resist any of these actions anymore.</p>





<p> She silently sucked and licked Keith's tongue with her mouth, which was thrust out when he asked her to suck his tongue during the kiss.</p>





<p> There was no dead husband, no daughter, no store at that moment.</p>





<p> But how far would this continue? How long would this last?</p>





<p> Thinking so, she clung to the man who gave it to her.</p>





<p> When the man finally reached his limit, Roana lifted herself up, spreading her legs, and kissed him, which she had hated so much.</p>





<p>&quot;Roana-sama... kuh! Uu! You're good at kissing.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Chu, habu, chu... nchu.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nrero, chu! Whoa... not good, I think it's the limit... chu.&quot;</p>





<p> The sweaty Keith was giving a final piston to Roana as she rode him.</p>





<p> His penis was numb from the repeated endurance.</p>





<p> The thought of not having to endure the feeling of ejaculation this time gave him goosebumps.</p>





<p> So he kissed her again.</p>





<p>&quot;I think it's going to come out... when is Roana-sama's ovulation day?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh, chu... I don't know... I haven't done it for a long time.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;&#12540;, but, oh well. If it goes well, your family will grow.&quot;</p>





<p> Chuckling lightly despite the wild movement of his hips, Keith releases his semen that rushes up from his lower body for what seems like the umpteenth time.</p>





<p>&quot;Ufuo!! It's here!! Ooohh!! It's here, it's here, it's here. It's coming ouut!!&quot;</p>





<p> Roana also moves her hips, getting ready to be impregnated as he prepared for his ejaculation.</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa... kuh!! Intensee...!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah! Ah! Ah!!! Kuh!!! Gah!!&quot;</p>





<p> The first vaginal cum shot this day.</p>





<p> For Roana, it was the first semen she had felt in her womb in a decade.</p>





<p> She could feel her womb, which had been continuously poked, happily gulping down the semen.</p>





<p> That sensation made her suddenly calm down.</p>





<p>&quot;Semen... it came out... uu, uu... even though it's wrong... this is... I...&quot;</p>





<p> To such Roana.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuoo!! Too much!!! It's not stopping&#12540;&#12540;. Kuaahh!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith, who didn't seem to mind at all, let out his last drop of cum.</p>





<p>&quot;As expected of a ripe pussy. The amount of semen it's drinking is different.&quot;</p>





<p> The pussy flesh tightens around the penis to squeeze it out, and the womb opens up to accept the seed juices.</p>





<p> He was so impressed with Roana that he let out a few words.</p>





<p> Then, he pulled out his penis, which was slightly sore from the prolonged erection, and he told the mature elf, who was crying.</p>





<p>&quot;It was good. I will help you if you ever want to forget many things again.&quot;</p>





<p> With that, he kissed her on the cheek, got dressed, and left the room.</p>





<p> As he left, he did not forget to deodorize the room.</p>





<p> As Roana sat on the bed crying, waiting for her body to calm down, there was a knock at the door and Fiel's voice was heard.</p>





<p>&quot;The guest has just left...... may I come in?&quot;</p>





<p> She got up in a hurry.</p>





<p>&quot;No!! Wait a minute!!&quot;</p>





<p> She shakes off the numbing afterglow and muscle ache from the first sex she's had in a long time and sets the bed in order.</p>





<p> She cleaned the sheets that were covered in Roana's sweat and love juices using magic and threw the contents of the trash can by pouring them into the sink.</p>





<p> Then, after preparing the bath with the spirit stone, she called out to Fiel to let her into the room.</p>





<p>&quot;Is Roana-sama taking a bath?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Y-yeah...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Let me get you a towel.&quot;</p>





<p> She bowed her head and Roana made sure Fiel was not suspicious as she left the bathroom, and when she saw no sign of her, she sank her mouth in the bathtub.</p>





<p> The water causes a mass of Keith's white fluid from her vagina to float in the bathtub.</p>





<p> As she felt goosebumps when scraping it out, Roana cried again.</p>















<p>...</p>















<p> The plan was to stay for three days, but Roana decided to call it off and go home.</p>





<p> She did not want to stay here even for a second.</p>





<p> Her daughter Erne complained, but she told her that she had to go to work.</p>





<p> On the airship ride home and after returning to the store, Roana tried her best to act normal.</p>





<p> She went out to the store as a normal manager, a normal mother, and lived a normal life.</p>





<p> But everyone around her, including Erne, knew that this was just empty cheerfulness.</p>





<p> It is because Roana's strength and her calm but vivacious nature are gone, and instead, she spends more time thinking and brooding.</p>





<p>&quot;Are you okay, Mom?&quot;</p>





<p> How many times has Erne asked her that?</p>





<p> Every time she smiled and say, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;, she didn't know how long she could deceive her.</p>





<p> So she thought she needed to forget about it as soon as possible, but&#8213;&#8213;&#8213; which &quot;thing&quot; is it that she wanted to forget about?</p>





<p> Is it the husband who died on his own without keeping his word?</p>





<p> Or is it about running a store that she will never get used to?</p>





<p> Or is it about the half-elf daughter who will one day die leaving her behind?</p>





<p> Time to forget all of them... such a moment...</p>





<p>&quot;Manager?&quot;</p>





<p> The old shopkeeper called out to her unexpectedly, and Roana looked up.</p>





<p> She was in the store. She was at work.</p>





<p> What was I thinking?</p>





<p> She was annoyed at herself for having such stupid thoughts for a long time now, but she still kept a calm face.</p>





<p>&quot;Sorry, I was just thinking.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, I was thinking more about the stocking.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Purchasing will continue as before......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I mean, we have a special order for spirit stones, and we're running low on stock, so we have to go directly to Seimrad.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p> Her heart raced.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8NhgKjd/Manga-Zip-info-0263.jpg"></img>


<p> Is he going to Seimrad?</p>





<p> Are we going to Seimrad?</p>





<p> Once again... again...</p>





<p>&quot;So, either me or Grant-san is.......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Me!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I'll... go.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;The manager? In person?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes... I'll... go.&quot;</p>





<p> Roana's face was filled with a smile for the first time in a long time.</p>
