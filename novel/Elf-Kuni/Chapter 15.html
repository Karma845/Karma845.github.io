<h3>Chapter 15: Female Knight, I Accept</h3>

<p>Lou woke up in the middle of the night on its bed and stretched out.</p>



<p>Looking around, it saw Keith fiddling with something under the light of the desk lamp.</p>



<p>&quot;Master, what are you making this time, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>Lou asked from the bed.</p>



<p>&quot;The other day, Worland-san said his hips gave out again... So I thought I&apos;d give him a painkiller... To thank him for giving me an excellent quality Mithril.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t think Master is concerned for the well-being of others, nyaa.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Shut up, worthless cat.&quot;</p>



<p>Just as Lou was about to fall asleep again while watching Keith, who continued to fiddle with something while saying that, it heard a clacking sound.</p>



<p>&quot;Nya?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith heard it, too, and looked around the room.</p>



<p>Then there was another clacking sound.</p>



<p>Realizing that it was the sound of something hitting the windowpane, Keith opened the window and looked out, but there was nothing there.</p>



<p>&quot;Die.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Master!!&quot;</p>



<p>Lou jumped up and pulled Keith by the collar.</p>



<p>&quot;Gue!&quot;</p>



<p>Keith fell on his back, screaming like a frog being run over, and the blade went through where his neck had been.</p>



<p>&quot;Oh!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Tch!!&quot;</p>



<p>A clicking of a tongue can be heard.</p>



<p>He knew someone is there, but he can only dimly see who it is.</p>



<p>It is some kind of magic to hide their appearance or some other kind of magic tool.</p>



<p>But Keith doesn&apos;t know of any magic or tool that can conceal a person&apos;s appearance with this level of accuracy.</p>



<p>For a moment, he wanted to praise Lou for having figured it out, but now was not the time for that.</p>



<p>He reached out and grabbed the driftwood magic staff he had left under the bed instead of the magic staff the king had given him.</p>



<p>&quot;Lou! Close your eyes!!&quot;</p>



<p>He shouted and used a flash of magic.</p>



<p>A torrent of light floods the room, and Lou&apos;s voice is heard saying, &quot;Funya!!&quot; and the intruder&apos;s voice, &quot;Guh!!&quot;.</p>



<p>Keith keeps his eyes closed and continues to perform a temporary magic disablement.</p>



<p>Then, as soon as the flash subsides, the intruder&apos;s figure is revealed.</p>



<p>A figure in a black cloak.</p>



<p>If the invisibility was due to magic, it would be meaningless, but if it was due to the cloak, as he thought so, he pulled off the cloak of the intruder who was still blinded by the light.</p>



<p>There she was.</p>



<p>&quot;A-Aisha... sama?&quot;</p>



<p>It was Aisha.</p>



<p>She was dressed in hot pants, boots, and a turtleneck sweater, instead of her usual uniform.</p>



<p>And in her hand, she was holding a large, sharp Kukri knife.</p>



<p>The thought of being slashed with it gave Keith goosebumps.</p>



<p>Aisha&apos;s cloak is stripped away, and she realizes that she is visible.</p>



<p>&quot;Kuh!!&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha frowned, but quickly changed her mind and rushed forward with her blade held horizontally.</p>



<p>&quot;Uhyaaa!!!&quot;</p>



<p>He screamed and barely blocked the blade with his staff.</p>



<p>&quot;A-A-A-Aisha-sama!? What in the world do you want at this hour?&quot;</p>



<p>The woman&apos;s behavior indicates that she is here to kill him, but he can&apos;t help but ask such a question.</p>



<p>Aisha, on the other hand, did not blink at all, staring at Keith&apos;s face.</p>



<p>&quot;Of course I&apos;m here to kill you. You lowlife.&quot;</p>



<p>She said that and swatted him away.</p>



<p>&quot;Ugyaa!!&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha, who was riding on Keith as he fell to the floor, gripped the knife with both hands and said.</p>



<p>&quot;Die, lowlife.&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha swung the knife down on Keith&apos;s face.</p>



<p>&quot;Master!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ouch!!!&quot;</p>



<p>Again, Lou bit Keith&apos;s ear and pulled.</p>



<p>His neck bent toward Lou&apos;s pull, and the blade only sliced the skin of his neck.</p>



<p>Keith desperately grabbed Aisha&apos;s hand to stop her as she tried to pull the blade out of the floor.</p>



<p>&quot;Let go!! You bastard!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Wait a minute! May I ask why you&apos;re trying to kill me?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Reason? The reason!! It&apos;s obvious!! It&apos;s about Naia-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;W-what have I done to the Princess!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What!? What you&apos;ve done!? You lowlife!!! Did you think that the vile deed you did to Naia-sama would not be noticed?!!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Geh!!?&quot;</p>



<p>I&apos;ve been exposed.</p>



<p>It&apos;s not good.</p>



<p>It&apos;s not even that close!!</p>



<p>If they found out about it, it&apos;s no wonder they&apos;re going to kill me.</p>



<p>But I don&apos;t want to be killed!!</p>



<p>Think.</p>



<p>Think, think.</p>



<p>Did the whole palace know about it?</p>



<p>&quot;You mean, it isn&apos;t just Aisha-sama who knew it!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;How can I tell anyone else about Naia-sama&apos;s lasciviousness!!!&quot;</p>



<p>Yes! This elf, a goofball who is only loyal!!</p>



<p>In Keith&apos;s mind, his eloquence was on fire.</p>



<p>If he messed up here, he would surely be killed by this female elf.</p>



<p>&quot;B-but, you must know, that the Princess and me is...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Shut up!! Don&apos;t talk anymore!! I know what I know!! I know!!! I know that you used magic to brainwash Naia-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Hmm!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Otherwise, Naia-sama would never have...... made such a vile abomination...... Damn it!! I&apos;ll kill you!! I&apos;ll kill you, you bastard!!&quot;</p>



<p>The force with which she tried to pull out the knife became even stronger, and he could no longer hold it back.</p>



<p>If he was going to be killed anyway...... Keith decided to trust his ability to talk his way out of the situation.</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha-sama! I-I didn&apos;t use brainwashing!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;D-don&apos;t lie!! Naia-sama would never do those things with you without brainwashing her!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That&apos;s because, as a matter of fact, my body has been fused with a magic tool......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What about it!!! What the hell does that have to do with Naia-sama!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;T-the magic tool is actually a tool that is necessary for the princess to be able to use magic......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Like, I, said... What does that have to do with what you did to Naia-sama!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, as I said, In order to prevent the fused magic tool from taking over my body, I need someone else to supply it with mana!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;......I see, that&apos;s how you and Naia-sama did it.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes! That&apos;s right!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see, I see, then you can rest easy now. You&apos;re going to die now, so you don&apos;t have to worry about the magic tool anymore. So die in peace!!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Wait, wait, wait!!!&quot;</p>



<p>It&apos;s useless.</p>



<p>The same excuses I gave to Naia will not work, of course.</p>



<p>Then&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>



<p>&quot;Do you think I would lay a hand on the princess of a country without any insurance?&quot;</p>



<p>Keith made a wicked face as best he could.</p>



<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha-sama, have you ever heard of the thing [copy crystal]?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Copy... crystal...&quot;</p>



<p>When she understood Keith&apos;s words, Aisha&apos;s face, which had been red with excitement, suddenly turned pale.</p>



<p>&quot;T-that&apos;s ridiculous!! It&apos;s not supposed to be able to capture such an act!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Who do you think I am? I am the mage who defeated the basilisk and bestowed magic on the princess! Improving a magic tool like that is easier than slaying a slime!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s a lie! Of course, it&apos;s a lie! It&apos;s just an excuse because you don&apos;t want to be killed!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;If you think it&apos;s a lie, then keep on thinking it!! If I get killed or disappeared, it will be publicized!! Then, at best, you will see me and the princess together!!&quot;</p>



<p>Of course, it&apos;s a lie.</p>



<p>That video is still in my desk drawer because it&apos;s only for my own enjoyment.</p>



<p>And, due to the nature of the magic tool, it is impossible to duplicate it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But at Keith&apos;s words, Aisha put her left hand behind her back from her grip on the kukri knife, pulled out a small dagger knife and held it to his throat.</p>



<p>&quot;Where is the crystal?... Be honest...&quot;</p>



<p>Her eyes are not that of the shining eyes full of chivalry.</p>



<p>They were the eyes of an angry, emotionless murderer.</p>



<p>But Keith was not intimidated.</p>



<p>&quot;I won&apos;t tell you. I would die if I told you.&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha thought as she looked into the eyes that stared back at her.</p>



<p>She thought, &quot;This is a lie, of course. The moment he can&apos;t tell the truth is the proof&quot;.</p>



<p>But deep down inside, a voice said, &quot;What if it&apos;s true?&quot;.</p>



<p>What if it was true?</p>



<p>What if the princess of a country...... the perversity of a noble elf doing it with a human mage were to be spread to the world?</p>



<p>Naia would be disowned, disassociated, and thrown out.</p>



<p>She will not be stoned for adultery like in the old days, but she will still have a bad reputation for the rest of her life.</p>



<p>In this world, good deeds are hard to keep, but bad deeds will haunt one for a hundred years.</p>



<p>Naia is 24 years old now. For the next 750 years, will she be called a whore for the rest of her life?</p>



<p>That woman? That Naia-sama?</p>



<p>No, no, no, no!!!</p>



<p>&quot;That&apos;s not gooood!!!!... Ugh!&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha screamed, throwing down the knife.</p>



<p>She can&apos;t do anything.</p>



<p>She can&apos;t kill this man, she can&apos;t take the crystal, she can&apos;t see if it&apos;s true or not...... she can&apos;t save Naia.</p>



<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;No, she can.</p>



<p>There is only one thing she can do.</p>



<p>Yes, Aisha, she can.</p>



<p>Because she is a &quot;woman&quot;.</p>



<p>&quot;Mage&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>Keith was puzzled by the quiet tone of her voice.</p>



<p>&quot;W-what is it?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You told me that you were doing that with Naia-sama in order to appease the magic tool that has fused with you......&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Does it have to be Naia-sama?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ha?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Can&apos;t I... do it?&quot;</p>



<p>The room became awfully quiet.</p>



<p>It was as if the air had stopped transmitting sound.</p>



<p>&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Use my body in place of Naia-sama&apos;s and learn...... to supply it with mana, but in return, don&apos;t touch Naia-sama at all from now on.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith looked up at Aisha who was on top of him.</p>



<p>&quot;Do you know what you&apos;re talking about?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yeah...... I&apos;m supposed to send mana to that tool, right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Do you know where that tool is?&quot;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&quot;Male genitalia, you know?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;I see.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;You&apos;re not surprised?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;</p>



<p>Whether or not the story about the fusion with the magic tool is true or not is not important to Aisha.</p>



<p>The only thing that matters is that Keith never touches Naia again and that the videos captured by the crystal are never shown to the world.</p>



<p>She will accept whatever it takes to make that happen.</p>



<p>She will believe everything this man says and do everything he wants her to do.</p>



<p>If she could save Naia by doing so, it would be a small price to pay.</p>



<p>Looking at Aisha&apos;s face.</p>



<p>&quot;Hey, worthless cat.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith called out to Lou, who had been watching the whole thing.</p>



<p>Lou, who had guessed the general situation from the conversation, asked.</p>



<p>&quot;What is it, nyaa? Awful master.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Shut up. Here.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith then pulled out a gold coin from his pocket and tossed it.</p>



<p>Lou looked at it as it fell in front of it with a clink.</p>



<p>&quot;What, nyaa?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m thanking you for saving my life. Go eat something tasty. Don&apos;t come back for the night.&quot;</p>



<p>Understanding what its master was saying, the clever cat put the gold coin in its mouth and deftly placed it between its collars. Then.</p>



<p>&quot;You&apos;re the worst, nyaa. I shouldn&apos;t have helped, nyaa!&quot;</p>



<p>With these words, Lou went out through the open window.</p>



<p>&quot;Leave me alone.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith muttered, then.</p>



<p>&quot;Please get off of me for now.&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha quietly complied.</p>



<p>Keith stood up, took a breath, and picked up both knives on the floor, but Aisha didn&apos;t react.</p>



<p>&quot;No resistance...&quot;</p>



<p>The atmosphere was as if she could die right now but if I told her I was going to cast the oath spell to keep the promise.</p>



<p>That&apos;s no fun, is it?</p>



<p>I don&apos;t want an emotionless woman like that.</p>



<p>Keith said to Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;Show me the proof.&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha looked up.</p>



<p>&quot;Proof?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Proof that you won&apos;t resist, go against me, or try to kill me if I do something like that with you.&quot;</p>



<p>It&apos;s obvious to him that she would never do such a thing, but he still said it.</p>



<p>&quot;&hellip;&hellip;What should I do?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Well, for the time being, take off your clothes.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...Right here?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>



<p>Her hesitation was a moment.</p>



<p>Aisha immediately stood up and began to undress.</p>



<p>She pulls down her hot pants, takes off her boots, and removes her sweater.</p>



<p>When she took off her clothes, her ample breasts appeared, swaying and jiggling.</p>



<p>Her two breasts are wrapped in a pure white bra that shines against her brown skin.</p>



<p>She seemed to be a skinny type and they were much larger than I had imagined.</p>



<p>The matching panties covered the important place between her plump thighs.</p>



<p>&quot;Please take those off, too.&quot;</p>



<p>She resumed her stopped movements.</p>



<p>First, she took off her bra and then her panties.</p>



<p>Keith couldn&apos;t help but salivate at the sight of Aisha&apos;s completely nude body.</p>



<p>It was a woman&apos;s body that was close to completion, different from Naia&apos;s semi-mature body.</p>



<p>If it were a human body, she would have the body of a woman in her late teens.</p>



<p>Her breasts were ample, and her areolas and nipples were a little darker brown than her skin color.</p>



<p>Her waist is toned and her muscles are not too tight.</p>



<p>When he looked down from her abdominal muscles, he noticed her silver-colored pubic hair, which was a little darker than her hair, but that didn&apos;t stop him from looking.</p>



<p>The hair is a little darker than the rest of her body, but that only adds to the eroticism of the figure.</p>



<p>&quot;Don&apos;t hide it, let me see it.&quot;</p>



<p>He stopped her from trying to cover her secret parts with her hands.</p>



<p>Keith couldn&apos;t stop the grin on his face at the thought of being able to do whatever he wanted with this body from now on.</p>
