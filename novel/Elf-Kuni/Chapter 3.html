<h3>Chapter 3: Let's Start the Treatment</h3>


<p>The next day, Keith head to Naia&apos;s room in the early afternoon.</p>



<p>The only difference from yesterday is that the amount of things he is carrying had increased.</p>



<p>Led by the knight, he walked down the hallway and entered the room.</p>



<p>Naia is happy and Aisha looks like she is about to bite him.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama, Keith-sama!&quot;</p>



<p>She approached him like a dog, which probably makes Aisha feel even more aggravated.</p>



<p>Staring at him that seemed to say, &quot;Hey, you&apos;re really going to bleed if you don&apos;t behave&quot;. and pressured him.</p>



<p>But when Naia told Aisha to go outside because the lessons are about to start, Aisha left, again looking like an abandoned puppy.</p>



<p>Relieved that the danger is gone.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama, the treatment you promised!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia is excited, her small chest heaving with anticipation, as though she had been thinking about it since yesterday.</p>



<p>It was not surprising, since she thought that now she could finally use magic.</p>



<p>Keith said, &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; and began preparing.</p>



<p>He laid a sheet made of water dragon skin on the floor and spread a clean sheet on top of it. Then placed one small pillow on it.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, please lie down.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Here?&quot;</p>



<p>Naia tried to lie down as she was told.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah no, take off your clothes.&quot;</p>



<p>At Keith&apos;s words,</p>



<p>&quot;T-take my clothes off!?&quot;</p>



<p>She was very surprised.</p>



<p>And it surprised Keith.</p>



<p>Because royalty and nobility have everything done for them by others, their sense of shame is at a different level from that of commoners.</p>



<p>Therefore, they are not embarrassed by the slightest thing.</p>



<p>Besides, he told her that this is a treatment. So he didn&apos;t think it&apos;s strange to be naked.</p>



<p>That was what he&apos;s thinking.</p>



<p>&quot;.........In front of Keith-sama... naked...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;If it&apos;s impossible, I&apos;ll think about something else...&quot;</p>



<p>At Keith&apos;s words.</p>



<p>&quot;...No, I asked for it. I will do it.&quot;</p>



<p>When she said that, she took off her clothes.</p>



<p>Her skin is translucent white and her body is thin.</p>



<p>Her breasts and hips are not developed yet, but they are beginning to swell up a little bit.</p>



<p>Naia, who was turning bright red, was trying her best to cover her breasts and crotch with her hands.</p>



<p>&quot;I-Is this okay?&quot;</p>



<p>She asked.</p>



<p>She was red all the way to the tips of her pointed ears.</p>



<p>&quot;That&apos;s fine. Please lie down.&quot;</p>



<p>He also thought it was a beautiful body, and to be honest, he was nervous, but if he showed it, Naia would get even more anxious.</p>



<p>Keith thought so and calmly gave instructions.</p>



<p>When Naia lay down, she had a spotless back, rounded buttocks, and slender legs.</p>



<p>It was a delicious body. But he resisted the urge to eat it right away and decided to begin the treatment.</p>



<p>He took out a small bottle from the bag he had brought with him.</p>



<p>&quot;That is?&quot;</p>



<p>Naia, who was looking at him sideways, asked.</p>



<p>&quot;It is a mixture of plant sap, honey, medicinal wine. They are all natural ingredients, but...... for now.&quot;</p>



<p>With that, he took a little and applied some on Nai&apos;a&apos;s arm.</p>



<p>He then casts a spell, but Naia&apos;s body does not react in any particular way.</p>



<p>&quot;There is no particular problem. Then.&quot;</p>



<p>What he just did was a kind of allergic reaction test.</p>



<p>If she got a rash, it would be a big problem.</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s a little cold.&quot;</p>



<p>He then dripped the liquid onto Naia&apos;s back.</p>



<p>&quot;Hyaa!&quot;</p>



<p>Naia raised her voice at the coldness of the liquid.</p>



<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh... yeah. I was just a little surprised...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Then, I will continue.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith finished pouring the liquid and then smeared it over her back with both hands.</p>



<p>His hand crawls over Naia&apos;s back as the sound of liquid and the sensation of squeezing echo.</p>



<p>But not too strong and not too weak.</p>



<p>Sometimes his thumbs press down on her neck, behind her shoulder blades, along her spine, and from her liver side, the sensation spreads across her entire back.</p>



<p>&quot;Kufuu...&quot; Her voice leaked out.</p>



<p>She bit down on the pillow in desperation, trying to hold on, but as Keith&apos;s palm squeezed up to encircle her waist, and his thumb pressed the center of her lower waist, she felt the warmth of his hand on her back.</p>



<p>&quot;Hyuu!... ah, kuh, uuu.&quot;</p>



<p>Her voice leaked out along with her drool.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to move from your hips to your legs.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Fuee...? ah, my butt...&quot;</p>



<p>When she said that, Keith&apos;s palm was already squeezing Naia&apos;s rounded, raised buttocks, pushing hard with his palm.</p>



<p>The peach-like flesh of her buttocks shook and swayed as he applied pressure, and he could feel the tension in the flesh.</p>



<p>When he squeezed his thumb from the border between her buttocks and legs to the dimple on her buttocks, he heard Naia&apos;s voice saying &quot;Ahh!&quot;.</p>



<p>At this point, Keith noticed that Naia was releasing a female scent from her crack, but he ignored it.</p>



<p>He continued rubbing.</p>



<p>He started at the shins of her legs, squeezing one leg at a time with both hands.</p>



<p>When he reached her thigh, he rubbed the other leg. Over and over.</p>



<p>Naia was almost sniffling due to the pleasurable sensation.</p>



<p>After the rubbing, Keith washed his hands in the bowl of water.</p>



<p>Naia was dying of embarrassment as she was rubbed all over and buried her face in the pillow, gasping for air.</p>



<p>(Shameful, shameful, shameful! Keith-sama is treating me, but I am making such a voice...)</p>



<p>She was a little wet, but the feeling of being rubbed was more important to Naia, who did not even know what it meant to be wet in the first place.</p>



<p>As she watched Keith washing his hands in the bowl.</p>



<p>&quot;Is it... over?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;No, next is the front...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;The front!?&quot;</p>



<p>Naia couldn&apos;t help but yell at Keith&apos;s words.</p>



<p>Then there was a bang on the door.</p>



<p>&quot;Naia-sama! Are you okay!!!&quot;</p>



<p>Aisha&apos;s voice called out and Naia replied in a hurry.</p>



<p>&quot;I&apos;m okay!! Don&apos;t come in!!&quot;</p>



<p>Even if it was for the treatment, if Aisha saw her like this, she would kill Keith for sure.</p>



<p>She tried her best to stop her.</p>



<p>&quot;But!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;If I said don&apos;t, then don&apos;t!!&quot;</p>



<p>There was a gasping sound behind the door and a voice like a whining dog said, &quot;Excuse my rudeness.......&quot;.</p>



<p>Naia sighed, and Keith was relieved that the danger of him being killed was averted.</p>



<p>Naia bit her lip, not wanting to make Keith uncomfortable at this point, and lay on her back, struggling to contain her embarrassment.</p>



<p>For the first time in her life, Naia&apos;s body was exposed in front of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>Her undeveloped, swollen breasts showed pale cherry-colored nipples, which are slightly sunken.</p>



<p>Her ribs are still childishly prominent, and from there, her belly, which is free of any excess fat.</p>



<p>Her pubic hair is thin with a platinum color like her hair.</p>



<p>Therefore, her clitoris is clearly visible, but it is completely hidden by the foreskin.</p>



<p>Tears of shame came to her eyes.</p>



<p>But when Keith did not show any reaction, Naia felt hurt, but she did not know why.</p>



<p>Keith, on the other hand, was trying desperately to calm himself down by telling himself that he was doing it for the sake of treatment.</p>



<p>It made him look even more expressionless, but Naia didn&apos;t notice it.</p>



<p>Keith poured the rest of the liquid onto her stomach.</p>



<p>He did not press down on it like he did on her back, just spreading it around with his palm. When he reached the chest area, the evil that lives in his heart finally began to whisper.</p>



<p>Isn&apos;t it okay to massage this part?</p>



<p>No, I should massage it.</p>



<p>That&apos;s right, this is a treatment, so there&apos;s no reason I should not massage it!</p>



<p>Rather, I should rub it.</p>



<p>He was desperately ignoring such whispers, but because of that, he lost control and lightly touched the nipple that he had been avoiding.</p>



<p>&quot;Ahh! nhh...&quot;</p>



<p>Naia was so embarrassed that she raised her voice and hid her face with her arms.</p>



<p>The way she looked was unbearably cute, and something shattered inside Keith.</p>



<p>Slowly but surely it collapsed.</p>



<p>It started by thinking that it&apos;s fine if it&apos;s only just a little.</p>



<p>Applying a little more of the viscous liquid to the swelling area.</p>



<p>With his palm, avoiding the areola at first.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah... auu... hick.&quot;</p>



<p>Eventually, as he traced the edge of the areola and allowed the liquid to permeate, the sunken nipple revealed its tiny form.</p>



<p>&quot;Uu... uuu... akuu...&quot;</p>



<p>He pinched the little nipple that had come out with his thumb and forefinger.</p>



<p>&quot;Hiii!&quot;</p>



<p>As he kneaded and rubbed it, Naia&apos;s body reacted with a jerk and moved.</p>



<p>&quot;Not... there, Keith-sama... hii... nooo...&quot;</p>



<p>He removed his hand from the now fully raised nipple and brought them down to her belly.</p>



<p>It is to rub the important area at the base of her legs.</p>



<p>The twisted thoughts in Keith&apos;s mind, hand in hand with his sexual desires, now completely dominated him.</p>



<p>I am here to be her plaything anyway. A clown.</p>



<p>Then why not have a little perk?</p>



<p>It&apos;s okay to enjoy it.</p>



<p>I can have fun, and on top of that, I can treat her, which is not a bad thing for either of us.</p>



<p>Keith moved his hand to the base of her thigh while stroking her lower abdomen, and in the process, he accidentally touched her clitoris with his finger.</p>



<p>&quot;Hyuu!!&quot;</p>



<p>The fingers of another person touch a place that had never been touched before, and the intensity of the sensation lifted her hips.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith-sama...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Um&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Perhaps... you want to stop?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?... um.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Well... it can&apos;t be helped. The treatment is almost...&quot;</p>



<p>As Keith was about to stand up after saying that, Naia hurriedly stopped him.</p>



<p>&quot;I-It&apos;s not that, It&apos;s not...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Not?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...It&apos;s strange.&quot;</p>



<p>While looking down, Naia said.</p>



<p>&quot;...When Keith-sama is touching me... it feels good... even though this is just a treatment... I.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Oh, is that what this is about?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;This is more of a correction than a treatment. The body is trying to return to its proper state, so it is natural that it feels good.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;R-really?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>



<p>A big lie.</p>



<p>In the first place, what he is doing now is just a preliminary stage of the treatment, a palpation, so to speak.</p>



<p>But Naia, who could not possibly know that, looks happy.</p>



<p>&quot;Then, um...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It&apos;s fine to feel good, you know?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ah... but.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith&apos;s knowledge kicked in at this point.</p>



<p>&quot;Just a moment please&quot;</p>



<p>With that, he wiped his wet hands and pulled a stone out of his bag.</p>



<p>He cast a spell on it, made sure the stone glowed faintly, and set it down beside him.</p>



<p>&quot;Princess, please shout for a moment.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if it is loud enough for Aisha to break through the door.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;But&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Trust me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...Y-yes.&quot;</p>



<p>Naia sucked in air as hard as she can and screamed, &quot;Kyaaaaaah!&quot;, but there was no response.</p>



<p>&quot;This is&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;This stone absorbs sound. Its range is enough to cover us both and no sound escapes outside of that area.&quot;</p>



<p>A magical tool that he made for when one is conversing with someone in secret outside, but it didn&apos;t sell well at all.</p>



<p>In the first place, people do not talk outside about things they do not want others to hear.</p>



<p>Keith whispered in Naia&apos;s ear.</p>



<p>&quot;Now you can feel good and speak louder.&quot;</p>



<p>And Naia.</p>



<p>&quot;Auu... uuu...&quot;</p>



<p>She covered her face due to embarrassment.</p>



<p>Looking at Naia, Keith resumed the mischievous act called therapy.</p>
