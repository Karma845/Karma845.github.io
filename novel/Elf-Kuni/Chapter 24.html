<h3>Chapter 24: Female Knight, Treated Kindly 1</h3>

<p>Their lips touched.</p>

<p> The soft mucous membranes overlapped and made a lovely wet sound.</p>



<p> Closing their eyes and feeling only the sensation.</p>



<p> Tongues not entering. No touching of the chest or anywhere.</p>



<p> Only kissing.</p>



<p> A gentle kiss.</p>



<p> Aisha pulled her face away.</p>



<p> When she opens her eyes, Keith also opens his eyes almost at the same time.</p>



<p> Keith smiles at her.</p>



<p> Aisha turned her face away from him, feeling very embarrassed for some reason.</p>



<p>&quot;Isn't this enough... the thank you is done.&quot;</p>



<p> That said, he will probably attack her suddenly after this anyway.</p>



<p> Aisha had a feeling that it will be the case.</p>



<p> Because it was always like that.</p>



<p> Even if he said something nice or pretended to be good-natured, he would trick her into bringing out her nasty self again.</p>



<p> That is frustrating and unbearable.</p>



<p> And yet, today.</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha... can I hug you?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p> He asked.</p>



<p> He asked a question.</p>



<p> Normally, Keith would make a dirty face and treat Aisha's body like a toy.</p>



<p> But he asked with a soft face.</p>



<p> She didn't know how to answer it.</p>



<p> She can say that she didn't want to.</p>



<p> She could yell at him to stop playing around.</p>



<p> She knew that's what she should do, but her body didn't respond.</p>



<p>&quot;May I?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yeah...... eh&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>



<p> Keith smiled and put his hands around Aisha's waist and back.</p>



<p>&quot;Ah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha was held in his arms.</p>



<p> She had to resist.</p>



<p> But would a lover resist a hug?</p>



<p> And he even got her permission.</p>



<p> Then it would be wrong to resist.</p>



<p> That's right. Because she has to play along well. Resisting is wrong.</p>



<p> Aisha concluded so and accepted Keith's embrace.</p>



<p> Keith's left hand caresses Aisha's head.</p>



<p> His right hand is on her waist, but he never made any unwanted movements.</p>



<p> In that gentle embrace, Aisha noticed that Keith was sniffing her.</p>



<p>&quot;Y-you promised me you wouldn't sniff.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;The bed. I didn't promise not to smell Aisha's scent.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That's unfair.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...You don't like it? Then I'll stop.&quot;</p>



<p> He asked again. And Aisha is reluctant to resist.</p>



<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Do whatever you want.&quot;</p>



<p> Following her words, Keith sniffs her hair from Aisha's neck.</p>



<p> The smell of sweat, unlike that of a human, was not off-putting; it smelled like sweet nectar. Inhaling it into his nose.</p>



<p> Aisha let out a sigh at the tickle of having her own scent sniffed.</p>



<p>&quot;Aisha, you look cute.&quot;</p>



<p> She thought it felt sly to say that in this state.</p>



<p>&quot;That... don't say it again.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;That?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;... Cute... or...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;It's because you're cute.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I'm not happy when someone younger than me says it.&quot;</p>



<p> That's true. Aisha is more than 20 years older than Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;But you're cute, so there's nothing I can do about it.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;L-like I said... kyaa.&quot;</p>



<p> After saying that, Aisha raises her voice.</p>



<p> Keith switched position.</p>



<p> Aisha was on the bottom, but she didn't get hurt. She only raised her voice because it was done so suddenly.</p>



<p> Keith looked down at the beautiful brown elf, trapping Aisha under his own limbs.</p>



<p> Her puzzled face gives the impression that she is younger than her age.</p>



<p> To such Aisha.</p>



<p>&quot;When two lovers are in this position in bed, they would do what they're supposed to do, right?&quot;</p>



<p> Here it comes. Yes, as she thought.</p>



<p> Keith is about to do something to her that is too disgusting to even say out loud.</p>



<p> Aisha glared at Keith.</p>



<p> As she tried hard to hold back the tears that are threatening to come out.</p>



<p>&quot;You can do whatever you want!&quot;</p>



<p> Keith smiled at her words.</p>



<p>&quot;You don't get to ask your lover for a night out and then do whatever you want, right?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I see, So if your lover says no, are you going to give up!?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;......Is that being coy?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Hmph! Then I have no right to refuse! What else to say but 'do what you want'!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha turned away from him as if to throw up, and Keith put his mouth to her ear and said, &quot;Good grief&quot;.</p>



<p>&quot;Then, let's go with this kind of setting. Aisha's cuteness has made me lust after her so much that I want her, and even though I'm really tired from work, she accepts me, telling me to do whatever I want.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;What's that! Are you stupid!!&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Playing pretend is interesting because it's stupid.&quot;</p>



<p> Saying so, Keith kissed Aisha.</p>



<p> It's a gentle kiss.</p>



<p> He separates his lips once and kisses her again. But this time for a longer time. Still no tongue.</p>



<p> When their lips parted several times.</p>



<p>&quot;Do you want to take off your clothes, Aisha? Or do you want me to take them off for you?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;I'll take them off myself...... so move.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot;</p>



<p>Keith gets up and watches happily as she takes off her dress.</p>



<p> Aisha felt that if she was going to undress, she didn't need to change her clothes. She didn't understand a male's mind.</p>



<p> When she took off her dress and was about to take off her bra.</p>



<p>&quot;That's! I want to take it off.&quot;</p>



<p> The pervert pleaded with an expression like an abandoned puppy.</p>



<p> With a jittery look in his eyes, she sighed and removed her hand from the bra, and Keith was happy with a big smile on his face.</p>



<p> He kissed her while sitting on the bed.</p>



<p> Aisha, who had been kissed so much by Keith, had gotten used to it.</p>



<p> At first, it was difficult for her to breathe, but recently she is aware that it is getting better.</p>



<p> Though it was not something that made her happy.</p>



<p>&quot;Fuu...! Nfuu...&quot;</p>



<p> A tongue entered her mouth.</p>



<p> She accepted it and let her tongue lift a little, and Keith licked it.</p>



<p> There was a rustling sound.</p>



<p> Eventually, Keith's hands began to touch her breasts through her bra.</p>



<p> Aisha was puzzled by the touch.</p>



<p> It was different. The way he touched her was different.</p>



<p> It was completely different from the way she had been touched before.</p>



<p> She can't explain how it was different. But to put it simply, it is gentle.</p>



<p> He touches her as if he loves and cares for her.</p>



<p> She doesn't enjoy rubbing her breasts. But it's the kind of touching that Aisha feels good about.</p>



<p> Eventually, Keith's hand undid the front hook and let Aisha's breasts pop out.</p>



<p> He squeezes her large breasts directly.</p>



<p>&quot;Chu... puha!... ah, ahh...&quot;</p>



<p> She said out loud.</p>



<p> While rubbing her breasts slowly and kneading them, he gently ran his fingers over the areola.</p>



<p> The ticklishness soon turned into a pleasant sensation.</p>



<p> As he repeatedly caressed her areola, her nipples began to harden. He felt it with his fingertips.</p>



<p>&quot;Can I lick it?&quot;</p>



<p> He whispered in her ear. Goosebumps rose on Aisha's spine.</p>



<p>&quot;No... don't...&quot;</p>



<p> She said reflexively.</p>



<p>&quot;I see, then I won't do it.&quot;</p>



<p> Keith mumbled quietly and squeezed her nipples between his fingers.</p>



<p>&quot;Kuh!!&quot;</p>



<p> When he squeezed it with exquisite force, a warmth flowed from the tips of her nipples to her stomach along with pleasure.</p>



<p>&quot;Fuhii!! Ah, kuh...!&quot;</p>



<p> When her nipples began to ache, Keith removed his fingers.</p>



<p> Keith places his body completely on the bed and leans his back against the headrest, then opens his arms.</p>



<p> Aisha is a little confused, holding her breasts, which were aching, and crawled on the bed, leaning against Keith.</p>



<p> While sitting on the bed, he removes her bra completely from behind and kissed Aisha's neck.</p>



<p> Then, he rubbed her breasts again. Also rubbing her nipples.</p>



<p>&quot;Kufuu!! Ah, nhh!! Fuwaa...&quot;</p>



<p> His right hand went down.</p>



<p> It traced her clitoris through her panties.</p>



<p>&quot;Kyuu!!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha let out a cry.</p>



<p>&quot;Sorry, was that strong?&quot;</p>



<p> Those were the words of a man who abused her clitoris with a massaging tool when he took her virginity.</p>



<p> And the touch.</p>



<p> He gently stroked her clitoris, caressing it at the foreskin.</p>



<p>&quot;Ahhh.&quot;</p>



<p> After stroking repeatedly and letting out some love juice, he now traces the crotch area.</p>



<p> Aisha endured gasping and turned to Keith.</p>



<p>&quot;W... why...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Hmm? What is?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Hii!... ah, ah... this, gentleness... kuh! It's different from usual...&quot;</p>



<p> Keith smiled.</p>



<p>&quot;It's natural, Because Aisha is very important to me.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Im, portant?&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Yeah, you're my cute lover after all.&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Ahhh!!!&quot;</p>



<p> The moment he said that, she felt a jolt of electricity down her spine.</p>



<p> It was because she was being touched. She desperately tries to make excuses in her mind.</p>



<p> Not because Keith told her that she was an important person to him.</p>



<p> That shouldn't be the case.</p>



<p> Because this is just a play. It's just a child's game.</p>



<p> When the play is over... when it's over, she's going to kill him.</p>



<p> She told her mind and endured the shivering on her spine.</p>



<p> The fact that Keith doesn't say anything is unsettling.</p>



<p> He didn't ask her to speak up or be more disruptive.</p>



<p> He just touches her gently. She felt good. Both her mind and body feel good.</p>



<p>&quot;Your underwear is a little wet. Should I take it off... can I take it off?&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha, breathing hard, can't even reply.</p>



<p> Keith saw it.</p>



<p>&quot;Please lift up your waist a little.&quot;</p>



<p> He pulls off her panties.</p>



<p> She thought he would smell it again, but he put it under the bed.</p>



<p> Aisha had a vague feeling that Keith would never do anything she didn't want.</p>



<p> Aisha was now completely naked, and Keith began to caress her again.</p>



<p> When he touched her pussy directly, Aisha's body trembled due to the stimulation.</p>



<p>&quot;Uaaa!! Nhh...... haa!! Ahhh.&quot;</p>



<p> He rubbed her labia, stroked her clitoris, traced the crack, and slowly inserted his middle finger into her vaginal hole, turning it in small circles.</p>



<p> Then, he pulls it out while moving his finger to tickle it deep inside.</p>



<p> The purpose of that was not to force her to cum, but to make her feel good and get her wet.</p>



<p>&quot;G-gently... the finger! Kuaa!! Kuh, ahh!!&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha bit her lip, about to say it felt good.</p>



<p> But she felt good.</p>



<p> It's not a feeling that she would loathe herself afterward. It is not a violent pleasure.</p>



<p> It was the feeling she had fantasized about alone after reading books. It was the feeling of being given by someone one loves.</p>



<p> She knew that her vagina was aching to welcome this person.</p>



<p>&quot;Can I insert it?&quot;</p>



<p> Keith asked Aisha when he felt that her love juice was wet enough on his fingers.</p>



<p> Aisha looked at Keith for a moment and then.</p>



<p>&quot;Do...... as you please.&quot;</p>



<p> Aisha muttered.</p>



<p> Keith smiled and gently laid Aisha down on the bed.</p>
