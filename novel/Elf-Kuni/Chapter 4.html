<h3>Chapter 4: First Feeling</h3>

<p>Well, where should I start?</p>





<p>It would be nice to start with the virgin pussy, but when he looked at it, the sunken nipples were still standing pretty.</p>





<p>Keith was torn and decided to start with the breasts.</p>





<p>He rubbed Naia&apos;s small breasts with both hands, trying to gather them up.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuu... hii...&quot;</p>





<p>To Naia, who was closing her eyes and biting her lip to endure the sensation.</p>





<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? It&apos;s okay to let out your voice, you know?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...Um, but...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want Keith-sama... to hear my vulgar voice...&quot;</p>





<p>Keith smiled and whispered in Naia&apos;s pointed ear.</p>





<p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;d be more happy if you&apos;re feeling good and let out your voice.&quot;</p>





<p>After a few moments of silence at his words, Naia nodded &quot;yes&quot;.</p>





<p>While looking at Keith&apos;s face, he began to knead her breasts again.</p>





<p>Soft and fluffy. This young lady&apos;s breasts are still small and haven&apos;t been developed.</p>





<p>Wrapping his hands around it so as not to hurt her or damage it.</p>





<p>The small, palm-sized breasts were wet with the liquid that Keith had poured on them and was making a wet, nasty sound.</p>





<p>&quot;Hauu!... ahh...!! nhh, hyuu!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia rubbed her thighs together while her breasts were being squeezed and her face turned bright red.</p>





<p>Although her breasts are being rubbed, the area deep inside her crotch is getting hotter and hotter.</p>





<p>Is there something wrong with me?</p>





<p>But she couldn&apos;t ask Keith that and was getting just a little bit scared.</p>





<p>While thinking that, Keith continued to play with her breasts.</p>





<p>When he flicked her nipples with his thumbs, Naia responded, &quot;Hick!!&quot;. It was interesting to see Naia&apos;s reaction.</p>





<p>He guessed she was sensitive to stimulation because her nipples were usually sunken in.</p>





<p>He thought to himself that he should caress more.</p>



<p>&quot;Keith... sama.&quot;</p>





<p>Naia said between her gasps and breathing.</p>





<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Um... the tip of my breasts... is aching...&quot;</p>





<p>She did not understand the change caused by the sexual arousal in her own body.</p>





<p>The pure-cultured elf princess made an indecent sound.</p>





<p>&quot;That&apos;s not good!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia was surprised to hear Keith shout a little and to hear the words &quot;not good&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;I-Is something wrong with me?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No, It&apos;s not the princess. But this oil.&quot;</p>





<p>He showed her the liquid he had smeared on her breasts.</p>





<p>&quot;This may have been a little too stimulating for the princess&apos;s breasts. Not good, we have to wipe it off quickly.&quot;</p>





<p>Naia, who believed such a big lie, said, &quot;We must wash it with water&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;I think it would be better this way......&quot;</p>





<p>Keith moved his face closer to Naia&apos;s breast.</p>





<p>&quot;Eh? Ehh? Ehhhh?&quot;</p>





<p>Hamu, chu, chuu, rero, rero, chu, chuu.</p>





<p>Licking. Sucking. It is being played by his tongue.</p>





<p>Naia panicked at what was happening.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama! What are you, hauu! Hiii... stop, hiee!! Pleasee!&quot;</p>





<p>Keith moved his mouth from the left nipple to the right nipple.</p>





<p>&quot;No. Licking and cleansing has always been the basis of magic.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;No... way, hyauu!!&quot;</p>





<p>While tracing the areola, he sucked the nipple and roll it with his tongue.</p>





<p>The liquid is a component that was safe to put in one&apos;s mouth, so he is licking it without worries.</p>





<p>The other nipple is being kneaded with his fingers and plucking it.</p>





<p>The taste of the liquid that has been smeared on her nipple combined with Naia&apos;s sweat, is slightly sweet.</p>





<p>Elves, who do not like to eat meat, do not have much body odor, and the sweat they secrete does not smell either.</p>





<p>Recalling that, Keith was enjoying the taste of Nai&apos;a&apos;s breasts.</p>





<p>Suddenly, he wondered, if sweat tastes like this, how about love juice?</p>





<p>At that thought, his head was pressed tightly.</p>





<p>He looked over and saw that Naia was holding Keith with both arms, pressing him to her breast.</p>





<p>&quot;Fubuu.&quot;</p>





<p>Although a girl&apos;s strength is low, it is a little hard to separate his mouth from her nipple.</p>





<p>Naia is probably doing it unconsciously. Her eyes are closed and desperately calling out Keith&apos;s name.</p>





<p>&quot;Kieth-sama! Hauu! Kie... nhh! Hyaaaa!! My breasts... since earlier, my breasts... hyaaa!! Keith-samaa!!!&quot;</p>





<p>Like a child hugging a precious doll, Naia was writhing with Keith&apos;s head pressed tightly to her breast.</p>





<p>Maybe I should make her cum once.</p>





<p>Keith decided that it might be a good idea to make her cum once, so he gently moved his left hand down, tracing Naia&apos;s lower abdomen, and gently touched her clitoris.</p>





<p>Like a pea, covered by the foreskin, but hard enough.</p>





<p>He gently touched it with his middle finger.</p>





<p>&quot;Hii!! kyuu... hii!!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia&apos;s throat was choking and she was bending backward.</p>





<p>He found that the clitoris stimulation was effective, so he rubbed the clitoris with his middle finger through its foreskin, while moving his tongue around her breast as though he were licking ice cream.</p>





<p>&quot;Au! Auu! Kieth-sama !! There! It&apos;s getting strange, higuu!! My stomach is burning!! It&apos;s aching moree!!&quot;</p>





<p>Her voice was almost a scream as she drooled and appealed.</p>





<p>As soon as Keith touched her clitoris to push it in a little harder, she writhes violently.</p>





<p>&quot;Scary! I&apos;m scared! Something!!!! Something inside!! Auu, ahhn! Nhh!!!!! Kieth... samaaa......!!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia&apos;s arms tightened even more as she climaxed for the first time in her life.</p>





<p>Her first climax was light, but it was enough for the virgin elf girl.</p>





<p>&quot;Fuhaa!! haa, haa!!&quot;</p>





<p>Keith removed his head as the pressure weakened.</p>





<p>He nearly suffocated.</p>





<p>Drool dripped from the corner of her mouth, and the sight of Naia breathing roughly filled him with satisfaction.</p>





<p>Licking the finger that had been touching her clitoris, he longs to taste the nectar that is overflowing from a little lower down, where the finger had been touching.</p>





<p>But there is no time.</p>





<p>The time for the lesson is precisely set, and if it passes, Aisha will rush into the room without even getting permission to enter.</p>





<p>If he were to clean Naia&apos;s sticky body and put her clothes back on, it would take a good amount of time.</p>





<p>Keith called out to the absent-minded princess, telling his penis, which was insisting to let it do its job to Naia&apos;s lascivious appearance, that &quot;the fun was just beginning&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess, it&apos;s time for us to wrap up the lesson, please wake up.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Hauu?&quot;</p>





<p>Naia stared at Keith with trance-like eyes.</p>





<p>Was it that stimulating?</p>





<p>If this was the case after just a little teasing of her breasts and clitoris, what would happen if he did it in earnest?</p>





<p>He was half-excited and half-terrified. But his sexual desire is adding to the anticipation.</p>





<p>&quot;Princess! Princess!!&quot;</p>





<p>While desperately waking Naia up, Keith couldn&apos;t stop smiling at the thought of what was to come.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>&quot;Um... I didn&apos;t mean... to show that vulgar... appearance...&quot;</p>





<p>Naia, who had turned bright red and was lying on her face, said that in a slurred voice.</p>





<p>Her body has been washed and she is wearing clothes properly.</p>





<p>When Keith woke her up and became more conscious, she almost die from embarrassment due to exposing her lasciviousness.</p>





<p>Of course, it was Keith who was at fault.</p>





<p>There is no way to explain away the fact that he deceived Naia, who knew nothing about it.</p>





<p>However, in Naia&apos;s mind, Keith was the one who was treating her, and it was she who was writhing around, feeling good on her own.</p>





<p>So she should feel ashamed... Nia thought so.</p>





<p>And Keith knew that.</p>





<p>&quot;No, no, that&apos;s.&quot;</p>





<p>He then put away the things he had brought with him and activated a deodorant magic tool.</p>





<p>It was a fairly sold product.</p>





<p>&quot;So, how was it?&quot;</p>





<p>Did it feel good?</p>





<p>Naia fidgeted a little, unsure if she should be honest about such a perverted question.</p>





<p>&quot;Y-yes. Very...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I see that the treatment was worth it.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;At the end...... my mind turned white and my body jerked! So that was the first step towards being able to do magic!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>



<p>What a misunderstanding she had.......</p>





<p>She thought that sexual climax is the first step to change her body to be able to use magic.</p>





<p>He almost erupted in laughter at the misunderstanding, but he tried desperately to hold it in.</p>





<p>&quot;Is it not?&quot;</p>





<p>She asked with a smile on her face, so he tried his best to remain calm and go along with her story.</p>





<p>&quot;No, you&apos;re right. If you experience that blank mind over and over again, you will become a great mage.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Yes! I will do my best!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Pf-&hellip;&hellip;&quot;</p>





<p>He tried his best to hold back his laughter at the statement that she was going to do her best to do sexual things.</p>





<p>But the question is how to prevent this from being discovered.</p>





<p>Especially if Aisha finds out about this, he will be made into a rug and placed in front of the fireplace.</p>





<p>As he was pondering that.</p>





<p>&quot;Um... in this case... Keith-sama.&quot;</p>





<p>He was interrupted in his thoughts by Naia&apos;s words and replied &quot;Yes?&quot;.</p>





<p>&quot;About the treatment...... could you please not tell anyone else about it?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;It would be...... embarrassing if everyone knew that I&apos;m...... making that kind of vulgar appearance.&quot;</p>





<p>A ship is ready for departure.</p>





<p>A duck came with leeks on its back.</p>





<p>A mandragora was out.</p>





<p>What a convenient offer!</p>





<p>What is this princess? An elf dedicated to erotic things that God has bestowed upon me?</p>





<p>He was grinning, and Naia, perhaps feeling uneasy, looked as if she were about to cry.</p>





<p>&quot;I know I have to report my progress to your father and mother...... but.......&quot;</p>





<p>Keith let a fresh smile form on his face.</p>





<p>&quot;I understand. If that&apos;s what the princess wants, then that&apos;s what I&apos;ll do.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Keith-sama!&quot;</p>





<p>Naia took Keith&apos;s hand in hers.</p>





<p>&quot;Really, you&apos;re too kind... I...&quot;</p>





<p>No one noticed that the fire of love was beginning to smolder in the depths of her eyes.</p>







<p>...</p>







<p>&quot;I&apos;m back ~ ~.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Master, you&apos;re smiling, nyaa.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Well ~ ~ yeah.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Much different from yesterday, nyaa.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Don&apos;t think of me as I was yesterday.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Nyaa?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Come on, let&apos;s go take a bath and get ready for tomorrow!&quot;</p>





<p>As Lou watched its master walk toward the back of the room like a child before going on a field trip, Lou said.</p>





<p>&quot;Because this is a fun country, nyaa...&quot;</p>





<p>With these words, Lou slept again.</p>
