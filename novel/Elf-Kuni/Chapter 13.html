<h3>Chapter 13: Female Knight, Massage</h3>



<p> Keith, naked, is lying down on the bed.</p>





<p> He buried his face in the pillow and sometimes says &quot;Ahh ~ ~&quot;.</p>





<p> The reason is simple, he's getting a massage.</p>





<p> It is Aisha who is doing it.</p>





<p> The only thing she wears now is white micro bikini armor.</p>





<p> Her voluptuous yet toned brown body looked good in a white micro bikini with a small area of fabric.</p>





<p> Aisha straddles Keith's legs and with her oil-soaked hands, presses and rubs his hips forcefully, pushing and rubbing with force.</p>





<p>&quot;Why am I doing this?&quot;</p>





<p> As she pressed his stiffened muscles with her thumbs, Keith couldn't help but let out a &quot;hohee&quot; at the pleasant sensation.</p>





<p> As for why Aisha is doing this, the story goes back to an hour ago.</p>













<p>...</p>















<p> At midnight, after finishing her work, Aisha got ready for bed, lay down on her bed, and let out a small sigh.</p>





<p> Thirteen days had passed since she had played maid with Keith.</p>





<p> During that time, Aisha had been avoiding Keith.</p>





<p> That day when she and Keith spent the whole day like beasts in a room in a mansion, Aisha had been having sex with Keith</p>





<p> Aisha had fallen fainted several times during the day, but in the end, Aisha had wanted Keith until the very last minute of her day off.</p>





<p> Not Keith. But Aisha wanted Keith.</p>





<p> The main reasons for that were the simple rule that she was Keith's erotic maid and that she would be rewarded for her services, and also because Keith had called her his personal maid and his personal Aisha so many times that she was very happy.</p>





<p> When it was done and headed out on her duty, she felt wonderfully satisfied, energized, and exhilarated, but as time went on.</p>





<p>&quot;Are? Maybe I've done something terrible.&quot;</p>





<p> That culminated when Keith told her that he was not feeling well and would not be able to attend Naia's lessons.</p>





<p> It was definitely her fault. She had asked Keith so much.</p>





<p> She turned pale and thought about going to visit him, but the part of her that wasn't being honest came out.</p>





<p>&quot;No, it was Keith's fault for bringing up such punishment! I am the victim!&quot;</p>





<p> She ended up second-guessing it because of such incomprehensible and twisted feelings.</p>





<p> And if she went to visit him, Keith would surely make fun of Aisha, saying she looked like a slut, no matter how terrible she was feeling.</p>





<p> Aisha scratched her head when she remembered her flirtatious &quot;Master, please reward Aisha&quot; words at that time, so she couldn't easily go visit Keith.</p>





<p> Because of these thoughts, when Naia said, &quot;I want to go visit him!&quot; she had to shout out to stop her. If Naia went to Keith, then Aisha would have to go too. So she desperately tried to stop her.</p>





<p> Thanks to that, Naia cried and resented her, but more importantly, she wanted to see Keith.</p>





<p> But even though she should have been that embarrassed, all Aisha could think about was Keith these days.</p>





<p> Is your body okay? How is your back? And...... do you hate me?</p>





<p> The last time she had been tricked by Keith into thinking she had been drugged with an aphrodisiac, she exposed her indecent self, and after time passed, she had wanted to die of self-loathing.</p>





<p> This time, however, she felt a little self-loathing, but more than that, she felt a smoldering feeling in her heart that what if Keith was disgusted with her for having sought him to the point of harming his body?</p>





<p> Of course, it is Keith. Of course, he is enjoying the situation and will tease her if he sees her.</p>





<p> However, if by any chance he is fed up with her being too indecent?</p>





<p> As time went by, the thought of that exceeded her embarrassment, and couldn't go see him because of that fear.</p>





<p>&quot;Keith, you idiot... why aren't you coming to see me?&quot;</p>





<p> For three days since she heard that Keith had made a full recovery and resumed lessons, Aisha was very unhappy with that, muttering such things all the time and not being able to do anything about it.</p>



<p> Tonight, she was lying in bed again, feeling depressed, when there was a knock at the door.</p>





<p> A familiar sound, the usual time.</p>





<p> Aisha's face was filled with a tearful smile.</p>





<p> But not wanting to recognize it, she shook her head and took a breath with a discouraged expression before opening the door.</p>





<p> There stood Keith, with a familiar grin on his face, as usual.</p>





<p>&quot;Good evening.&quot;</p>





<p> With the same voice as usual, she wanted to hug Keith right now.</p>





<p>&quot;...W-what do you want?&quot;</p>





<p> She replied in her usual annoyed tone.</p>





<p>&quot;I just wanted to see Aisha. Is this a bad time?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...We'll stand out if we talk here...... come in.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha, careful not to make a strange face.</p>





<p>&quot;I told you. When you come, I want you to tell it to me in, fue!? Nhh, chu.&quot;</p>





<p> Suddenly, she was hugged from behind and kissed as she turned around.</p>





<p> She was surprised, but with Keith's face right in front of her, and the taste of his saliva on her tongue, Aisha lost the slightest intention of resisting.</p>





<p>&quot;Nhh, chu... rero, rero, chupa, chu... pua.&quot;</p>





<p> When the long oral-mucous-teasing act is over, Aisha stares at Keith with moist eyes.</p>





<p>&quot;I haven't tasted Aisha in a long time.......&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha blushed as she was told that.</p>





<p>&quot;Are you stupid... I-I was bored to death since...&quot;</p>





<p> She brought it up, that day herself.</p>





<p> Aisha noticed that and choked on her words, but Keith buried his face in her neck as if he hadn't heard anything.</p>





<p>&quot;It's been a while since I smelled Aisha... It smells good.&quot;</p>





<p> She wriggled against the tickle but didn't resist like she usually did.</p>





<p> No, she couldn't.</p>





<p> Keith hugged her, kissed her, and smelled her.</p>





<p> It was proof that Keith didn't hate her.</p>





<p> She was so happy about it that she let it, but then she thought that it isn't like her.</p>





<p>&quot;S-stop!! Are you a dog or something!?&quot;</p>





<p> And she pushed him away.</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith fell onto the bed with an exaggerated gesture, making a deliberate voice.</p>





<p> At first, Aisha thought it was an act, but when Keith didn't seem to get up after a while.</p>





<p>&quot;...W-what's wrong?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha fearfully calls out to him, then.</p>





<p>&quot;My... my waist... just now...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh!?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's face hardened in surprise, then turned pale.</p>





<p> Waist? His waist? Just now, again?</p>





<p> She thought she didn't put that much force into it. And yet.</p>





<p> But he had been in bed for 10 days with back pain. She didn't know how to fix it back.</p>





<p> Aisha hurriedly approached Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;Are you okay? Should I call a doctor!? I'm not good with healing magic! Keith!! I'm sorry!! I...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Waist...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;My waist... please massage it... and then.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;T-the waist, right! I'll just massage the waist, right!? I understand!!&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha then put her hands on his hips and.</p>





<p>&quot;Wait...... get dressed.......&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Ha?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;In my bag... change of clothes...&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;... Wait, why would you have all that stuff ready when it was supposed to be an accident? And I don't understand how I had time to change.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Whoa!! My waist!!&quot;</p>





<p> Keith glances at Aisha as he screams.</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p> Aisha now gives him a blank stare at the deliberate sound of his voice.</p>





<p> When Keith saw that</p>





<p>&quot;Guaa!! Aisha! My waist.&quot;</p>





<p> Then he glanced at Aisha again.</p>





<p> When it got to that point, all she could do was sigh.</p>





<p> She felt that the desire to see him and to have him hold her was rapidly fading. However.</p>





<p>&quot;...Where is the bag?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ah, there's a paper bag on there, and it's inside.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...You look fine.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;My waist!! My quadratus lumborum!!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;What is that!!&quot;</p>





<p> Eventually, Aisha takes the bag and heads for the bathroom.</p>





<p> As she opened the bag with a sigh.</p>





<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;What's this?&quot;</p>





<p> When she held the bag, it was so light that she thought, &quot;Change of clothes?&quot; but her cheeks twitched at the small amount of fabric.</p>





<p> She wanted to get out of the bathroom and complain to Keith right away, but she knew that if she did, he would scream about his waist again, so she relented and changed into it.</p>





<p> White micro bikini armor.</p>





<p> It was a new piece that Keith had made exclusively for Aisha.</p>





<p> When she looked at herself in the mirror, she made a strange face because she look so vulgar and pathetic.</p>





<p> It was a combination of shamefulness and the thought that Keith would want and desire this look from her.</p>





<p> She took a deep breath and returned to the room to find Keith still lying on the bed, but his eyes were blazing as he gazed at Aisha's figure.</p>





<p> Her brown skin shone against the white fabric.</p>





<p> The top, which hides only the nipples of her large breasts, shows off the roundness of her breasts, and the bottom is so thin that it digs into her crotch, protecting Aisha's precious part.</p>





<p> Wonderful&#8213;&#8213;&#8213; Keith hurriedly kept his mouth shut as he was about to say so.</p>





<p> He had to pretend that his back hurts.</p>





<p> Even though his back had been healed and he had just had a lot of fun playing on the mat with Naia!</p>





<p> Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to get Aisha to give him a sexual massage!</p>





<p> Aisha's personality is such that even if he asked her to give him a normal massage, she would refuse.</p>





<p> Then he would have to take advantage of her guilt.</p>





<p> But even that guilt shouldn't be taken out of the equation.</p>





<p> It's just a matter of saying, &quot;Ouch. What is it? I wonder why?&quot; He had to poke a thorn in Aisha's heart with &quot;I'm in pain&quot;.</p>





<p> It was a new plan he came up with when Naia spilled the tea and thanks to that, they were able to play on the mat.</p>





<p> Until then, Keith had honestly wanted to embarrass Aisha with verbal abuse.</p>





<p> Despite her embarrassment, saying &quot;I changed clothes!&quot; and almost got an erection at the sight of that.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha ~ ~, my waist ~ ~ ~, quick ~ ~ ~.&quot;</p>





<p> He squeezes out a pathetic voice.</p>





<p> Aisha sighs and mutters, &quot;Why would I&quot; as she tries to get closer to Keith and get on the bed to massage his waist, but.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha... please take off my clothes.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Ahh??&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;You can't do it over the clothes... you have to massage it naked!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;J-just take them off yourself.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;My waisst!! My external abdominal obliquee!!&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;I know! I understand!!&quot;</p>





<p> While saying, &quot;Jeez&quot;, she took off Keith's jacket.</p>





<p> In the process, she realized that she was terribly embarrassed by the act of removing a man's clothes.</p>





<p> When she took off his jacket and shirt, undressing him naked, she was so embarrassed that even her ears turned red at the sight, which she should have been seeing all the time.</p>





<p> Keith knew that, but he urged her to hurry up with the bottom half too.</p>





<p> She then took off his belt and pants, hesitated for a moment, and then took off his underwear as well, revealing his penis in a non-combative state.</p>





<p> Although not erected, Aisha turned away from it, which was black and grotesque.</p>





<p> She had been licking it and letting it penetrate her body for a long time, but her reaction was as innocent as ever, and Keith almost laughed.</p>





<p> Aisha slowly turned Keith's body over and tried to straddle his thighs.</p>





<p> Then Keith.</p>





<p>&quot;There is massage oil in the bag, so please use it.&quot;</p>





<p> While burying his face in the pillow, he said so.</p>





<p>&quot;...Aren't you too well prepared?&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;...My waisst...&quot;</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Haa.&rdquo;</p>





<p> She took out a bottle of natural oil from Keith's bag, just as he told her to do.</p>





<p> The massage oil was the same stuff he used when he palpated Naia's body.</p>





<p> Aisha straddled Keith, applied the oil to her hands, and placed her hands on his waist, and began to rub them carefully.</p>



<p>  She began by pressing her fingers from his waist to his back toward his shoulders.</p>





<p> When she reached the shoulders, she returned to the waist.</p>





<p> She pushed her fingers in the middle of the lower back as if squeezing, and stops when it does hurt.</p>





<p> She always moved to different places and was careful not to rub the same place.</p>





<p> After loosening it to some extent, she put her weight on her palm and applied pressure.</p>





<p> Keith screamed at the feeling of pushing his muscles.</p>





<p>&quot;This... isn't this awfully good?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha's massage was so good that he couldn't help but say that.</p>





<p>&quot;My dead father suffered from a back injury in his later years...... and I learned how to do massage while I massage him.&quot;</p>





<p> While they were having that conversation, Aisha's fingers now began to loosen the muscles of his buttocks.</p>





<p> When she squeezed her thumb a few times while pressing his muscles, he said, &quot;Fuho&quot;.</p>





<p> It felt so good that he almost melted.</p>





<p> He felt a warm sensation around his waist.</p>





<p> Not good! I'm seriously going to fall asleep!!</p>





<p> With that in mind, Aisha is straddling him in an erotic outfit.</p>





<p> Keith drooled on Aisha's pillow when he felt pressure on his waist, down his sides to his shoulder blades, and then her fingers repeated it.</p>





<p> Massage demon, you elf!!</p>





<p> &quot;Aisha + Massage = Danger.&quot;</p>





<p> Keith, who learned that, now seriously turned up his libido to full blast.</p>





<p>(Burn up! My libido!! Don't be satisfied with just a massage!!!)</p>





<p> If left alone, he would really want to keep receiving Aisha's massages all night long, but there was no point without doing something erotic.</p>





<p> The feeling of Aisha's crotch on the back of his thighs and the good feeling of the massage are converted into sexual stimulation in his brain and gathering blood in his penis.</p>





<p>(Erection! I need to get an erection!!)</p>





<p> Smelling Aisha's pillow, he rubbed his penis against the bed without her noticing.</p>





<p> He got an erection. It was so erect that it hurt as it was being crushed.</p>





<p>&quot;Aisha...&quot;</p>





<p> So he called out to her.</p>





<p>&quot;Hmm? What's wrong?&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha asks, stopping the massage.</p>





<p>&quot;I'd like a massage in a different part.&quot;</p>





<p>&quot;Different part?... Where?&quot;</p>





<p> Keith turned his body under Aisha.</p>





<p> Aisha looks down at Keith, who is now on his back with his hips thrust upward.</p>





<p> The man's penis, fully erect, was towering between Keith's legs as if he was raising it to the heavens.</p>





<p> Aisha was looking at his erect penis, which was reddish-black and bloodshot, and twitching.</p>





<p>&quot;I'd like a massage here, too, please.&quot;</p>





<p> Aisha wanted to hit Keith in the face when he said that with a smile.</p>
