<h3>Chapter 2 - Festival of Valour.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days after the first examination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up in the inn, Wind Dragon Fountain Pavilion, and yawned absently at the whitish sky, where the sun was just beginning to rise. As I got out of bed, a cold draft caressed my skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..today, is the second round of exams right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The successful candidates for the interviews were announced yesterday. There were twenty-four parties. This means that roughly a third of the parties who took the first examinations were able to proceed to the second round of the examinations.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s earlier than planned, but let&#8217;s head for the castle’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I washed my face, changed my clothes and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went downstairs to the front desk of the inn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I found Risha snoozing in the dining room. She was lying comfortably with her cheeks on the table and her well-groomed orange-grey hair hanging down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hhuh&#8230;..? Needoo-san &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of my footsteps woke her and look at me sleepily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Risha. You&#8217;ll catch a cold if you sleep here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;.. good,&#8230; morning&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, her eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry! Did I sleepwalk&#8230;?!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risha&#8217;s face turned bright red and she fixed her dishevelled hair with her hands. She then realised that she was drooling and hurriedly wiped it off with the back of her hand. She had apparently been caught off guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you doing something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,&#8211;yes. That&#8230;..I’m going to go out today, so I was making lunch, but I woke up too early and accidentally fell asleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risha laughed in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Going out, huh? So that means you&#8217;re off work today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Today, the Wind Dragon Fountain Pavilion is closed until the evening! Or rather, not only the Wind Dragon Fountain Pavilion, but many other shops will be closed today!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risha&#8217;s eyes light up as she says, perhaps having woken up from her drowsiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately knew why she was so excited.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secondary exams, you&#8217;re going to watch it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! Today is the long-awaited secondary exam&#8230;It&#8217;s the day of the hero fighting festival!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second stage of the selection test for the Hero Party is a battle royal between parties that have passed the first stage of the test. Rushia had prepared a huge arena in the centre of the capital for this test, with seating for a large audience. She has simply reused a place that was once used as a theatre, but even so, the preparations were swift.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the battle royal for the second test became a highly eventful event, as anyone could easily watch and the content was expected to be fierce and intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For us, the heroic party selection test is nothing short of remarkable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We therefore decided to name this second examination the Festival of Valour and make it a national event. The strategy worked and the national voltage is now at its highest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. If you’re that excited, I&#8217;m glad I’ve organised it.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Organised?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself, and Risha tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In case you&#8217;re wondering, I&#8217;m the one who came up with the idea of the valour festival.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell her honestly, as it&#8217;s not something I should hide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Risha&#8217;s eyes widened round for a moment, but she eventually laughed awkwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That again~you must be joking. Before, you said that your job was just a light chore&#8230;..and even if you&#8217;re joking, aren’t you overreacting~?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risha didn&#8217;t believe me at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Ned-san, it&#8217;s early in the morning again today&#8230;..are you working?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, sort of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh..y, well it can’t be helped. Sorry, I&#8217;m the only one who got carried away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: oh, she’s planning to invite Ned)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t really think much about the work, because my work is to watch the valour festival&#8230;&#8230;but Risha looked apologetic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Ned-san. Can I ask you to wait a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Risha said, as if she had thought of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding, Risha made a short run to the kitchen across the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she eventually returned, Risha had a small basket in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, I hope you like it. I made it in a hurry with leftovers, so I can&#8217;t guarantee the taste&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, Risha took out from the basket a freshly prepared lunch box.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It contained many sandwiches with an abundance of colourful ingredients.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. That&#8217;s a big help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing&#8230;..Oh, but please don&#8217;t tell the other customers, okay? Ned-san is a regular, so it&#8217;s a special service.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding up her index finger in front of her lips, Risha says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good luck with your work. I’m rooting for you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a much appreciated cheer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also very grateful for the food, as I ate random foods recently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After parting with Risha, I left the inn and headed for the royal castle where Rushia and her family were waiting for me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; nice decoration, the whole city is buoyant.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is still early in the morning so it is not that busy, but there are still more people on the streets than usual. Advertisements and information boards for the Festival of Valour were set up everywhere in the city. The residents of the Royal Capital also seem to want to enjoy this festival to the fullest, and are voluntarily decorating the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived at the gates of the royal castle, admiring the arched decorations hanging between the lampposts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two guards on either side of the gate bowed silently when they saw my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded lightly and passed through the gate.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now that I realise it, how is it possible for a mere adventurer to enter the royal castle with a face-pass &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Convenient, but I might as well point it out when I have time.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about going straight into the castle, but then remembered that I still had some time to spare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to stop by the gardens to kill a little time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Mm, who are you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I stepped into the gardens, I heard someone&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a girl&#8217;s voice, echoing directly into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me is a pure white dragon, standing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia?  Are you in your dragon form?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned?&#8230;&#8230;Umu. Returning back.』”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s body in dragon form emits a pale light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The white dragon quickly returned to the girl&#8217;s form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What have you been doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sunbathing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s an old man&#8217;s hobby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are those eyes? It feels good to sunbathe on a dragon&#8217;s body, doesn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Is that so?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does the smooth and big surface area make her feel better?&#8230;.. No, she’s not a plant.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, even without the sunbathing, I&#8217;ve been turning my body into a dragon in this garden from time to time since I got the dragonisation disease. It&#8217;s an ingrained habit that I have to continue or I won&#8217;t be able to relax.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, the first time I visited this garden, Lucilla had dragonised her body. That time she had a seizure and had no choice, but this time it was voluntary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve already mastered dragonification, haven&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Now I can do things like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Rushia turned her right arm into a dragon&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was covered from the elbow to the tip with white scaling scales, and sharp claws extended from the wrist area. However, the size of the animal remained the same as a human arm. It looked as if it were covered by a strong basket of hands.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was admiring Rushia&#8217;s smooth use of dragonisation, my eyes met those of a squire walking along the corridor of the castle. The squire looks at me and then at Rushia, who is dragonising her arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The squire&#8230;..did not look particularly shocked, quietly bowed his head and walked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.When Rushia&#8217;s dragonification disease was discovered, I honestly wondered what would happen to you, but it seems that you completely settled back into your normal relationship with the people around you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say with relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But upon hearing this, Rushia had a complicated look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm&#8230;&#8230;unfortunately, things are not completely back to normal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me, with difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Commoners can accept it. But the nobility and royalty are exposed to the public eye. They are conscious of their appearance. Not many nobles will accept this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Rushia returned her right arm to that of a human being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you ask me, the only people around me who have been infected with the Dragon Disease are adventurers. The only example I know of of a member of the royal family being infected with the Dragon Disease is Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Sorry, I wasn&#8217;t considerate enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t mind. I don&#8217;t care, so there&#8217;s no need to worry about it, Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said with a carefree smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Father is concerned. He&#8217;s having a hard time deciding who to make an offer to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An offer&#8230;..Rushia? What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who else could it be but this mistress?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a royal affair. She is still very young, but it seems that she already has to think about her future partner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m not worried. If the need arises, I can just use Ned as father’s son-in-law.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s true&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Haa&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost let it slide, but then I felt he said something strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think my father would object if it was you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t think so, and generally my intention is&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lightly chuckled, Rushia looked at me, her eyes moist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You..don’t like it..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia looks at me when our skin is just about to touch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia was originally a normal young girl, but she has a beautiful appearance and is certain to become a beauty of the highest order in the future. When such a young girl is approached in such a cute and adorable way, it is something that makes me feel a little bit of a rush──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..If you can make jokes like that, it means you&#8217;re not bothered about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu&#8230;.. well, that’s true, but I think I could be a bit more upset.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Rushia had done the same to me five years later, it might have been a bad idea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled again at Rushia, whose lips twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right now, I have a lot more to do than just making and thinking about marriage proposals. The selection test for the Hero Party is one of them. I&#8217;ll finish all that then&#8230;&#8230;I’ll finish this..stuff afterwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes she seems like a girl of her age, other times she exudes the dignity of a princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a girl worthy of respect. I&#8217;m glad I left the Kingdom of Intail for the Kingdom of Enuvidia. It allowed me to meet Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Ned. After five years, it&#8217;s not a problem, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt I had to answer that question carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether there is a problem or not&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.at least, in five years time I&#8217;ll have to take it seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu&#8230;&#8230;Well, for now, I&#8217;ll just have to be content with that answer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what Rushia is thinking right now, but I felt it was better not to know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look around briefly. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No outsiders&#8230;.. good. Shall I get to the topic?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her in a slightly hushed voice, Rushia immediately put on a serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the sound of my voice, she must have sensed that it was a serious topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ever since the first exam, I&#8217;ve been investigating suspicious parties, relying on Winryn&#8217;s help. But, no matter how much time I spent, there was one party that I couldn&#8217;t fully investigate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Couldn&#8217;t fully investigate?] I nodded to Rushia, who tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Precisely, there are parties that exist, no matter how much we look into them, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to find anything suspicious about them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re&#8230;..clean, does it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too clean. It&#8217;s so clean, it&#8217;s almost suspicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be easy enough to just reject them, but they&#8217;re too good a party to drop just because they&#8217;re suspicious. I just need to give it a bit more of a look.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, I understand. I’ll put all my trust in Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia’s words made me realise that she has her full trust in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I&#8217;ll be responsible for keeping an eye on that party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, which is this suspicious party &#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia asked with a mysterious look on her face, and I whispered in her ear with a quiet tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia rolled her eyes in surprise.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large crowd had gathered in the mortar-shaped arena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The venue was supposed to have quite a lot of seating, but it seemed to be already full, and the standing room was crammed with people. Young members of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 are organising and guiding the audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. From now on, we will hold the opening ceremony of the Festival of Valour.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of the hall, May, the examiner, echoes an announcement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the audience roared with cheers and applause. As if a volcano had erupted, the heat of the audience began to overflow. The atmosphere felt as if it was shaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Before we open the tournament, we will receive a greeting from the Princess of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, Princess Rushia Enuvidia.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, May descended from the platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A silver-haired girl then appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia Enuvidia! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering here today!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, a thunderous cheer rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The public&#8217;s attention to Rushia has been increasing day by day since the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The appearance of Rushia, the most talked-about person in the kingdom at the moment, was the best performance in the event of the selection of the hero party, an event that will create a new future for the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The forthcoming valour festival is officially the second round of the hero party selection test. Twenty-four parties passed the first round of tests held recently&#8230;.At this year&#8217;s festival of valour, we&#8217;ll narrow it down to ten more parties.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Festival of Valour is not just a festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience regained their composure as Rushia spoke as if to tighten their spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『This is the first time that the Kingdom of Enuvidia has receive a lot of heroes. So I have been thinking. What kind of people would be suitable for the heroic party that will carry our country on their backs? &#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the people in the audience, Rushia continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The answer to that question is this festival of valour.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia tells the audience with full confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Please let us all find out at this festival of valour.Whether these heroes who have gathered here are truly worthy to carry our country on their backs and whether they are capable of valour. I want you to see their talents, their abilities, their wits and their personalities with your own eyes!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new hero, who is said to have slain the poisonous dragon, cries out for her country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『For our kingdom, this battle has great significance and responsibility!　Therefore, heroes!　I want you to show me with all your might!　Your will &#8211; your determination to carry your country on your shoulders!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Russia tells them as if she herself is one of the candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『From now on, we will hold the second test &#8211; the Festival of Valour!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Rushia&#8217;s voice echoed through the hall, the cheers exploded as if to drown it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if a huge bolt of lightning had fallen, and the voice burst into a thunderous roar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The excitement of the audience spread throughout the venue. My palms, which I had been watching, were slowly sweating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air was suitable for this historic moment. I&#8217;m sure this scene will be in the textbooks next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Come!　I, Faina＝Pallette, the lively entertainment district, will now take over as the live commentator!　I am very grateful to be entrusted with such an honourable job!　I will aim to be the royal family&#8217;s favourite play-by-play man, so if you give me a chance, I would be very grateful!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience was thrilled by the comments of the woman assigned to do the live commentary, Faina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is aiming for a career that is quite different from the actual situation of the royal family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m usually the host of a show in the entertainment district, but I&#8217;m also a B-level adventurer, so this time I&#8217;m going to make sure I&#8217;m ready to take on the competitors!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An impressed [Oh] was heard from the audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Then let’s have the second commentator introduce himself!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes, I am Ritter＝Seisel the second live commentator. I usually work at the Court Institute of Magic, doing research on magical tools, and I&#8217;m a colleague of Heisen, a player competing in the B Block.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listening to Ritter, the man assigned to provide commentary, introduce himself, I entered the hall&#8217;s officials&#8217; space. After passing through a long, narrow corridor and up a flight of stairs, I reached the spectator seating area, which had glass walls. It was probably the best vantage point of any seating area. It is a privilege for the examiners to watch the games from here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, you&#8217;re already here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who had entered the room from the opposite corridor, recognised me and called out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re really getting into the swing of things as an examiner. I liked your first speech.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,you sure? Well, I was quickly replaced by Rushia, &#8230;&#8230;I hope it went well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May couldn&#8217;t contain the emotions that were rising up in her, and grinned. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just&#8230;&#8230;I’m glad I hired those two commentators. I couldn&#8217;t have done that talking shtick.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;well, they are professional”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I certainly can&#8217;t imagine May doing that  style of speaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it was decided to name the second round of examinations the Valour Festival and to make it a lively event, it was decided that a commentary would be hired from outside. This was because the majority of people involved in the management of the Hero Party Selection Examination are involved in national politics, and we thought that if we were to act as commentators, the atmosphere would be too stuffy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Now then, the players from Block A &#8211;  let&#8217;s go!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bustle of the arena turned their focus at the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The parties belonging to Block A appeared one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. What do you think is going to happen&#8230;.to this battle royale?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s question got me thinking as I looked at the players.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, the number of surviving parties is twenty-four. In the festival of valour, it will be divided into A and B blocks, so in one block, twelve parties will fight and five parties will win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Block A, which is about to begin, there were a number of leading players.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among them, the one who is still attracting the most attention is the blonde girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The most promising candidate is, after all, Seren Duvalis. Her Existence Power of 5 is huge. She is the only one among them who does not have a party, but I think she is good enough to overturn the difference in the number of&#8230;..people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, the other existence force 5, will be competing in Block B, so the two will not fight in the Valour Festival. So in terms of existence power alone, Block A is Seren&#8217;s own field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The runner-up would be Lux, the moving fortress.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He&#8217;s the leader of the vigilantes in Baron Lumeth&#8217;s territory, which has an unbelievably high number of monsters. As his two names suggest, he is characterised by his fortress-like endurance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May also seems to have taken in all the information about the players in her mind as the test director.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are quite a few other players I&#8217;m paying attention to, such as Fena the Ironfire Spear and Mirei the Wind Dancer, but&#8230;&#8230;the one I&#8217;m personally interested in is Hartia Tirleis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl with purple-blue hair tied into a single knot on the circular field where the players fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The second daughter of the Marquise Tirleis? Why are you interested in her?&#8230;&#8230;You wouldn&#8217;t say you like the way she looks, do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wouldn&#8217;t say&#8230;..Well, I certainly think she&#8217;s well put-together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained, ignoring May, who looked at me with piercing eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hartia Tirleis is apparently the head of the adventure department at the Royal Rowana Academy. I&#8217;m curious to see how well she fares as a student representative.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were three men and women around Hartia. All were dressed in school uniforms. She explained in the interview that she had formed a party with only her classmates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventure department means that they are literally learning about adventure. Hartia seems to be a noblewoman, but she seems to be in a position where she is allowed a lot of freedom, as she is learning a field that has nothing to do with the running of the estate. Probably because she is the second daughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero parties contribute to their country by travelling around the world. Nobles, on the other hand, stay in their country and protect their lands. Because of the incompatible roles of the two, it was unusual for nobles to apply for this selection test. It seems that there are no foolish nobles in this country who are dazzled by power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, did Ned ever go to school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did. I went to school until I was fifteen, in the Kingdom of Intail. Well, I skipped about half of my attendance days, and I was generally just having adventures with someone else&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can picture that scene…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of schools, I wonder if Julius, who replaced me in the 『Stardust Light』, is doing well?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the academy, he attended classes on my behalf and helped me a lot with the exams&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a good memory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are a lot of strong contenders, &#8230;&#8230; but that&#8217;s probably not the highlight of Block A.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.what do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained, choosing my words carefully, to May, who asked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think of Seren&#8217;s personality, May?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Personality?&#8230;&#8230; Honestly, I don’t have a very good impression of her during the interview, but I could see her core strength. I got the impression that she had no doubt in her mind that she was going to be a hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I agree with you. So this is just my prediction&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, looking at the girl standing in the centre of the field, her fighting spirit boiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s&#8230;.probably going to take them all down.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Block A &#8211; the match is about to begin!!』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren let out a small exhalation as soon as the live radio signalled the start of the match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She confirms the rules in her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The format of the match is battle royal, meaning everyone is an enemy. The field is this circular sandy area in the centre of the venue. The victory condition is to be among the five remaining parties. The condition for defeat is to lose the battle or surrender before then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The referee around the field decides if a combatant is incapacitated or surrenders. Until the referee decides that a fighter is incapacitated, he may pursue, but it is a foul to deliberately attack an opponent who is&#8230;clearly incapacitated or demoralised.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;such pathetic rules.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was convinced by the sight of the doctors waiting behind the judges. In the hands of the doctors were expensive magical tools that could instantly heal a certain amount of trauma. There was no way they could casually prepare that much magical equipment. In a real battle, she doesn&#8217;t see that kind of magical equipment very often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The valour festival is probably a kind of performance, like a match or a mock battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren doesn&#8217;t like it, but she doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong either. The heroic parties are the ones who bear the expectations of the people. The ability to gain popularity is essential.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The festival of valour is surely a test to showcase such abilities as she interpreted it in her own way, Seren noticed several shadows approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Roughly ten men and women are approaching with an openly wary look on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not one party. Two&#8230;&#8230;no, three parties were after Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren Duvalis&#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t take it personally.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just another way of getting around.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Armed, well-dressed men glared at Seren and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aaaaah!?　Three parties are surrounding Seren!　Even though she has no party, is this difference in numbers too much?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s not a problem. They still follow the rules. Even heroes sometimes join forces with someone else. Seren is the only candidate in Block A with a presence power of 5, so they must be very wary.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd collectively goes wild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; saved me the trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren tells the dubious man with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said it saved me a lot of trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren then drew a sword from the yellow scabbard sheathed at her waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A [bachiri] sound is heard. Lightning gushed out from the blade of the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other parties rush to ready their weapons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the next instant──Seren&#8217;s figure disappeared and was replaced by a flash of violent lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guaaa──!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From one end of the field to the other, Seren runs through in an instant. The men along the way were reamed out by a bolt of lightning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After flying at lightning speed through the low sky, Seren puts both feet on the wall and looks at her next target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment she swung her sword. Her figure disappeared again and a bolt of lightning shot across the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only a few seconds later, the referee raises his flag at the sight of the fallen men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh, in the blink of an eye, three parties have dropped out!　This is Seren Duvalis!　The presence power of five is no joke!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『As a user of the special armoury 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》, she is as fast and sharp. I would say that the lightning-clad Seren is a lightning bolt itself.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ground-shaking cheer rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword shatters with a clattering sound in Seren&#8217;s arm, which does not disturb her breath even a single breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armament &#8211; 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is in the form of a scabbard, which Seren now holds at her waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword in the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 is imbued with the power of thunder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, because of its immense power, the swords often do not hold up. A cheap, poor-quality sword will shatter the moment it is put into its sheath in the first place, and an ordinary sword is limited to a single swing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why Seren had one sword at her waist and six swords strapped to her back. The way she crossed her swords on his back, three at a time, as if drawing an &#8216;X&#8217;, could be described as bizarre.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The swords that had been stored in the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 from the beginning were now shattered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are only six swords left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s enough to win this match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren pulls a sword from her back and places it in the《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 on her left hip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she drew her sword again &#8211; a [bachiri] sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Searching for her next prey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren looks around the field and sees a young man with earth-coloured hair. While most of the players are wary of Seren, the young man is fierce and belligerent. A look that she doesn&#8217;t like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lightning of the blade spreads and envelopes Seren&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a single step, Seren&#8217;s figure disappears like a haze, and another bolt of lightning flashes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;Ooo!!? Danger!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren&#8217;s sword, which was supposed to lightly obliterate the young man&#8217;s flank, was blocked by a rock armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren&#8217;s eyes, which had intended to deal with the enemy in an indifferent manner, showed a slight agitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three men responded to the youth&#8217;s command.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spears approached from the left and axes from the right. Seren evaded them by leaping backwards, but immediately afterwards a dagger was thrown at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Twisting in mid-air, Seren narrowly avoids the dagger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she landed, the sword in Seren&#8217;s hand shattered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The person who prevented Seren&#8217;s onslaught was the moving fortress candidate, Lux!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『He prevented the onslaught of Seren with her proud defence. The effect of his special armour 《Armour of Genbu Peak》 is simple&#8230;..In exchange for mobility, it produces strong and tough armour&#8230;..Because of its simple effect, it will be extremely difficult to break it from the front.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(岩武嶺の鎧)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: Okay, this name is quite complicated for me, credits to boilpoil. 岩武 = Genbu, the Turtle, of the four guardian animal. 嶺 = peak/cliff. 鎧 = armour.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voices of the actual situation and commentary reach Seren&#8217;s ears.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No wonder, that they were so skilled at working together.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Barony of Lumeth, vigilantes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, what. I&#8217;m surprised that the Thunder Emperor knows about us.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s well known among adventurers&#8230;&#8230;The Barony of Lumeth, where powerful monsters frequently appear. It is thanks to you and your vigilantes that people can live in peace in a dangerous place that everyone would normally avoid. You seem to be very competent, as you fight monsters on a daily basis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s true. When it comes to smashing monsters, there&#8217;s no one better than us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are no monsters here, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha!! There is a monster here!──A monster called Seren Duvalis!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after Lux smiles ferociously like a predator, his companions attack Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man flanks Seren with a single step and cleaves his spear to the side with a slashing sound of the wind. Not only Lux, who retains the nickname of the moving fortress, but also his party members have a strong presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren draws another sword from her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t let her sheath her swords!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lux shouts. It seems that he also had planned countermeasures against the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lax had deactivated his 《rock ridge armour》, and was observing Seren while giving him instructions from the rear. The moment Seren went on the offensive, he would immediately approach Seren, and would probably calculate to defend himself by putting his body on the line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lux deactivated his 《Armour of Genbu Peak》 and observed Seren while giving instructions to his companion. The moment Seren went on the offensive, he would immediately approach Seren, and he would defend himself with his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren, then, moves away from the men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the men chasing her, Seren tried to sheathe her sword. The men then try to approach Seren in a frustrated manner &#8211; but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later. Seren turned the tip of her sword, which she was about to sheathe, around and pointed it at the men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a move that monsters can&#8217;t do, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A Feint ─!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The startled man tries to retreat in a panic. But before he can do so, Seren strikes the man in the chest with the peak of her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking down at the groaning man, Seren this time put the sword into the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then ── once again, a flash of light runs through the man&#8217;s chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu ── o&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren, who turned into a bolt of lightning as she drew her sword, killed two of Lax&#8217;s companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lux immediately activates the 《Armour of Genbu Peak》. Rocks appeared from somewhere and tried to envelop Lux&#8217;s entire body, but  before they could do so. Seren&#8217;s thrust blew Lux away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lux collides backwards into the rear wall and falls without effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The referee does not raise his hand. It seems Lux still has the energy to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren immediately tried to follow up, but the sword shattered shortly afterwards.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I was going to save my quality sword for the final exam&#8230;.this would have gone smoother if I had brought extras’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren has four swords left. Although there was plenty to spare, it was troublesome that they broke so easily every time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled out the swords and put them in《Phantom Dance of Lightning》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a girl with hanging purple-blue hair spoke to Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you, my name is Hartia Tirleis. I belong to the Adventure Department of the Royal Rowana Academy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren immediately knew why she had been approached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Royal Rowana Academy. Located in the royal capital of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, it is the largest school in the kingdom. Children of all ages attend the school, from primary to high school, and can study a wide range of subjects, from pharmacy to adventure studies. Historically, it is a venerable educational institution that has been instrumental in improving the culture of the people of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was a graduate of the Rowana Academy&#8217;s adventure studies department.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Hartia in front of her is Seren&#8217;s junior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have long heard of your seniority. I look forward to meeting you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they were in the middle of a battle, Hartia bowed politely like a daughter of a marquess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, a commoner would be afraid to stand up to a nobleman, even if it was just for entertainment. However, this valour festival is organised by the royal family, Rushia Enuvidia. As long as the royalty wants a fair fight, the other nobles have no choice but to comply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So there is not a single reason for Seren to go easy on Hartia now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she understands this and wants hand-to-hand combat, then she has a lot of nerve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that will have to wait for another time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hartia widens her eyes, as if she didn&#8217;t expect to be rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This time, I&#8217;m not just going to take on you &#8211; I&#8217;m going to take on everyone here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words that Seren said were a declaration of war against all the candidates on the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candidates, who had been wary of Seren from a while ago, all at once became war-weary upon hearing her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Seren paid them no heed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《The thunderous phantom flower scatters to the far-off lands…》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silently, she began to chant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Its flashes shredded dreams.》《Leaving the real world behind.──》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scabbard at Seren&#8217;s waist was electrified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had not yet drawn the sword from its scabbard. But as the scabbard became violently charged, the sword&#8217;s hilt turned yellow. It was as if the sword had turned into lightning itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release ─ 《Thunder Flash》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without hesitation, Seren ran fast as a bolt of lightning.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increases the output of lightning for a certain period of time. That is the effect of 《Thunder Flash》. When the output of the simple but originally powerful 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 is increased, its power reaches the level of a special kill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moving fortress Lux is clad in rock armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Seren&#8217;s thrust penetrated that rock with ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guaaa──!!!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lux screams as he is slammed into the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aftermath of the impact also blew away Lux&#8217;s companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『La, Lax party is out!!!　Seren is continuing to attack blindly!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword in Seren&#8217;s hand shattered and fell to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren quickly sheathes the next sword.──The 《Thunder Flash》 is still powered on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight parties remain.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p111-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1024" /></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;Riese. You&#8217;ve changed since you met that guy, Ned or whatever he&#8217;s called.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a speed that could not be detected by the naked eye, Seren headed for the centre of the field. In the next instant, she rotates her body with a small leap and sends a slash of lightning in all directions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thunderous roar and a blast of wind caused a cloud of dust and sand. The gushing lightning scorched the two parties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six parties remain. Seren sheathed her sword again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I will become a hero and&#8230;&#8230;wake you up.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gripped the hilt with strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, stay low!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of Seren, Hartia instructed her companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay calm! If one more party drops out, this match will be over&#8230;..Anyway, just concentrate on enduring for now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hartia realised the difference in strength between her and Seren and chose to endure. This was probably a decision made by Seren, who saw that she was not attached to Hartia at all. Seren was simply defeating the opponents that came into view at random. ──As if she was kicking away a stone on the side of the road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hartia, who until a short time ago had been giving Seren a look of respect, now had a look of humiliation on her face that passed in awe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this face, Seren let out a small sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As a senior, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next target could be anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Seren dared to turn her body towards Hartia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you follow the rules──you&#8217;re second class..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flash of yellow light flashes through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lightning engulfed not only Hartia, but also many of the other candidates on the field.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『T–the game is over&#8230;! The party that passed through Block A is &#8230;..three parties!　Two more parties have been eliminated than planned!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Seren&#8217;s onslaught was so fierce that the referee&#8217;s judgement was delayed.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The actual situation and commentary are, to say, bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The parties that made it through Block A were a party with just one person, Seren, a party led by Feena the Iron Fire Spear, and a party led by Mirei the Wind Dancer. Among the high-profile players, the moving fortress Lux and the party of Hartia, a student at the Royal Academy, were eliminated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a complete irregularity, as the original plan was to let two more parties through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the audience was thrilled&#8230;.At these kinds of events, the irregularities are often the best part of the event. A long, loud cheer enveloped the audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, from the examiners&#8217; point of view, irregularities are nothing short of distressing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.she did it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Seren was going to ignore the rules and defeat as many parties as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The proof of this is that &#8211; Seren has consumed all seven swords she had prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With six parties remaining, Seren had two swords left. If she had only defeated Hartia, she would have only needed to consume one sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Presumably, Seren had consumed one more sword after annihilating Hartia&#8217;s party, and then defeated two additional parties. So in the end there were only three parties left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of the field, Seren is making a dissatisfied face, as if to say that she has failed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It seems that she was dissatisfied that she couldn&#8217;t beat everyone. I&#8217;m glad her sword shattered before that.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. that was overwhelming.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, May, next to me, muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“During the interview, I didn&#8217;t have a good impression of her. When I learnt that Seren was going to defeat everyone in this fight, I felt like she was a nuisance who was unnecessarily disturbing the harmony&#8230;&#8230;.but I have to admit that it&#8217;s a quandary to get to this point. How much of that strength&#8230;&#8230; is really based on how much she&#8217;s studied? It&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;Stunning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until the match started, May didn&#8217;t seem to like Seren much, but&#8230;&#8230;now she looked at her with respect in her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any ego, if it has the strength to carry through, is now a belief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren has shown herself to be a vessel worthy of a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As a knight, do you admire that kind of strength?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I do. As for the point about her, personally, I&#8217;m still not impressed, but &#8230;&#8230; with that kind of strength, I would be able to fight more for Rushia-sama. In the case of the Poison Demon Dragon, I almost left it up to the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, you know. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think so, but it is also true that the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 made an exceptional contribution to the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon. Originally, the &#8216;『White Dragon Chivalric Order』were a world-famous adventurer party. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something to compare them with, but I guess the serious May can&#8217;t help but be conscious of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, May, isn&#8217;t it about time you show yourself at the Block B?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah!That&#8217;s right! I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m going now!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had been so absorbed in watching the match that he had forgotten about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May hurried towards the broadcasting booth where the commentator crew was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike May, I don&#8217;t have much work to do during the Festival of Valour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was still some time left as the B Block match was being cleared. There was nothing to do in the spectator stands, so I decided to walk outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking down the corridor and blend in with the crowds, I noticed three men and a woman. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them, a tall, thin, grey-haired man, looked familiar. He was Exzair Sullivan, who had assisted Alice during the interview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their grouping means that they are&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Alice Feldrant&#8217;s party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you&#8217;re the interviewer from the first test.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair  notices my presence and bows lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Alice is not present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a quick look around and the two men and women next to Exzair bowed their heads to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Phylicia＝Murray.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">フィリア＝マーレイ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m Kirch＝Eisen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">キルヒ＝アイゼン</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl with green hair and a calm demeanour is Phylicia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark-skinned man with the scar on his chin is called Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the looks of it, Phylicia is a bowman and Kirch is an axeman?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. I&#8217;m more of a healer.”</span></p>

<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p117-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1024" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia denies my prediction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Healers are adventurers who heal their fellow adventurers. The method can be anything, such as medicinal herbs or magic, but in the case of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, healers with special armaments are probably the most common.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like Alice, I was an adventurer when I was a student. Back then, I used to fight with this bow, but I had an accident when I got a request to&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Phylicia picked up the bow she was carrying and gripped it lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a purple smoke-like substance covered Phylicia&#8217;s left eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is called the Purple Smoke Curse. Because of this curse, which was placed on me by the monsters I was supposed to defeat, my vision in my left eye became blocked every time I held my bow. Because of this&#8230;.. I had no choice but to quit being a bowman.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would have been a disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Phylicia removed her hand from the bow, the purple smoke in her left eye disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The purple smoke curse is so powerful that not even the universal elixir can break it. I turned to a healer because I thought that&#8230;&#8230;I should find a way to break the curse myself. My right eye is fine and I still use a bow, but it&#8217;s so poorly accurate compared to my&#8230;&#8230; past.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia says, lowering her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia was known as a master archer&#8230;&#8230; before she was cursed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a small voice, Kirch adds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia smiled in trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch–san, it’s all in the past now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; but it&#8217;s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch told her without changing his expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an intriguing story, but from the looks of Phylicia, she doesn&#8217;t seem to want to be pried into. It is probably complicated for her, as she seems to be digging up her past glories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you and Alice end up in one party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice and I are childhood friends. We grew up in the same place and went to the same school. So she invited me because of that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">New information about Alice is obtained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you two were childhood friends and went to the same school, does that mean &#8230;&#8230; Alice and Phylicia were adventurers together when they were students?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be natural to think so, but Phylicia looks uncomfortable and said</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..No. For various reasons, we worked separately from each other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they attended the same school, they seemed to have worked individually as adventurers.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Come to think of it, Alice spoke during the interview that she followed the hero Rin to the Amdo Empire a year ago. Maybe that&#8217;s why they couldn&#8217;t work together.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After I joined Alice&#8217;s party, we trained together and I am proud to say that we have no problems with the combination. I am a second-rate bowman, but because of that, I trained at a sanatorium and honed my skills as a healer, so I hope you will pay attention to me as a healer at the Festival of Valour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia was apparently trained at a sanatorium to hone her healing skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her calm appearance, she seems to have a stoic personality, as she turned herself into a healer to break the curse. Talking to her like this, I get the impression she has a strong will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, I shifted my gaze to Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to hear what Kirch had to say, but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I used to be a mercenary soldier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch says this and his lips close together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A brief silence ensues. Realising that his explanation was insufficient, Kirch opened his mouth again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I am a survivor of the Ruinous Demon Tribe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unusual word came out of nowhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the clan sounded familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a clan that has been fighting demons on the eastern continent?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know about us&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve only heard rumours. I&#8217;ve never met them in person until today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch widened his eyes in surprise. His tribe is not very famous in the public eye. He was surprised that I, a person from another country, knew about them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ruinous Demon Tribe are a tribe on the eastern continent who make their living fighting demons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The term &#8216;demon&#8217; refers to a humanoid monster with a muscular physique and horns sprouting from its head. On the eastern continent, there seems to be an area where these ogres are abundant,the Demons are in charge of managing the area and exterminating any ogres that appear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, the Ruinous Demon Tribe, as I recall, was founded a few years ago&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Aaa. Our clan was defeated and scattered by the evil monsters known as the Deceptive Onikki.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sad face, Kirch speaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m &#8230;&#8230;looking for my missing sister right now. To be honest, half of my quest for the Hero Party is also a personal one. Since the&#8230;&#8230;Hero Party travels all over the world, I thought it would be easier to find my sister.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People have different reasons for wanting to become a member of the Hero Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all of the candidates will be motivated by such a beautiful cause as wanting to work for the country. For this party, there seems to be no problem because of the leader Alice&#8217;s aspiration to become a hero person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did Kirch meet Alice?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;After escaping from the Deceptive Onikki, I became a mercenary to make ends meet. But when &#8230;.. I went to take down a large monster on business, I was surrounded. I was almost killed by the monsters, but Alice saved me&#8230;&#8230;This is a connection between the two of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch says seriously.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice is a&#8230;..benefactor to me. So I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t have turned down Alice&#8217;s offer&#8230;&#8230;even if it hadn&#8217;t been for my sister.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, that&#8217;s why Kirch said half of it was personal.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s reasons for wanting to join the Hero Party is to find his sister and to repay his debt to Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After explaining everything, Kirch suddenly makes an awkward face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you can see, I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8230;not a good talker. I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m rude&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. It&#8217;s okay for there to be at least one person in a hero party who&#8217;s not a good talker.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Kirch beamed happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You &#8230;&#8230; are a nice guy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt slightly happy when Kirch put it like that, but if I&#8230;.. think about it, the leader of this party is Alice. The combination of Alice, who is too timid, and Kirch, who is not a good talker, might make it difficult to negotiate. I hope Exzair and Phylicia are balancing things out. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Kirch. That tattoo belongs to the mercenaries, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, pointing to the tattoo on Kirch&#8217;s right arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above the raised muscles were drawn one spreading wing and downward-facing fangs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa…This is the tattoo of the Glazray mercenary group I used to be a part of. &#8230;..The leader of the group, Glazray, was originally the captain of the Fourth Squadron in that world&#8217;s largest mercenary group, the Sieghardt Mercenaries&#8230;..This tattoo is apparently a replica of the Sieghardt Mercenaries&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mercenary companies often have a common tattoo somewhere on their bodies as a symbol of unity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood why the tattoo was familiar to me when I heard Kirch&#8217;s story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew that Glazray created a mercenary group, but I didn&#8217;t expect to meet some of its members here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re close with the leader&#8230;&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“yup.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head at Kirch, who winded his eyes again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is Glazray doing?　Six months ago, he said he lost one of his arms in a mysterious accident&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.It&#8217;s not a problem. He claims that he is even stronger than before since he bought a superior prosthetic hand&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s just like him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I chuckle, Kirch smiles too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Glazray was concerned that he had not yet been able to address the leader of the&#8230;..Sieghardt Mercenaries to say goodbye. He said he was a little guilty because he left the mercenaries  so abruptly after the expedition was over. He told him in a&#8230;.. letter, but he wanted to see him in person because he owed him a debt of&#8230;..gratitude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch must have admired Glazray. Since he says it with a concerned look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. He shouldn’t have to worry about it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing. I’m thinking about other stuff….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deceive Kirch, who looks at me strangely but in an appropriate manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader of the Sieghart Mercenaries is ──── me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was originally a small mercenary business that Sieghardt, the captain of the first squad, and I started together. Somehow, it turned out to be the biggest in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may be because we accepted people who were on the street or who had been driven from their homes by monsters from one side to the other. Glazray was one of those who joined the ranks in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that we hardly work together any more, I would like to hand over the position of leader to someone else, but Sieghardt stubbornly refuses to take that position. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still the leader of the Sieghart Mercenaries. I&#8217;m a completely ornamental leader, but somehow the other members of the group seem to be satisfied with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So for me&#8230;&#8230;Kirch is a subordinate of a subordinate of a subordinate. Sieghardt&#8217;s subordinate, Glazray&#8217;s subordinate, that&#8217;s the man in front of me, Kirch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a connection in a strange way, but at least I don&#8217;t have to tell him now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The B Block matches are about to start. I don&#8217;t want to confuse him by giving any unnecessary information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. So, where is Alice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well….she’s out to buy something….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia replies with an affectionate smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, the sound of running can be heard in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m back──Hyaaaa! The interviewer is back..?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had come over in a hurry, looked exaggeratedly surprised when she saw my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, sir!　Did I do something wrong,&#8230;&#8230;, or did I get rejected,&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,&#8230;&#8230;we were just talking normally.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How insecure are you?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where have you been?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yes. Well, you know, to the ladies&#8217; room&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t have to be so specific</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]&#8230;&#8230;Everyone except Alice looks awkward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a strange girl in many ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you watch the fight in Block A?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes. Of course I did.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you have any thoughts about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thoughts, you mean &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked at me strangely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; nothing in particular.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice replied with a puzzled look on her face, as if she did not understand the intent of the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel slightly worried ────.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A faint but definite feeling of discomfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The match just now must have had many highlights. In particular, Seren, who shares the same presence strength 5 as Alice, made a bold show. The dramatic strength of the crowd&#8217;s enthusiasm was evident in their enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet Alice is&#8230;&#8230;nonchalant, as if she were watching a boring match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Alice-Ferdlant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah, hiya!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to Alice, as if the name was etched strongly in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl overreacts and her face turns pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Seren becomes a hero, she will surely achieve spectacular success. She will defeat extraordinary monsters one after another and steadily progress on the road to defeating the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand,  the future of Alice as a hero is hard to imagine. There is an unstable mix of good and bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However &#8211; the person who is chosen to be a hero always easily exceeds the expectations of an ordinary person like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice may have the qualities of a brave person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I had to tell her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you really want to be a hero I expect you to be sincere.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Festival of Valour, Block B candidates have arrived!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bustling entertainment district, Faina tells us in a well-defined voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the candidates on the field were unifying their spirits in their own ways. Some took deep breaths, some stretched, others concentrated on their own routines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Commentator Ritter, are there any candidates to watch out for?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The first would be Glock, the leader of the Vanhardt Knights. The Knights of Vanhardt, as you probably know, are the venerable knightly order of the Dukes of Vanhardt. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is twinned with the Knights of the Kingsguard in terms of name recognition alone. The head of this knightly order, which is the object of admiration for many knights, gives us high expectations of what kind of battles he will really put up. And the party members all look like members of the Order of the Knights.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All eyes of the audience were on the knight at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Vanhardt Knights. Their trademark is their armour, which is made of steel and engraved with a jade-grey emblem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although affiliated to the dukes, it was an organisation that placed more emphasis on merit than on prestige, and was a knightly order that did not feel aristocratic in the good sense of the word. Because of its nature, it is trusted by the people and is the object of admiration for active knights and for boys and girls who aspire to become knights. The name of its leader, Glock, was well known in the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Other players include Fuzen the Green Shadow, also known as the poster child of survival, and Alex the Red-Haired, who has repeatedly killed giants with his wealth of strategies. Both have a Existence Power of 4, which is not low by any means.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuzen the Green Shadow, a man in a green cloak. The Red-haired Alec, who has been steadily building up his achievements as an adventurer. The attention is also focused on the two men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『And of course, attention should also be paid to this player. Alice Feldrant&#8230;&#8230; the only player in Block B with a presence force of 5.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience chimes in with a resounding [Oooh].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience was so excited it made Alice&#8217;s shoulders tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If you talking about  Existence Power 5, she’s the same as Seren, who is candidate in Block A.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes. But unlike Seren, there is not a lot of information about Alice. I think a lot of the audience doesn’t know much about Alice&#8230;..Is she not very prominent in the first place? Or is she&#8230;..simply not good at standing out?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience looks at Alice again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiii,hyeeee”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice hid behind Phylicia&#8217;s back with a pallid face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Probably the latter] thought everyone in the audience. The entire audience begins to groan, as it is too hard to believe that this girl is really an Existence Power 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Personally, though, I&#8217;m concerned about my colleague Heisen. Look at&#8230;.the other parties are properly armed, but only his party is wearing a white coat. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s suited for combat in any way. &#8230;..How did he pass the first test?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience burst into laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the candidates had prepared vague answers to the commentary&#8217;s questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the commentary says, Heisen’s party, for all intents and purposes are indoorsmen and do not appear to be good at fighting. However, they are probably by far the most knowledgeable of the candidates when it comes to magical tools alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a way, they are a party whose moves are the most difficult to read.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen’s party is treated like a special case and that’s why other parties were seriously wary of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well then,all parties! Get ready!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that announcement, the candidates ready themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hall was silent and tense. A blood-chilling, tingling atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Block B &#8211; this battle  starts….Now!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as the announcement battle shouted, a man drew his sword from its scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man opens his mouth, glaring at the other candidate around him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoever you are. Would you like to make a deal.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vanhardt Knights, Commander Glock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who headed the meritocratic Order of the Knights had a tremendous dignity and was so powerful that an ordinary person would be intimidated by the sound of his voice alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But everyone in this field aspires to be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll teach you, clever knight, how adventurers fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t like two against one?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two parties joined forces and surrounded Glock&#8217;s party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone saw such tactics in Block A. In Block B, it became clear that the Glock was as much on alert of his surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nearby──a grey-haired man in a white coat moves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex the Red-Haired.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen, an expert on grimoires, approached the red-haired adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alec turns around with a dubious look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a question for you, veteran adventurer. Do you know the boundary between &#8230;&#8230; magical tools and special armaments?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. it&#8217;s whether it&#8217;s made from monster material or not, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi Alex, we&#8217;re in the middle of a match.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fellow colleague named Rygan chastised Alex for conversing so leisurely with his opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen, however, smiles with satisfaction, seemingly without hostility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct. Magical tools are made from ores, plants and other materials, whereas special armaments are made from materials derived from monsters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex knew at least that much, so he nodded his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you think that in &#8230;&#8230; only special armaments are used in battle?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen asked again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because&#8230;..special armaments are stronger. Magical tools are useful but less powerful. It is a fool&#8217;s errand to fight with a sewing needle when you have a sword in front of you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. That&#8217;s exactly how the public perceives it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen looked disapproving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s extreme?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a question that was not expected to be answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To a quizzical Alex, Heisen continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only special armaments are useful in battle. The role of magic tools is to make people&#8217;s daily lives more convenient&#8230;.society today is too caught up in such common sense. In fact, some special armaments may be useless in battle&#8230;..This taxonomy is wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. what do you want to say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, you see, as a grimoire scholar, I want to show the hidden potential of grimoires.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen holds up three fingers and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blessings, special armaments and magic&#8230;..are the three most commonly used in battle. But they are all difficult to obtain or learn. That&#8217;s where grimoires come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen held up his fourth finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it is important to enrich people&#8217;s lives. But magical tools can also be useful in battle, if you are clever enough. As proof of this,&#8230;&#8230;this time we will fight with the most commonly used magical tools.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Heisen pulls out a palm-sized cube from inside his white coat and throws it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cube fell in front of Alex in a parabolic path &#8211; a moment later it emitted an intense luminescence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For example, the magic tool used for indoor lighting, the firefly light crystal can also be used to dazzle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guh──hh!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex closed his eyes and retreated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Heisen took advantage of the opportunity and closed the gap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing Heisen took out was a black stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the tip of the stick was pressed against Alex&#8217;s neck, a sizzling sound of burning flesh could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Burn…!?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An easy-to-ignite magical tool, this stick can be used as a weapon in close combat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A roar of cheers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience was beginning to enjoy Heisen&#8217;s unpredictable attacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W–wait a minute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex says, bemused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve used fluorescent crystals and ignition sticks before, but not with that kind of power&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed, some customisation is necessary. But anyone with the knowledge and the tools can do it&#8230;.. Of course, even adventurers can do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex clicked his tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fluorescent crystals and ignition sticks are useful tools during adventuring. They are used for lighting when exploring caves with no light source, while fire sticks are often used for lighting fires when cooking outdoors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rygan, I&#8217;ll hold Heisen back, you attack those around him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been doing it for a while now!　I&#8217;m trying, but I can&#8217;t get close enough! What the hell is this swamp?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex&#8217;s companions have lost their balance after getting their feet caught in the muddy slush.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they tried to approach, the next moment the ground under their feet would turn to mud. Alex&#8217;s party was confused by a situation they had never experienced before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a combination of a magical tool that tills the soil and a magical tool that produces water. Hard to move, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Heisen&#8217;s right hand was a small hoe-like object and in his left hand was a funnel-like object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are everyday items that do not look like weapons by any stretch of the imagination. However, this made it impossible for Alec and his men to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The excitement of the crowd exacerbated Rygan&#8217;s frustration.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Interesting fight they&#8217;ve got going on here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself as I watched the parties fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spectator door opens and Rushia appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia, can you be here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu. I thought I&#8217;d come over and have a chat with Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there&#8217;s no problem, it&#8217;ll still be some time before the battle in B Block is over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together with Ruhsia and May, I watched the candidates fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How&#8217;s it going? Any notable candidates in Block B?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Rushia&#8217;s question, I think for a moment before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So far, Heisen is interesting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm&#8230;&#8230;they certainly have an eye-catching fighting style.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen, the grimoire scholar, was now fighting the red-haired Alex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone would have thought that Alex would win hands down. However, when the lid was opened, a completely different scene unfolded. An interesting development for the spectators, but for Alec and the others themselves, it must have been painful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s certainly interesting, but&#8230;..how&#8217;s that a fighting style for a hero? Seems pretty novel to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with it. He&#8217;d probably make a good hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to May&#8217;s question, I express my own opinion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Heisen becomes a hero, the world will surely change its perception of magical equipment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armaments are difficult to manufacture and require long months of work by first-class craftsmen. Furthermore, extraordinary skills are required to master them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why only a few of the strongest adventurers used special armaments, and newcomers used ordinary weapons without exception. I used to fight monsters with a sword I bought at a local shop, when I was a pure and inexperienced young man who wanted to be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The advantage of magical tools is that they can be used by anyone. If Heisen could develop a magical tool that could also be used in battle, it would be a great help to new adventurers. The casualty rate would certainly decrease.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..I also like to discuss new ways of using the communication stone.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only with regard to the magical tool called a communication stone, I am confident that I use it far more than the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why I have been thinking about new ways to use the communication stone for some time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘With Heisen&#8217;s help&#8230;&#8230;it could be achieved.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next time I find some free time, I should make an appointment with the Court Magic Institute. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can only offer a trivial idea. It will take some trial runs, and it will take a long time before this idea can be realised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t think&#8230;..grimoire would be as useful in a fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia says dejectedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I had more knowledge of magical tools, I might have had a better chance to fight the&#8230;..poisonous demon dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the past&#8230;&#8230;I, too, never thought I could fight so well with magical tools.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May mutters protectively and defensively to Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she probably meant it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if grimoires are that useful, they should be more famous&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May said curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Magic tools and the magic scholar Heisen will become famous names at this year&#8217;s tournament. Conversely, it is a wonder that they have not been famous before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I &#8230;sort of guessed the reason for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; adventurers have their pride, too.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex clicks his tongue as he is dazzled by a flash of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex and his team are still unable to attack Heisen, who makes use of a variety of magical tools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I initially wanted to promote these as weapons. However, this was not possible because of the common sense I have just told you about. When I visited&#8230;&#8230; Adventurers Guild and approached them about a partnership, they laughed in my face. 『You want us to fight with commodities?』&#8230;When you say that much, our pride is ignited. I wanted to tell them about the possibilities of magic tools, no matter what.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the Festival of Valour, candidates are allowed to freely prepare weapons. Therefore, they are free to bring in their own magic tools, and there is no problem with modifying them in their own way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I did not expect these magical tools to be used in combat in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is no surprise that modifications are necessary. It would be a threat if the magical tool, as everyday items, had such output from the start. It should never have been possible to compete with Alex, who is renowned as a veteran adventurer, just by using magic tools that can be bought in a shop around the corner. It is too dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Alex wondered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it okay to gain this much power with only a few modifications?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; are you complaining that your grimoire isn&#8217;t being used in battle?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, the idea &#8211; it would only bring chaos.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Alex, who is not a very smart man, could easily imagine that future. If magic tools, which are everyday items, have hidden uses in battle&#8230;.there would be countless weapons scattered around this country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you saying that magical tools should be used as &#8230;..weapons?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A country where men and women, young and old, have access to weapons. Is that what Heisen  wants?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Alec&#8217;s question, Heisen shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t! I just wish they would  be used during battle!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex stops moving at the sight of Heisen, who seems to be shouting in his soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;.adventurers in particular should realise. The magnificence of the magical tools.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alex heard those words, the irritation vanished from his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He feels something like a special kind of obsession from Heisen and his party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll tell you one thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen says with a mysterious look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Many of the magical tools scholars have lost their families and homelands to people and monsters. We develop magical tools based on their regret&#8230;&#8230;all to build a safer future than the one we have now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen&#8217;s words reached Alex’s heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, he realised the nature of the strange power they exuded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So &#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s what you mean &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex gave a small chuckle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen and his party want adventurers to fight more safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that reason, they are shouting to them to rely more on them and make use of the magical tools they have created.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Your resolve has been conveyed to us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, Alex had thought until a few minutes ago that Heisen and his friends were only participating in the Festival of Valour for their own personal gain, to show off their magical tools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he was wrong. They had strong and righteous convictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In exchange, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With sincerity, Alex says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are not the only ones with regrets.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex draws his sword from its scabbard and stares at Heisen and the others with a calm expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Red-haired Alex was born and raised in the small village of Yotsumi. Although it was far from the city and often inconvenient, it was a long, quiet village, separated from the busyness of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, however, Yotsumi village is nowhere to be found on the map.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because it was destroyed by a giant monster when Alex was six years old.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the day the monster appeared, Alex happened to be visiting the local adventurers guild. At the time, he was not yet that interested in adventurers. Alex was simply taking requests at the guild with the feeling that he was learning something outside the village, almost as a pastime, so to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after that request, Alex &#8211; abruptly &#8211; lost his home to return to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at this moment that Alex seriously decided to become an adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are monsters in the world who destroy human life without a second thought. Alex did not want to accept this reality. That is why he wanted to become an adventurer who could fight that reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After losing his friends and family, Alex spent nearly ten years in the Adventurers Guild. He was soon recognised for his skills and became known as Alex the Red-Haired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Sword of Transfiguration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex&#8217;s sword made a strange curling sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the special armoury 《Sword of Transfiguration》 is a change in shape. It can expand and contract freely, its weight can be increased or decreased at will, and the width of the blade can be adjusted at will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to Riese&#8217;s 《Spear of the Great Radiant》 and Seren&#8217;s 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》, it may seem unspectacular. But Alex is very fond of this weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The special armament 《Sword of Transfiguration》 is extremely versatile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Alex, who fights neither with prowess nor intelligence, but with his movements and ingenuity, it was a weapon that was a perfect match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se──Ah&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muh!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex swung his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was still a distance between them. Therefore, Heisen thought that the sword would never reach him  but a moment later, the《Sword of Transfiguration》 extended its blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade strikes Heisen at his side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a loud bang, Heisen was blown away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His companion rushed towards Heisen in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chief!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s ok. I’m good. Thank goodness we have an exoskeleton for civil engineering work inside&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen gets up with a grunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, Alex&#8217;s fellow bowman fires an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyoo!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyaa..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrows, with rounded arrowheads and burrs to reduce the killing power, hit Heisen&#8217;s party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Heisen&#8217;s bewildered party, Alex calmly considers his next move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, he regretted his past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex has a long career as an adventurer. That is why he had many opportunities to be confronted with the cold reality. He can&#8217;t be a Yuusha. He cannot be an Eiyuu. His existence had not grown since 4, and even after becoming a Class A adventurer, he was still frightened by the rise of the younger generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: I wanted to put both a hero and champion but..decided not to)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his ambition waning, Alex found himself losing even his passion for being an adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But &#8211; now he remembers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He became an adventurer to protect someone from the unreasonableness of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He still has a long way to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rygan! Get in!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooou!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex&#8217;s sword changes into a flat shape, like a large steel plate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan puts both of his feet on the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Alex swung his sword as hard as he could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He sent a human flying&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen is astonished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is a rotten being, but he is still an Existence Power 4. His physical capabilities are already beyond the reach of ordinary people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With this one&#8230; it&#8217;s over!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flying Rygan swung down a large axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ground rolled up with a roaring noise. The impact alone blasted Heisen&#8217;s party to pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu,oooo….!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen felt so much pain that he could not get up. The pain that he would never have experienced if he had just bitten down on his desk. Heisen has not developed the mental strength to overcome it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex&#8217;s sword is placed on Heisen&#8217;s neck, which is coated in a dusty, sandy dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Thanks to you, I remember my original intention.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex, with a clean expression on his face, left Heisen speechless for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Heisen gives a small smile and  surrenders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Heisen party, you&#8217;re eliminated here!　Wowーthat was a good match』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voices of the spectators echoed in the heavens in response to the actual situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Umm, Eeee…?　What&#8217;s the matter, commentator Ritter? You&#8217;re in tears. &#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t expect my colleague to get into such a heated fight&#8230;..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ritter was so moved that he was in tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation on the field did not reach the audience. But Ritter, the commentator, seemed to feel something from Heisen&#8217;s fighting spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from such excitement in the audience, Alex&#8230; looked at Heisen somewhat absent-mindedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex, what&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex mutters, unable to grasp the feeling in his chest himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t know&#8230;magic tools could be used like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen&#8217;s fighting style was ruminating over and over in Alex&#8217;s brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of gears meshing together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex, who admits to himself that he is a good fighter, felt at this moment&#8230;&#8230;that he could see a new way of fighting that he should learn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to interrupt your train of thought, but we&#8217;re still in the middle of a fight. Concentrate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding at Rygan&#8217;s words, Alex looks around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glock, leader of the Knights of Vanhardt, had just annihilated two parties that had surrounded him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were somewhat fatigued, but there was not a single scratch on their armour&#8230;.Alex decides to avoid fighting Glock’s party as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex looked at the other players.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment &#8211; he was immensely surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Ehh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silently and without a sound &#8211; two parties fell over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing in the centre of it was a girl with bluish black hair.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hey, what happened &#8230;&#8230;?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No, this is &#8230;&#8230; I didn&#8217;t get a good look at it, either. &#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bemused voices of the live commentary can be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither the audience nor the candidates had any idea what had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu&#8230;&#8230;I still, can&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One man, who had fallen, whipped his shaking body and stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a girl with too-long hair was standing beside him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ex, –excuse me, I will&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a timid attitude, Alice apologises to the man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Alice is standing behind the man before he knows it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the man&#8230;..slowly collapses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aa, Alice, is like she&#8217;s not even there! I can&#8217;t see when shen moved! Is his speed on par with Seren&#8217;s!!?　How in the world is this possible!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s hard to believe, but it doesn&#8217;t look like she&#8217;s using special armaments. That means it&#8217;s just plain physical ability&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s hard to believe that she&#8217;s Existence Power 5.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The breathtaking view of the live commentary and the commentators was contagious to the spectators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The field went silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; mu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Kirch let out a small voice and raised his axe behind Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flying throwing knife hits the axe and a metallic sound echoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The party member who threw the knife at Alice&#8217;s back was a member of the Green Shadow Husen party. The man in the green cloak clicks his tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, th,thank you, Kirch–san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind it&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch says, lifting his axe lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll keep them in check.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia readied her bow and arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Purple smoke covered her left eye. However, Phylicia fired the arrow without moving at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow was released, cut by the wind, and approached Alex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuku &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex, fatigued from the fight earlier, dodged the arrow with a dull reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, he won&#8217;t be able to attack so easily as long as someone is watching him. Phylicia glanced at Alex, ready for the second shot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should probably do some work, too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Exzair  touched the black bracelet around his right wrist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“─ ─ 《Void Sky》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black bracelet creates a jet-black mist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair stepped into that mist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Exzair appears &#8211; behind Glock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! ──Guaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair took a dagger from his pocket and thrust it into Glock&#8217;s waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dagger slips through a gap in the armour and pierces deeply into Glock&#8217;s side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glock&#8217;s companions quickly surrounded Exzair. However, Exzair entered the black mist again, and the next moment he appeared beside Alice and her friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black mist disappeared as soon as the Exzair  exited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『This is another attack where I&#8217;m not sure what happened&#8230;&#8230;!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It looked as if Exzair suddenly appeared from somewhere else&#8230;.Perhaps this one, unlike Alice, uses a special armament.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he listens to the commentary, Exzair lets out a small exhale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This should make it harder for that knight to move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Exzair–san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;thanks for your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phyliciaa and Kirch thanked him honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alice, beside them, bowed her head with her gaze lowered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, thank you very much&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, grasping the hem of her skirt tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To some listeners, it sounded as if she was frightened of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve entered a&#8230;.. Stalemate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the candidates around her, Phylicia mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Alice had been too conspicuous earlier, the other parties became wary and stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair whispers in a small voice that only Alice can hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice shook her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take down at least three parties &#8230;&#8230;, preferably four or more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With seven parties remaining, the match would end with just two more parties to defeat. However, it seems that Exzair is not satisfied with just that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ex, Exzair–san&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s what Seren Duvalis did too. There is no need to hold back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was at a loss for a reply when Exzair ruthlessly told her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzaire&#8217;s face turns grim when he sees Alice, who is not prepared to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice. I don&#8217;t think so, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair glared at Alice, revealing his irritation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[──You haven&#8217;t forgotten, have you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blood drains from Alice&#8217;s face at the implied words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch are oblivious to their exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,&#8211;I’ll do..it&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Alice nodding with a face that looked as if she was about to cry, Exzair lifted the corners of his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia, Kirch. Step back&#8230;. Alice seems to be making a big move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice put her hand on the hilt of the sword in its scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword is slowly drawn from its pure white scabbard. The white blade, exposed to the open air, seemed to light up with a delicate glow, just like the first snow reflecting the sunlight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Snow Origin》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snowflakes engraved on the blade emit a white light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The released slash drew a large arc and struck the players on the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sound. Because it was so swift and so monotonous, the blow that Alice unleashed was not flashy at all. However -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candidates on the field fell — gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The match is over&#8230;..and the survivors are the four parties.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice defeated three parties as instructed.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd was thrilled when the B Block finished its match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the A Block was settled, the audience was in a frenzy. It should have been the same place and the same audience, but the difference was like that of a foreign land.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Knights of Vanhardt have fallen&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their leader, Glock, was deeply wounded by the surprise attack from Exzair and his party was completely destroyed by the final blow of Alice.</span></p>

<p>Four parties survived. These included Alex&#8217;s party, Husen&#8217;s party and Alice&#8217;s party.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the high-profile parties remained, but again more parties dropped out than planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was a brilliant fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in the officials-only spectator area when a voice called out to me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman in pure white armour stands next to me.</span></p>
<p>“Are you alone now?”</p><p>“Yes. Rushia and May were here earlier, but they have work to do after this, so they went to their posts."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, the closing ceremony of the Festival of Valour will begin. It was their task to prepare it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese &#8230;..what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; you mean Alice Feldrant?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is definitely the first person needed to be mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In a nutshell, she is Existence Power 5 but she is as close to existence 6&#8230;&#8230;Probably just one or two more fights with stronger monsters and she&#8217;ll be at Existence Power 6 in no time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words,she may be equal to Riese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unparalleled strength. So a new question arises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why didn&#8217;t she increase her Existence Power?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know that either, but if I were to &#8230;&#8230; guess, isn&#8217;t she usually the quiet type?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To this question, I answer, remembering Alice&#8217;s appearance before the match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; she&#8217;s usually a bit more than quiet, she&#8217;s the type that&#8217;s quite timid.”</span></p>le="font-weight: 400">Riese seemed to get the point, and said, [I see].</span></p>
<p>“They are extremely rare. Those who don&#8217;t seek out a fight, but end up with overwhelming strength.”</span></p>

<p>Riese touches the window pane in front of her and looks at Alice in the field as she speaks.</span></p>

<p>“Normally, many adventurers, myself included, are drawn to battle. I get an inexplicable rush when I&#8217;m in the middle of crossing swords with a powerful foe. I&#8217;m sure that this Alice girl doesn&#8217;t have that. So she has no will to increase her power of existence. I should say that she has no desire for&#8230;.strength. Because of that indifference, she doesn&#8217;t even seem to realise how strong she is compared to those around her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree with Riese. When I think about it, Alice seems unaware of her own strength. Perhaps that&#8217;s why she has a timid attitude on a daily basis. Her strength is on par with Seren&#8217;s, but her character is more humble than that of a new adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That special armoury is pretty good too. It&#8217;s comparable to Seren&#8217;s 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》. It may have been too brief a moment to see it right, but her&#8230;&#8230; slash looked like it had slipped past their guard&#8230;..interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese had a faintly aggressive expression on her face as she told me this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a high-ranking adventurer, she felt something in Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.. envious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a feeling I, an ordinary genius with existence power 1, doesn&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She really did stand out in this match, but the other members of her party seem to have a lot of personality. The green-haired girl and the big-bodied guy&#8230;.those two are still hiding their powers, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Yes. They both should have had special armaments, but they won without using them.”</span></p>
<p>I nod and answer Riese&#8217;s question.</span></p>
le="font-weight: 400">While watching the battle in Block B, I was looking up information on Phylicia and Kirch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia Murray. ──── She is a bowman trained in Tengen-Ryu archery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tengen-Ryu archery is regarded as the most battle-ready archery in the Kingdom of Enuvidia, with high killing power against both humans and monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The essence of its archery is precision shooting. Its silent, silent aim at the vital point of its prey is feared by some and there is in fact a well-known user of Tengen-Ryu archery in the underworld.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia is a master of Tengen-Ryu archery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that those who have mastered Tengen-Ryu archery can shoot through their target in the blink of an eye, as long as the opponent is in their field of vision. When it comes to a human, it seems that they can pierce not only the head and torso, but even the fingernail of the little finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the match began, Kirch said that Phylicia had been called a great archer before she was cursed, and that was true without any exaggeration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..It&#8217;s regrettable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only she had not been cursed with the purple smoke, Phylicia would have had the reputation she wanted as a bowman. She was such a master of her craft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She now acts as a healer and carries special armaments for this purpose. But in this match, none of her comrades were hurt, so she did not have to take part in it.</span></p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;Phylicia is not the only one with an unorthodox background.</span></p><<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch Eisen. ──── He’s the best warrior of the Demon Tribe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Demons have been fighting demons for generations, so they are naturally skilled in combat. Kirch was born with an extremely robust body, and there is a record of him withstanding a wyvern attack in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch told me that when he was hired by the Glazray Mercenaries, he was surrounded by monsters and saved by Alice&#8230;&#8230;.If you ask him, the monster was a fearsome opponent, a little less than a poisonous demon dragon. If you fight such a monster, you will probably be beaten back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If we’re talking about the balance of the members, Alice&#8217;s party is by far the best.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A master archer who has lost her power and a survivor of the Demon Tribe. The party is unusually well-balanced, since it is the shy Alice who leads them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the one remaining&#8230;.also has unusual powers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That guy, Exzair, was it?&#8230;..That man&#8217;s special armament is quite vicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese is right. That thing is&#8230;.more heinous than strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ability to move through space at will. The black mist from the bracelet seemed to act as a gateway between the two spaces. Special armaments that interfere in&#8230;.space are quite rare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think, while stating my own reasoning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That special armament called 《Void Sky》, depending on how it is used, will be able to do all kinds of evil. If it can move freely through space, it can wade through any security and get out of any encirclement. It can also be used in battle, but it is a special weapon that is more suited to dark deeds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..How can any of you guys manage to use such a complicated thing as special armaments?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with this, I have more than once wanted to master special armaments. But I am ashamed to say that there was almost no special armament that I could master.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rises replied to me with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re talking about special armaments, don&#8217;t you also use it sometimes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. that&#8217;s more like a party item than an armament.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re probably the only person ever who could be that effective with that party item special armament.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says with a laugh.</span></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can call that one an effective role&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Phylicia and Kirch, who were in the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up information on them, I considered whether I could solve their problems while I was at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was extremely difficult to find a way to break the purple smoke curse on Phylicia, and Kirch had no clue about the sister he was looking for. At least, it doesn&#8217;t look like it can be solved right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, it looks like it&#8217;s about to start.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says, looking at the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia Enuvidia, the princess of this kingdom, appeared in front of the candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;.. it&#8217;s time to announce the final examinations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the  Festival of Valour over, the Hero Party Selection Examination is now at the final examination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, unlike the first round of interviews and the second round of the Festival of Valour, only the content of the final examinations had not yet been told to the candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is what she is going to announce now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ladies and Gentlemen!　I thank you all for the great fight you put up this time!　Unexpectedly, only seven parties made it through, but I think everyone could see that this was a serious fight! There will be no losers. It is these seven parties who will win!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said, looking at the seven parties gathered on the field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud cheer rang out. It seems that some are still shouting even though their throats are sore. It&#8217;s a great honour for the audience to be so excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Now I&#8217;m going to tell you what the final exam will be!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oooouuu] said the audience in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It shouldn&#8217;t have been brewed with cherry blossoms, but people in this country are very excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『But first, &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m going to tell you a little bit of an old story』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Rushia announced this, the audience and candidates had curious looks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We, the management, know what is going to be told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not a futile story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we don&#8217;t tell this story, we can&#8217;t talk about the final exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『There was once a dragon in this kingdom called the Abandoned Dragon.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia began to speak in a serious voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Abandoned Dragon had the power to corrode anything that came near it and turn it into dust&#8230;..Our kingdom made a mutual aid agreement with the dragon and entrusted it with the disposal of our waste for approximately 200 years. In return, our kingdom gave them a huge forest in the north as a nest for their waste.』”</span></p>
le="font-weight: 400">The older citizens of the audience in the auditorium nodded their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『But fifty years ago. The Abandoned Dragon has lived out its natural life.』”</span></p>
<p>Dragons are living beings. Its life span must have an end.</span></p>

<p>And the problem is &#8211; this is where it starts.</span></p>

<p>『Even in death, the dragon did not lose its power. Rather, the power that had been suppressed by its intellect was released upon its death, and the forest quickly became corroded. The disposal of the corpses was a difficult task, as they would have been turned to dust if they had been approached carelessly. While they were left to their own devices, monsters strong enough to withstand the force of the corrosion ate the carcasses of the dead dragons and mutated into more vicious individuals. The lair of the&#8230;&#8230;abandoned dragon has turned into a magical world of mutated monsters.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia announced with a serious expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><spanstylet: 400">“『Forty years ago. In order to clean up the monsters living and breathing in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair, one of our country&#8217;s most skilled adventurers raided the lair. The adventurer was lent a special weapon, a national treasure of our country. The power of that weapon is to borrow the power of a dragon with whom we have formed a friendship. For our country, which is closely associated with&#8230;&#8230;dragons, this is truly an extraordinary power.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel the audience gasp in shock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A foreigner who does not know much about dragons may not understand the effects of that special armament. But I understood it well. That special armament, as long as you befriend a dragon, you can obtain the power of a poison demon dragon or a dragonised Rushia. And not just one. If you form a fellowship with more than one dragon, you can obtain the power of more t
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia is right, it is truly unparalleled power. However──.</span></p>

<p>“『But the adventurer failed. He was defeated by the mutated monster I mentioned earlier.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience was abuzz with noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The adventurer died and the national treasure was left in the lair of an abandoned dragon. There have been numerous attempts to recapture it, but all have failed due to the interference of the monsters. As we were wondering what to do, the threat of a poisonous demon dragon appeared. Since then, our country has been forced to deal with the poisonous dragon, and our attempts to recover the national treasure have remained suspended.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said all that, Rushia looked at the candidate on the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You now know what you must do, right?. ──That&#8217;s the final test.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air in the arena tensed at Rushia&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After quietly catching her breath, Rushia announced once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The content of the final test is to raid the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair and bring back our national treasure, the 《Dragon Crown Sword》 within three days!　If you succeed, I will appoint your party as our heroic party and promise to give you the national treasure, the 《Dragon Crown Sword》!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only the spectators, but also the candidates were in an uproar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now the candidates must surely be confused by two facts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is the good news that if they are chosen to be part of the heroic party, they will be given the national treasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the bad news is that they will have to take on the dangerous task of retrieving the national treasure, which no one has been able to accomplish for&#8230;..forty years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Of course, I know how dangerous that is!　But what our country is looking for is a party of heroes! Not good warriors, not clever scholars!We want heroes who can represent this country&#8230;..or even humanity!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Rushia&#8217;s words, I gave a small smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new hero──that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m always looking forward to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia was one of the new heroes when she defeated the Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, she will be looking for a new hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If you are a hero&#8230; show me your greatness!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia shouted with fury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Pass this test and become a new hero!』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Burr</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the skin shivers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fighting spirit is in the eyes of the candidate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Please, the audience, give them a push!　Someone here will become a hero! You are the ones who will travel around the world with our expectations on your shoulders!!』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a cheer so loud that the air shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My skin has become tense and my hair is standing up. I was aware of it when I saw this&#8230;&#8230;scene. The selection test for the Hero Party is a new history itself for the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do not allow them to fail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The second test &#8211; the Festival of Valour &#8211; is now closed! Let&#8217;s have a big round of applause, everyone!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candidates were greeted with thunderous applause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even through the glass I can feel the enthusiasm of the spectators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The final exam is in three days?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, next to me, mutters in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One more job before then, I suppose.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry&#8230;..I&#8217;ll be relying on you again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.  You can rely on me more and more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It makes me feel better to hear her say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? In your estimation, when am I supposed to help you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably tonight.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A whole day had passed since the Festival of Valour ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Four men and a woman were walking in the quiet midnight of the royal castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kingdom of Enuvidia has a big kind heart, too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an empty corridor, the man leading the way said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though we’re a candidate for the Hero Party, I never thought we&#8217;d be renting inside the Royal Castle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? The food also was the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted in my life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Candidates who passed the second round of examinations, the Festival of Valour, were allowed to stay at the Royal Castle until the final examinations. Of course, it’s also possible to use other accommodation, but all of the candidates chose to sleep in the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;hey, are you sure you want to do this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smallest man, who was walking farthest back, stops and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re through to the final examinations.　Can we really afford to throw away that chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; you already promised not to tell me that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slender girl, who has been silent ever since she left the room, says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After listening to their brief conversation, the man in the lead spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t intend to squander this opportunity. If we do well, no one will find out, and if I can reduce the number of favourites here, it will give me an advantage in the final exam.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; are you serious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other three frowned at the small man&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re out of your mind to surprise a sleeping opponent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words echoed in the quiet corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s serious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way I can be part of a hero party by doing such a cowardly thing. But &#8230;..we have no choice. Right now, we have more important things to do than becoming a hero party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man was clearly angry, but the brunt of his anger was directed at himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The men then continued to walk down the corridor in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s that room&#8230;..There, over there, is Seren Duvalis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as they found the room they wanted, the men felt nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no turning back now. The miserable feeling turns to determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. ready your weapons. Move with caution.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man instructs his companions while holding the spear on his back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as he is about to take his first step, he notices someone standing in front of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rigil&#8217;s party, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A young man with dark hair emerges from the silent darkness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When his name was called, the man called Rigil stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil recognised the young man. He had sat next to Rushia Enuvidia as an interviewer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you here&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have three days until the final exam. We are also expecting an unauthorized battle. The reason why we made our move right after the&#8230;..valour festival was because we thought that our opponents would still be tired now, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil&#8217;s eyes widened at the words of the young man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He hit the nail on the head. He realised that they were about to challenge someone to battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s quite bold of you to choose Seren as your unauthorized opponent. I thought you guys were a more solid party&#8230;..Did someone threaten you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment he heard Ned&#8217;s question, sweat broke out all over Rigil&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rigil, what are we going to do&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil&#8217;s teeth chattered as his companion let out an anxious sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;we have no choice but to defeat this man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, we&#8217;ll stand out if we fight here&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. From the looks of it, this man isn&#8217;t very strong&#8230;..and we can take him down in no time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, their true identity is already known.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only way to be sure is to defeat Ned here and now. Thinking this, Rigil instantly points his spear at Ned──but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Rigil was knocked to the floor by an impact that came down from above him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kah&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, Ned isn&#8217;t strong, but that doesn&#8217;t mean his alone”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A third party intervened, who had not been present earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil looked up with a grunt and saw pure white armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese Von Aldiana&#8230;&#8230;!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most famous adventurer party in the kingdom. Its leader is right in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese had a relaxed expression on her face even in front of the four armed men. She did not appear to be wary of them. She just stands there with an air of dignity that is frightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rigil!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuu, so──!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil’s companion surrounds Riese and attacks her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese&#8217;s image disappears for a moment. Immediately afterwards, Rigil&#8217;s companions fall to their knees. Riese&#8217;s movements were not even visible. The difference between him and Rigil was overwhelming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese then stands in front of Ned as a matter of course, showing her willingness to protect him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she did it was like a knight protecting her lord at the risk of her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What on earth&#8230;.is the relationship between you two?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost subconsciously, Rigil uttered such a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese  pretends to think for a moment before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;. like an older sister and brother, I suppose.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned put his hand on his forehead.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes passed when Riese incapacitated four men and women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blue-haired woman approaches from across the corridor at a short run.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, a Kingsguard knight, sees Rigil and the others sitting on the floor, wiping sweat on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I’m late.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. We&#8217;ve just finished over here”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is busy supervising the exams. That&#8217;s why I hired the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 for security.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I have shared some information with her. I&#8217;ve already informed them that I expect an unauthorised fight to take place this evening, and that if it does become a reality, I&#8217;ll be working with Riese to deal with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;..they really showed up. I thought we&#8217;d largely eliminated the suspicious parties in the run up to the second test&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. So I guess it wasn&#8217;t really suspicious until this very moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]　The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re going to tell us what happened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him this, Rigil spoke reluctantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story spun out in a trembling voice was pretty much what I would expect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I see. So you were asked to do this just after the Festival of Valour was over.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing the whole story, I nodded, crossing my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The request is to keep Seren Duvalis out of the final test. As a reward, you will get a certain medicine. That&#8217;s the kind of deal you agreed to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil nodded his head awkwardly at the confirmation question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; my sister has been bedridden with an illness since she was a child. In order to cure her, she needs a special medicine. She told me that if I complete&#8230;..her request, she will give me that medicine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil continued to speak haltingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The truth is, we were determined to become a Hero party and travel around the world to find the medicine. Even if we don&#8217;t find it, we&#8217;ll have a lot of gold when we become a heroic party and we can buy the medicine with it. But &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..You still don&#8217;t know if you and your party can become a hero party. That&#8217;s why you agreed to the deal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil nodded, biting his lip hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Rigil could not believe that they could become a hero party. Dazzled by the opportunities that suddenly fell upon them, they thought it would be more certain if they reached for it, right here and now. He believed in his immediate good fortune rather than his own abilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He must have consulted with his friends. Rigil&#8217;s friends say nothing. They all express regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who was the client?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“..‥That, I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my suspicion, Rigil continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got the job through a mediating agency in Ghirtia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ギルティア</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Rigil said that, everyone fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought I would hear the name of that organisation at this time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ghirtia of the Dark Guild?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May muttered with a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Guild Ghirtia. It is a criminal organisation that mainly mediates dirty jobs that cannot be mentioned in the surface society. Due to its size, a few people in the surface society know of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ghirtia&#8217;s activities are mainly mediating requests, and Ghirtia itself does not often get involved in dirty work. Because of this nature, countries and kingdoms struggled to crack down on them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because of the medicine’s rarity&#8230;.we have extended our antennae to the black guilds. That&#8217;s why we were able to accept this request. But we were only mediated, so we don&#8217;t know anything about &#8230;&#8230; the client.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil said with a guilty look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I guess from the fact that he named the target as Seren, the client&#8217;s purpose is probably to weaken the heroes&#8217; party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give out my reasoning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The strength of a hero party is also the strength of its kingdom. Therefore, from the point of view of other kingdoms, it is better for the heroes of the Kingdom of Enuvidia to be as weak as possible. It&#8217;s because it gives them an advantage in competition between hero parties and in political negotiations. The reason why &#8230;&#8230; Seren was named because it was judged that Seren would be a nuisance if she became a Hero. Existence Force 5 is not a joke.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does&#8230;&#8230;mean that the client is someone involved in the politics of another country?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Probably so.] I nod in agreement with May&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which kingdoms would be concerned about Seren becoming a hero? If I look into those conditions, I can think of several possible culprits, but if I fight back in this direction, I will only be able to cut the lizard&#8217;s tail off. I can&#8217;t spend that much effort on a severed tail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s easy to predict why they made the request at this time&#8230;&#8230;maybe the request was originally supposed to be done by another party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explain to the surprised Rigil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After the first test, Riese and I caught several parties. One of them was supposed to carry out this request. But since they got caught and failed, your party, who still survived the exam, was approached.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil&#8217;s eyes widened and he stiffened, as if the idea had never occurred to him. Perhaps he felt frustrated that they had been used as replaceable terminally wounded soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm. That would take the complexity of this case up a notch, wouldn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says, holding her finger to her chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah,] I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They really want to make the heroic party of the Kingdom of Enuvidia as weak as possible&#8230;&#8230;because those requests have already been made. No matter how many lowly handlers we catch, as long as the request doesn&#8217;t disappear, it will be repeated again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We prevented this from happening only because it has been repeatedly occurring. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Rigil and his party, Riese and I prevented it from happening by catching them after the first test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the second time that they have now been stopped from committing a crime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, just wait here for a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then took a communication stone out of my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found the address I was looking for and immediately made contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May looked at me curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you communicating with?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ghirtia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May was surprised to hear after the words were spoken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other party is a busy man in his own right. There is a good chance that they are not answering the call, but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it connects.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s lucky that he picked up right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it&#8217;s been a while. Can I talk to you for a minute? I need to speak to you urgently.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『When you say it&#8217;s urgent, I can&#8217;t not make time for you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An evil sounding laugh is heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person on the other end of the line was the leader of the Dark Guild Ghirtia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know that they are currently holding a hero party selection test in the Kingdom of Enuvidia, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yeah. Because I&#8217;m mediating several requests related to it.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I need you to cancel all those requests.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him simply, the Ghirtia leader was silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oi. You&#8217;re──licking our boots a bit too much, aren&#8217;t you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dusky voice emanated from the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is powerful, even though we haven&#8217;t met in person. If an unaccustomed person were to hear this, he or she would break out in a cold sweat. At any rate, the other party is the leader of Ghirtia, which is no exaggeration to say that he unites the underworld. To make an enemy of this man is to make an enemy of the underworld.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I have a certain amount of experience in the field of negotiation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s true that the guy I&#8217;m talking to right now is a hundred times stronger than me &#8211; but basically, I always talk to people who are stronger than me. There&#8217;s no need to be timid now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll get you an alternative request.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;what?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fortunately, I&#8217;m confident in the number of jobs I have. For example, I&#8217;ve been asked to help with monster slaying in the Sumeru region…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out a note from inside my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told him a list of tasks that I had scribbled down in a disorganised manner, from one end of the list to the other. I told them about jobs that they might be able to broker, from filling in for civil workers, to taking down monsters, to carrying luggage in the dungeons. All of these were projects I had been consulted on by someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the number of requests I introduced exceeded 30, the leader of Ghirtia told me to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Are you a human guild? No one can manage such  amount of work for an individual has to do.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so,&#8230;&#8230;I rely on a lot of people instead, so I guess we&#8217;re even.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this world, someone is always in trouble somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just know a lot of people, so I have a lot of opportunities to hear from those people in need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;m asking a lot of them on short notice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, with the intention of showing my sincerity that I would do all I could to provide compersion, I said──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes. The client this time is probably a nobleman from some kingdom, right? If you have trouble with them, I&#8217;ll introduce you to someone in a position they won&#8217;t be able to resist, so let me know if you need me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re still a scary guy, aren&#8217;t you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, he was scared of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why should I be [scared] by the Ghirtia leader?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Okay, I understand. I’ll withdraw all the requests.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks&#8230;&#8230;Sorry for asking you to do this, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve talked to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Don&#8217;t worry about it. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve had a chance to talk to you. After all, there aren&#8217;t many people I can talk to without freaking out.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just a matter of getting used to it. I was scared the first time I met you too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Give it a rest.. It&#8217;s me, the one who should be getting used to&#8230;.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear a giggle[Kukuku] and then the communication is disconnected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After putting the communication stone back in the pouch, I look at May and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, the request from Ghirtia has been withdrawn, so this matter is now closed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told them about the situation, May was stiff with her mouth open. Riese, on the other hand, smiles bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I&#8217;ll introduce Rigil&#8217;s party to a skilled apothecary. He&#8217;s an unusual guy who likes to mix medicines more than three meals a day. He can tell you where the ingredients are and everything else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa–thank you&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil spoke awkwardly, thanking me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, however, looked at me with an indescribable expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;.I didn&#8217;t think you would connect to Ghirtia, or&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They say the path of the snake is the snake. I know some people there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fact that may be a little hard for pure and righteous knights to accept.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;Ghirtia is that one, because it&#8217;s a necessary organisation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May tilts her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia would know what that means, wouldn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calling out across the corridor, a familiar girl&#8217;s voice answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia Enuvidia was approaching us with her beautiful silver hair hanging down. Rigil&#8217;s party hurriedly bowed their heads, and May looked a little surprised [Rushia–sama!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To those in awe, Rushia smiled and told them with her eyes to make themselves at ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are those in the world who are born unable to live by legitimate means, even if they are afraid to speak of it as a necessary evil&#8230;&#8230;.For children suffering from poverty and those who have been ostracised from the surface society for unreasonable reasons&#8230;. organisations such as Ghirtia are the last lifeline for them. They are the only means of giving them work to outlive their hunger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely, May does not know this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are mountains of people in this world who have only two choices: do the dirty work or starve to death. Ghirtia is also an organisation that gives them work and rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kingdom of Enuvidia is well governed. So it does not need such an organisation. But&#8230;&#8230; not every kingdom can be responsible for all the people that are born. It&#8217;s a pity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a very princess-like view.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu. As a princess, I have to know the difference between the sweet and the sour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Enuvidia is a safe and secure place. Even the remote villages are well monitored by their lords.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Riese seemed to be well aware that this was not always the case in other Kingdoms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevertheless&#8230;&#8230;I cannot pretend that your crude acts did not happen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia looked at Rigil and his party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry, but you are disqualified.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil no longer looked contrite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just, just resignation. I guess he was prepared for this to happen when he got the request from Ghirtia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take a piece of paper and a pen from my pouch and write a short note.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here&#8217;s where the medicine man is. I recommend you visit him as soon as possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I handed the note to Rigil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil receives the note and looks as if he is about to cry for a moment, but then he almost holds it back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. If this saves my sister, you are our benefactor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rigil looks straight at me and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This favour will be repaid one day. Thank you, thank you so much&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bowing deeply, Rigil turned on his heel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the looks of him, he will probably leave Royal Capital by the end of the night. On his back was a sense of guilt and a glimmer of hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a small exhale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve done my job. Just as I thought this, the communication stone vibrated in the pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out the stone that alerts me to an incoming call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the surface of the stone was the name of the Ghirtia leader with whom I had just communicated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『There is one thing I forgot to mention.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Guiltier leader tells me shortly as I answer the call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『There was an organisation supporting this request.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Supporting?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aa. There were organisations that supported sabotage against the Kingdom of Enuvidia, for example by blowing holes in the kingdom&#8217;s security to let agents in, or by providing other financial support &#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, there were a good number of agents that Riese and I caught after the first round of interviews.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently they had a common patron. It seems that they were collectively supporting the operatives who were targeting the Kingdom of Enuvidia in order to bring it down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such large-scale support&#8230;..cannot be provided by an ordinary organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is the name of that organisation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my question, the Ghirtia leader replies after a silent pause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s the Amdo Empire. You&#8230;&#8230;know what that means, don&#8217;t you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reply with a small [Aa], then thank him and hang up the transmission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Of all the candidates from the Amdo Empire, only one party remains until the final exam&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My bad premonition had come true.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two men and a woman were conversing on the balcony of the room where Alice&#8217;s party was staying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The grey-haired young man, Exzair, calls the girl&#8217;s name in an angry voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice shakes her shoulders in fright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you go easy on them at the &#8230;&#8230; valour festival?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t go easy on th,them&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t think you can fool my eyes. If you wanted to, you could have taken down another party&#8230;or two more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was silent as she was glared at by Exzair with his eyes flashing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That silence meant affirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..well, that&#8217;s okay. Fortunately things are proceeding as planned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair said with disdain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have just received an additional instruction order. They want us to take the 《Dragon Crown Sword》. &#8230;..Well, what we have to do is still the same. In any case, once we were chosen as the heroic party, we are going to steal any weapons and information the Kingdom of Enuvidia had.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair looked at the streets of the Royal City of the Kingdom of Enuvidia as if he were looking at rubbish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Alice, the scene was calm, serene and something she felt should not be broken. But Exzair apparently doesn&#8217;t feel that way at all. For this man, the kingdom of Enuvidia had been nothing more than a target from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with that face?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair looks into Alice&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unconsciously, Alice looked defiant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You haven&#8217;t forgotten, have you? Phylicia, Kirch, your parents, if I wanted to….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–..I, I know&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice nodded her head hurriedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair doesn&#8217;t want to hear any more of the words that follow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t care what they do to me&#8230;.please don&#8217;t touch anyone&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says in a trembling voice, on the verge of tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair stroked Alice&#8217;s head, which had her face down, as if he was playing with a toy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good girl.”</span></p>
