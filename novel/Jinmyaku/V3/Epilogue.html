<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days after investigating the castle district of the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a well-deserved rest at the inn, we were once again discussing our future plans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened to Ziggrit and his party&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says with an anxious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had invited Alice and Phylicia to the room that Kirch and I were using. We sit around a circular table and discuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not going to end too well. It won&#8217;t save the&#8230;&#8230;party from breaking up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit and his party are now going to see His Majesty the Emperor in person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are going to confess all their sins to His Majesty. From the expressions on the faces of the Ziggrit when we parted three days ago, it is clear that they will not repeat their sins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s talk about our future plans.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a quick look at everyone&#8217;s faces, I open my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We will continue to look for clues about the Demon King. But apparently, Yggdrasil&#8217;s dark activities have become conspicuous recently.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Abandoned Dragon&#8217;s Nest and the Airun Ruins. We&#8217;ve been involved with Yggdrasil members twice in a row.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We can&#8217;t overlook it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, our next destination&#8230;&#8230;can we take a little detour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to say to Alice and the others who had curiosity in their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you know about the Assembly Of Great Powers?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard of it&#8230;&#8230;. I think it was&#8230;&#8230; a meeting of only the powerful and strongest people that takes place once a year&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at Kirch&#8217;s answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That perception is generally correct. The Assembly Of Great Powers is a special event, an invitation-only meeting, where you have to be one of the strongest in the world to be allowed to participate. It takes place in two months&#8217; time and this year it will be held on the eastern continent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others nodded silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Participation in a meeting of the powers is a kind of status. For those who are obsessed with strength and power, such meetings are the object of admiration.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This meetings bring together powerful people from all over the world, so there are often important meetings going on. What I&#8217;m trying to say is&#8230;.. This is an event that lends itself to the exchange of information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, they agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think they read my intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yggdrasil was syphoning off the power of the Dark Eaters&#8230;.they might be planning something on a large scale. It would be better to exchange information with various people at once.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may lead to clues about the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand it&#8217;s by invitation only but is it gonna be okay over there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No worries. I&#8217;ve received a lot of invitations actually but so I&#8217;m going to accept invitations from the right people.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I kind of expected that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia nodded quietly and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Alice and Kirch also nodded with mixed expressions, as if in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you going to the Assembly Of Great Powers?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the door to the room opened, a girl&#8217;s voice was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I saw a girl with white hair standing at the entrance of the room. It was the girl who was kidnapped and almost sacrificed by Ziggrit and his party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;well, is your body alright now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thanks to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is very typical of Alice that her concern comes before the fact that she came into the room without permission.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days ago, when we left the ruins, we left the girl in the care of a clinic in town. I was afraid that she might be injured but from the looks of it, she seems to be fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So,Ned-sama. Are you going there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I intend to, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time that we’ve talked together and she spoke to me as if we’re close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides &#8211; when did I tell her my name?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then may I accompany you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly I was told something I didn&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then&#8230;someone I recognize crosses my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute.You, aren’t you…&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right in front of me, the girl&#8217;s body is enveloped in mist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her white hair turns peach-coloured, and the shape of her face and the colour of her skin also change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see. Ned-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl solemnly bows her head and greets me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recognised that figure.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to know the outside world. With this single-minded determination, she has mastered the magic of alter ego and disguise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sends her alter egos to countries,kingdoms and empires around the world as her curiosity takes her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Your Imperial Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Princess of Eisu smiled softly.</span></p>
