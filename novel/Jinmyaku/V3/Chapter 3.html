<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Idea of the Weak</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Foooooooooooo!! Hooooooooooooooooo!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of us must have been tense before we entered the Castle District, but as soon as we heard that strange voice, we started to loosen up quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Ned! This is amazing!　It&#8217;s a treasure trove of historical value!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This architectural style was used by the northern peoples&#8230;&#8230; Is it still the northern roots of the Kingdom of Airun? But there must have been indigenous peoples here too. There are no signs of conflict and it was abandoned for some reason&#8230;&#8230;? Then the only reason for that would be the Dark Eaters&#8230;&#8230;.Did the Dark Eaters destroy a kingdom before the Kingdom of Airun&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mumbling something and touching the floor, walls and pillars, Eri was, in a sense, a scholar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The castle district is literally where the royal castle of the Kingdom of Airun used to be. The roof has collapsed in places, allowing sunlight to shine through. However, there are many dimly lit areas. It would be better to explore carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned! Can I spend the day here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stingy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll pass through here again on our way back. For now, we&#8217;re moving on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have decided that we want to proceed swiftly as we do not want to miss Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We started our search, keeping a wary eye on our surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The footsteps of five people echoed on the stone floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;..it&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s more of a&#8230;..small town than a castle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch looks around and mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the royal castle Kingdom of Airun but it was much larger in scale than the royal castle of the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When the first king of the Kingdom of Airun decided to have the Dark Eaters reside in this castle, it seems that he expanded the construction of the castle considerably. There are two spaces here, one for human habitation and one for the spirits to dwell in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do spirits dwell in man-made environments?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, they do. Well, even if you say they dwell, the lower class spirits are just floating around. Apparently, there were many other dark spirits living in this castle besides the Dark Eaters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri politely replies to Phylicia’s question as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we continued down the long, narrow passageway, two doors were lined up on the right side.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holes in the walls allow a view inside. It is hard to tell because of the dim light and the tiles dotted with debris, but both had similar layouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, you can&#8217;t go through there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded, remembering the contents of the material given to me by Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Twelfth Order. Men must not enter women&#8217;s baths&#8230;.. looks like this was a bathhouse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the 13th order is the opposite of this,women must not enter men&#8217;s bathrooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiaa!!!”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly Alice screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, what&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bo,bo,bones &#8230;&#8230;?Bones&#8230;..!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice points to a hole in the wall with tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look closely, I can see one skeleton lying just beyond the door to the bathhouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the price to pay for peeking in?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s too heavy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled at Phylicia&#8217;s calm statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This skeletonised person probably entered the bathroom without knowing the rules I had just mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The same rules apply to all gender-segregated facilities, including toilets and changing rooms. Be careful if you see a place that looks like that.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri adds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew what I was getting into when I read the material. .There are a lot of detailed rules.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Dark Eater&#8217;s rules are kind of haphazard, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It seems that the Dark Eaters liked to make promises, no matter how trivial or detailed. The king must have been well aware of the character of the Dark Eaters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of this is a kind of pandering to the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters, born as unstable beings, therefore favoured an order that was supposed to be unchanging &#8211; in other words, a promise. The Dark Eaters probably took pleasure in keeping their promises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, you said that the Kingdom of Airun prospered by borrowing the power of the Dark Eaters instead of making promises to them&#8230;.. In what way did they borrow the power of the Dark Eaters?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, walking in the lead, turned and asked.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s about getting rid of external enemies. At the time, the Kingdom of Airun was suffering from invasions by neighbouring states. They had inferior military strength, so the Dark Eaters compensated for this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters succeeded in eliminating the external enemies, but in the end the kingdom itself was destroyed because of them&#8230;..It&#8217;s an ironic ending.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu…everyone stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stopped shortly after we heard Kirch&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A monster….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lion cub&#8217;s head, a goat&#8217;s body and a snake&#8217;s tail. A quadrupedal beast that looked like a mixture of three animals &#8211; a chimaera.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is considered to be a ferocious and dangerous monster. They often live in deep forests, but this one is said to nest in the ruins of Airun.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wish they&#8217;d gotten rid of the monsters at least.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Dark Eater doesn&#8217;t like monsters, so they wanted as little to do with them as possible. As you can see at &#8230;..they&#8217;re disorganised creatures.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri picked up a spirit bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the battle begins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three Chimaira. One of them was instantly cut down by Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to battle, she is the most reliable girl. Following Alice, who opened the battle, Kirch swung her axe to make the chimaera retreat, and Phylicia fired an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;muu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the chimaeras  enters a dark room that the sun does not reach.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kirch enters the room in alarm, the chimera slams its claws into him from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The visibility, it&#8217;s bad&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch retreated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Eri throws a spirit bottle into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The genie bottle broke and a blinding light illuminated the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve illuminated it! You can see it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;..thank you&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, seeing the chimaera, slammed his axe down forcefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost simultaneously, Alice slashes the third chimaera.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the monster doesn&#8217;t need to be concerned. The power of the monsters inhabiting the ruins of Airun is probably the same or lower than the monsters in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a magnificent door….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must be built of sturdy materials. The majestic door in front of us was almost undamaged, unlike the other doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one tries to go through this door easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there&#8217;s something there, we&#8217;ll never leave until we figure it out&#8230;&#8230;.A method for exploring the Airun site was being nurtured in us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, you didn&#8217;t find any material on this door, did you?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. But there seems to be something about it. &#8230;&#8230; Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri finds something in the lower right-hand corner of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked closely at it and saw a small stone monument there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the stone monument, strange words are inscribed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is unreadable but&#8230;&#8230;it probably describes the dark eater.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s important information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know what it says?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me five minutes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri announced shortly and moved her face closer to the stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The script originally used  by the Kingdom of Airun is not fully understood yet. In addition, because of this damage, we can only guess the content from the context&#8230;&#8230;.If my guess is correct, the roots of the Kingdom of Airun  are on the northern continent. If so, the language could also be similar to that of the north. Roish, Sharia, Mey, Old Mesorat language&#8230;&#8230;hmmm, let&#8217;s go and verify it with a small test shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ロイシュ語、シャリア語、メイ語、旧メソラト語</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri was already concentrating on deciphering the stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We watch in silence as Eri looks closely at the stone tablet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can read it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looks up and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently this door originally had a key!　And there is a rule that no one is allowed through the door unless that lock is opened by legitimate means.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door was slightly ajar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we wanted to open it, we could do so with a light push, but&#8230;&#8230;apparently the moment we open this, we&#8217;re dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily there is a path we can bypass, and it looks like we&#8217;d better go that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Eri looks at the wall on the left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the door in front of her, the wall was battered.There are several holes in places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the holes was a large space. It seems that if we go through this hole,we will be able to go onwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;how is it possible to read something so damaged&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch looks at the stone monument and expresses his admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, if I look at it as a layman, I really have no idea what is written on the stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yes. It would normally take a year to decipher it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.A year”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Eri had more advanced knowledge than they imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank goodness Eri is here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re welcome!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, if we were to set a destination for the moment, would it still be the top floor?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. I&#8217;m interested in the throne room on the top floor. The Dark Eaters seem to have frequented it, and according to the literature, it&#8217;s quite a large space, so there might be something in there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The throne room is at the far end of the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it is the most difficult space to reach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the steepest destination for those of us entering the Castle District for the first time but it&#8217;s the easiest place to plot something for Ziggrit, who knows the Castle District inside out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a tower?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stop and look at the structure in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through a hole in the wall, a tower of about five storeys could be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is large for a watchtower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the top, a passageway connects to the castle&#8230;&#8230;.If we climbed this tower, we might be able to reach the throne room in no time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hoping that Eri’s guess was correct, we headed for the tower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance door was half-built, and it was possible to see the scene beyond it without going inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Uuugg.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is &#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Terrible&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, Kirch and Phylicia frown at the scene before them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White bones and bloodstains were spread all over the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bloodstains have turned brown because of the considerable time that has passed. Most of the skeletons are also shattered but some skeletons remain, showing that they held their necks and died in agony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight is more disgusting than astonishing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably the adventurers who helped Ziggrit with his investigation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least thirty people have died here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looked around carefully and noticed a stone monument in front of the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumumu. Apparently there&#8217;s a rule about not putting your feet on the floor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite there being no stairs, it continues to the second and third floors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This tower seems to have been a laboratory for wizards. At the very least, you have to be a wizard who can fly&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone agreed to Eri’s conclusion. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just to be clear, can anyone fly?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one nodded to my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Alice raises her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um, if we can put our feet on the wall, I think we can make it to the top.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Alice&#8217;s words, Eri looked at the stone monument again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The walls are fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,then, I&#8217;m off!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice is full of motivation and jumps to the opposite wall with a light body movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice then turned her body diagonally upwards, kicked the wall and headed for the upper floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice reached the top in no time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, what do you see? Anything?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ma,maybe there is nothing!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, raising my voice a little, and Alice answered in a loud voice too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for a while, Alice came down again, as if she had finished her investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice slowly descended, running down the wall &#8211; and.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O&#8230;..aa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice lost her balance and almost fell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she continued to fall to the floor, the Dark Eater would kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment she thought that, an arrow flew towards Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow pierced Alice&#8217;s clothes and stuck into the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s fall stopped as her clothes stuck to the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, thank you, Phylicia-san &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who has regained her composure, adjusts her stance and kicks the wall back to us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Phylicia, who released the arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was a quick reaction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been ready to fire an arrow at any time since I entered these ruins&#8230;. recently I felt humiliated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly guessed what that humiliation referred to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, Phylicia was clearly disrespected by Ziggrit&#8217;s fellow bowman. The humiliation of that time seems to have given Phylicia a strong will now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there was a bookshelf at the top of the tower, so I got on it and looked around&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bookshelf? There were books?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri approached Alice with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes. But most of them looked like this and I couldn&#8217;t seem to read them&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice showed her a book that was more a pile of tattered paper than a book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contents had deteriorated so much that the ink had faded and the text was unreadable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, aaaaaaaaaa &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri kneeled on the ground, discouraged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just maybe it&#8217;s my imagination, but there were some kind of&#8230;..footprints.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says unsurely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s not likely she mistook the footprints for anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Has someone checked this place out already?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone must have entered here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on the amount of blood and white bones, it is likely that Ziggrit passed through here when he first investigated the Airun site. Ziggrit had two hundred collaborators in his survey. It seems that he had a lot of trouble here but at least he was able to reach the top floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was a door on the top floor that seemed to lead to a corridor, but&#8230;..that door was locked and not likely to be passable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;anyway, we can&#8217;t all go up to the top floor. We&#8217;ll  have to find another way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, the shortcut from the top floor of the tower to the top floor of the castle is unlikely to be available.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Alice alone could get to the top floor, we didn&#8217;t want to act separately in this danger zone. The five of us had to act as a single mass to survive in the ruins of Airun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the tower, we proceeded through the castle again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, we found a staircase. The railings had collapsed and there were many holes in the floor, so we carefully climbed up to the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The castle appears to have five floors, but this staircase stopped at the second floor. To go up to the third floor, another staircase had to be used, apparently. The structure of this castle is complex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many paths that cannot be bypassed due to the rules of the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, by taking detours, we managed to continue our search</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’me getting the gist of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we walk, I sort out the information so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are two main types of rules created by the Dark Eaters. One type requires special abilities to pass through and the other type allows anyone to pass through as long as they meet the conditions. However, not all people in the Royal Castle have special abilities, so emergency passages and the like are standardised in the latter type&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s a detour, but if we keep going that way, you should be able to reach the back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stricter the restrictions on entry, the fewer people would be available to rush in at a moment&#8217;s notice. Successive kings who have made promises to the Dark Eaters have probably adjusted this salt-and-pepper balance well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobles&#8217; and royalty&#8217;s rooms are often provided with back roads so that knights and servants can rush to them in case of emergency. On the other hand, the laboratories of wizards are less important than the living quarters of royalty, so they have no back roads and are absolutely inaccessible unless that person has special skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Proceed with caution. It&#8217;s just right that we spend more time thinking than moving forward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My companions nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The search for ruins continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the &#8230;&#8230; servants&#8217; quarters, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri said at the end of the path created by the cracked wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I was in a large room but on closer inspection I could see that it was just a series of small rooms connected by collapsed walls. In the corner of the room, there were pieces of wood scattered about that appeared to be the framework of a bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good timing. Let&#8217;s rest here today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is already dark outside. Everyone is tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were few monsters in the area, and there seemed to be few rules by the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are few places to be at ease in the castle district, so we will never know when and where we can rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is a place to rest, we should stop at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I found some scraps of curtains, so I&#8217;ll make a simple sleeping area for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia picks up a piece of cloth scattered on the floor and dusts it off with a light tap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the team prepared food and kept a vigil around the area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out some dried meat from my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, Eri lightly shakes a spirit bottle. A warm light illuminates in the jar. She placed the bottle on the floor to provide a warming light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you were going to say, 『I&#8217;m off to do some personal research!』but you&#8217;ve been surprisingly quiet.&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now I know exactly what Ned thinks of me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri stared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Eri eventually let out a sigh and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though I am known as an active scholar,  I too can be tired. I can smell death everywhere here at this ruins&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;ve never investigated such a dangerous ruins before”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri said regretfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m burdening you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not a burden! Because I like to take part in this exploration! It is my fault that I am not physically fit. I&#8217;ll do some muscle training from now on!&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muscle training is another thing, but it would be better to attend the conference, which she had skipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we ate our dinner and went to bed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; Looks like we all went to bed.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard the four of us, except myself, sleeping, I got up without making a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the room and went back the way I came. Once I&#8217;ve been down that road, I know how to proceed safely.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s try this for a minute’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the second floor of the castle district was a place called the main corridor. A long, narrow corridor circled around the courtyard. There was a half-destroyed bench in the corridor. The view of the courtyard from this corridor must have been good. Unfortunately, all that can be seen now is a pile of rubble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked along the edge of the corridor, following the railing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters set certain rules in this corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly move my right foot closer to the middle of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly &#8211; an eerie darkness appears right in front of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『41st Order. Only nobles may pass through the centre in the main corridor.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater tells what the rules are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a common custom. Commoners have to face the nobility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it is called the main corridor, the nobles must have passed through here often. The commoners would offer the aristocrats the central path and walk close to the edge of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My right foot was about to step over the middle of the corridor and I stopped just before that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater is silent for a while, then mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Just barely──』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Can I have a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out somewhat hastily, as I didn&#8217;t want it to disappear too soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I felt the darkness in front of me seem to sway slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;..We are surprised. We didn&#8217;t expect you to ask us for a dialogue.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you know they&#8217;re someone you can have a dialogue with, it&#8217;s normal to talk to them, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;..No, no,no, it&#8217;s extremely unusual. You&#8217;re a little bit crazy.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a terrible thing to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;ve always wanted to have a dialogue with the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I first confronted the Dark Eaters, they used normal human language. ──If I think about it calmly, the possibility was there from the beginning. Making promises to people means communicating with them. It should be possible to have a dialogue with the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they can have dialogue, I might be able to negotiate with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark eater. Our aim is not to cause you any trouble. So can you guarantee our safety for a while?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We refuse. Accepting that request would mean we would breaking our word.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I knew that would be the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, for the Dark Eaters, decades-old promises are still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the person to whom they have already made a promise is no longer alive&#8230;&#8230;the Dark Eaters are only obedient to their own desires and have no regard for human beings. It is a value system that is hard to sympathise with, as befits a monster that transcends human knowledge.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p165-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you answer some questions for me?&#8230;..Is there anything in these ruins that has to do with the Demon King?　What&#8217;s Ziggrit doing here?　Has a girl with white hair ever been here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked three questions in rapid succession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be helpful if it could answer any of them but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Answering that question would break our promise』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We must not do anything to detriment Ziggrit. That&#8217;s what we promised each other.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That statement is nothing more than the Dark Eaters protecting and defending Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;did you make a new promise?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having grasped the situation, I let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is nothing strange about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the late King Airun, the Dark Eaters are still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it would not be strange if the Dark Eaters made a new promise to someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you make that promise?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We can&#8217;t answer that.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you make that promise with Ziggrit?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No answer.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inorganic answers are repeated.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘In any case, the dark eater does not always answer the truth. &#8230;&#8230;it would be quicker to do my own research.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters have now made some kind of promise with Ziggrit and are protecting him. If he continues to negotiate with the Dark Eaters in this state, he cannot be trusted with the information he has obtained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne,Ned,–san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard Alice&#8217;s voice from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn around and see Alice looking at me with her hand on the scabbard of her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice. Sorry, did I wake you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,This is not the time to say that. &#8230;..! No, you need to get away from the Dark Eaters right now&#8230;&#8230;!　It&#8217;s dangerous&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice stared at the Dark Eater with a pallid face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her whole body trembled with fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Now,that&#8217;s a normal reaction.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eater said plainly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you lay a hand on Ned-san&#8230;&#8230;I swear, I will slay you&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice drew her sword with a trembling hand and pointed her spearhead at the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A weak wind blows through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eater&#8217;s body shook slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『As long as you don&#8217;t break the order, I won&#8217;t do anything. It is always stupid people who destroy eternity.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, the Dark Eater fizzled out and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Alice did not release her stance for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she had been alerted to her surroundings for a long enough, Alice slowly sheathed her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Alice, who was breathing on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice nodded silently, then stared at me with a slightly sulky expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne,Ned-san&#8230;&#8230;.I, I was worried about you&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With tears in the corners of her eyes, Alice said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.my mistake.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I&#8217;m too used to dealing with higher-ranking beings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone is probably tired and I was acting with a light heartedness about it&#8230;&#8230;trying to make contact with the Dark Eaters while I could, but it seems I caused unnecessary worry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the main corridor, we returned to the room where everyone was sleeping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way there, Alice unexpectedly squeezed my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Ned-san, you are always out of my sight&#8230;&#8230;This way, you won&#8217;t go anywhere else&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s face was bright red, but her grip on my hand was strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s what the hero wants, I&#8217;ll obey her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We kept our hands interlocked until we returned to our beds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We resumed our investigation and walked carefully so as not to break the Dark Eater&#8217;s rules.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Mental fatigue is hard to deal with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you&#8217;re dead, you&#8217;re dead, so why not just reopen the door? ──That kind of thinking is possible. I was the only one who was used to this kind of situation, and fatigue was definitely setting in for the other four.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Physical fatigue can be recovered by resting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t know how to recover from mental fatigue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vague burden of being unable to grasp what was happening was eating away at our heart every second.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks like we can get up to the fifth floor from here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says, leaning slightly down from the stairs and staring upwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way up the stairs, I notice sweat dripping from Alice&#8217;s cheeks as she walks in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice is not the only one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri and Kirch are equally tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only ones who seem to be fine are me and&#8230;. Phylicia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia seems fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For a bowman, spiritual training is a must. Well, I&#8217;m a healer now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia said with a reliable smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, a bowman I know said something similar. The bow is a delicate weapon, so to master it you have to train not only your technique but also your mentality. Slurred breathing and trembling fingers cannot be controlled by physical training alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beyond this door is the throne room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The majestic door was in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri. There are some rules here, aren&#8217;t there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too&#8230;&#8230; hmm? Is this &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looked with difficulty at the stone monument in front of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, I don&#8217;t think there is one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up, Eli tells us clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is surprising. The throne room is one or two of the most important places in this castle. Unlike the changing rooms and toilets, where rules are likely to be installed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If they pass through here, it means they have business with the king. I think they wanted to avoid comparing the two, the errand to the King and the appointment with the Dark Eaters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. a matter of dignity, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the rules of the Dark Eaters have to take precedence even in front of the throne room where the king is present, the visitors will feel as if they are more concerned about the Dark Eaters than the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know much about the relationship the Kingdom of Airun had with the Dark Eaters at the time but it seems that the Dark Eaters never stood above the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went into the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after entering the throne room, we stopped and were alarmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the other rooms, this one is full of debris, but&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“wh,what is this device &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, looking around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A huge device had been set up, with a heavy operating noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of piping is stretched around the device. They seem to be made of a special material and are very sturdy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way it is set up suggests that something is being delivered through the pipes to the device in the centre of the room. Or vice versa, something in the equipment is being released through the pipes to the outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pipework extended deep into the castle, the exact opposite of the way we had come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is definitely not a relic of the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is clearly state-of-the-art technology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, do you know what it is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;.this is not my area of expertise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as Eli doesn&#8217;t know, this must be a device that has nothing to do with archaeology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other three also looked to make sure, but they all shook their heads. No one seems to know anything about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If no one knows, then it&#8217;s my turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could call someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out a communication stone from my pouch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approach the device, signalling the person I want to talk to.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If I look closely, I can see some sort of serial number on it.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This number could be a clue to something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told the person I was communicating with about the scene in front of me and the serial number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes later&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see what you mean. Thanks for telling me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our communication ends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I put the communication stone in the pouch, Alice and the others looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Ned-san, do you know what that is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somewhat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t nod my head in a dignified manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First I contacted a legendary merchant &#8211; the god of distribution &#8211; who knew where all the goods were. As a result, the god of distribution introduced me to an engineer from a certain country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By giving the serial number to the engineer, I was able to obtain information about the device.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently, this is a device that absorbs magic power. But I don&#8217;t know why it is placed in a place like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the story, this was a magic suction machine developed by the technological powerhouse Zetabytes. The central device is said to convert the collected magic power into solid crystals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic power is the energy that fuels the use of magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is usually present in the atmosphere and wizards have the art of harbouring it in their bodies. There have been cases of high-ranking monsters carrying them in their bodies, but this is rare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. Do you remember how I explained earlier that spirits may be the beings who taught humans magic?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says with a serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She explained that there is no evidence for this, only in theory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason that theory was put forward is that spirits have an energy similar to magical power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looks at the device and continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This device could possibly be used to syphon off the energy of the Dark Eaters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.would the Dark Eaters allow that to happen so easily and readily?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s possible if they&#8217;ve made that kind of promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, I agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Eaters, who are starved of order, have a tremendous attachment to promises. They value the lives of those to whom they have made promises more than their own lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;&#8230;look at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch calls out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch points to the floor at my feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Footprints&#8230;&#8230;.probably new.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were three sets of footprints in the gravel, made up of finely crushed debris.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think Ziggrit is in the vicinity”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all reveal our wariness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We don&#8217;t know what this device is, but Ziggrit&#8217;s plot is probably related to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this device was hidden in the Airun ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that remained was to catch him, who would be the ringleader and everything would be solved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a noise was heard from the back of the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was Ziggrit but what appeared were quadrupedal beasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monsters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Four chimaeras. Behind them, if I look closely, there are three golems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The golem, like the gargoyle, is a huge monster with an ore body. However, their structure is different. The golem is bipedal and humanoid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gargoyles and golems prefer similar environments to each other, so both may inhabit the same location. In such cases, gargoyles often live outdoors and golems indoors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll take on the golem&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch said, holding his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leave the hard enemies to Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice drew her sword and flashed  towards the chimaera.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Presumably, there are no Dark Eater rules in the throne room. So Alice and her team were able to concentrate on the fight. One after another, the heads of the chimaera were severed and the golems were destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the golem, which was blown away, collided with the device that sucked up magic power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The device doesn&#8217;t even twitch. It seems to be quite sturdy, as it is set up unprotected in a place where monsters are present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;..the last one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the slash fired by Alice touches the chimaera, it liquefies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chimaera, which received a spray of slashes, was torn to shreds all over its body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. phew.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice lets out a small exhale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last monster was defeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when we were about to resume our investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A mass of flames flew in from a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They all jump back from the spot to avoid the flaming mass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s monsters left&#8230;&#8230;?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch raises his axe in alarm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alice denies it with impatience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! Someone is attacking us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, lightning spears flew in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of them is about fifty. This was a magical attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice approached me in an instant, lifted my body and evacuated with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spears of lightning fell indiscriminately like rain. Kirch held his axe like an umbrella to block the spears, while Phylicia and Eri moved out of the range of the spears in the nick of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for saving me..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked Alice and stared at the front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew exactly who was attacking us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ziggrit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long, shiny blue hair. Silver armour that glints faintly in the dimly lit ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zigrit, a hero from the Imperial Kingdom of Eisu, stands in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit opens his mouth while staring at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His  first words were──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;How did you get here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He frowned, as if to say that it was truly incomprehensible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you know the rules that exist in the Castle District? Why, with that level of ability, how did you get here without anyone dying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laughed and said to a bemused Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fortunately, I&#8217;ve got some good friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eheeh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri puffed out her chest proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit. There was a lot of information in this world that you missed. Since you didn&#8217;t share the archaeological material with us, we scholars have been desperately trying to piece it together and get information about the castle district&#8230;&#8230;Then it was just a matter of deciphering the stone monuments around here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stone monument? The decipherment of that stone monument was spoon-fed to every scholar. Don&#8217;t spout such lies.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t put me in the same company of those scholars! I am a woman of action!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not something that can be put away with one word…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is often said that absorbing knowledge through actual experience is far more efficient than studying diligently at a desk and in a sense, Eri is a scholar who has mastered this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She values experience above all else. She may acquire knowledge from books but in such cases she always puts it into practice and sublimates it into experience. I don&#8217;t think a normal person can acquire extraordinary knowledge just by doing that but geniuses always live according to their own policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Eri, action is probably the most important thing to focus on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.bullshit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit didn&#8217;t believe a word of what Eri said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I listen to their exchange, I look behind him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a bowman and a wizard there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is dimly lit and hard to see, but the wizard is holding a girl with white hair.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. the girl that was kidnapped.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The search for the white-haired girl was requested at the entrance to the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That purpose has been served.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do with that girl?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; none of your business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit glared at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that you&#8217;ve disturbed us this much, we&#8217;ll kill you sooner or later&#8230;&#8230;but we&#8217;re busy right now. If you say you&#8217;ll leave soon, we&#8217;ll stop chasing you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit quietly waited for our reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sign of closing the distance. I guess he meant what he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re not going to leave, and we&#8217;re not going to let you go. You&#8217;re going to spit everything about what you&#8217;re up to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit slightly lowered his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Then die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Ziggrit dives towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice blocked the blade that was coming at me with her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of a fierce clash, Kirch came around behind Ziggrit and swung down his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit dodged the axe by half-turning his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Blazing Stone: Fire shot》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">炎礫ファイア・ショット]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wizard releases a flaming conglomerate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri throws a spirit bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the bottle breaks, it unleashed a blast that blows the flaming stone away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Javelin: Thunder Lance》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, spears of lightning flew in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others were unable to attack due to the incessant onslaught by the wizard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept my distance from the battle line and looked at the wizard who was one of Ziggurit&#8217;s companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Paul＝Wenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">パル＝ウェンティ。</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl, who holds a large staff, is skilled in a variety of magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By nature, wizards tend to be all-rounders. Paul is no exception to this rule and has developed solid, royal skills. If he lacks skill, he is poor at dexterity, but Paul is no ordinary member of a heroic party. She performs both offensively and defensively to an extremely high standard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The magic was unleashed in small increments, making it difficult for us to find an opening to counterattack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow we found a launch at an attack and Alice tried to close the distance with Paul, but──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a short, wind-slashing sound, an arrow was aimed at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice repels the arrow with her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aimed&#8230;..precisely&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow is coming towards her, and Kirch calmly plays the arrow with his axe, muttering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arrows were flying at the perfect timing from a while ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a marvel that she can shoot arrows so accurately in this dimly lit environment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Meti-Cortal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">メティ＝コルタル</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of Ziggrit&#8217;s companions. A bowman, she has won all the archery competitions held in the imperial kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The essence of this is the speed of reaction. Meti is quick to fire and does not miss even the slightest opening. In addition, her accuracy is so high that her opponent has to be constantly on the lookout for arrows and is unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who is shooting the arrow keeps her distance and cannot be touched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s karma, isn&#8217;t it? I never thought I would have to fight so hard with a bow as crude as this one….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, once an accomplished archer, irritably dodges the arrows fired by Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s companions have a good balance of strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, the wizard Paul is on the front line,focusing on attacking and the bowman Meti is a sniper, but both of them could realise a variety of strategies if they wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By nature, members of a heroic party tend to specialise in one art. Since the heroic party has to be supported by the people, unique individuals are more likely to be chosen. A genius in one field is more impressive than an honours student who can do everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Ziggrit&#8217;s party members have rather modest personalities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for this&#8230; is this man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Silver star.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit sheaths his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Noble and majestic beast!》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While placing his hand on the breastplate of the armour he wears, Ziggrit chants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《When the sacred sword of pride decays.》《The  deadly claws and fangs turns red.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ferocious fighting spirit dwelled in Ziggrit&#8217;s sharp eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release ────《Silver Star Beast》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A reddish-black pattern floated on Ziggrit&#8217;s silver armour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armour, 《Silver Beast Armour》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its silver armour, change certain parts of his body to look like the claws and fangs of a beast by releasing that skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit fleshed out Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice immediately swings her sword and tries to keep her distance but before she can do so, Ziggrit tries to cleave her arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, a sharp blade extended from Ziggrit&#8217;s gaulet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The claws of the huge beast closing in on Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden change in spacing delayed Alice&#8217;s response for a moment. Alice, who chose defence over evasion, laid down her sword to catch the claws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to catch the impact, Alice was blown backwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to end you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I won&#8217;t let you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit attempts to pursue Alice, but just before she does, Phylicia fires an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the arrow did not reach Ziggrit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s movements were faster than the arrow that was released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the blessing of the flying arrow! You can&#8217;t match his speed in a straight line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggurit has a blessing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Flying Arrow Blessing&#8230;&#8230;Its effect is somewhat tricky, despite its name, as it accelerates movement in a straight line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is faster than anyone or anything else when it comes to movement in a straight line alone. It is extremely difficult for humans to keep up with him and even arrows and magic will not reach him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice barely jumped back before a silver claw sliced through her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A roar echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Large claw marks were carved into the walls of the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We must not let Ziggrit behave as he pleases any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch swung his axe down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A steel tail extended from Ziggrit&#8217;s armour to block the axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem powerful, but not fast enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The steel tail repelled the axe, and Ziggrit swung his claws out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, having blocked the claw with his axe, retreated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Ziggrit thrust his left arm forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ 《Ice Boreas:Ice Collapse and Raging Destruction》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">氷崩猛壊アイス・ボレアス</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huge chunks of ice attack in a row, like an avalanche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is large-scale ice magic. The range is wide and this is unavoidable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Axe of Execution》──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s great axe smashes the ice blocks with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet the momentum of the ice block is unstoppable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is unfashionable!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri slams the spirit bottle on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A wall of earth appears, slightly cutting the momentum of the ice block.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ice block&#8217;s momentum is slightly reduced by the appearance of a wall of earth, which barely manage to divert from its path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The forceful action took the initiative at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That one person…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Ziggrit＝Arland</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ジグリット＝アーランド</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Hero from the Imperial Kingdom of Eisu has three talents that, if he had just one, would make him famous all over the world: his special armour, the Armour of the Silver Beast, the blessing of the Flying Arrow and large-scale ice magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He can fight at close quarters as well as at long range, and his speed and physical strength are unparalleled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is truly a monster with no blind spots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heroic party of the Eisu Empire is, to put it bluntly, is a one-man party by Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The party is formed by this man alone. Therefore, the individuality of the party members does not have to be specific.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll cover for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia calmly pulls an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Meti fired an arrow at Phylicia sooner than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia clicks her tongue and avoids the arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow flies at really exquisite timing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti looked at Phylicia with the next arrow already in her sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re not used to real combat, are you?　You move so slow as if I’m playing with a target practice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia&#8217;s forehead had a blue streaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia&#8217;s bow skills have been compromised because of the curse of the purple smoke. It doesn&#8217;t matter if she&#8217;s had any real combat experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys better be&#8230;&#8230; ready at once…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, who was retreating while keeping a wary eye on Ziggrit, suddenly stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ki, Kirch-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is dangerous to stop in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice approached Kirch, wondering if something had happened to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment &#8211; Kirch swung his axe at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice hurriedly avoids the axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s axe cracked loudly on the floor where Alice had just been standing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch-san, what the&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice almost reflexively pointed her sword at Kirch but managed to hold back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can&#8217;t point a sword at your fellow man. But for some reason, Kirch attacked them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is he&#8230;&#8230; being controlled by someone?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that kind of magic existed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I observe my surroundings, leaving my friends bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Ziggrit. Paul, clutching her wand, was sitting on the floor, face down, as if she had lost consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We haven&#8217;t done anything to her yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And despite being unconscious, neither Ziggrit nor Meti are worried about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, it&#8217;s that wizard. Maybe Kirch is enchanted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice approached Paul with blinding speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin》!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slashes fired at the wall liquefy and reflect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not easy to avoid this complex attack. Ziggrit rushes back and jumps away, holding Paul&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unconscious Paul wakes up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, Kirch&#8217;s body stiffens again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch-san!　Are you alright!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. mu? For a moment, my memory&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch wakes up safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul, who was being held by Ziggrit, glares at us and clicks her tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not so much magic to control the body, but magic to transfer it&#8230;&#8230;.If she can apply that power, she might be the one to move the dolls, too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no use fooling around now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who attacked us that night and the one who abducted the white-haired girl, was this wizard called Paul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic that can transfer into people and things is quite a tricky thing to have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ 《Ice Boreas:Ice Collapse and Raging Destruction》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The avalanche of ice blocks hits us again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhhh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch holds up his axe and hits the ice block sideways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The avalanche&#8217;s trajectory is slightly deflected. On top of that, Alice scattered the impact with a slash and Eri with a wall of earth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They succeed in outwitting the ice block.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we can&#8217;t let that magic be used so many times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s breath was tinged white. The temperature in the room has dropped considerably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Balance of Purification and Healing》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A balance appears in Phylicia&#8217;s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch and Alice&#8217;s wounds are treated. But they do not recover from fatigue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to retreat, retreat. Don&#8217;t think you can overturn this gap in strength.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit said, glaring at us.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not so much the strength difference but the geographical advantage they have over us&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Ziggrit and his party continue to evade, we probably won&#8217;t be able to corner them. They’re probably more familiar with the structure of the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We shouldn&#8217;t think we can settle this here and now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, at the very least, we want to steadily and gradually chip away at their strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we capture one of them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked my companions in a quiet voice so that Ziggrit and his party could not hear me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ca,ccapture&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. We can hold them hostage, but more than that, we need to know what Ziggrit&#8217;s objective is&#8230;&#8230;If we can find out what he wants, even if we can&#8217;t get him here in the worst case scenario, we can create another opportunity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy to forget because we&#8217;ve gone into a state of engagement, we still don&#8217;t know what Ziggrit is up to. Knowing that might give us a better advantage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The person we&#8217;re going to capture&#8230;&#8230;would you be okay with that bowman?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a reason for this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She is a Tengen-style archer like me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia  says, glaring at the bow-user Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably about level 9. The basics are in place, but there are still a lot of things she’s not good at. Despite the fact that&#8230;..she look down on me with that&#8230;..condescending look, it is absolutely unforgivable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The normally calm Phylicia  was unusually outspoken in her anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Phylicia. Isn&#8217;t that called &#8230;&#8230; a personal grudge?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can&#8217;t it be my personal grudge, Kirch-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia has a terrifying smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s face twitched slightly. This is a rare reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if that motivates you, then good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to take Phylicia&#8217;s suggestion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just thinking of targeting Meti the bowman or Paul the wizard, as capturing a Ziggrit would be difficult in any case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will neutralise that bowman. So, can one of you create an opening for me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“okay, I&#8217;ll try&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice readied her sword and concentrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ 《O White Devil who wanders eternally.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a white exhalation, Alice chants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《that blossom in vain is piled up》《Remnant snowflakes dance in the sky──》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword glowed white.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The outline of the blade becomes faintly &#8230;&#8230; dim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release────《White Flower》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice swung the blade, which was covered in cold air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beautiful snowflakes flew in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the snow touched the floor ── a flower of slashes bloomed and spilled out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh-?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit jumped back with his eyes wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the skill 《White Flower》 of the special armament 《Snow Origin》 is to turn slashes into snow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s slash, which was almost particulate, was a difficult blow to avoid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get carried away&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit uses the blessing of his flying arrow and instantly retreats to the wall directly behind him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a great deal of momentum, Ziggrit put his foot on the wall and pointed his palm at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ 《Ice Boreas:Ice Collapse and Raging Destruction》!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice leapt diagonally upwards against the approaching ice block.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in a dance, Alice flipped herself lightly in the air and swung her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pure white beautiful snow scattered and came into contact with Ziggrit&#8217;s magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Countless blades of snow pierce the huge block of ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The impact was so great that I barely managed to hold on as I was about to be blown away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snow and ice crystals scattered violently. The dimly lit throne room glistened in the faint sunlight. It is such a fantastic sight that I would fall in love with it if I’m not in the middle of a battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was a girl who was quietly sharpening her fangs, paying no attention to such a fantastic sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia turns the arrow on her bow and calmly looks at her target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s true, I&#8217;m not very good with a bow because of this curse, but&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Purple smoke blocks Phylicia&#8217;s left eye as she mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Phylicia&#8217;s bow and arrow were not shaking in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I&#8217;m willing to take my time ──── I can get somewhat closer to my prime.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia shoots an arrow.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p195-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The released arrow instantly pierced through the gap between the scattered snow blades and the shattered ice blocks and hit the bowstring held by Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.What? Ha? Why did the&#8230;..string break&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti, who was holding the bow, was stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incredible accuracy. She shot through only the string of the bow, which was held by a human being, with precision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing such divine deeds gives me goosebumps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this is no time to stand still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to dazzle all of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri throws the spirit bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottle cracks in mid-air and intense light is emitted in all directions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice approaches Meti while Ziggrit and Paul are closing their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha, Wait…..!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti was startled, as if she didn&#8217;t think she would be the target at this moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice went behind Meti and thrust her sword into her neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu,  please don&#8217;t move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti&#8217;s face paled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit and Paul stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s unbecoming of a heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not a surprise to either of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s more than mutual. Not only are Ziggrit are obstructing us relentlessly but he also abducting a girl who is just a civilian.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opponent is a heroic party. It cannot be said that they gained an advantage to the extent that they took hostages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But odds were against me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit. You said you were busy, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s eyebrows moved slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn&#8217;t want to be disturb, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe you&#8217;re in a hurry? I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;..but we don&#8217;t mind playing endurance games.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit sharpened his flashing eyelids and glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the response I received was not as I expected. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit. Just go. I&#8217;m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit looks frustrated at the captured Meti&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Ziggrit quietly lowers his gaze and</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a brief apology, Ziggrit left the throne room with Paul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They fled in the opposite direction from the way we came, towards the piping chain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice sheathes her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We approach the captured companion, Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to break the ice&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia calls out to Meti, who is slumped on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I have a word with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia smiles so horrifyingly that even a predator would run away from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I have nothing to say to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti, the bowman, still showed defiance in the face of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have something to tell us, maybe we can help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.there&#8217;s nothing you can do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Meti closes her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even want to hear your voice. Such act is conveyed through her attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you recognise my face, my dear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[貴女 Kijo=Noblewoman/lady or can be use to refer to a woman; epistolary style. Phylicia use this but I wrote my dear, tell me if you,the readers have a substitute for this]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Phylicia brings her face close to Meti</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti opens her eyes slightly, but closes them quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t look familiar &#8230;&#8230;, there&#8217;s no way that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“─do you recognise my face?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Phylicia repeats the same question once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the second time she asked the question, there was a force in her tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I say I don’t know&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti looked at Phylicia&#8217;s face in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Meti slowly opens her eyes wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti was astonished, as if she had seen something out of this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It, it can’t be&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;your the mad-bow Phylicia?!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Mad-bow Phylicia?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti seems to know Phylicia, but calls her by a strange second name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know you, but you know me, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye, yes&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you mustn&#8217;t cross me, must you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia asked with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smile. It should be a smile, but I feel a pressure not to go against it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Yes”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti nodded defiantly, as if her previous defiance had been a lie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phyliciaa, what does she mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I questioned the person in question about their relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not a big deal. I&#8217;m a bit famous amongst Tengen-style archery users, so I have a good reputation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N, no, not just a bit&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti shuts her mouth and shakes her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks unusually frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, Phylicia lets out a small sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she explains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tengen-ryu is a meritocracy. That&#8217;s why those below you can&#8217;t go against those above you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia  said, looking at 　Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti shook her head slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia  was, as I recall, a full member of the team. How well does that stand up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Tengen-ryu archery has a dan ranking system from 5th to 10th dan, and above that there are three levels of transmission: Okuden, Kaiden and Kyokuden. There are 18 levels in total. There is one Kyokuden and one Kaiden, so&#8230;&#8230;I am, in a manner of speaking, the second highest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ping me if I’m wrong.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia told us in a matter-of-fact manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Tengen-ryu school of archery is renowned as the most battle-tested school of archery in the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being the second highest in the school is an extraordinary status, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sh,Should I give up my&#8230;&#8230;position as the hero&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says to Filia with a cramped face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, don&#8217;t say that. I&#8217;ve been conceited up to now because of this half-baked class. Thanks to&#8230;..meeting you, I have learned about the vastness of the world. I think Alice deserves to be the hero of this party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia tells Alice in a serious tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, Alice is stronger in terms of pure combat power. So Phylicia  is right, Alice should be the hero. It is not that she unsuitable, but Alice is suited to be a hero not only in terms of combat power but also in terms of spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alice&#8217;s face fell down in embarrassment, Phylicia smiled gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the two of them in such a friendly mood, Meti spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, &#8230;&#8230;is that really, Phylicia-san &#8230;&#8230;?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti asked, puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard that the&#8230;&#8230;mad-bow Phylicia, as the name implies, is an extreme bow addict and while she&#8217;s reliable on the battlefield, when she gets bored she shoots every single monster in sight, a terrifying strange person. She&#8217;s a…──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti-san? Could you shut up for a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti&#8217;s shoulders jumped up and she nodded at the sense of intimidation emanating from Phylicia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Phylicia is regarded as a peculiar in some circles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s more than a hobby, it&#8217;s a nickname that&#8217;s long overdue because of her incredible skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you that great with the bow, Phylicia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard from Kirch that she was a great archer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hundreds of shots. People use the term as an expression to enhance a story, but rarely does a bowman use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was Phylicia that good in the eyes of the heroic party  of archers?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The moment someone enters&#8230;&#8230;in her sight, they die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti muttered in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The last thing you want to do is antagonise Phylicia＝Murray, the minute she comes into view, the next thing you know you’re dead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no longer in the hundreds shot. Phylicia is a deadly enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you can defeat the enemy just by entering the field of view instead of seeing it, it may be more than just a deadly enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that&#8217;s only if it&#8217;s a human opponent. With monsters, I can at least close my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia softly corrects her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it&#8217;s terrific enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that prowess is now meaningless because of the curse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Curse&#8230;&#8230;? Ah, that&#8217;s why you have such poor moves&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have lost to you, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti shook her head hurriedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia has frightened the poor thing to the point of I’m starting to feel sorry for her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. It might be better to prioritise breaking Phylicia&#8217;s curse rather than proceeding with the adventure.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I originally thought our party had a lot of potential but it has exceeded my expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the future, it might be better to provide a period of time to get stronger. All three of us could still be stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, back to the topic&#8230;..what are you guys doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has no intention of defying her anymore. Meti speaks out in a haltingly stilted manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two years ago&#8230;&#8230;we investigated these Airun Ruins. The members were four of us, a heroic party and two hundred collaborators. After a month-long investigation, only three of us survived.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti clenches her fists as she remembers those days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We finally reached the deepest part and there we encountered a certain monster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monster&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ask back, and Meti nods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are under the control of the Demon King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, we were startled into silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our minds were occupied with Ziggrit &#8211; we had originally investigated the Airun Ruins to look for clues about the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought I would hear the word Demon King here. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We couldn&#8217;t beat the Demon King&#8217;s men. But just when we thought we were going to be killed, they offered us a deal. They wanted us to cooperate with them in exchange for saving our lives.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and urged her to continue the story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question is what the deal was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know why, but the Demon King&#8217;s men are sucking the power out of the Dark Eaters. That&#8217;s what this device here is for.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Meti takes a glance at the piping around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, this seems to be for sucking out the power of the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Demon King&#8217;s subordinate made a promise to the Dark Eaters in exchange for sucking their power away &#8230;..they would offer a human being as a sacrifice every twenty days&#8230;&#8230;.we were made to help procure that sacrifice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Eri had expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters demand sacrifices in exchange for their power being sucked out of them. It is because of such promises that the Dark Eaters continue to have their power sucked out of them without resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t think the condition of that promise was a sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl is going to be sacrificed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember the girl with the white hair that the wizard was holding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Yes. We were kidnapping tourists as much as we could so that the people of Redas would not suspect us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that travellers visiting the city have been going missing in Redas recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the source of these disappearances includes Ziggrit and his party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No&#8230;.the original culprit was the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Demon King&#8217;s men also made us and the Dark Eaters another promise&#8230;&#8230;The Dark Eaters would not divulge information that would be detrimental to us. Instead, we will shorten the frequency of sacrifices to once every ten days.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it because of that promise that the Dark Eaters won&#8217;t say anything about Ziggrit and  his party?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a light promise. The frequency of sacrifices, which used to be once every twenty days, has been reduced by a factor of two. The number of victims has doubled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit is in a hurry because the day to offer the sacrifice is today&#8230;&#8230;There isn&#8217;t much time left. He is desperate because if he doesn&#8217;t offer the sacrifice, the Dark Eaters will kill him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti says, looking down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand that Ziggrit and the others are in a tight spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;..clearly there is no need to feel sorry for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were attacked by puppets controlled by Paul. In other words, Ziggrit was trying to sacrifice us. It is difficult to see them as victims.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I think we need to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are not doing this because they like it either. As the same heroic party, we should not put them away as if they were someone else since they were defeated by the Demon King&#8217;s men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small exhale, we sorted out the information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were clues about the Demon King. I also understood what Ziggrit was up to. I also found out the whereabouts of the girl who said she had been kidnapped. Now we have a full picture of this incident.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Our first adventure as heroic party have started with a bang’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clues to the Demon King were present at the Airun Ruins</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time that clues to the Demon King could be found in a place that had already been investigated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This could affect heroic parties all over the world. In the worst case scenario, we will have to re-investigate all the places we once surveyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that remains is to do what needs to be done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have to question Ziggrit and ask her for more information about the Demon King&#8217;s clues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the kidnapped girl must also be properly secured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re going after him.At the same time, we have to stop that sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After informing my companions of my plans, I look at Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti. Where did Ziggrit go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Behind here. In the throne room, further &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti pursed her lips once, then continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you won&#8217;t make it anyway. You can&#8217;t go from here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you have been bypassing the area to find a safer path, but from here onwards there is only one road&#8230;&#8230;The area beyond is the domain of the Dark Eaters. It&#8217;s not meant for normal humans to enter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti looks me in the eye and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When we first investigated the Airun Ruins, it took us five days to get here. The casualties were about sixty of the adventurers who helped us. That&#8217;s all it took&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As a result of going on from here, one hundred and forty adventurers and one of our own died. It took us about 30 days to get here&#8230;&#8230;.This end is the most dangerous place in the Castle District.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking slightly, Meti said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she remember the horror when the first time they investigated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, what she said is true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says with a worried look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are two areas in the Castle District, one inhabited by humans and one inhabited by spirits. The two are roughly the same size and in the centre of each is this throne room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;So this throne room is like a bridge between the two realms?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, Eri explained that the throne room was also frequented by Dark Eaters. If the throne room is connected to the realm where spirits live, it makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are no escape routes or back roads in the spirit realm like there were in the human realm. So I think it&#8217;s definitely dangerous from here onwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri&#8217;s guidance has saved our lives many times in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words are more trustworthy than anyone else&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti, can you give us directions?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti said with her eyes downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know anything about it. Only Ziggrit knows the correct way to proceed in the castle district. He said it would be safer not to share the information, because it would be too risky if it leaked outside.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That, on the flip side, means that Ziggrit suspects that Meti and Paul might leak information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is very well prepared. That is why, until now, no one has detected her actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guilt of continually sacrificing innocent civilians leads to a discretion that could be described as cowardice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give up. &#8230;&#8230;We have sacrificed so much to be able to come and go freely in and out of the Castle District. It&#8217;s not something you can handle if you&#8217;ve only entered the ruins yesterday and today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti says with a self-deprecating smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was exhausted. She can&#8217;t stand the guilt. Maybe if we walk away here, she will go and turn herself in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems it would be extremely difficult to hunt down Ziggrit right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for one girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, we have to go&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says, revealing her determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A hero does not abandon human life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is usually timid, but at times like this she speaks up clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we both knew Alice&#8217;s character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We know &#8211; Alice would say that, wouldn&#8217;t she?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all thought the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let&#8217;s go then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Meti won&#8217;t mind if we leave her here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the monsters around have been killed. The throne room should be safe now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,wait! Are you out of your mind?　How many people do you think died down there!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti doesn&#8217;t have to come with us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not the point!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti shouted in desperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She can&#8217;t seem to understand us at heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Meti&#8217;s weepy face and open my&#8230;..mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me ask you one question, do you guys like to offer sacrifices?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I ask this, her face turns bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, of course not…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti is furiously agitated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s only natural. As long as she has been chosen for the heroic party, she must have lived her life with extraordinary determination. Now that she has become a pawn under the control of the Demon King and is sacrificing ordinary people, she will not be able to forgive herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you should be honest about it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys should have just told&#8230;.someone to help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti&#8217;s eyes widen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they could do that, they wouldn&#8217;t be struggling now. If they rely on someone else, they couldn’t rely on them fully even if they wanted to, because they will suffer as well. I am sure that is what Ziggrit and his parties have decided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I know someone will help them because I know how big the world is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no problem that no one can solve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are so many people in this world who are far beyond my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t think you can proceed safely.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti said in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Usually, it’s a total loss..Even if the damage is contained, at least two people would still be dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Facing down, she said in a shaky voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking those words to heart, we slowly move forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A squeezed voice was heard ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a small voice but all of us heard it loud and clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to us. We&#8217;re the heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone asks for help &#8211; it&#8217;s the hero party responsible to responds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, we headed towards the back of the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before we did &#8211; I turned around because something was really bothering me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;&#8230;sorry. I forgot to ask you one question.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t really intend to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from a moment ago, she truly blames herself for the sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Meti has a personality that feels guilty as much as anyone else &#8211; there was one thing that puzzled me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meti. Is there anything else you&#8217;re not telling me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..? No. I&#8217;ve already told you everything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti replied, not knowing what she was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So Meti was not involved in this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: I think it’s about the imposter demon king]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had somehow guessed from her attitude earlier, so I don&#8217;t want to mention it any further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time I left Meti alone and set off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The device in the throne room seems to be designed to suck power from the Dark Eaters. If so, the Dark Eaters are probably where this piping is headed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Ziggrit is there too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We followed the piping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s better to hurry as much as possible….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, wary of her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I know. If we&#8217;re moving slowly&#8230;&#8230; that little girl will be sacrificed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like to proceed with caution, but I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re in a situation where it isn’t allowed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, too, will hasten the decipherment as much as I can!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of us is motivated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But our state of mind is surely filled with anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ One member of the heroic party had died down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Kingdom of Eisu is a great power that is more or less equal to the Kingdom of Enuvidia. One of the most powerful members of the hero party has died. It is easy to imagine the spectacular hell that lies ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Worst of all, one of us might become a victim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a terrible thing for a party of brave men and women who have just set out on a journey to have to deal with such anxieties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.this is a good place to use it, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice tilts her head at me as I mutter to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out a communication stone from my pouch and start communicating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heisen. I want to use it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Understood』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him briefly, Heisen also ended the communication with a minimal reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He must have realised that we were now in an emergency situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From inside my pouch, I took out a magical tool similar to a communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pressed the switch, a rectangular screen appeared in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ All this while, I wanted a weapon that was unique to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be precise, I wanted a weapon that would allow me to make better use of my contacts. Keeping in touch with each other by communication stone is enough but I was searching for a more effective way to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, I came up with a form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shared its form with Heisen, an expert on magical tools and asked him to think about how I could make it a reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──This is the weapon of Ned-tono, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen said this after I told him about the concept of the weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──In the end, though, it still uses other people&#8217;s help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──That&#8217;s not true. This magic tool would not be possible without the connections of Ned-tono.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen denied my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──This magical tool will be an indication of the work Ned-tono has built. Hence the name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the magical tool was chosen by Heisen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name was a little itchy for me but Heisen and his men were excited about it, so I decided to go along with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a member of a hero party, I wanted&#8230;&#8230;my power to help everyone in any way I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is surely the weapon that will make my wish come true.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p216-1-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now&#8230;&#8230; let&#8217;s get this over with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Ned had begun to move into the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit was in a state of agitation in the deepest part of the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the room that the Kingdom of Airun had prepared exclusively for the Dark Eaters &#8211; the Dark Eaters&#8217; living quarters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Eaters still exist in this dimly lit room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was difficult to see them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boundary between the darkness of the room and the Dark Eaters is so blurred that he cannot tell where they are. He almost feels as if all the darkness in the room is the Dark Eaters themselves, and that he is now in the belly of the Dark Eaters. He was slowly going crazy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit now understood that spirits are disordered and unstable creatures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is probably why Dark Eaters seek order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;dark eater.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit called out its name in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, darkness shimmers in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Don&#8217;t call us so casually.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit could heard an unhappy voice talking to him and felt a tremendous pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just looking at them was a total horror. Just by being there, Ziggrit is reminded of the difference in their status as living creatures. Like a frog staring at a snake, the mere presence of a dark eater makes him unable to do anything. His limbs trembled and sweat broke out all over his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that when a person encounters an opponent whose presence is far more powerful than their own, they are overwhelmed by their presence and cannot move a single fingertip. Ziggrit, who was originally blessed with talent, had never experienced this but he thought that this feeling must be similar to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current Ziggrit has an Existence Power of 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, if he apply the strength of the Dark Eater to human standards, they may have an Existence Power of 20 or 30, not 10.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The difference is overwhelming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one can remain calm in the face of the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is, it is either the strongest person in the world, or a weird person with his head screwed on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is neither of these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still──he had to call out to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark eater. The sacrifice is already prepared. Can we move on now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Rejected. The 92nd Order, Ziggrit Arland, must make a sacrifice to us once every ten days&#8230;..Two hundred and thirty-nine hours, forty-seven minutes and forty-one seconds have passed since the last sacrifice. The next sacrifice will come directly from you in twelve minutes and fifteen seconds.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit barely suppressed the urge to spit from his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Eaters thoroughly keep their promises once made. In doing so, they are not flexible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a spirit, the Dark Eaters do not understand the human way of being flexible. If they are told every ten days, as the saying goes, it is every 240 hours. The Dark Eaters have no concept of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sacrifice will be made in twelve minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until then, Ziggrit will be stranded here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the brave men of the Kingdom of Enuvidia will be in pursuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark eater, I have a favour to ask you. Make a promise to me. There&#8217;s been an intruder in the&#8230;..castle district. I want you to kill them all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit bowed his head pleadingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Order is a noble and absolute thing. It is not something that can be set up by a blockhead like you.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ボンクラ:Bonkura. There’s many words synonym to blockhead but I chose this.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Kuhh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s face contorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a little-known fact &#8211; the Dark Eaters are selective about who they make promises to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Eaters consider order to be sublime. Therefore, they believe that order should not be created by ordinary people with shallow knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the Dark Eaters, Ziggrit was an ordinary person. That is why they do not recognise him as a person with whom they would make a promise.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You made a promise to the Demon King&#8217;s subordinates, but am I’m not good enough….?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he already knew this, Ziggrit feels unbearably humiliated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zi, Ziggrit. Are you&#8230;..okay?We&#8217;re holed up in here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul, the wizard, asked anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought that heroic party was going to come after us&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s going to be alright&#8230;&#8230;.Of course it&#8217;s okay. Do you know how much time and lives we sacrificed to get here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit said to himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes &#8211; it has to be okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, Ziggrit is just upset that their sins are known to the other Heroic Parties.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They’ll never get this far&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ruins of Airun are the worst trap zone in history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to get to Ziggrit  in the deepest part, they have to go through countless instant-death traps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a place that can be breached by a simple plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit and his team understand the horror of these ruins better than anyone else.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Particularly troublesome were the Dark Spirit Room and the corridor crossing from the West Tower&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit recalls the despair of that day.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The Dark Spirit Room is a living room where dark spirits who have been caught by the presence of dark eaters and have entered the castle can relax and unwind. To pass through here, you have to ask permission from the dark spirits inside. Not more than ten people in the world can communicate with spirits. I&#8217;ve had people who know a lot about spirits working like cart horses, and we&#8217;ve finally got to the point where we can communicate with them in a minimum of one language.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took ten days to break through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifty people died simply because they said or heard things wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some died simply because they were too frightened to speak out properly and choked on their words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was more hell to come.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There is an invisible scaffold in the crossing corridor from the West Tower. They have to step on those scaffolds in the correct order to proceed&#8230;&#8230;.If they take even one wrong step, they will die instantly.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took 15 days to break through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just figuring out the location of the scaffolds and the route to take was enough to cause many casualties. Somehow, they managed to find the correct route but even after that, many people lost their footing because their bodies were shaking with fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone was killed by the Dark Eaters, and those who witnessed the scene felt an even stronger fear and stepped off the scaffold. Then they were killed again by the Dark Eaters, and the fear became even more contagious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of them had mental breakdowns and threw themselves across the corridor without crossing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their blood stains were freshly smeared on the floor below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of victims was approximately ninety. The length of the corridor is not that long, about the length of three horse-drawn carriages. The fact that ninety people had died in such a short distance was a source of tremendous fear.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They can&#8217;t possibly get here. They must not reach here&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much despair they had to endure to get to this Dark Eater&#8217;s living room&#8230;..Zigrit still vividly remembers that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is proud to say that he has the ability to be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with that ability, one hundred and forty people were killed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the other is the same heroic party, there is no way they can reach this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zi, Ziggrit&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul calls out to Ziggrit, who recalls the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment,Ziggrit almost shouted at her, [What do you want this time?], but he quickly realised that it would be taking it out on her and held back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,that…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul pointed in a certain direction, clutching his walking stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The finger pointed to a crossing corridor that could be seen outside the window. The place that Ziggrit had just recalled was the hellhole where nearly ninety collaborators had died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the corridor, Ziggrit&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this very moment, five figures were crossing the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be, that&#8217;s ridiculous&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahead of us running through the castle district, we saw a double-opening door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri quickly deciphers the stone inscription.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned! Apparently, this door is not to be passed through unless you talk to the dark spirits in the room and ask their permission!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ok”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps getting the hang of it, Eri quickly deciphered the contents of the stone inscription.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no one here now who can talk to the spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I typed the words into my magical tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned: who can interact with dark spirits?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the letters were entered, several responses were received.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lisha: I can do it only in words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reg: If you don&#8217;t mind if it takes a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alia: I can speak～!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">リーシャ,レグ,アリア</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to ask for help reliably and efficiently if possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I contact one of the acquaintances who responds, via a communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alia, can you do me a favour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ll take care of it!　I just have to talk to the dark spirits, right?　My theatre company sometimes has spirit guests, so I can talk to them as much as I want~!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She agreed with an upbeat attitude and is a member of the 『Fraudia troupe』, a famous theatre company that travels the world. They perform their plays not only with people, but sometimes with monsters and spirits. They have no fixed place of activity and no fixed audience, they jump all boundaries and are accepted, and they have a large number of fans as the most egalitarian theatre company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">フラウディア座</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While connecting with Alia, I point the communication stone towards the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear the voice of the spirit through the door, then Alia&#8217;s voice through the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a strange language, beyond description.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, a bright voice is heard from the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s done! I was so surprised at how talkative all the spirits were! I was told you can just walk through from now on, so feel free to come in!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for your help”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon we opened the door and passed through a room where the dark spirits seemed to live.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was dark, without a single light. As we walked, we could hear what sounded like a child&#8217;s laughter, giggling in our ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an eerie place where just being there made me feel uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if Alia is right, the dark spirits accept us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let us pass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I conveyed just one word, the air around me became slightly warmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know, but I feel like the spirits are welcoming me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the &#8230;&#8230; tower&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch wonders at the scene in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I left the room with the dark spirits, I too, saw the entrance to the tower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On climbing the steps of the tower, we find another stone monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There seems to be an invisible scaffold here, created by the spirits. It seems we have to go through the scaffolds in the correct sequence to proceed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a complicated rule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I again post a message on the 《Networking connections》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned: show me how to get through the invisible scaffolding with the correct procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shamri: Tessa says she can use visualisation magic, so we can transfer Net&#8217;s vision to Tessa and then she can use visualisation magic on top of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tessa: Oh, that would work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A plan was developed that seemed to work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I remember correctly, there was no connection between Shamri and Tessa. They have spent time on different continents and have different professions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now they have connected through this magical tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing that moment, I feel a solid response to this new weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A magical tool──《Networking connections》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This magical tool is divided into a parent unit and a child unit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The parent unit, which I have, can start and stop the magic tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the magic tool is activated, it automatically starts communicating with the child unit and a message board is displayed. If I have either the parent or the child unit, I can freely enter messages on the noticeboard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The child unit was mailed by Heisen before I left the Kingdom of Enuvidia. It was addressed to all of my contacts. It hasn&#8217;t been very long since it was mailed, so maybe only some of them have received it but they will all receive it eventually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, my contacts have only connected me to someone&#8230;. I have a lot of acquaintances and friends myself, but they don&#8217;t connect with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with this magical tool, acquaintances can connect with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This magical tool, 《Networking connections》, turned my network of contacts into a group of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve always relied on the help of individuals in different situations but now I&#8217;ll be able to use the collective strength of the group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see &#8211; the effect is enormous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This group, after all, is full of geniuses I&#8217;ve met all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Met: I’ll do the detective work. I have a blessing to follow people&#8217;s traces, could this help me find my way around?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[メト]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shamri: Let&#8217;s try to transfer it to Met. Ned, are you okay with this suggestion?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shamri checks with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My vision has started to become hazy&#8230;..Well, I can&#8217;t turn my back on them. I&#8217;m going to trust them here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned: Aaa. Everyone, please.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I replied, Shamri communicated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned, can you tell me where you are?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the castle district of the Airun Ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I see. No wonder we&#8217;re going through a complicated place.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for a while, a voice was heard briefly from the communication stone saying [OK].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Coordinates successfully specified. Let&#8217;s begin.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after I heard those words, my vision suddenly went black.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently this is what happens when my vision is transferred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, I received another transmission from someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It’s me, Met. It&#8217;s been a while. Now Ned, you have to do exactly what I tell you to do.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Met, a boy genius detective known to everyone who knows him, who has a reputation for solving all kinds of difficult cases by relying on him, gives brief instructions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Numerous villains have been exposed by this boy. Some of the biggest names in politics and business have even sent assassins after him, but Met, himself an S-class adventurer, has managed to turn the tables on them all. For an evil-doer, there is probably no one he would rather make enemies with than him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Place the right foot diagonally upwards.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like this?&#8230;..there&#8217;s definitely some scaffolding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Keep going that way. Next, move to the scaffold on the left, but be careful with your timing, as that scaffold is rotating slowly. I&#8217;ll give you the instructions.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to follow Met&#8217;s instructions and before I knew it, I was across the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now all you have to do is repeat the same method.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I throw the communication stone to Alice on the other side of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to use my vision to locate the scaffolding, and Met gave Alice directions over the comms. The following Alice and the others are able to cross quickly because, unlike me, their vision had not been shifted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a similar fashion, we continued on through the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After passing through a long, narrow passageway, we came to a large room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san..that’s….!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dimly lit room, Alice pointed ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a man in silver armour, Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A white-haired girl is lying beside him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We made it just in time, didn&#8217;t we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha&#8230;&#8230;?!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit noticed our presence and his expression became distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way&#8230;..there&#8217;s no way, no way, no way!!!!! How did you all get here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We were allowed to go through the front door as normal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be ridiculous! How much time and sacrifice do you think it took us to get here?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the bottom of his heart, he didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it to this room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit unleashes  《Ice Boreas:Ice Collapse and Raging Destruction》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The huge ice blocks that formed in a row were one size smaller than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch cleaves his axe to the side and deflect Ziggrit&#8217;s magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His magic power must be depleted. The output of the magic is reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, Alice stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudden loss of consciousness.──I&#8217;ve seen this phenomenon before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. That magic again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia quickly fires an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She fires an arrow at Paul the Wizard, who is sleeping unprotected in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..ghii?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An arrow pierced Paul&#8217;s right arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Screaming, Paul wakes up. At the same time, Alice&#8217;s consciousness returns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Presumably, that transfer magic leaves the main body unprotected while he or she is using it. The fact that the magic is used in such a messy way, with a certain amount of risk, suggests that the Ziggrit probably no longer have the luxury of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That magic is still suspicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take one look at Paul, who stares at me, and say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve always wondered. No matter how much of an adventurer I may be, with my ramblings about the unknown, I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d actively investigate a place this dangerous until the last minute”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Ziggrit, I continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The point that the two hundred adventurers who cooperated all died stinks too much. If the death toll was that high, there must have been people who wanted to retire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet no one has retired──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys&#8230;you forced that person to cooperate with your investigation by using magic to transfer into him or her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words, Ziggrit had no reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the wizard did not. Paul couldn&#8217;t hide her agitation and looked frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, what if it&#8217;s true?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Realising that he could no longer hide it, Ziggrit says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meti did not seem to know this fact. This matter was planned by Ziggrit , the leader of the heroic party and Paul, who can use magic to transfer into people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Airun ruins are a magical place that can only be breached at the cost of large numbers of lives&#8230;.they were a necessary sacrifice. It can&#8217;t be helped that people have to die for the sake of the investigation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can it be inevitable?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a pause, I countered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not talking about the legitimacy of means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am talking about the resolve of a person &#8211; a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are disqualified to be a heroic party. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you have been threatened by the servants of the Demon King, or whether you have made a promise to the Dark Eaters. You have gone astray even before you arrived here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fierce hatred lights up in Ziggrit&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Ziggrit looked agitated but he quickly cooled down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No it isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s always the people around them, not the person in question, who decide who makes a heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Ziggrit touched the breastplate of his armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you die, we can continue to be a heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do not underestimate people who are trapped and have only one path left. If there is only one path, they will try to follow that path with all their might&#8230;..even if it is the wrong path.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Silver Star》──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A reddish-black pattern appeared on Ziggrit&#8217;s armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A murderous intent was gushing out. It’s like a cornered beast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the next instant, Ziggrit&#8217;s figure blurred and disappeared. It is a high-speed movement by the blessing of the flying arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, barely able to react, parries Ziggrit&#8217;s silver claws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s companion, Paul, is unable to move as Phylicia is glaring at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice concentrated on fighting Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《White Flower》!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice scatters a snow of slashes in the orbit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Ziggrit, accelerated by the blessing of the flying arrow, is not stopped by a few slashes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku&#8230;..!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps feeling that this is the brink of victory, Ziggrit continued his tremendous onslaught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Ziggurit&#8217;s strength is about 50-50.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we have to settle this as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I enter a message into the《Networking connections》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned: tell me how to beat Ziggrit the Brave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no time for a leisurely strategy meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only send a minimal message but there was already a response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren: He is a hero with the blessing of flying arrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of this girl is still fresh in my memories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren: A mobile opponent is vulnerable to changes in terrain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she&#8217;s saying it, then there&#8217;s no doubt about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image of her that day, when she swooped down on the students with a flash of speed, is clearly burned into the back of my eyelids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, break the scaffold!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,Okay!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice replied and sheathed the 《Snow Origin》 in mid-air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then picked up the other sword she was carrying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《O Dragon》&#8230;&#8230;《my bonded contract.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her hand on the blade, Alice chanted as if she were praying to something inside the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《I will hold your pride in my heart》&#8230;&#8230;《carve your power into my sword.──》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the blade, the crest of an abandoned dragon lights up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《I now wield you》&#8230;&#8230;《Show me your power》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power of the dragon resides in the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tremendous presence emanates from the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with that sword&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice swung the sword at the frustrated Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill Release ──── 《Breath of the Abandoned Dragon》!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dragon&#8217;s breath was released, turning everything into dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit quickly transforms his armour and tries to block the breath with his huge claws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver armour turned to dust and there was nothing left to protect its body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice closes the distance in an instant against Ziggrit , who barely manages to hold on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit tried to jump back in a panic, but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Escape, this place&#8230;?”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p240-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggurit, sandwiched between debris on all sides, is frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flying arrow&#8217;s blessing loses its effect if there are obstacles in a straight line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 《Snow Origin》 was swung by Alice at Ziggrit, who had lost all his mobility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s over!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah──?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit tried to block Alice&#8217;s slash with his broken gaulet but it failed to catch the impact and blew him backwards to the wall behind him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Struck so hard that the wall cracked, Ziggrit tried to stand up, spitting blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,It’s not enough….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having lost his sword and armour, Ziggrit still tried to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t accept it&#8230;.! I can&#8217;t lose at a place like this&#8230;..! How do you think I felt when I made the decision to get my hands dirty&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit, who couldn&#8217;t hold it anymore, revealed his true feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, I finally understand this person, Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There had to be a way to do it that didn&#8217;t involve getting his hands dirty. Perhaps he would have struggled tremendously to find that way, but he would still have had a far better answer than the current status quo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, this man is no different from Meti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man is more sinful than her but the problems he has are the same as hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit Arland”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I call out the name of the devastated man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Born with a divine blessing, you were even blessed with magical and swordplay talents, growing to existence power 6 at an astonishing rate&#8230;&#8230;.in the end, it was no good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having researched information on Ziggrit beforehand, I was astonished by his resourceful way of life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in hindsight&#8230;..there were some drawbacks because of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were strong from the beginning. That&#8217;s why&#8230;you didn&#8217;t know how to rely on others.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words like that &#8211; Ziggrit&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While fighting the heroes of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, Ziggrit remembered the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two years ago &#8211; Ziggrit the Brave was impatient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was good that he had been chosen as the hero of the imperial kingdom, Ziggrit and his party were unable to achieve any results for a long time afterwards. Combined with the fact that heroic parties from other countries were active, the people of the Empire gradually began to doubt the competence of Ziggrit and his party.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘We have to&#8230;&#8230; give&#8230;.some results&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, when Ziggrit and his party were in a state of agitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Word reached their ears that monsters were active in the vicinity of the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Airun Ruins are the land of his mother country. Ziggrit thought that if the heroic party from another kingdom were to take away his achievements, it would be the end of his heroic career and he was determined to investigate the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ He couldn&#8217;t fail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So Ziggrit was prepared to get his hands dirty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He decided to see and use all 200 collaborators as pawns to be discarded. Meti was mentally fragile, so the rest of the team discussed and decided on this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During their investigation, they arrived at the throne room and discovered a suspicious device.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they reported this, it would be an achievement for the heroic party and just as they thought that, they encountered the Demon King&#8217;s subordinate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if they had witnessed the end of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit even thought that the world would be destroyed once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Ziggrit and his party were defeated by the Demon King&#8217;s subordiante and made to swear obedience but their achievement in completing the investigation of the ruins of Airun was greater than expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people of the Imperial Kingdom recognised Ziggrit as if he had turned his palm back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps their abilities grew during the investigation of the Airun ruins, but after that Ziggrit and the others performed a number of activities befitting a party of heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, they became so popular that their goods are now sold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it works now &#8211; it&#8217;s too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’ve already got their hands dirty.He already lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, he didn&#8217;t want to die, so he chose to cling to life, even if it was in a slapdash way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were strong from the beginning. That&#8217;s why you didn&#8217;t know how to rely on people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man in front of him spoke those words to him..</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Rely on people?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When, where and by whom am I supposed to turn to?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If I could be saved just by relying on someone, I wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble. &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When I was investigating the ruins of Airun and now when I am being forced to cooperate with the Demon King&#8217;s subordinates, if I could solve the problem just by bowing to someone, I would bow to them as much as possible.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The act of relying on others is not so universal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit thought so, but──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘My idea was &#8230;&#8230; wrong, you say?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit become doubtful.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How did this man get to this point?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit knows it when he sees it. This man is not very strong. However, from the way he stood there in this danger zone, he could sense that he had been through a lot of rough patches.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did this man arrive here by relying on someone else?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to believe in the face of it all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hard to believe, but this man definitely has a power he doesn&#8217;t have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that means relying on others…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This guy is a natural enemy to the &#8230;&#8230; strong’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a weak idea to try to rely on someone else in times of need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a weak person&#8217;s way of thinking to rely on others in times of crisis. This is an idea that is difficult to grasp for the strong, who spend their days affirming their talents and working hard their own talents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So now Ziggrit has been caught off guard by this man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man is a natural enemy for the strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he can also be a salvation for the strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He will show the strong who have forgotten how to rely on others. The option of relying on others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can help, please&#8230;&#8230;help me..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he thinks it is impossible anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit told the man in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Help me &#8211; Ziggrit, who told me this in front of me, turned his gaze somewhere else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of the dimly lit room. If I look carefully, I can see an altar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a rule that sacrifices are offered on that altar. If I don&#8217;t put anything on the altar, the Dark Eaters will appear in a few minutes for breaking the rule&#8230;&#8230;At &#8230;.. that moment, they will kill me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting down on the floor, Ziggrit&#8217;s lips were drawn back as he said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is already prepared to die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and her friends are ready for battle, wary of the appearance of the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of you, stay out of this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told this to my companions, they nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing could be heard, a silent moment passed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then &#8211; darkness stirred before our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Violation』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are swallowed up in a vortex of killing intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stabbing, strangling, bludgeoning, slaughtering, crushing, poisoning, slashing, shooting &#8211; all kinds of death simultaneously. The pressure was so heavy that if I was distracted for even a moment, I would lose consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A presence that could destroy the world has appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark Eaters”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only I, the only one accustomed to the pressure of being outranked, was able to look directly at the Dark Eaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters were about to kill Ziggrit at any moment, but they stopped just in time when they noticed me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;..You again?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I’m interrupting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yeah. we are being disturbed. But&#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blackness drifted close to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped Alice with my eyes as she tried to pull her sword from its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We thought of you before&#8230;&#8230;but you smell familiar. The opposite of us&#8230;&#8230;.Aaaa, yes, I remember&#8230;&#8230;. maybe it&#8217;s the smell of Luminous.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ルミナス</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater mumbled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the name is Luminous, I can only think of one thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Light Spirit Luminous. It&#8217;s a spirit I encountered and befriended during an adventure a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Luminous is my friend, but&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Heee. That one that made a friend?&#8230;&#8230; interesting.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eater sounded a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, I remember that Eri once said, [The spirits are frightened of you!]. Was it because they had sensed the presence of Luminous?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, the Dark Eaters are listening to what I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s cut to the chase before they change their mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark Eaters. You seem to be having your powers sucked out of you at the moment, what will ultimately happen to you if you keep getting sucked out?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We will be disappearing.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater announced their own disappearance in no uncertain terms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were aware of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──The Dark Eaters do not use sacrifices to recover their energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never heard of a single instance in my past of a spirit eating a person. If there were such cases, people would be more wary of spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eater, whose power is continually being sucked, will eventually disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you disappear, the numerous orders that exist in this castle will no longer be protected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It doesn&#8217;t matter. If order is destroyed by order, that is also order. We&#8217;ve seen people&#8217;s society here. We understand that much.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s quite a profound thing to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I could hear what I wanted to hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Existing promises can be overridden by new promises &#8211; Now, I wanted to know this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark eater. I&#8217;m sorry to bother you but can you make one promise to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aaa, sure. You&#8217;re worthy. Luminous smells weirdly strong and We’re kind of intrigued.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know by what criteria they like it, but it&#8217;s convenient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like order, don&#8217;t you? &#8230;&#8230;Shall I introduce you to the best lawyers in the world?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Houuuu?!!』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater bites plainly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not for free, of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In exchange, I want you to renege on your promise regarding the sacrifice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Okay.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Negotiations began here but contrary to my expectations, the Dark Eaters accepted in an instant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surprisingly, you agreed so fast.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Order being destroyed by order is also order. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we don&#8217;t feel anything about order being destroyed. We decided that our order would be better preserved if we made a promise to you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, and I agree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they continue to keep their promise regarding the sacrifice, the Dark Eaters will eventually disappear and they will have to break all the other promises they have kept so far. But if they make a promise to me here, the Dark Eaters will not be extinguished and they can continue to keep the promises they have kept so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Destroying an order with an order is also an order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the Dark Eaters wanted to destroy the promise that would eventually extinguish them with other promises. The promise I proposed met that demand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the outside, the Dark Eaters, whose existence is unstable, seem to be self-sufficient but they surely find comfort in living within their limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We’re getting excited&#8230;.. 』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were very happy to be introduced to the legal profession. The dark eater pondered for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You&#8217;re a spirit bottle user, aren&#8217;t you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly the dark eater moves its body towards Eri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, is it useless&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No, it&#8217;s rather good. The lower class of spirits, as you call them, are inconvenient and have too much time on their hands. You can bottle up as much as you like and take it with you. The spirits with you seem to be having a lot of fun.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the spirits in Eri&#8217;s jars are happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a fact we can&#8217;t feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『can you give me one of those bottles?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?&#8230;&#8230;aa, yes. Here you go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri was puzzled and gave the empty bottle in front of the dark eater.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A particle of darkness lifts the bottle and enters it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We&#8217;ll give you a piece of us.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters placed the bottle on my palm.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p252-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a little darkness swirling in the bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『When your life is in danger or when you call out to me, a part of me will protect you as best I can. Let&#8217;s make that promise.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unexpected turn of event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems too big to be called a pick-up&#8230;&#8230;. At any rate, the opponent is a dark spirit, a dark eater, who easily killed an adventurer with an existence power of 7.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to be adventuring with some of the Dark Eaters from now on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s both encouraging and frightening. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『We’ll have the legal referrals done by tomorrow.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s another promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters&#8217; presence disappears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I&#8217;ll be dead if I don&#8217;t introduce a lawyer to the Dark Eaters by tomorrow&#8230;.Nothing wrong with that. I will be able to introduce him in a few hours, if not tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, I guess that clears up the whole dark eater thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Ziggrit, who is sitting on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit. I saved you, just like you told me to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told the stunned Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit has plenty of time to spare──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..haha.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He laughs unreliably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has no choice but to laugh. The expression on his face was one of relaxed tension.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve successfully foiled Ziggrit&#8217;s plot and secured the girl who was kidnapped. There is only one thing left to do. The clue to the Demon King.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here on, we will fulfil the true objective of our heroic party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit. Tell me about the Demon King&#8217;s subordinate that you encountered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I call out to Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..he almost looks like a human being.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit speaks out in halting tones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A muscular man dressed in black. He has a mane of brown hair and ferocious eyes&#8230;&#8230;If he hadn&#8217;t claimed to be a servant of the Demon King, I would have thought he was that&#8230;&#8230;.but that mighty power he has, I could only conclude he is a beastman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit said with a slight tremble of his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we frowned when we heard the information Ziggrit had mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me some more details. Like the fine clothes&#8230;..and the tone of voice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may have seemed somewhat overexaggeration, but he spoke maturely. The black garments were of thin fabric, revealing the shape of his muscles and his tone was apparently very rough and heroic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;But that&#8217;s not how a Demon King&#8217;s subordinate look, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit looks doubtful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently this wasn&#8217;t just my opinion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, Phylicia and Kirch are also almost certain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit was defeated and not by the Demon King&#8217;s subordinate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The one you encountered was Yggdrasil…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain-Yggdrasil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was the man we encountered in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair.</p>
