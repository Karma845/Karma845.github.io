<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Ned’s Style and the Art of Adventure</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At last, the day of departure from the Kingdom of Enuvidia arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“w,we&#8217;re finally leaving&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says with a nervous look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The location is at the outside gardens of the royal castle. Many citizens had gathered to celebrate the departure of their hero party. Some of the more excitable citizens wanted to approach us but the guards managed to hold them back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice-chan, hang in there~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia-oneesama~! Look at me~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch~! With your muscles, you can defeat the Demon King~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three were met with cheers from all three sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Alice and her team had firmly captured the hearts of the people with their performance in the selection test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was Alice, a girl who made people want to love her, Phylicia, a woman who was well built and looked at with admiration by both men and women, and Kirch, who for some reason was gaining enthusiastic popularity with some men. It&#8217;s good for the heroic party that the characters are well established.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is a problem, it is my presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi&#8230;..is there a weird guy in the mix?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s Ned or whatever he&#8217;s called, he&#8217;s a grade A adventurer, but he doesn&#8217;t look&#8230;..like one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people who had been shining their eyes at Alice and the others, gave me a stink eye.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m nobody, so it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I myself am used to people looking down on me. But I don&#8217;t want their dissatisfaction to grow and be directed at Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you just make fun of Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have a blind spot in your eye. You&#8217;ll regret saying that later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From somewhere I heard voices defending me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On closer inspection, it was the adventurers who were defending me. Apparently, the adventurers didn&#8217;t hate me because I used to frequent the guild.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were arguing furiously and eventually it devolved into a scuffle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi! What are you two fighting about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May rushed to stop the men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May hurriedly to stop the men and as I watched May&#8217;s back as she moved away, Riese smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so popular.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.If you can Riese, please stop them too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m an adventurer, not a knight, so I have no obligation to stop them. It&#8217;s just&#8230;&#8230; scuffle. I think May-tono probably feels the same way.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it can&#8217;t be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so and looked at May──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, come on! Stop fighting&#8230;..Okay, do it. Hit that man.….I told you to stop fighting&#8230;&#8230;! Oi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May has changed a lot since we first met. Why is that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I&#8217;m going to explain to you about what&#8217;s going to happen now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cleared my mind and said to my party members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Airun Ruin is a huge ruin in the Empire of Eisu. We are now heading for the city of Redas, which is closest to the ruins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">エイス皇国</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is a long way to Redas . We have to cross several mountains, so it would be better to take the air route rather than the land route.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then that&#8217;s where this misstress comes in!　I&#8217;ll dragonize myself and carry you there!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia, who was nearby, said in full motivation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I shake my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I appreciate the sentiment, but this time I have to reject it. I&#8217;ve already called in the legs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after I explained this, a large shadow fell over the garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear a rustle of wings from above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the wind, a green wyvern descended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the wyvern lands, a girl on its back comes down in front of me. Her semi-long, habitual brown hair swung softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, good to see you, Ishna.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">イシュナ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After exchanging greetings with my long-time friends, I turned to Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we&#8217;ll ride this wyvern all the way to Redas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna said this, but for some reason Alice and the others remained rigid with their eyes widened at the wyvern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kohon. As the adviser, I have one last important thing to tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese deliberately cleared her throat and announced to Alice and the others.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you are surprised by everything Ned does, there is no end to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;it seems so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah,&#8230;.. We&#8217;ll try our best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch have a complicated look on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had told them in advance that I would provide the means of transport, but it seems that they did not expect wyverns would be used.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Ishna looks at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must be Alice Feldrant, the hero of this country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyah, hyai! I&#8217;m so happy to meet you today!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; what a peculiar girl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t mind it. I mean, most of the people I know about Ned are just weird.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not true&#8230;&#8230;maybe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, get in. I&#8217;ll get you there in no time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna leads Alice and the others to the back of the wyvern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Rushia, who had been glaring at the wyvern with a frown on her face, spoke up.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;this mistress is more beautiful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa!?—My WaiWai is more beautiful than you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The naming sense is not beautiful, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new bickering has started albeit in a strange way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-dono!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard a voice calling me from far away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, a man in a white coat was approaching me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heisen?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa, haaaa&#8230;.did I manage to get here in time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen, a professor on grimoire studies, regulates his ragged breathing in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen, with dark circles around his eyes, handed me a small box.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-dono. Take this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen gave a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the box, I found a magical tool similar to a communication stone inside. The difference from the communication stone is that the central stone is processed into a beautiful rectangle and there are several buttons on the frame.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──This is the prototype.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m astonished and appalled by his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It&#8217;s only been a week. How did you manage to make it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was only because the theory was generally complete. We merely provided the technology.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The technology is of a different dimension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is&#8230; fortuitous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have found the best engineers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve mailed them all the handsets, as they were supposed to. They will all be delivered in a few days&#8230;.but there are two things you need to be careful of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heisen raises his index finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One. The consumption is too intense. Once used, it takes a while for the energy to recharge, so it cannot be used continuously. Use it only when the moment is right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding, Heisen continued, also raising his middle finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Second. The amount of data to be processed is too large. The processing speed is not fast enough with the small terminal&#8230;..so I have decided to put a dedicated data processing terminal in my laboratory. I will improve it later, but if you want to use it, contact me first. If I don&#8217;t activate the processing terminal here, then the terminal is useless.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;understood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In summary, it cannot be used continuously and furthermore, Heisen must be contacted in advance when using it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, that&#8217;s the best I can do at the moment. I would have liked to be able to at least have the processing terminal running all the time, but I had to rush it because Ned-dono would have left before I could do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is good enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I need to contact Heisen in advance, it makes it difficult to use it during an emergency. But in the first place, I never had the slightest idea that this tool would take shape. For me, it&#8217;s more than enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I will use it when the time comes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. You&#8217;re welcome to make use of it. ─It is a magical tool only for Ned-dono.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he had dark circles around his eyes, his eyes lit up with strong enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I got to know this man at the Valour Festival, I decided to ask him to develop a certain magical tool that I had been thinking about for a long time. I thought it would be difficult because the product was unique, but contrary to my expectations, Heisen gave it to me in just one week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. This tool will surely come in handy for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thanking Heisen again, I looked towards Ishna and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look! Look at those claws!　These streamlined beauties! My WaiWai is more beautiful!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This mistress&#8217;s nails are more noble!　Look at their white brilliance! They have elegance!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna and Lucilla were still arguing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to get going soon&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned! Do you think WaiWai-kun is more beautiful than her, don&#8217;t you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!! Tell them honestly! I am more beautiful than that, right?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was a choice between two options, neither of which should have been chosen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To their recklessness, I think for a moment before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Comparing dragons and wyverns is nonsense, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two girls pulled their lips into a tight line and a straight face. They wanted to say, [That&#8217;s not what we wanted to hear].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I do not have a motto of an other-oriented approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a smooth talker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we’re off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We boarded the wyvern and felt the wind on our face as we slowly rose to the skies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia, looking up at me from the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, Phylicia, Kirch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia, who had called out the names of each member of the heroic party, announced in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“─ ─ I wish you all the best of luck!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#230;she’s a beautiful and pure princess, isn’t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m glad to be a part of this kingdom&#8217;s hero party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch and Phylicia took Rushia&#8217;s encouragement to heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wyverns speed up gently. In no time, the view of the royal city became distant and the horizon faraway could be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It has amazing speed. &#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says excitedly to the wyvern, which is moving forward, slashing through the wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san, what is she like? What kind of person is she?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia asked, looking at Ishna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ishna＝Montan. Manipulative Driving Master.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(イシュナ＝モンターン。操そう駆く師しだ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Manipulative Driving….?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s one of the professions in the Ostrock Federation. I&#8217;ll give you a quick summary, it&#8217;s a job where you ride a monster and transport people and things. Ishna&#8217;s wyvern flights are famous because they&#8217;re fast and reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(オスロック)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Federation of Ostrock is a country in the centre of the continent. It is surrounded by three countries &#8211; the Kingdom of Enuvidia, the Amdo Empire and the Kingdom of Eisu, which is the destination of this trip and in addition, it faces the sea. In any case, logistics is flourishing, which has given rise to a transport industry such as that of the manipulators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I relied on Ishna instead of Rushia for transport this time is simply due to their difference in experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Air travel is not easy. You have to fly higher in order to cross mountains, you have to know in advance where safe rest points are, as you can&#8217;t keep your strength up if you keep flying all the time. You also need to change your route depending on the weather and wind speed of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna is a professional in transporting people and goods in wyverns. She can solve all these problems easily and effortlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t know you could ride a wyvern&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice murmured as she lightly stroked the wyvern&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wyvern emits a curl and a whine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can only ride a wyvern on an Ishna wyvern flight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wyverns, unlike dragons, are said to be incapable of reason. Only Ishna can tame a wyvern to this extent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although dragons may be faster at maximum speed, they have the disadvantage that their large bodies make them difficult to manoeuvre around and they have to be careful about landing on the ground. On the other hand, wyverns are not as large and can be dismounted in town. Wyverns are better suited for transportation purposes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This wyvern &#8230;&#8230; is pretty strong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch muttered in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Ishna, who was in front of him, turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My WaiWai, will never fight you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna said, glaring lightly at Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are monsters in the world who hate fighting, no matter how strong and feared they are. I became a manipulator to make room for those monsters&#8230;..I know you didn&#8217;t do it on purpose, but please don&#8217;t associate my monsters with fighting if you can help it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I understand. I will bear that in mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch looked remorseful and bowed deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air travel by the wyvern lasted for several hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wyvern was apparently one of the fittest of all the wyverns used by Ishna. We only have two rest stops. At one of them, we had lunch, which we had prepared in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A short time later, we arrived in Redas, a city on the frontier of the Imperial Kingdom of Ais.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess that&#8217;s it for me then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Redas was a small town surrounded by stone walls. Ishna parks the wyvern in front of it and drops us off one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh!　If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to give you something in return&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s very kind of you. But I&#8217;m just doing my job, so as long as I get paid, I&#8217;m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my fare on the palm of Ishna&#8217;s hand when she told me this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will continue to rely on Ishna, especially when I travel long distances across the country. Is everyone else ok with that too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others immediately nodded their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The convenience of the Wyvern flight seemed to be clearly understood by all of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, don&#8217;t be reckless.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna says to me in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. We&#8217;re Ishna&#8217;s customers, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t mean it like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishna&#8217;s lips twitched in a somewhat tired manner and she let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you need any help, call me anytime. I&#8217;ll come flying in anytime, anywhere for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was grateful when she said those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thanked her honestly with a [thank you], Ishna looked away with a slightly embarrassed [hmm] and took off with the wyvern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing Ishna and Wyvern off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we&#8217;d better get going too&#8230;&#8230;.beyond that barrier is Redas .”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I headed for the town with Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Redas is a small town. However, it had a rather ostentatious barrier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop, who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A guard stares at us in front of the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are the Heroic Party from the Kingdom of Enuvidia. We wish to investigate the ruins of Airun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A hero party?&#8230;&#8230;I heard that, indeed, a new one has been formed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew this would happen and this is how a party of unproven heroes can be treated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard looked at us with a [hmm] in his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But even if you’re a hero party, if you don&#8217;t have a pass, I can’t let you all enter&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled a document out of my pouch and showed it to the guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s authentic. You can go through&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard returned back the documents and we passed through the barrier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th, there was such a thing as a pass&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, a little further away from the barrier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The only reason why outsiders bother to visit this city is because they have business in the Airun  Ruins. But the ruins of Airun are an unusual and dangerous place, so a special barrier has been set up to repel untrustworthy visitors.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I didn&#8217;t realise that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slightly different danger lurks in the Airun ruins than in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest. The danger may, at worst, extend to the city&#8217;s inhabitants, so it is understandable that they are careful and delicate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, even if it is dangerous, as long as we don&#8217;t enter the ruins, there is no problem. There are quite a few tourist spots here, so it&#8217;s okay to let off steam in town.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Alice, whose shoulders are a little tense, I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After that we will go and get permission to do an investigation of the ruins, then we will find an Inn to stay..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told them this, Phylicia and Kirch looked impressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like our adventure is going pretty well, thanks to you, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. If not for&#8230;Ned, it would have taken ten days to leave the Kingdom of Enuvidia. Even at the barrier, we would have been stranded for a few days before we managed to enter this place&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled at their words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because this is all I can do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to fighting, I have to rely on the three of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that, I&#8217;m just doing my part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we passed the barrier and entered Redas, we could faintly smell the fields. The ground was hard earth, the houses were wooden and bare rocks were placed in places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a town that&#8217;s at one&#8230;..with nature. It looks like &#8230;&#8230; my hometown.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch mutters at the sight before him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch’s home of the Demon Tribe is on the eastern continent. I have never been to that land, which is overrun by monsters called demons, but it is said to have a similar landscape to here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you ever been here before, Ned-san&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it&#8217;s my first time. I&#8217;ve got some information about the city from people I know beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I&#8217;ve never been to a place myself, usually someone I know has. Hearing from that person can make my adventure more efficient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;ve learnt from my previous adventures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys are travellers?　Come on by.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While walking down the street, the owner of a general shop approached me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the usual medicines and stationery, maps and souvenirs are on display. The shop seems to be targeting tourists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goods here can be found&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked at the goods at the very front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A doll of a man with a silver sword is lined up in a narrow space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That doll must be Ziggrit, the hero of this kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(ジグリット)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Kingdom of Ais also sends a party of heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the hero is Ziggrit. This man&#8217;s exploits are remarkable and world-famous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were many goods lined up for Ziggrit and his friends. They seem to have won the hearts of the imperial people as a hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Co, could we be like this for our country?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It will be&#8230;&#8230;. I mean, it&#8217;s already happening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?] Alice tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the Festival of Valour, Alice has gained immense popularity among the Enuvidia people. Unofficially, stuffed animals and costumes modelled on Alice have already been sold. According to a souvenir shop I know, sales have been brisk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They also have a book available. This is &#8230;&#8230; 『Interesting aspects of the exiled Kingdom of Airun 』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia said, looking at the bookshelf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a bestseller book in this kingdom. At first glance it looks like a guidebook but it&#8217;s a storybook and reads like an entertaining novel. I recommend the Prosperity section and the Decline and Fall section.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seller explains in a good mood. The seller himself must like the book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do you like it, would you like to buy it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;ve got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words, the shopkeeper rolls his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, on the other hand, looks at me with sparkling eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha,that’s amazing, Ned-san. You have those things prepared in advance too&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;about this, it was imposed on me without my permission &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a long story to explain, so I don&#8217;t need to tell it now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to the shopkeeper and offered him money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I have some of your wound medicine?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to save as much weight as possible when using the wyvern service, so my luggage was the bare minimum. I just wanted to replenish my medicines while I was at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you go, the medicine&#8230;&#8230; Oh, yeah. I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, since you&#8217;re here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thanked him for the medicine, the shopkeeper said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lately, a lot of travellers have been going missing in this town. We city dwellers are guessing that they have gone into the ruins again without permission and got lost, or that they have easily entered the nearby forest and been attacked by monsters, but&#8230;&#8230;you should be careful too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at the shopkeeper&#8217;s warning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there going to be trouble&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could be. Let&#8217;s be on the lookout, just in case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether this smell is related to the Demon King is unknown at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Well, here we are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped when I saw the building in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Redas branch of the Ruins Management Department. We&#8217;ll get permission to investigate the Airun ruins here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of us, tourists were entering and leaving the building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This building also provides tourist information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do you get permission to investigate&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered Alice&#8217;s question succinctly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You fight the examiner and win.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we visited the Ruins Management Department, we immediately went to the front counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist smiles affably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you here for sightseeing?　You can book a guide over there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not here for sightseeing, I want to do some research.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist&#8217;s eyes change when I tell her simply what I want to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Research?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A piercing stare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt the air instantly tense. I looked and saw that the other receptionists nearby were also looking at me with a somewhat nervous look on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I’ve been contacted by the guards. Are you a hero party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist muttered quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By investigation, do you mean going inside those ruins?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.We want to check what&#8217;s going on inside the ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding, the receptionist gave us a quick look at our appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would like to warn you, the ruins of Airun is not a place that even a party of heroes should feel comfortable entering. After all, it is a magical place where even adventurers of Existence Power 7 could not return alive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice spills a small voice of doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Anyway, if you&#8217;re here to investigate, I&#8217;ll put you in touch with someone who can help you. Please wait a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist then went behind the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, a rough hard-looking man arrives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting. I&#8217;m the examiner, Grouse. I will now show you to the examination room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(グロウス)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The test is a mock battle. We will confirm whether you have the ability to explore the ruins of Airun. The test can be exempted if you have a record of having trodden the five great ruins or if you have your lord&#8217;s permission, but so far no one has actually been able to exempt themselves. So the easiest way is to beat us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After explaining that much, Groth turns his gaze towards us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;This is a question that has nothing to do with the examination, but why is a party of heroes from another country investigating the ruins of Ayloon?　&#8217;As for the connection with the Demon King,Ziggrit-sama has already investigated that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just have some thoughts. There is no deep meaning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a question that could not be answered very honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial hero Ziggrit might possibly have missed a clue about the Demon King. But for the imperial people of Eisu who adores Ziggrit , that line of dialogue would sound like an insult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“aah, um&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice calls out to Grouse with a sly smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard that the ruins of Airun were such that even an adventurer with Existence Power 7 could not return alive&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? What, you didn&#8217;t know that? Then I&#8217;ll tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse thought for a moment, as if to organise his words, and then spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About seventy years ago. There was a kingdom here called the Kingdom of Airun. The Dark Eater was a spirit who liked to make promises to people and saw those promises as absolute. One day, however, the king of the Kingdom of Airun broke his promise to the Dark Eaters. As a result, the Dark Eaters were furious and the kingom was destroyed in just one night. That was the Airun Ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse explained the origins of the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Airun Ruins are the remnants of that kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Dark Eaters still live in the Airun Ruins. And they are still faithfully keeping the many promises they made seventy years ago. As long as you don&#8217;t enter the&#8230;&#8230; ruins, the Dark Eaters won&#8217;t touch you. However, unable to bear the horror of the situation, the Imperial Government has requested adventurers with a power of existence of 7 to defeat the Dark Eaters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice gulped and swallowed her spit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I overheard the result from the receptionist earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The adventurer is dead. His corpse had not retained its original form.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Existence Power 7 is the most powerful human being in the world, one of only ten in the world. The fact that one of them is dead is not an easy fact to accept&#8230;..that he was defeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since then, the Airun Ruins has become inviolable territory for us&#8230;&#8230;.but that changed two years ago. Monster activity in the vicinity of the Airun Ruins led to suspicions of a connection between the Ruins and the Demon King, and a party of heroes led by Ziggrit-sama investigated the Ruins&#8230;&#8230;As a result of the investigation, it was found that there was no connection between the Airun Ruins and the Demon King. &#8230;..Ziggrit-sama is a really strong person. He bravely pushed through those terrible ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse spoke somewhat proudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, his expression soon turned shadowy and he said</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Well, two hundred adventurers who helped with the investigation died then as well. Not only that, but one of Ziggrit-sama’s companions also died.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others gasped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words &#8211; one of the hero party has died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s a stranger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Dark Eaters are extremely dangerous spirits. Ziggrit-sama managed to get out alive, but he did not defeat or neutralise the Dark Eaters&#8230;.so as far as I&#8217;m concerned, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend an investigation. If you really want to investigate, you&#8217;ll have to show me you&#8217;re reasonably good. I don&#8217;t want to see any unnecessary deaths.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse led us out of the building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked out onto a neatly cleared square. I look closely, I can see scorch marks and cracks in the ground. These are the marks of the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were four men and women gathered there, besides Grouse. Each of them is armed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Including me, all five of us here are A-level adventurers. In addition, there are two with existence power 5. If&#8230;&#8230;you can defeat all of us, I&#8217;ll give you a permit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would be the test for getting permission to investigate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From this point onwards, it&#8217;s not up to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it won&#8217;t be a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All three of you, I can trust you, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say, trusting Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,Yes&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice expressed her desire to live up to the trust with her whole body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I sort of expected it, but you&#8217;re not the hero, are you? If that&#8217;s the case&#8230;..is it you with the axe on your back?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;No, not me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch shakes his head in response to Grouse&#8217;s gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It,it&#8217;s me. I’m the hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice raised her hand hesitantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; you, the hero?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,Yes! My name is Alice Feldrant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The five examiners looked at Alice with quizzical eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiner in his armour suit, standing next to Grouse, muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little nostalgic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, this is what would happen. Alice&#8217;s appearance gives no indication of her strength. Her body is thin and she looks feeble, giving the impression that she is not suited to combat. She is full of motivation at the moment but she looks like a child being overzealous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter. We&#8217;ve got some experience. Don&#8217;t hesitate to come at us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right….then I shall begin&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiner said to Alice with the intention of lending her his chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, the actual position is the opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is Alice who lends her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice muttered briefly and at the same time swung her sword with blinding speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no wasted movement at all. The girl, who looked like a frail child, unleashed a master&#8217;s single flash of the sword that gave goosebumps just by being close to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this bizarre sight, the examiners stiffened as if time had stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiner&#8217;s armour was cut in half and fell to the ground with a clatter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,Oi&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay alert. This girl is the real deal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiners quickly switched and prepared for battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Thunder Force: Heavy Bombardment》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(サンダー・フォース.雷勢砲)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wizard unleashes a barrage of lightning gushing from the tip of her staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s good with her magic&#8230;&#8230;she&#8217;s probably one of the examiners who has the Existence Power Level 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Alice and her friends evade this with agile movements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after the lightning passes, Kirch runs in a straight line towards the examiner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His coming! Ready your shields!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the examiners tries to intercept Kirch with a large shield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was a bad move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Axe of Execution》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The harder the opponent, the more powerful the axe, which is Kirch&#8217;s special weapon, is. The axe swung horizontally and shattered the large shield with ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu──!!!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shards of the shattered shield dazzled the examiners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Alice dived into the bosom of the examiners and flashed her blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her aim is the weapons held by the examiners. With a flash of Alice&#8217;s blade, the examiners each drop their swords, spears and staffs. The basket handles that had encircled both of Grouse&#8217;s hands were cleanly severed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The test is not over yet…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse tried to rush to pick up the weapon on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before he could reach for it, an arrow pierced the front of the weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you still want to continue the test?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, her left eye covered in purple smoke, glared at the examiners as she held the arrow in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I give up, I give up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse opens his hands and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My goodness, that&#8217;s quite a feat. I hate to admit it, but you&#8217;re as strong as the likes of Ziggrit-sama and his party”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Grouse says they will not win, Ziggrit must be very strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A swordsman and an axe-user&#8230;..and that young lady over there, is she a bow-user?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grose asked, looking at Phylicia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m a healer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A healer? Despite that, you showed no signs of healing&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t seem that I have to use it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Phylicia says this, Grouse is momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he immediately bursts out laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, no difference!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Laughing broadly, Grouse then looks at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Alice, isn&#8217;t it?&#8230;..Honestly, I had my doubts when I saw that you were a hero, but now I can believe you&#8230;.. how much is your Existence Power?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, its &#8230;&#8230;5.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“5!?!　Liar!　You can&#8217;t possibly be the same as me with that strength!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse exclaimed in astonishment.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I knew it, she hadn&#8217;t reliased it yet&#8230;..’　</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the bewildered Grouse, I&#8217;m convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, Alice looked back at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You may not be aware of it, &#8230;&#8230; but you&#8217;re probably at presence six.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?Re,Really?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because at the time of the Valour Festival, you are pretty strong for an existence power of 5&#8230;&#8230; probably went up when you fought in the Abandoned Dragon&#8217;s Nest. I’ll have your existence power measured again next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese also referred to Alice at the Valour Festival as [an existence force of 5, as close to an existence force of 6].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeating the Abandoned Snake in the final test would have broken through another barrier of existential power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you, Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations Alice&#8230;.now, we can&#8217;t lose&#8230;..either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch praise Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was delighted, but turned her head downwards in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, boy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse looks at me and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have been standing on the sidelines since a while ago, but just because I gave the other three a permit doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give you one too. What are you going to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I can&#8217;t join the fight, but I brought this instead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took an envelope from my pouch and handed it to Grouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking one of the documents in the envelope, Grouse&#8217;s eyes widen as he examines its contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,The record of the five major sites that have been traversed&#8230;..?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse&#8217;s hand shook as he held the document.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute!　You&#8217;re telling me you&#8217;ve just trudged through the&#8230;&#8230;Aerial Temple?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It was a lot of work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it was!　It&#8217;s as dangerous as the ruins of Airun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first day I met Rushia, I told her about my adventure to the Aerial Temple and she was very happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Aerial Temple is famous for being overrun with powerful monsters but the most difficult part is the way to get to it. The temple in the sky is surrounded by a variety of flying monsters and if an inexperienced adventurer tries to get too close, they will be devoured in mid-air. Because of these characteristics, it was chosen as one of the five most difficult sites in the world to traverse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the criteria for being selected as one of the Five Great Monuments are the difficulty of traversing the site and its tourist appeal. The Aerial Temple met the latter criterion for its scenic quality. The Airun Ruins may be on par with the Aerial Ruins in terms of difficulty of traversing alone but unfortunately its tourist attractions are not that great. The Airun Ruins are bloody and dark, ruins filled with raw history rather than romantic romance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I&#8217;d be happy if you gave me a permit too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I&#8217;ll do it. I&#8217;ve never seen a record of the five major&#8230;..ruins been traversed before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse carefully handed the envelope back to me as if it were fragile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you&#8230;&#8230;why didn&#8217;t you show this to me from the start? If I had read that tread record, I wouldn&#8217;t have done the test in the first place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, this is something I stepped through with another party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see] Grouse nodded and agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that is not the only reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And &#8230;&#8230; this isn&#8217;t going to be enough to convince you, is it?　Because apparently Redus is being held responsible for the damage at the Airun Ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse raised his eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ruins of Airun is a dangerous place and adventurers have a nasty habit of willingly going to such dangerous places. As a result, casualties continued to occur.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, as the number of casualties at the ruins of Airun continued to increase, some people began to whisper that this might be due to a lack of management by the inhabitants of Redus. Although the rumour had no basis, there were not a few who believed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People in Redas take life lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a time when it was said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why the inhabitants prepared a strict barrier and created this kind of examination system that emphasises competence. In order to stop as many people dying as possible and at the same time to prove that they are trying to reduce the number of victims to the maximum extent possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given their circumstances, Alice and her party should show what they are capable of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This test is a rule they have set up to protect themselves. I want to follow them as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there are some non-negotiable circumstances here and there, so I was allowed to use the documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I appreciate your concern.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse said with a gentle smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The examination is now over. Our business is done for the time being.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We entered the  Ruins Management Department building again to get a permit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, take your permits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse, standing behind the counter, hands over the permits for the four of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, are you aware of the dangers of the Airun Ruins?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered Grouse&#8217;s question after thinking about it for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I have some knowledge&#8230;..but to be honest, I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi. Are you going to be alright? I&#8217;m telling you, we can&#8217;t help with your investigation. We&#8217;re scared.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse can honestly and openly say that he is afraid of the Airun Ruins because, as shameful as it is to say so, it is a terrifying place. There is no shame in fearing the &#8230;&#8230;.Dark Eaters of the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just to be sure, can you share with us some of Ziggrit-sama&#8217;s research material?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not possible. The information about the Airun Ruins is centrally managed by  Ziggrit-sama. It&#8217;s still dangerous there, so Ziggrit-sama made sure that adventurers wouldn&#8217;t carelessly enter.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Centralised managed?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit and his party are supposed to be on a journey to defeat the Demon King but in parallel with that, he is going to manage the information on these Airun Ruins?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is a hero who is very careful or&#8230;..concerned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. understand. I’m going to prepare it on my own, no problem.&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Self-prepared? &#8230;&#8230;well, that&#8217;s okay, I gave you a permit. You can do whatever you want from here on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse looked at me strangely, but nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yeah, if you want information about the ruins, I recommend this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Grouse hands Alice a book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was 『Interesting aspects of the exiled Kingdom of Airun 』, which I had seen in the general shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The book was written by a well-known archaeologist. It also describes the dangers of the Dark Eaters. It should give you some knowledge.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice received the book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice gazes at the cover and Grouse puts on a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be extra careful. The ruins are not a place where you just have to be strong to survive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse finally advised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see this book a lot. I saw it for sale in the souvenir shop next to the front desk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because the author is famous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we leave the administration building, Phylicia mutters something and I explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The author of the book is the youngest person ever to have been affiliated with the World Scientific Research Organisation, the most prestigious academic institution in the world. And she didn&#8217;t get there by legitimate means but by being held on half-heartedly to a theory that the institution was advocating, which she twisted head-on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The World Academic Research Organisation is an academic institution that transcends national boundaries to address global issues. It brings together the best academics and researchers from around the world, where original, large-scale research is conducted on a daily basis that no other organisation could ever hope to emulate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it plainly, it is a haven for geniuses. Wisdom King Lucas who I once relied on, also belongs to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The author of the book is more than a genius, as she is the youngest person ever to be held in that den.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, there is such an amazing person &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked at the cover of the book with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s quite amazing that Alice was chosen to be a Hero&#8230;..She doesn&#8217;t seem to be aware how important it is for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; By the way, Ned. Earlier, when you were talking about the research material by the Hero Ziggrit, you said you would prepare it on your own&#8230;..what did you mean by that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch asks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ruins is a special environment. This time I&#8217;ve decided to prepare a helper&#8230;&#8230;she should be nearby by now, so I&#8217;ll call her up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activated the communication stone and contacted the person I was looking for and received an immediate reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell her that I am near the Ruins Management Department and she tells me that she will be on her way immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes later, a woman with red hair appeared in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, hello! Ned, it&#8217;s been a while!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, long time no see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman approached us, looking highly-strung.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san, is she&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice asks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied, pointing to her copy of 『Interesting aspects of the exiled Kingdom of Airun 』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, the archaeologist. The author of that book.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(エーリ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others stiffen, their eyes wide open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the silence,the 『Interesting aspects of the exiled Kingdom of Airun 』book falls to the ground with a thud.</span></p>
