<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; The Imperial Hero Party</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noon the next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the inn and were soon joined by the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greetings!　I&#8217;m Eri, an archaeologist!　Pleased to meet you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri shook her bright red hair and told us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed full of energy from early in the morning. As for me, I&#8217;m a little sleepy and yawn lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve already introduced ourselves yesterday and we&#8217;ll head straight for the ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mooooooooou! Ned is as impatient as ever!　Friendship is a slow process, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I basically agree with that opinion, but it depends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am confident when it comes to building friendships, so it doesn&#8217;t need to be pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I thought we&#8217;d better hurry up, as Eri&#8217;s schedule is packed &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yes! We must hurry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri said, flabbergasted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">── Eri＝Vincent</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(エーリ＝ヴィンセント)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age, 20</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Occupation, archaeologist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Affiliation, World Scientific Research Organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scope of activities, mainly in the Imperial Kingdom of Eisu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is of normal height, but has a slightly childish face, probably because of her cheerful expression on a daily basis. She has distinctive red hair that extends to her thighs and her shorts and backpack on her back show her active personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is the archaeologist who, a year ago, academically proved that the ancient civilisation of Kalarika was not of mankind but of spirits. The truth about the ancient civilisation of Kalarika became so famous that it appeared in history textbooks and shook the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(カラリカ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, the World Scientific Research Organisation proposed that the ancient civilisation of Kalarika was a human civilisation, which Eri denied. As a result, scholars of the institute recognised Eri&#8217;s abilities and invited her to join their ranks. Those who were unaware of the situation praised the institution&#8217;s intentions, saying, [What a generous organisation to invite a woman who denied the theories into their ranks!] But in reality, they were afraid that their research would be denied at every turn if they let the Eri Vincent go unchecked. Thus, she was forced into the agency because of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Eri is a genius so great that geniuses from all over the world have raised the white flag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as for the person herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, to be honest, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with skipping a conference or two!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it carefreely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a girl who has left her mark on history, she is not obsessed with her work as a scholar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, saying things like that will make your colleagues dislike you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Ned&#8217;s fault I had to join the World Scientific Research Organisation! You are responsible for that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, Alice and the others were rolling their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, we went separate ways yesterday after only a light meeting, so I guess I didn&#8217;t explain more about Eri&#8217;s background.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri, who noticed the same thing as I did, opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I joined the World Scientific Research Organisation in the first place, in large part due to the results from Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeeee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, don&#8217;t take her seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to the astonished Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Originally I was a scholar who just wandered around the world&#8217;s ruins at my own pace. But one day, by chance, I ended up going on an adventure with Ned. &#8230;&#8230;Then, this man came into contact with the truth of all kinds of history and when I summarised it in a little thesis, my life suddenly changed!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Part of her story was also undeniable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened a lot&#8230;..at that time. Adventures that defied history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the depths of a city supposedly destroyed by a tsunami, a giant water-manipulating monster is actually lurking. In a village said to have been destroyed by a magic sword that made its owner mentally insane, there is actually no such thing as a magic sword but rather a record of a swordsman who was originally just a murderer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my influence must not be as big as Eri thinks it is.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri is brilliant to begin with. Her unusual footwork had led to a number of original views, and&#8230;&#8230; her adventures with me were just the start.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No it wasn&#8217;t!　Without Ned I would still be a mediocre scholar!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Absolutely not!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was even called a heretic at a local conference before she met me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our two sides&#8217; arguments were parallel &#8230;This exchange has been repeated many times already. Knowing that neither of us would fold, we gave up trying to persuade each other and changed the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way Ned, have you been reading the book I sent you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m reading it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, here&#8217;s a quiz. What spirit is the king who supposedly ruled the ancient civilisation of Kalarika?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;They are spirits of the earth. &#8216;I hear that the throne in the centre was formed of a special soil like no other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. You really seem to be reading it right&#8230;&#8230; Good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not[Good!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind was accumulating archaeological knowledge as I was reading the papers and books sent to me by Eri. I am surprised even at myself that I can answer the question now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May I? I became a scholar because of you, so you owe it to me to keep an eye on my activities! Please pay proper attention to me in the future!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,okay&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t dare tell her this because it might set her off but to be honest, I&#8217;m paying attention to her even if she doesn&#8217;t tell me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a lot of respect for Eri and her books are interesting. The archaeological knowledge I&#8217;ve acquired thanks to her can sometimes be used in chatting with people.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to try to help Eri during my research at the Airun Ruins. As you can see, she has a difficult personality, but she&#8217;s very competent and has a good track record.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One word is superfluous!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We couldn&#8217;t stand around talking forever, so we moved towards the Airun Ruins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um! I read your book yesterday, Eri!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice called out to Eri as we walked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it was very interesting!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice gave her honest impression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who blushes slightly and reveals her feelings without embellishment, laughs by Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahahaha!!! Ned, your companion is quite lovely this time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agreed with Eri, who smiled good-humouredly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is one talent and a virtue to be able to tell your feelings honestly without faking them. Alice&#8217;s pure behaviour is soothing to watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Alice&#8230;&#8230;.was there anything you didn&#8217;t understand?　I can probably answer any questions you have. After all, I&#8217;m the author!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Um, just one thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice opens her mouth in a reserved manner.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of spirit is that&#8230;..Dark Eater?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question was a little vague, but Alice&#8217;s eyes were lit up with determination as she asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even for such a pure girl &#8211; Alice is a brave warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the process of investigating the ruins of Airun, there may be contact with the Dark Eaters. She will be careful but in the worst case scenario, they will turn against her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice has already considered the possibility of fighting the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to know as much information as possible about the enemies that will stand in her way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, well&#8230;..actually, that book started out with a lot more detail about the Dark Eaters, but a lot of it was cut out during the censorship process. I think that&#8217;s probably what Alice wants to know about, so&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s a bit long, but I&#8217;ll explain it from the ground up!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri smiled brightly and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To begin with, do you know anything about spirits?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;.not much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spirits are creatures that are not bound by the laws of physics, also known as conceptual life. Their forms are hazy and they are often untouchable and invisible&#8230;&#8230; One theory is that they are the beings who taught humans magic but there is currently no evidence for this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like ordinary spirits, the Dark Eaters were born without fixed contours, always unstable. That is why the Dark Eaters, unlike themselves, longed for an unchanging existence&#8230;&#8230;of order.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Order, is it &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. The Dark Eaters interpreted this thing called order as a promise. So the Dark Eaters liked to make promises to people&#8230;&#8230;the first king of the Kingdom of Airun noticed such a character of the Dark Eaters and actively made promises to them. In return, the kingdom prospered with the help of the Dark Eaters. In other words, the Kingdom of Airun and the Dark Eaters had a co-existing relationship.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters longed for order and wanted to make a promise to someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Airun at first wanted to eliminate the threat of the Dark Eaters but soon they profited from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that there was a time when the interests of both sides were aligned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But seventy years ago, the then king broke his promise to the Dark Eaters. For the Dark Eaters, who regard order as an absolute&#8230;&#8230;breaking a promise is unforgivable. So the Dark Eaters destroyed the kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and her friends gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other side has the power to destroy a country. We should not fight them. If we do, we will face the most powerful enemy ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Incidentally, can you imagine what promises the king broke back then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one could answer Eri&#8217;s question clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Alice and the others, who look at her with difficulty, Eri gives her answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The promise is that 『the royal castle must be entered through the main gate』 &#8230;&#8230;The king at the time broke this promise. I think he accidentally entered the castle through the back gate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s eyes widen when she hears Eri&#8217;s story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,that&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230;the kingdom was destroyed&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are spirits, you know. They are incompatible with human values.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For humans, such things are indifferent, but not for the Dark Eaters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters seem to have coexisted with people, but in the end they did not fit in with human culture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, they probably didn&#8217;t even want to fit in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even now that the kingdom has fallen, the Dark Eaters remain in the Airun Ruins and continue to faithfully keep the promise they once made&#8230;&#8230;.The ruins of Airun  are, in short, a trap zone, where countless traps are lurking in the name of promises made at the time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eaters still keep their promises, even though the people they promised have long since been killed by them. They only care about promises and not about the people who made them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, what was born was a danger zone where there are not enough lives to go around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri stops in her tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Twenty minutes walk from the inn. We arrived at the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;the ruins of Airun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others look at the scene before them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the huge iron fence, there was unspoilt nature and old buildings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stonework of the building is covered with moss. The scene, where nature and man-made objects are integrated into one, creates a somewhat magical atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The inside of the iron fence is the area affected by the Dark Eaters. The outside is unaffected by the Dark Eaters, so it was a space where tourists could view the ruins. However, as it is on the outskirts of the town, monsters can appear, and for this reason the Ruins Management Department has dispatched guides and guards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The area I am going to guide you to is the town&#8217;s outskirts, even within the ruins of Airun. This area, which is on the periphery of the ruins, is relatively safe as there are few promises from the Dark Eaters. To be honest, I think that even ordinary adventurers can manage to get around if they only go to the city districts.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others nodded in agreement to Eri&#8217;s explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The problem is the castle ward, which is further in. That one is far more dangerous than the city’s ward and I have yet to set foot in it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staring at the castle in the middle of the ruins, Eri said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the royal castle when Airun was once a kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the Dark Eaters originally lived in that castle. And they still live in the same place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s get to it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together with Eri, we headed for the entrance to the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two guards standing in front of the iron fence presented us with a permit to investigate the ruins. As a matter of course, Eri also has a permit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guards nodded and opened the door of the iron fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigation of the Airun Ruins begins. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, stop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyai?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as they entered the ruins, Eri said loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had been nervous, jumps up on her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There, at first glance it looks like a pathway, but it&#8217;s actually a dried up waterway. 『Do not walk through the waterway for any reason other than to do maintenance』&#8230;&#8230; Such a promise is made.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri pointed to her feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The road is also old and its shape is broken in places. However, if I look closely, I can see a faint dimple. This is not noticed until it is pointed out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was one step away from stepping into that canal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you step on it, you die, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you will die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded her head at Phylicia, who asked with a mysterious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I see. But these trap zones, what are they often referred to…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one knows what happened seventy years ago&#8230;&#8230;Is there a myriad of invisible, lethal traps here &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s what I mean. The dark eater destroyed the kingdom with so much power that there are hardly any records left from that time. It is no wonder that adventurers with an existence force of seven have died. Because all the traps lurking in this place are instant killers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the adventurers don&#8217;t know about them, they can&#8217;t deal with them, and if you can&#8217;t, the traps will be their instant death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fear that it was lurking in myriads of places lay over our bodies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spiritual creatures are usually full of these kinds of threats. They have a different strength vector to humans and monsters. So, that’s why they are irresistible”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri calmly tells us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, footsteps could be heard stamping on the grass ahead of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; monsters, there are monsters out there, too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stone statue of a winged monster was in front of you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The statue&#8217;s jaws cracked open, threatening us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a gargoyle! Be careful, its body is harder than it looks!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks hard enough, though. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Eri&#8217;s words, Phylicia calmly mutters as she turns the arrow on her bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gargoyles are monsters whose bodies are made of minerals. Its greatest feature is that it grows by eating minerals and changes its body structure accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The area was pristine and the ground was littered with stones. As it looks, this gargoyle must have grown up by eating stones. A gargoyle that has eaten stones looks like a stone statue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a non-combatant, I moved a little away from Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others start fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kirch who opened the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Axe of Execution》!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s special armament pierced his sturdy opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A huge axe crushes the gargoyle with a single blow. Stone fragments scatter and a roaring noise echoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the sound, four more gargoyles came from the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to reduce your mobility &#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice wields a pure white sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s special armament, the Snow Sect, can liquefy the slash when it is released on impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slash from the white sword hit the gargoyle&#8217;s wing. Immediately afterwards, the slash liquefies and seeps into the cracks in the gargoyle&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gargoyle&#8217;s wings were destroyed from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U–nn&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, Eri was standing next to me with her arms crossed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she watches the battle, which appears to be going well, she spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. Your companions this time&#8230;&#8230;frankly, are weaker than usual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would normally be strange to tell Alice that she is [weak] even after seeing her fight with an Existence Power of 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s not hard to understand how Eri feels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being in contact with outstanding people all the time makes Eri discern. Compared to my former companions, Eri probably feels that the current Alice and her friends are not good enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no problem. Their potential is as good as any of the others I&#8217;ve worked with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice has just reached existence power 6. Moreover, she has the ultimate special armament, which can be said to be the best in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia has also just switched from being a bowman to a healer. Besides, she has acquired full training in Tengen-ryu Archery, and it is not clear whether she really has to give up the bow&#8230;.there is still room for ingenuity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch is an extinct demon tribe. It is said that the Perishable Demons, a clan that defeats demons, have a special condition when fighting demons. If he can use his power more, he will become even stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What makes this party unique is that there is still room for improvement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of them will become stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others are already strong enough but they can still become stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,Um, That!　That gargoyle!　It’s walking on the waterway&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice pointed to a gargoyle walking along a dried-up waterway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monsters are okay!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eli tells her in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked frustrated.  I can see in her mind she wanted to shout [That’s not fair!!].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll cover you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow that Phylicia released pierced the gargoyle&#8217;s eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Alice&#8217;s slash dismembers the gargoyle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll go help you a bit..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri, who had been watching the battle, approached Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gargoyle glared at Eri as she approached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E, Eri-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I can fight too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gargoyle glared at the approaching Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is a deep connection between archaeology and spirits&#8230;&#8230;spirits existed in this world long before humanity flourished, so if you unravel human history, you will realise how people have been influenced by spirits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Eri lowered her rucksack to the ground and took out a strange object from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a belt of bottles. Eri wears the belt around her waist, with different shapes and sizes, from examiner-like to liquor bottles, hanging from it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the bottles were shimmering lights of different colours.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p072-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why they go surprisingly well together.The combination of an archaeologist and&#8230; a spirit bottle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Picking up one of the bottles hanging from her belt, Eri threw it at the gargoyle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottle hits the monster and breaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a whirlwind was born from inside the bottle, tearing the gargoyle&#8217;s hard body to shreds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Spirit bottles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Literally, a small, low-grade spirit is placed inside a bottle, which can be thrown or thrown as a grenade to simulate the power of a spirit. The principle is exactly the same as the Molotov cocktail. The only difference is that what is contained inside is not a flammable substance but a variety of spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lower spirits are closer to natural phenomena than to life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those jars are filled with whirlwinds, flames, rain clouds and swamps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha,that&#8217;s amazing&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu&#8230;this still doesn&#8217;t beat Ned on a sheer number of occasions!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was impressed and Eri was in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri throws the bottles one after the other. The explosions blew the gargoyles away and froze the ground, causing the gargoyles to fall over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Humans who fight with the help of spirits are rare but not unheard of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most major group are known as spiritists. They make a contract with a specific spirit and are endowed with the spirit&#8217;s power. However, in order to become a spirit magician, the magician needs a high level of expertise and skill, and above all, they must find a spirit that is a good match for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, a spirit bottle can be replenished with ammunition simply by finding a lower grade spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the scale of power that can be handled is smaller than that of the spiritist, it is possible to do a wide variety of things, as each bottle can contain spirits of different properties.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, the fact that archaeologists and spirit bottles go well with each other is a perfect match, but &#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, a scholar&#8217;s job is not to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, Eri&#8217;s fighting style may seem like relying on the spirit, or she fights with ease using handy weapons, but in reality there is a risk that if she makes even the slightest mistake in timing, she too can be killed by the spirit. Besides, it is difficult to put a spirit into a bottle. Even though they are lower grade spirits, they are beings beyond human knowledge. If she touches them carelessly, she could die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why Eeli&#8217;s mastery of the spirit bottle is more special.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, Eri has visited more than a hundred sites and dungeons of archaeological val</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ue. She has benefited from this experience. Having known and interacted with a wide variety of spirits, she has reached the level of a master only when it comes to dealing with low-grade spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, even if she were not an archaeologist, she would be a person who makes a living doing just that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Arara?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Eri lets out a curious voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned! I don&#8217;t know why, but the spirits are frightened of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like to know that too!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have a slightest clue even if she says it like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just to be clear, you didn&#8217;t make a contract with a higher spirit, did you!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shouldn&#8217;t have..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are times when various spells are cast without my permission, but it is unlikely that a contract has been made with a powerful spirit without permission. I hear that making a contract with a spirit requires a complicated procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm&#8230;&#8230;well, that&#8217;s fine. There are some children who seem to be alright. Would you like some help there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri put the bottle in her hand back on her belt and took the other bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“─ ─ Good! Now they&#8217;re all wiped out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for the last gargoyle, Eri froze its feet to stop it from moving, and Alice slashed it to finish it off. Both Alice and Eri are used to adventures and are able to work together flexibly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it? Are you ready to fight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes. Somehow&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least the monsters are a little weaker than those in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia looks around and states the results of her analysis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to concentrate with the dark eater restriction on my mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch muttered with difficulty and carried his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An invisible trap is a mental burden. Even if the opponent is weak, if an adventurer&#8217;s concentration is reduced, they might get caught flat-footed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When it comes to this, I wish they&#8217;d share Ziggrit’s research material.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I can agree to that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my mutterings, Eri agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I tilted my head at her acknowledgement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not even you manage to get a share of the information?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right! He says he doesn&#8217;t want to endanger the people, but he doesn&#8217;t care about us academics at all! He calls us by our names and I think he&#8217;s getting on our nerves! That hero!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s centrally managed, but&#8230;..this is more like a monopoly than management.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s true! Ziggrit is an enemy of us, the archaeologists!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri is indignant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to be very frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all very suspicious, I tell you Ned! He claims to have completed the survey but he seems to be hanging around regularly!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri continues to complain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. wait.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That statement made me wonder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does Ziggrit come here regularly?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri affirmed as a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, maybe&#8230;..he and his party will come today”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after hearing Eri&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you guys?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man in silver armour appeared in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver armour the man wears is not just a piece of armour at first glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is both beautiful and terrifying. The armour, in which these two incompatible elements coexist, is in all probability a special armour. It also has tremendous power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew this man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hero Ziggrit&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I mutter his name, Alice and the others open their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has long blue hair and silver armour. The hero Ziggrit of the Eisu Empire is glaring at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I ask you again. Who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air was tense and the skin of my entire body stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmly replied to this man, who let out an aura that wanted to kill me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are the hero party from the Kingdom of Enuvidia. We are investigating the ruins of Airun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Hero Party &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit looked doubtful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s two women behind him. One carries a bow and the other a large staff. They are Ziggrit&#8217;s companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;re the hero of the new party huh? What do you mean by investigating the ruins of&#8230;..Airun? I have already proved that these ruins have nothing to do with the Demon King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been bothering me a little. We also want to investigate on our own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll say it in a suitably deceptive way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Ziggrit showed his annoyance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you suspect that &#8230;&#8230; our investigation is flawed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His killing intent that was being emitted became even more intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s undeniable because it is true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s unpleasant, even if we are the same heroic party. Now leave this place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have nothing to be guilty of, then there should be no problem with us investigating these ruins. We are both competitors in defeating the Demon King&#8230;&#8230;and it&#8217;s rather convenient for you to waste your time doing nothing, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have the same objectives, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re the kind of friends who have unconditional and complete trust in each other. If anything, we are competitors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there is of course cooperation between hero parties but the true intention of the kingdom that dispatches their parties is, they want their own heroic parties to stand out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There should be no reason to hold us back like an obsessive person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless Ziggrit has something to be guilty about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re new and you think you&#8217;re equal to us??”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Ziggrit pulled the sword out of its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll show you how different we are…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, they disappear from view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gakin!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　and the sound of metal colliding arose in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had drawn her sword before I knew it, blocked Ziggurit&#8217;s sword, which had been right in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku, u&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was pressured by Ziggrit&#8217;s sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both are phenomenally fast. Ziggrit, in particular, is still fast even though he is clad in heavy-looking armour. The speed and the destructive power is immense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia tries to shoot an arrow to protect Alice</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before that, an enemy arrow grazed Phylicia&#8217;s cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are slow to shoot arrows.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku….!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, a huge mass of flame flew in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic. Kirch blocks the flames with his axe as they come at him, burning the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mass of flames explodes and Kirch is blown backwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch quickly holds his axe at an angle and deflects the impact upwards but he looks pained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice,Phylicia,Kirch are the qualified people in the Kingdom of Enuvidia. In the first examination, they were tested on their aspirations as heroes, in the second examination, the Festival of Valour, they were tested on their strength as heroes, and in the final examination, they achieved the difficult task of leaving a legacy of great deeds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the opponents now were no ordinary heroic party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit and his party are also the representative party of the Imperial of Eisu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you understand the difference in ability?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not yet&#8230;.!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice flashed at Ziggrit and swung her sword straight down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the trajectory of her sword misses Ziggrit</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t even know how to measure your weapon, do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit avoided Alice&#8217;s blade easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice lowered her posture, dived into his blindspot and launched a vertical swing down. As long as it was avoided, the swinging Alice&#8217;s sword would impact the ground at this rate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit readied his sword, waiting for the decisive opening that would soon come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Alice swung her sword down without a second thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin》!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, the slash that hit the ground liquefied and bounced back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flying spray of slashes hits Zigrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s slash passes through a gap in Ziggrit&#8217;s armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit rushes back, but red blood spills from her right leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;&#8230;better not get carried away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s armour deformed and his intimidation swelled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice retreats in apparent alarm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, stop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri shouted in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice stops in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment ─ ─.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ A deep darkness appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The darkness was swirling, writhing, and looking at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottomless darkness, blacker than the night sky, blocks out the sunlight that pours down, distorting the space around it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh&#8230;uuu&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unforgivable weight was placed on my entire body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Filia crouch down with pale, pallid faces. The same is true of Ziggrit&#8217;s companions, who are unable to resist the pressure of the situation. The bowman and wizard over there are also shaking with fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I regulated my breathing, I looked at the mass of darkness that had suddenly appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a strange presence that I have never felt from people and monsters I have fought before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──The Dark Eater.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew intuitively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the spirit of darkness that once destroyed a kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a symbol of the horror that still reigns in the land.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ne, Ne, Ned-ssan&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;speak.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmly say to Alice, who is about to be crushed by fear and anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Sixty-fourth order. Do not trample the flowers in the flower beds.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mass of darkness emitted a distorted snoring voice that was not human.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater seemed to have neither eyes nor mouth, but for some reason I felt that its gaze was focused on Alice&#8217;s feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Alice&#8217;s feet &#8211; there was a white flower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flower is not crushed. Alice&#8217;s feet are slightly next to the flower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;..barely stepped on』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dark Eater said this and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The darkness becomes fine particles and disappears as if melting into the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after the Dark Eaters left everyone except Ziggrit and  I crouched down, looking exhausted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, Filia and Kirch are all sweating profusely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, you can&#8217;t go on through these ruins in that state.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit sheathed his sword and told us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave. This is no place for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, Ziggrit headed towards the back of the ruins &#8211; the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Alice and the others and make up my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry, but now I have no choice but to do as he says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a temporary retreat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our steps were heavy as we left the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Partly because we were baffled by the interference by Ziggrit but also because of the impact of the Dark Eater who appeared immediately afterwards. It was so strong that the confrontation with Ziggrit  was almost completely forgotten. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Ned-san seems to be fine….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who has regained some composure, looks at me and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s an everyday thing for me to deal with higher-ranked people who are out of my league.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m always getting my share of adventures with the help of my friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poison demon dragon that was tormenting Rushia, the abandoned snake, bird and monkey in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest, and the dark eater encountered in the ruins of Airun this time, all of them are beings that I can&#8217;t hit with my sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have more opportunities to feel such pressure than most people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was used to it&#8230;&#8230;though not at all helpful to Alice and her friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Eri safe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, somehow&#8230;&#8230;in my case, it&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve seen a dark eater. But it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve had my liver chilled this badly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Eri, who was usually high-spirited and buzzing about the place, was tired this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took us 40 minutes to get back to Redas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The journey there must have taken twenty minutes. For Alice and the others, the pressure of the Dark Eaters was so intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the streets of Redas, Alice and her friends finally let out a breath of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The contact with the Dark Eaters was too sudden, but that was expected. If we had gone ahead with the investigation of the ruins, I think we would have been in that situation sooner or later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you ask me&#8230;Alice and others showed a convincing pretence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I didn&#8217;t expect was the appearance of Ziggrit. I had heard that his party from the Imperial Kingdom of Eisu occasionally returned to their home country to interact with the people but I didn&#8217;t expect them to visit the ruins.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I didn&#8217;t do enough research on this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story that Ziggrit is regularly surveying the Airun Ruins is probably not generally recognised. However, Eri and the inhabitants of this city know about it, so it is probably not hidden from them&#8230;&#8230;they are not hiding it, but they don&#8217;t want it to be known as much as possible, so they keep leaks to a minimum. That&#8217;s what I sense as their intention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the person we really need to be aware of now is Ziggrit, not the Dark Eaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is clearly interfering with our investigations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri.  What kind of a hero is Ziggrit?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, he&#8217;s a hero, a very brave man. I don&#8217;t like him but the man&#8217;s exploits are nothing short of glorious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri, somewhat grimly, spoke about the exploits of Ziggrit and his party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Eri, he saved a city that had been ruled by monsters after a fierce battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, he boldly conquered the poisonous swamps from which no one had survived, and discovered the stronghold of the Demon King&#8217;s men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is said to be active not only in defeating demon kings but also in helping people for the sake of the Imperial Kingdom. When a popular S-class adventurer in the Eisu Empire was unable to return from a dungeon on his own, Ziggrit rushed to his rescue without sleeping a wink, even though he was on another continent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such good deeds have led to Ziggrit&#8217;s current popularity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled that when I first visited the city, I saw a line of Ziggurit goods in the general shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;..Indeed, a heroic hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It may also have something to do with the fact that the first results he achieved was in this investigation of the Airun ruins. After all, he had investigated such a dangerous place, he wouldn&#8217;t be timid about going elsewhere now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a fair point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s clear that Ziggrit acting dubious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I state my opinion cautiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was concerned when he had a monopoly on information but if he is visiting the ruins regularly on top of that, then I have to be suspicious&#8230;..Perhaps there is something in the Airun ruins that Ziggrit and his party don&#8217;t want a third party to know about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, is it a clue about the Demon King&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not sure we can rule that one yet, but it&#8217;s starting to look like a possibility.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reply to Alice&#8217;s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit went to the Castle Ward. If there&#8217;s anything at the Airun Ruins, it&#8217;s the Castle Ward. We should complete our investigation of the Airun Ruins as planned &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I had thought that as long as we could be sure that there was really no connection with the Demon King, we could just investigate the city district only. But now, this happens, we need to investigate everything in excess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, let me reiterate that the Castle Ward is really dangerous, okay? Ziggrit did indeed go into the Castle Ward and survive but he lost two hundred collaborators and one member of his party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I agree.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know enough about the dangers of the Airun ruins that I don&#8217;t need to ask now. I&#8217;ve done a complete prep with books and other materials sent to me by Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark eater has given so much pressure that we can&#8217;t even breathe just by confronting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s impossible for me to deal with it alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why I called Eri.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her, honestly, that I couldn&#8217;t handle it on my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to dump me there &#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t have a choice. I&#8217;m a very dependent person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was a reckless act of selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Eri looks proud, as if she knew I could rely on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really don&#8217;t have a choice&#8230;.then, I&#8217;ll give you a special treat!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Eri took a bundle of papers out of the briefcase bag she was carrying and handed it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bundle of papers described the structure of the Airun Ruins, among other things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These are the documents for the Airun Ruins and Castle Ward! I&#8217;ve got it all in my head, so you can have it Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says with a big smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn&#8217;t&#8230;..Ziggurit have a monopoly on this stuff?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was obtained completely different from Ziggurit investigation!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What does she mean&#8230;..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri said she had never been into the Castle District, so it was not something she obtained on her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri then explains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Airun Ruins was abruptly destroyed without a trace, so there were very few references to it from that period. But it was mostly destroyed, not entirely&#8230;&#8230; Six months ago, when we, the archaeologists, gave up on the information provided by Ziggrit, we managed to scrape up all this literature and read it secretly! But if Ziggrit found out, he might confiscate it, so we kept it a secret until now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand, knowing Ziggrit, he would do so. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri and the other archaeologists seemed to be wary of Ziggrit from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, but you have to be careful!　It&#8217;s only a piece of material spliced together from past documents that are full of holes, so it may be completely useless compared to Ziggrit&#8217;s information. It&#8217;s just a way of getting directions!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you can count on my experience. Not as much as the Airun Ruins but I&#8217;ve surveyed a lot of places in my time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says with pride.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her like that blew away my fears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re reliable. I&#8217;ll need you to be my guide in the castle district too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! I&#8217;ll do my best, even if it&#8217;s only in a small way!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri smiled shyly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. is it that time already?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I noticed that the sun was setting down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky had taken on the orangey-green hues of sunset. I put the bundle of papers away in my pouch. I&#8217;ll read the rest when I get back to the inn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way to the inn, I crossed a busy shop on the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a tavern?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it is! I think it&#8217;s the busiest place in Redas!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the open door, men and women were happily drinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, a farmer, an adventurer and a man who appears to be a craftsman of some sort are there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m visiting Redus for the first time today, so naturally I don&#8217;t see anyone I know in the tavern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;alright, I&#8217;ll drop by.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys go and eat at your leisure, I&#8217;ll go and talk to those people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After entering the bar, Ned said to us and went to a table with a group of strangers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Who are you? You don&#8217;t look familiar.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Ned, an adventurer. Fom the Kingdom of Enuvidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hooー, you&#8217;re from the Kingdom of Enuvidia. That&#8217;s unusual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? I think it&#8217;s pretty close&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned naturally sat next to the men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within minutes, there was giggling and laughter from Ned’s group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.he’s already familiar with them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yea,Yeahh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To get on so easily with someone who was supposed to be a complete stranger was something that&#8230;..Alice, at least, could never imitate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Alice watches the harmonious Ned, the food she&#8217;s ordered arrives at her table.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice reflected on the events of the day as she cut the fruit-filled pie.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark eaters&#8230;maybe I can&#8217;t win if I fight&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a contest to begin with. It is like a lump of unreasonableness. The swordsmanship Alice honed and the experience she accumulated are useless.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s nice to have Eri with us, but she said she&#8217;d never been in the castle district&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On pure combat ability alone, Alice is far stronger than Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being strong means being responsible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When push comes to shove, Alice will have to lead the battle to victory.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How can I&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they head to the Castle District, they may have contact with the Dark Eaters again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And worst of all, they might fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice found herself stopped eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does Ned have a plan&#8230;&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do in case I have to fight the Dark Eaters?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shouldn&#8217;t we all have a serious discussion here at least once?</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alice began to worry like that -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if this is the time to have a serious discussion&#8230;&#8230;you’re thinking that, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri, who is sitting next to me, saw through what I was thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, no, no, no!!? I&#8217;m not that kind of thing──&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I know what you’re thinking! When I was adventuring with the Net, that&#8217;s all I thought about!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice tried to deny it by shaking her head, but Eri nodded forward before she could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is always looking for someone to talk to!　Even when we&#8217;re scratching our heads, that man is not bothered at all, he will just wander this and that way &#8230;&#8230;which is why I doubted his ability at first too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;do you know why Ned has shown you all here today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice could not answer that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice shookher head silently and Eri gave her the answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned and I met in a tavern just like this one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around the motley atmosphere of the bar, Eri said somewhat nostalgically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, Alice understand what Eri is trying to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and her friends had a good grasp of the fact that the Ned&#8217;s weapon of choice is human connections. In fact, when they left the Kingdom of Enuvidia, they were helped by Ishna, who runs a wyvern flight and then by Eri, the scholar in front of them, at the Airun Ruins. When they explored the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest for the hero party selection exam, none of the examinees died thanks to the adventurers that Ned brought with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they were not Ned companions from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every connection has a beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned is now trying to make that beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as it once did when it met Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even today, Ned is still trying to nurture a bond with someone.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s Ned&#8217;s way of adventure.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice felt a strong sense of respect.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today. Why did Eli help them? &#8230;&#8230; It is because Ned and Eri met. It is because they met, developed friendship and trust in each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice realised that they must not disturb Ned now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This moment is surely the most important time for Ned.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri-san&#8230;&#8230;tha, thank you for telling me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice understood that she herself still didn&#8217;t fully understand Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice thanked Eli profusely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. I like Ned and I&#8217;m happy if one more person understands him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a gentle smile that showed her maturity, Eri said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Relieved, Alice resumed eating, feeling hungry as her worries had been lifted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was about to indulge in the sweet crispy fruit  pie- when she suddenly remembered what Eri had said earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, um, what do you mean&#8230;..when you say you like &#8230;&#8230; Ned-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice asked, puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Eri gave a sarcastic smile and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t tell anyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is a seductress, a seducer who is also a womaniser&#8230;so you should all be careful!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, Eri went to the table where Ned was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned! You want to compare drinks? Please let me join you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo, Sure!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E,Eri-san!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri chuckily sat down next to Ned and started drinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their distance feels&#8230;..closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A strange feeling swirled inside my chest. Unsettled&#8230;. I couldn&#8217;t seem to look past the scene in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up vigorously when I saw Eri, arm in arm with Ned, drinking his drink in a friendly manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I went straight to Ned&#8217;s side and</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned raised his eyebrows at the sudden approaching Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice picks up a cup of liquor on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I also have an adventure with you too&#8230;. Ned-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I tilted the cup and took a swig of the liquor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo, Jo-chan is quite good!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go! We can&#8217;t afford to lose to these slobs!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phuwaa, Alice drinks up her drink and the men around her also chug theirs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice has changed a lot since she met&#8230;..Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, she has.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kirch looked at Alice, who had finished her drink, Phylicia nodded as she took a small mouthful of vegetable stew soup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a shame to leave him as a substitute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch mutters in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, Ned is a substitute for the Kingdom of Enuvidia&#8217;s Hero Party. However, Alice, Filia and Kirch were willing to welcome Ned as an official member.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;saddening to think that one day we&#8217;ll have to part ways..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be fine if we didn&#8217;t have to part.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Do you have any thoughts on this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We should surround ourselves with the right people. Let&#8217;s blow the word around that all our activities are only possible because of Ned-san. That way the outer moat will be filled.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; quite, very calculated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice is pure. I thought I would take on this kind of role within the party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a smirk and a soft smile,Phylicia says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a black-hearted face&#8230;&#8230;thought Kirch, but he never said it out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, there is a lack of people in this party who think things through with rationality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Kirch wondered if Ned would fit into that frame of mind. However, as we worked together, that idea changed. Ned is the type of person who considers the interests of both parties when dealing with people, but he is also somehow fragile with compassion. That is probably why people love him so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not as strong as Alice, but Ned-san surprises me sometimes. After all, the strength from Ned-san is completely out of the ordinary for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I agree with you on that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch nodded his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe Ned doesn&#8217;t need to be understood&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chewing his sausage, Kirch said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even when I was a mercenary, sometimes there were people like that. Those who could predict the outcome of a battle, those who for some reason were not attacked by monsters. &#8230;&#8230;Their power was not theoretical. They just&#8230;&#8230;always had results that no one else could imitate. That&#8217;s why&#8230;.we trusted them so much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch looks at Ned again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is probably that sort of person&#8230;..ideas that are too deep to be contained within the confines of language. &#8230;&#8230;so it&#8217;s probably hard for people to even understand him.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned’s weapon of choice, making  connections is not fully understood, not even by his fellow party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even if they don&#8217;t understand it, they at least know it&#8217;s trustworthy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, Kingsguard Knight Meir, Party Leader Riese of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, that man who is adored by so many people cannot be an ordinary person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We just have to &#8230;&#8230; believe in him. Then Ned will respond&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia nodded at Kirch&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we go and mingle too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;Alice is going to get drunk, so we&#8217;ll keep it moderate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the sky was completely darkened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnuuh &#8230;..Ned, it&#8217;s warm&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was on my way to the inn, with Alice on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though you drank it all in one gulp, I didn&#8217;t know if one drink can make you this drunk&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it was probably her first drink..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who has become too drunk to walk on her own, says, while Phylicia looks at her somewhat happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Incidentally, it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve had it too and it&#8217;s better than &#8230;&#8230;I thought it would be..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;In case you&#8217;re wondering, even in the Eisu Empire, drinking is only allowed at the age of 18.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please, let&#8217;s call it a rude awakening.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, whose cheeks are slightly red, smiles good-humouredly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch does not seem to have been that drunk. Rather than being a strong drinker, I think he decided that if they all got drunk, they would be stuck in the middle of nowhere, so he was holding his own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already split up with Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staying at a different inn from us. We were visiting Redas for the first time this time but Eeli had been there several times in the past and had been friends with some of the lodges since then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8230;..want to be stronger like&#8230;&#8230;Rin, like&#8230;.Ned&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice blurted out to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels quite strange to be put in the same league as such a brave Lynn and me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did they find strong or cool about me&#8230;..I have no idea at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly entered the inn, trying not to shake Alice&#8217;s body as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ara, she’s very drunk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to the inn, the Wooden Hotel in Redas, I was greeted by the owner, even though it was already late at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was an old woman with a strong spirit but she smiled a lot and was full of warmth. She looked worried when she saw Alice being carried by me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t tell me the people in town made her drink?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I drank it myself. I&#8217;ll&#8230;..tell her not to drink too much next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a wry smile I said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;right, I was keeping this for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a bottle from my pouch and handed it to the shopkeeper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard the owner of the Wooden Hotel likes ale.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! I never thought I&#8217;d be entertained by a customer!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner slapped me on the back with a bang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For adventurers and hero parties who travel from place to place, it is important to have food, clothing and shelter. I want to express my gratitude as much as possible to the people who provide these things for us. I&#8217;m glad to hear that the owner is happy with the ale I bought at the bar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two rooms at the inn are rented, one for the women and one for the men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Phylicia in charge of Alice and tried to enter the men&#8217;s room with Kirch, but&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu&#8230;&#8230; I don’t want&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice grabbed my clothes and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Net-san is &#8230;&#8230; with me. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, looking me up and down and staring me in the face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moist eyes, flushed cheeks and slightly sweaty skin. The normally girlish Alice looks somewhat more mature now. Alice grabbed my clothes tightly and didn&#8217;t let go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She has become fond of you, hasn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia says smilingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..she’s just drunk and missing human contact.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some people are more honest when they&#8217;re drunk, don&#8217;t you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to ignore Phylicia&#8217;s mischievous laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice is not going to let me go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I have no choice. I&#8217;ll carry you.”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p104-720x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hands around Alice&#8217;s knees and back and lifted her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m an existence power 1 and my physical abilities are mediocre but I have no problem carrying a single girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia opened the door to the room and I went inside with Alice in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;d like it to stay like this forever&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I appreciate her saying that but I still have a few things I want to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Alice in my arms, I approached the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;.. just a bit more, cuddle&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, keep your eyes closed and count ten seconds.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who was showing a more pampered appearance than usual, was slowly placed on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice closes her eyes as she was told and after a while she emits a small sleepy sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Good, she’s asleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re somewhat used to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t deny it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m good at getting involved with people and doing things, and I have a lot of experience of all the events that occur as a result of my involvement with people. I&#8217;ve even cared for a fellow drunken person on a few occasions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomorrow we are going into the castle district. Phylicia and Kirch, too, should go to bed early today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I put my hand on the door to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;&#8230;where are you going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to sober up with the night breeze. I&#8217;m also going to read some of the material&#8230;&#8230;Eri gave me while I&#8217;m at it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..okay. If there&#8217;s anything I can do to help, just let me know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the room and headed down the stairs that lead outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was already almost sober but the chilly breeze had completely sobered me up. I&#8217;m the type of person who originally enjoys alcohol in what can be described as moderation, so I&#8217;ve never been too drunk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the battlefield of Alice and her friends is the ruins of Airun, my battlefield is everything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t get drunk on the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting on a bench, I read the material given to me by Eri, relying on the lamppost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I read through the material, I remembered the people I had met at the bar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Farmer, hunter or adventurer, appraiser, peddler and fisherman&#8230;..The peddler said he came to this town yesterday to sell some rare ore. The appraiser appraised it and said that a blacksmith had shown up and bought it in bulk. The blacksmith was actually planning to have a drink with him last night but the characteristics of the ore he bought were so interesting that he spent the whole night pounding and burning the stones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his earnings, the peddler ordered every single item on the tavern&#8217;s sumptuous menu. But halfway through the meal, he realised he couldn’t finish the food, so he called the adventurer and the farmer, who were rumoured to be the best eaters in town, to the tavern. The two men were good at keeping things lively, and before I knew it, the hunter, the fisherman&#8230;.and I, the hero party, were all at the same table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is how bar gatherings came about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People connect through events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I liked to know that connection.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The people of Redas were friendlier than I expected&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the checkpoints and the examinations at the  ruins management department, the people of Redas have an image of being very cautious. But once the lid was lifted, they readily accepted outsiders and drank with them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it because they are so guarded that once they accept me, our distance becomes closer?&#8230;&#8230; I bet they really want to spend more time in the open’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think they are wary of strangers because they like it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I could do something about it &#8211; that&#8217;s what I think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the threat of the Airun ruins disappears, they will surely find it easier to live.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope we can help with that&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I heard my name called by someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and it was Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri&#8230;&#8230;I thought we were finished for the day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. That’s why I come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Eri sits down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Ned, I thought you&#8217;d be out here anyway. It&#8217;s a bad habit of Ned to try to work alone, leaving his &#8230;..party to rest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because if it comes to combat I can&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s my job to contribute in places like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so stubborn, you know that?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri sighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. I need to have a serious talk with you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About what&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of his usual bright, carefree smile, Eri told me with a straight face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you like to work with me at the organisation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does Eri mean she wants me to join the&#8230;&#8230;World Academic and Research Organisation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..stop joking. Are you still drunk?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m not drunk, I&#8217;m serious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri comes closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open my mouth as I slowly back away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t join that organisation..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be a stupid. Your achievements will get you in anywhere. If you want, I can compile a list of your achievements and submit it to the organisation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;please don&#8217;t do that.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wryly laughed and said, as I know she would really do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think, with Ned, we can get closer to the truth about the world. So would you consider&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looked straight at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a joke, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m aware and proud of the fact that I&#8217;ve been involved in so many global achievements. Of course, I don&#8217;t have any special powers of my own but if my connections are valued, it might not be impossible for me to join the organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, I have a mission to fulfil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, but I am now a member of a Heroic Party. I have no intention of shirking my responsibilities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. but you&#8217;re just a substitute, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I intend to devote myself to the work of the heroic party until I am relieved of my duties. What happens afterwards, I&#8217;m not going to think about it now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I can&#8217;t concentrate on the work of the Heroic Party if I&#8217;m thinking about what I&#8217;m going to do after I leave. I&#8217;m not that dexterous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way you’re going to be&#8230;&#8230;relieved of your duties.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a small voice, Eri muttered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing! That&#8217;s enough! I&#8217;m going to sulk!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri&#8217;s lips twitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An invitation from the world&#8217;s most prestigious academic institution is an honour in itself. Unfortunately, I could not accept, but I am grateful for Eri&#8217;s feelings in itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it was a really serious talk, which is unusual for Eri.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re being disrespectful! I&#8217;m always serious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is your research at a standstill? I don&#8217;t intend to join the organisation, but if there&#8217;s anything I can do to help, I&#8217;ll help you as much as I can.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Eri looked difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re not at a standstill, but we&#8217;re at the climax&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m almost ready to prove it. The theory of the alternation of civilisations&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri seriously considers something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look on her face is scholarly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I felt an eerie presence behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A figure in a black cloak, blending in with the darkness of the night, has been standing there for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face and body are completely covered by the cloak, so even his gender is unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, do you know him?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cloaked figure did not speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could ask him what he wanted, he drew his hidden sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the intent to kill, Eri and I jumped back in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bench was cut in half. I was able to get a good look at the assailant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t look away from my attackers and took out the communication stone from my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, Phylicia, Kirch. We&#8217;re under attack outside the inn, can you come?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ll be right there!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Wait for me&#8230;&#8230;!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, I contacted the communication stone that had been entrusted to the three people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, over here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fled behind Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri throws a spirit bottle at the assailants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottle cracks and lightning explodes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is&#8230;not working?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The assailant approached us in spite of the lightning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade, illuminated by the moonlight, is closing on my neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped back and avoided the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Kirch with his axe on his back and Phylicia with her bow jumped down from the window of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both have an Existence Power of 4, which is almost forgotten because of Alice&#8217;s presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both have enviable physical abilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the&#8230;.. enemy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I don&#8217;t even know why he’s attacking us, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch holds up his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As each of them gets into a battle stance, I suddenly realise that someone was missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where&#8217;s Alice?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry but she isn’t in any condition to fight, I had to put her to sleep&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia said with a complicated expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attacker instantly closed the distance with Kirch and unleashed a flash of right cleave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strong&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch uses his axe as a shield to block the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, with his muscular body, has great physical strength but lacks agility. The attacker may have recognised this weakness and has become committed to one-strike attacks from a medium distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attacker&#8217;s sword ripped through Kirch&#8217;s right leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will heal you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A silver balance bottle appears in Filia&#8217;s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armament 《《Balance of Purification and Healing》. Phylicia uses this tool to heal and detoxify.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plate on the right side of the balance in Filia&#8217;s hand falls with a clatter. Immediately afterwards, Kirch&#8217;s right leg glows faintly and the bleeding stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attacker approached Kirch again, but──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..one pattern.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anticipating the attacker&#8217;s move, Kirch used his axe as a decoy and counter-punched with his fist.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bakiri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> comes with the sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is&#8230;&#8230; not a&#8230;&#8230; person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kirch pulls his fist out, a piece of wood falls from the attacker&#8217;s stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a human body. It is a doll made of wood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu…Nyarekoree….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Uuu….What’s happening/this&#8230;~)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[うぅ……にゃんれすか～……？]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice lazily appears in front of us, bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is dressed in a nightgown and has squinty eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is completely sleep-walking. Moreover, her head is still not working properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she still carries her sword, perhaps out of instinct as a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The assailant closes his distance to Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, get away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nmmm~&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia shouted but Alice stood there, wiping her eyes lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, the next moment, Alice put her hand on the handle and -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin~~》Eheh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Alice&#8217;s image seemed to blur and the next moment she was in a position behind her attacker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attacker&#8217;s body shifts in half without making a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe&#8230;&#8230;一first prize~&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had drawn her sword before she knew it, delivered it while muttering something unintelligible, as if she were dreaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; dependable, our hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The puppet assailant, which had separated into two parts, did not even twitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a clean cut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san, are you all right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Phylicia, who was coming towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is this doll &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at the severed doll, Phylicia mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri, do you have any idea?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not the doll nor the reason it attacked us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither do I.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Come to think of it, I heard about a missing traveller in the general shop we stopped at right after we came to town.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if this doll is the source.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the two dots can connect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to do, Ned&#8230;&#8230;?　Do you want to discuss our future plans now&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yea, I guess it&#8217;s time&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe we should talk about it but I looked at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was still sleeping while standing up. She is a very dexterous girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some say she is drunk, but&#8230;..probably she’s just that tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s take the rest of the day off. Everyone must be tired. We&#8217;ve had some unexpected attacks, so we&#8217;ll delay tomorrow&#8217;s schedule a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are responsible people. Even if I say I&#8217;m taking a break, they&#8217;ll be on alert for a while. So I decided to delay my wake-up time by an hour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the sun rises, the attackers will be too busy being seen to show themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to the inn with Alice in my arms again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning after fighting off the mysterious assailants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left my room and joined them for breakfast in the dining room on the ground floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bread, soup and dried meat were served on the table. The canteen was empty except for the four of us. It seems to have been rented out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you all tired?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y, yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her over a bowl of hot soup, Alice nodded cheerfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night we were on the lookout for assailants and woke up regularly but we still got plenty of rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, who was in the same room, also appeared to have slept contentedly&#8230;..Kirch is a former mercenary. He must have experienced many times situations where he had to rest his body even on the battlefield where he could not relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Phylicia were also active as adventurers, so their experience comes in handy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry about yesterday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Alice apologised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would be in response to the fact that she drank too much alcohol last night and was drunk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d say don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230;&#8230;but you should be careful with your amount next time..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…sor,sorry….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked down apologetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all right. drunk Alice was kawaii.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ka,waa! &#8230;&#8230;Phylicia-san, don&#8217;t make fun of me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s true. Isn&#8217;t that right, Ned-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she’s going to shake me there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it certainly was different from the norm in a lot of ways.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, slightly vaguely muddled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. alcohol&#8230;&#8230; sometimes, I&#8217;ll have a drink&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice mutters, her cheeks reddening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Phylicia are underage but the establishment of a tavern is a good place to gather information. They will probably go into bars more often in the future, so honestly, they should get used to a bit of drinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Enuvidia is a kingdom that is tolerant of adventurers. The people of the kingdom know that adventurers and tavern are a good combination, so there will be no complaints if a party of heroes who are engaged in activities similar to those of adventurers use the bars frequently. If this were a strict country, it would be a different story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll meet up with Eri in front of the ruins&#8230;&#8230;.Are you guys ready?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having filled our bellies, we left the canteen and headed towards the front desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, he locked eyes with the innkeeper at the front desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the amiable shopkeeper looked uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Good morning, did you sleep well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y, yes! I&#8217;m sorry I showed you my shabby side last night.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, well, that&#8217;s all right, but&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice bowed deeply and apologised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shopkeeper stared at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;. after all, I can&#8217;t believe it,&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shopkeeper returned to her work, muttering in distress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is going on? I wonder a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, let&#8217;s head to the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today we&#8217;re going to investigate the castle district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps we should do more research in the townships but given that Ziggrit has entered the Castle District, it&#8217;s better to prioritise the investigation of the Castle District.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we went outside, dazzling sunlight shone on our faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I squinted slightly and started walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that them, the strangers doing strange things&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard whispering around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first I thought it was a misunderstanding, but the stares continued to pour in after I left the inn.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;we’re getting a lot of attention.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, the stares were unwelcome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t have any idea. If I look at Alice and the others, they too were puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice suddenly calls out from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was the man I had shared a drink with at the tavern last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Actually, this morning, Ziggrit-san paid a visit to the city.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man told us, with some difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We heard about you doing strange things in the ruins of Airun&#8230;&#8230;things that put us, the inhabitants of Redas, in danger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man&#8217;s statement spoke for the feelings of the townspeople around him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Countless stares pierced the four of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that&#8217;s why we were the centre of attention.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No wonder the innkeeper was behaving strangely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d heard that story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around briefly, some are overtly wary of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh,what should we do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..anyway, we&#8217;ll just have to clear up the misunderstanding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;we have no material to clear up the misunderstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and her friends were understandably upset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We are being sabotaged by the Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they become uncooperative with us, we won&#8217;t have the access to accommodation and we won&#8217;t have enough food to eat. We don&#8217;t want to investigate the ruins in such a situation. In some cases, we may even be kicked out of the town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had judged them to be suspicious enough when we crossed swords with them yesterday but we had not expected them to interfere so blatantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Ziggrit had the assurance that the inhabitants of this city would believe what he said. After all, they even sell Ziggrit merchandise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The obstruction is a long way off, probably because Ziggrit was conscious of his own appearance. Ziggrit is also a heroic party. If he overtly interferes with a heroic party from another country, he will make a bad impression. The direct crossing of swords, like yesterday, should not be done, at least not in public places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, what about it? Are you guys plotting something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man asked nervously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere became heavy. Alice and the others were staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">一In a touchy atmosphere, I&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──No, I&#8217;m not planning anything, but..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered in a calm manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others opened their eyes. It was as if to say, [There&#8217;s no way we can clear our suspicions that easily.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it probably won&#8217;t be a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man rolled his eyes, but&#8230;&#8230;eventually gave a small smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230;I just met you yesterday but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re the kind of guy who would do something like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man patted his chest in relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this reaction, the other residents around us looked relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, was he mistaken after all?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit-sama is a human child too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It appears that this matter will end up being a misunderstanding on Ziggrit’s part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say a little louder so they can hear me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I told you yesterday in the bar, we just want to have a look around inside the ruins of Airun. If there&#8217;s anything we can&#8217;t handle, we&#8217;ll leave, and if it&#8217;s going to affect the town, we&#8217;ll discuss it properly beforehand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the kind of thing you just have to be honest about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The suspicion that had been focused on me easily disappears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried again to head for the ruins with Alice and the others, I found&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;connections, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The others looked at me with admiring eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. No. I&#8217;m just glad I believed it after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. We just have to believe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch and Phylicia smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure what they’re talking about but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have caused any problems, so we move on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a woman&#8217;s figure approached from a distance, her red hair swinging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eri? The meeting place is supposed to be the ruins. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve had a bit of a problem&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri stops and catches her breath, as if in a hurry to get here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri looked at the residents around her and tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s like Ziggrit was spreading bad rumours about us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Zigrit is targeting Eri too&#8230;&#8230;.I wonder if Eri was harmed in any way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just to be sure, I shared what had just happened with Eri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, no wonder you&#8217;ve been attracting so much attention!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Eri had managed to nullify Zigrit&#8217;s interference with her own brazenness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she is the kind of woman who skips a conference or two with impunity. She probably doesn&#8217;t care much about the way other people look at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what happened exactly, Eri?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our hard work!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri says as if she remembers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was waiting for you all in front of the ruins when I was approached by the guards at the entrance&#8230;..Apparently our permits have been temporarily revoked.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Eri&#8217;s words, I wrinkled my brow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We only got our permits yesterday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly this is not a normal situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the reason?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could not ask for more information&#8230;&#8230;but we can&#8217;t survey the ruins as it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri was annoyed by the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, let&#8217;s go to the Ruins Management Department.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing that comes to mind is the idea of a [straight talk].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stopped heading towards the Airun Ruins and headed for the Ruins Management Department.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we entered the Ruins Management Department, our eyes met those of the receptionist behind the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before we could approach the counter, someone approached us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large man approaches us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Grouse, one of the men who had been our examiner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grouse. I need to ask you a few questions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s about the&#8230;&#8230;permit, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said he was aware of the situation here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded [Aaa].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Grouse explains apologetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. Actually, this morning I was ordered by Ziggrit-sama to have your permits revoked. In&#8230;&#8230;this country, a heroic party has as much power as a duke. We had no choice but to obey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power of the heroic parties varies from Kingdom  to Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, no special power is given to us, but instead, Princess Rushia, is behind us. So, in a way, we were able to borrow power from Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, the Eisu Empire seems to have clearly defined the power of the heroic party. The difference in titles is not a simple hierarchical relationship but perhaps Ziggrit is in a position where he can make a statement on logistics and politics between the territories. If he uses that power, he can also do some shady things and blackmail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who do I have to talk to about it to get it sorted out?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse kept his mouth shut, as if he was reluctant to say it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here, you brats?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a well-dressed man appeared at the top of the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse immediately bowed his head towards him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work, Director Douglas…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ダグラス部長</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it is you, the heroic party of the Kingdom of Enuvidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man, who was called the director, stared at us without a single glance at Grouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to Grouse, the receptionist and other staff working here bowed to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that this man, Douglas, is in charge of the Ruins Management Department.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached Douglas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is my heroic party. We need to discuss the permit. I don&#8217;t know what Ziggrit said, but maybe we are misunderstood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up. Ziggrit-sama said that you are all up to no good. The hero of the&#8230;..Empire says so. It&#8217;s a good thing you&#8217;re not in custody.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way out of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas was overtly dismissive of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you the leader of the party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m the manager.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas wrinkles his brow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s alright. But I’m the one leading the party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no mistaking that perception.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas takes a long look at my appearance and overhears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So sleazy&#8230;&#8230;.but in the unlikely event that you can show me something that makes me willing to spend time with you, I&#8217;m willing to discuss it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I do have a record of the five major sites I&#8217;ve traversed, though”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not interested in that stuff.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a very different attitude from Grouse’s, who was so surprised that his voice was shaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s more to it than that, you know &#8230;&#8230;? There&#8217;s a kind of sincerity that&#8217;s appropriate when you&#8217;re asking someone for something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that remark, I understood what Douglas was asking for.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This guy&#8230;&#8230;is he being bribed by Ziggrit?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse explained that the Ruins Management Department had succumbed to Ziggrit&#8217;s power but the truth is different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man is simply being paid by Ziggrit. The idea that he bowed to Ziggrit is just a lie to cover up the bribe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now he’s trying to squeeze money out of us too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Let me think about it for a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right&#8230;..As an aside, I have a hobby of collecting antique pottery. The pottery I bought the other day cost 10 million zeny, but I think it was a good buy. After all, things that move people&#8217;s hearts must cost this much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not an afterthought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He politely tells me, implicitly, that I should have 10 million ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten million zeny is a lot of money, enough to build a house. It is not an amount of money that can be casually and easily spent, but Ziggrit must have given this amount of bribe money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heroic parties can receive support from the kingdom. If I ask Rushia, I can receive at least 10 million zeny. And if&#8230;&#8230;we are good enough, we can easily conquer places that are generally known as difficult places. You can make as much money as you want if you want to. Ten million zeny was an exquisite amount of money that could be paid with hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the moment, I&#8217;m going back to my party and friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They got me. Stuck in the simplest way possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shared with my friends what Douglas had said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That sucks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia glared at Douglas with disdain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the worst. It sucks but it is a common obstruction because of its simplicity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit&#8217;s interference was not just about impressing the town&#8217;s inhabitants. Rather, the impression on the inhabitants was only incidental and this was probably the main objective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can be troublesome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What shall we do?..Shall we come back when things die down?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about Kirch&#8217;s question and answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, we should rather investigate the ruins right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others winded their eyes, perhaps not expecting that statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will explain the reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ziggrit&#8217;s interference has been too hasty and rough around the edges. No matter how much power and money Zigrit has flirted with, this kind of forceful approach will not last for very long. Now they are demanding a bribe, but with time the problem will naturally resolve itself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man in charge of the site management department is that man Douglas, but further up is the feudal lord, who is in charge of the whole territory. Sooner or later, the feudal lord or someone close to him will notice this anomaly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was only a temporary set-back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the flip side, Ziggrit wanted to stall us for this very moment. If the&#8230;&#8230;purpose is to buy time, then, Ziggrit is up to something right now. If that plot is related to the Demon King, we should act immediately to keep Ziggrit from escaping.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit is interfering with our investigation of the Airun Ruins. Then he will most likely be in the Airun Ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we waste time here, we are at the mercy of Ziggrit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit may be doing something at the Airun Ruins at this very moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We should enter the ruins as soon as possible in order to catch their attempts  and to crush them when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. Does that mean you’re accepting the bribe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eri asks a genuine question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, ten million zeny is a sum we can&#8217;t afford right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas probably thinks it&#8217;s splendid if he can get another bribe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we&#8217;ll go straight forward.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled a communication stone out of my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh,What are you going to do&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice asked anxiously, to which I replied as I manipulated the comms stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&#8230;&#8230;power for power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The communication&#8230;connected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who has the greatest power in the Eisu Empire?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any ordinary person would answer that it is the Emperor. However, the reality is that power has been divided into many different categories through the complex and bizarre flow of history and no one has absolute power in all areas. It is sometimes said that a nobleman whose life was saved by a commoner was indebted to that commoner for the rest of his life. The first lady of a certain noble family was held hostage by her family and gave up her position to a concubine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The emperor was no exception to this rule and sometimes there were those who could exert more power than the emperor on this imperial stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──The Empress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A former mercenary, she is revered and feared by many with that nickname.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was supposed to be nothing more than a mere mercenary but she was famous for her bizarre war achievements all by herself. Her exploits were a one-hit wizard. Eventually, the imperial military heard of her reputation, and she became an official of the state, where she also achieved tremendous success as a soldier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she was too strong and was soon shunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alienated and feared, but unable to deny the possibility that she might turn against them if unleashed, the empire finally attempted to assassinate her in secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The assassination was carried out by the Imperial Special Forces. It was a strong unit with about 30 elite soldiers of strength 4 to 5. However, she fought them off single-handedly &#8211; torturing them and finally putting a blade to the neck of the Emperor, who had authorised the assassination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then said, [I&#8217;m going to pretend this never happened. In return, you will obey me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the woman, who had been a mere mercenary, gained the right to make the emperor her puppet. She is known as the Empress because of her appearance as an absolute champion who is second to none.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s been a while,Ned.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That empress has now answered my communication.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see. I have a favour to ask&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told the Empress what had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her that we wanted to investigate the ruins of Airun. But we were stuck because Ziggrit was blocking us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this reason. I want to borrow the Empress&#8217; power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I see.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress gave a short, humming sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You were right to turn to me instead of the emperor. I am the one who, without having to worry about appearances, can forcefully and instantly fulfil your wishes.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress is not a member of the underworld. Of course, her prestige extends to the underworld as well, but her own career has been extremely illustrious. Her tale of heroism from mercenary to the most famous knight in the Empire, is widely known and admired by many.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the imperial side that did the dirty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress is therefore connected to all the Imperial nobility, especially the Emperor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike her, I do not have any connection with the Emperor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No wonder you have it. In fact, you have the contact with the King Of Enuvidia, right?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..your ears are quick”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have got her information from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, the people I know are awesome and terrifying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, then, I shall grant your wish..I don&#8217;t know how this man, Ziggrit, has invoked his powers of coercion, but it would be a good idea to put pressure collectively on those who might be involved.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be too rough with them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I know. Because you don&#8217;t like it when people bring other people down.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The empress&#8217;s tone of voice, which had been full of dignity, seemed to have become slightly gentler.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she is often feared for her strength, the Empress is actually very attentive to those with whom she is close. I&#8217;m honoured that she recognises me as a close friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the communication stone, I hear the Empress speaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must be connecting to various people while maintaining communication with me. From time to time, I hear the voices of her busy men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for a while, the Empress calls out to me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Several nobles regard Ziggrit&#8217;s actions as selfish and are lobbying the lords of Redas. In a few more days things will be back to normal.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a smooth resolution it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am relieved to hear that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Thanks for the help. Let me thank you again some other time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Thank you? If so, join the Great Powers assembly』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for a reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──It is a proposal that cannot be easily accepted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I’m still thinking of the words to speak, the Empress speaks up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『A festival of the mighty. A one-of-a-kind event that brings together the fiercest men and women from all over the world&#8230;&#8230;.you should show up to that assembly at least once.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re not joking are you..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m the kind of person who can&#8217;t even take down a weak monster on my own. I’m in the furthest race to be removed from an assembly of powers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『That’s the opposite.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a powerful tone of voice, the Empress says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『There are several types of strength: military, intellectual, financial and&#8230;&#8230;power. But in recent years, the development of new kinds of strength has stalled, and everyone has become similar to everyone else. Including me&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s what&#8217;s called a rut. That&#8217;s why your strength stands out.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned, with your strength, you can put a dent in the rusted values of today&#8230;&#8230;.Can&#8217;t you show the hard-headed, old-fashioned, old-timers what you see?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress said somewhat happily, as if she had envisioned that future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s overestimating me. I don&#8217;t have that kind of power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Besides, there are a lot of people at the assembly who would love to meet you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that&#8217;s the word that works best for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The powers-that-be will gather the fiercest men and women from all over the world. Some of my acquaintances will be there. I certainly have the desire to talk to them after a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;For now I still have some activities for my heroic party. I still can&#8217;t do it..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Really?　As an information exchange event, it couldn&#8217;t be more useful.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected….she knows me well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, the Assembly of the Great Powers will be attended by several heroic parties from other countries, so it is a rather significant event if you think of it as a forum for information exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I will provide you with one piece of information to make it more convincing.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress said to me as I fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Apparently, imposters claiming to be under the command of the Demon Lord have been active recently』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imposters…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ah. Well thought out. All of the demon king&#8217;s current servants are monsters that are akin to human beings.If you pretend to be a&#8230;&#8230;monster under such a demon king&#8217;s command, they can deceive one or two of the ugly human ingenuity.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon king&#8217;s subordinates are characterised by being humanoid monsters that understand human languages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, it would certainly be possible to impersonate a human being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..It was useful information. I thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I expect a colourful reply about the meeting,right?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, the Empress disconnected the communication.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;I owe her a nasty debt, didn’t I?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress is not of a character to force me to do anything. That is what, bothering me instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, let’s just forget about the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First things first, I have to look in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve taken steps. Let&#8217;s wait a bit for the results…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explain to Alice and the others that the situation has progressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;just now&#8230;you’re dealing with the empress?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch asked fearfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;The Empress is a legend for mercenaries. She is a mercenary, yet she practically holds an entire kingdom in her hands. It&#8217;s more of an object of awe than&#8230;&#8230; admiration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not much is known about the power held by the Empress, as it relates to the dignity of His Majesty the Emperor, but even so, one cannot put words in people&#8217;s mouths. The mercenaries in particular knew the Empress well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a person who, despite her mercenary status, has emerged stronger and more formidable than anyone else. It is no surprise that Kirch knows about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,there&#8217;s someone that great….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;at least, I could never beat her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch nodded deeply at Alice, who seemed curious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is beneficial for the brave party to know the world&#8217;s powerful people. It is a good stimulus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I supplemented Alice with more information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you remember meeting Nain-Yggdrasil in the Abandoned Dragon&#8217;s Nest?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes. He was so strong that I could tell just by looking at him&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, perhaps remembering that time, grabbed the hem of her skirt tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So much so that the man Nain-Yggdrasil was unusually strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the world is a big place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If the Empress fights that man, she absolutely will win.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ab, absolutely &#8230;..?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress has a blessing that has an unreasonable effect. In a way, she deserves her name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unreasonableness of it may be similar to that of the Dark Eater.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Empress and Nain-Yggdrasil fought, the Empress would win even if heaven and earth were turned upside down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, all I have to do is wait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas was looking at me with a sly smile, as if he thought I was still wondering whether to take the bribe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring his gaze, I recall my conversation with the Empress.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘An assembly of the great powers&#8230;.. I&#8217;ve been invited a few times, but I&#8217;ve never went.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have been invited to that assembly once or twice and by people other than the Empress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have dodged it but if Alice and her friends are interested, I might consider it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo,you&#8230;&#8230;what have you done?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Douglas shouted loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked and saw Douglas picking up a communication stone from the counter. His face was pallid and he was terribly confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve just been contacted by the feudal lord&#8230;..what does that mean, why is this &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas was too bewildered to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Douglas, with a great deal of sweat dripping from his forehead, is not far behind, and Grose approaches us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have just received a communication from our feudal lord. Your permits have been improperly revoked and the director&#8230;.may have accepted a bribe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn&#8217;t told the Empress anything about the bribes, but maybe someone did a light investigation into Ziggrit&#8217;s interference and it was discovered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is possible that someone has been suspicious of Douglas from the start and marked him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Neither of us officials knew about the bribe&#8230;..Sorry again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, don&#8217;t worry about it. It&#8217;s already done.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes &#8211; it&#8217;s done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The permit has been restored and Douglas will be punished accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what does it really mean?&#8230;..are you acquainted with our lord? I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you told me now that you are his illegitimate son.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am the lord&#8217;s illegitimate son..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;d be surprised, wouldn&#8217;t you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I&#8217;m joking. I just happen to know someone who can do this sort of thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grouse muttered inexplicably,[Who&#8217;s the person who can do this kind of thing&#8230;..] but decided not to ask any more, as it would take too long to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s head for the ruins then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, we are going to the Airun site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu&#8230;I’m getting a bit excited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the road, Eri mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The long-awaited exploration of the Castle District. It makes my scholarly blood boil!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get too excited and get ahead of yourself, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please stop me then!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whereas before, when she was lecturing us about the dangers of the Castle District, she had seemed cautious, now Eri seemed genuinely excited from the bottom of her heart. I guess she really wanted to prioritise her intellectual curiosity. I understand that feeling. I used to be an adventurer myself. It is instinctive to feel a sense of romance in uncharted territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Mm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we approached the ruins, a clamour could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two men and a woman were arguing around the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let us through!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You need a permit&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A young girl was attacking the guards guarding the entrance to the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ask them as I approach the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, actually&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──&#8230; my friend has been kidnapped!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl screamed before the guards could explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I saw it! Last night, while I was on my way to the inn, a man in a black cloak suddenly kidnapped my friend! They ran away towards the Airun ruins!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was heading towards the inn, her friend was probably a tourist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s words of frustration reminded me of last night.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Black Cloak &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That mysterious doll that attacked us was also wearing a black cloak.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘We weren&#8217;t the only ones attacked last night, were we&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just because they’re going in the same direction doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s your friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard calmly tells the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you to let me in to find out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will not! Do you know how dangerous this place is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guards were adamant and refused to accept the girl&#8217;s request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assuming what you say is true, if you can&#8217;t find your friend from here, she&#8217;s most likely in the Castle District. &#8230;&#8230;that place is full of magical spirits. The only people who have made it back alive are Ziggrit-sama and his friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard tells the girl that he will not let her pass, even if she is willing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl then had tears in the corners of her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you saying that&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, no, I didn&#8217;t mean it that way&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard, who only wanted to tell the girl that the ruins were very dangerous, looked troubled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I have a word with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to the tearful girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are a party of heroes from the Kingdom of Enuvidia. We are going to investigate the castle district of the Airun Ruins&#8230;..Just to be safe, can you tell me what your friend looks like?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s a girl with pure white hair and blue eyes. She wears loose-fitting, exotic clothes and&#8230;&#8230;also looks a bit naive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right. If I find her, I&#8217;ll make sure I send her back to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl bowed deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before entering the ruins again &#8211; I looked at the guards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just want to ask you one question, is Ziggrit inside the ruins right now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I haven&#8217;t checked. Ziggrit-sama is allowed to come and go freely in and out of the ruins, so he may have entered through the back gate. The back gate is locked so the public cannot use it, but he has a key.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit seems to be allowed to operate quite freely with regard to the Ayloon site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No guards are posted at the locked back gate. This means that Ziggrit can enter the Airun Ruins without anyone knowing about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I show the permit to the guards and ask them to open the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is everyone ready?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Alice and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice,Phylicia, Kirch and Eri nodded their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The objective is to investigate whether there are any clues to the Demon King in the ruins of Airun. At the same time, we will also search for a girl who has been kidnapped after discovering what Ziggrit is up to&#8230;&#8230;we will probably have to search all over the castle district. It&#8217;s one of the most dangerous areas in the world, so be careful.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told them, intending to say this not only to my companions but also to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dangers of the Airun Ruins and Castle District no longer need to be mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An adventurer with an existence force of seven who took on the task of defeating the Dark Eater is dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ziggrit returned alive but instead two hundred collaborators and one of his heroic party were sacrificed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We won&#8217;t make the same mistake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; the odds are in our favour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and her friends reply cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the gate we entered the ruins.</span></p>
