<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days after the hero party selection test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s start the meeting to defeat the Demon King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the conference room of the royal castle, I said to the people present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four people gathered here now are me, Alice, Phylicia and Kirch, who belong to the hero Party. Also inside the room are Princess Rushia, the princess of this country, her guard May, and Riese, the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, making a total of seven people. Riese is here as an adviser.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,what do you want to talk about &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered Alice&#8217;s question succinctly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, there is no precedent for defeating the Demon King. So no one knows what to do or where to go. Let&#8217;s discuss that with everyone and decide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone shook their heads at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As far as I&#8217;ve been able to find out, it seems the standard is basically to look for a suspicious-looking place and investigate it&#8230;&#8230;. Well, I don&#8217;t think you need to be bound by the standard &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May commented.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being a serious knight, she must have done her research beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is one thing I&#8217;m wondering about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia raises her hand and says.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have heard the term Demon King&#8217;s Castle and I heard a rumour that the castle is located in a mysterious fortified city on the northern continent&#8230;. No one has been able to investigate it yet, as it is inhabited by many high-ranked monsters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;.. that one. That was a hot topic for a while.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The castle became famous when several parties mentioned it as a place to investigate. The northern continent is less civilised and the monsters that inhabit it are extremely powerful, so there is not much information available and combined with its eeriness, it became a topic of conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that no one has been able to investigate it yet means it is as dangerous as it sounds. To suggest such a place shows Phylicia&#8217;s strong determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is no need to investigate this matter with regard to the Demon King&#8217;s Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it turns out, it&#8217;s a hoax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did you get your information?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Hmmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied to Phylicia, who asked me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The adventurers&#8217; party I used to be with were very curious.  As as&#8230;..result, the view was spectacular but the Demon King was not there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a nice landscape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember the vastness of the landscape because of the lack of civilization. The view of the wilderness at dusk from the top of the stone castle was so beautiful that I could watch it until sunset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,that&#8217;s just what I would expect from you,Ned-san&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu&#8230;&#8230; Ned is not what he seems to be.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Alice, who honestly admired me with a twinkle in her eye, Rushia  was slightly taken back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, who is more often drawn to her, Alice is, how can I say this, a very good girl. She&#8217;s a breath of fresh air for my soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, Riese smiled a little amusedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not so much 『King of Illusion』 as 『King of Weirdos』.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">変幻王. 変人王</span><span style="font-weight: 400">) (It’s a pun)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..In the first place, the name 『King of Illusion』itself was given by someone on their own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not that attached to a name that was given to me on its own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Returning to the subject &#8211; at present, there are few clues about the Demon King, so it is difficult to head directly to the Demon King&#8217;s stronghold. We will have to look for clues first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, instead of looking for the Demon King, we need to look for clues about the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve encountered a few hero parties on my way as an adventurer, but they were all engaged in very similar and very different activities. As May-dono said, they must investigate suspicious places, but their means are different. Some parties worked on the basis of what they heard from others, while others worked by observing the ecology of the monsters. This area would largely depend on Brain.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells the facts she has seen and heard for herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, when you say Brain, you mean &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in response to Alice&#8217;s murmur, they all looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They all nodded their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Brain&#8217;s not a character, but&#8230;&#8230;actually, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m just not very good at the combat side of things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even so, since I joined as a member to fill in for the heroes&#8217; party, I want to do my job. So, in my own way, I was considering several plans. I will explain them now.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hero party has already been dispatched by countries all over the world. We, the Kingdom of Enuvidia are quite late to the party&#8230;..and we have already investigated most of the suspicious areas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..does that mean there are no more places to investigate?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, that&#8217;s what a normal hero party would think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked into Alice&#8217;s eyes as she asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know because I have some interconnectedness with heroes from other countries&#8230;..and they are all so talented that it is hard to believe that they are the same human race. It is honestly unbelievable that they are desperately searching for the Demon King and have not even made contact with him yet”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remembering all the brave men and women I have met, I told them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suspect&#8230;&#8230;that there is a traitor in our midst.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a statement that could have been marginalised at the drop of a hat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I trust everyone here. These women would be able to carry on a constructive discussion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think there might be falsehoods in the reports of the findings?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded silently in response to Riese&#8217;s confirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is an exemplary S-class adventurer. She is familiar with all situations and understands them quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t know if that person is deliberately betraying us. It is possible that they are being manipulated or threatened by the Demon Lord. Or it could just be a lack of investigation&#8230;&#8230;Anyway, I suspect that there are actually important clues hidden in places that have once been investigated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, we are latecomers. To be clear, I don&#8217;t think we can achieve any results by following what other heroic parties are doing now&#8230;&#8230;Then why don&#8217;t we make a bold move from the very beginning?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the three members of my party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ I agree. If no one has done something like that yet&#8230;..I think it&#8217;s always worth it for us to do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said on behalf of all three of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Her Highness the Princess, who is standing beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that okay with Rushia too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu! If it&#8217;s Ned’s decision, then it doesn&#8217;t matter!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Princess Rushia  is our sponsor, so you can have more say, you know?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve decided to trust my heroic party. This mistress is going to be ready for whatever decision the Ned’s make!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That may not be a bad stance to take.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least I feel like I can live up to that trust now that I&#8217;ve heard those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, give me some time. Even though we&#8217;ve decided on the&#8230;&#8230;policy, I&#8217;d like to have some idea of where we&#8217;re going. I&#8217;ll try to contact someone I can rely on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I left everyone for a bit and took a communication stone out of my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, the communication connects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s been a long time, Ju──…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaaahhh! You! You&#8217;re Ned!!　You-aaaaah!!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A furious yell was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take the communication stone away from my ear, waited a few seconds and then  spoke again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. you sound well. I&#8217;m relieved, Julius”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I am not fine!!!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His shouts were heard again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius, the guardian knight of the Kingdom of Intail. The man who had once joined the Intail Kingdom&#8217;s heroic party in my place was now furious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I can finally say this!　I&#8217;ve always wanted to say this to you!　─ &#8211; Listen to me!　Your party is crazy!　They&#8217;re all idiots!　You&#8217;re all idiots for helping people, from reanimating, to fighting, to researching!　Nobody listens to me!』”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you become an idiot too, Julius? It might make things easier for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『How am I supposed to that HA?!!!!』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s still a loud person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m always covered in fresh wounds because of the idiot who likes to help people and the idiot who likes to fight! Just when I think I&#8217;ve finally got them by the scruff of the neck, the resuscitation idiot and the research idiot are always causing problems!　Thanks to them, I never get any rest, body and soul!　I haven&#8217;t slept!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That sounds hard. Why don&#8217;t you get that priest to cast an anti-fatigue spell on you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Don&#8217;t be silly! That woman is interested in nothing but resuscitation and she only wants to resuscitate you!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, that&#8217;s right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the best in the world at raising the dead but she could do nothing else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『She&#8217;s the kind of woman who, every time she finds a graveyard, she&#8217;s going to raise the dead from one side to the other and throw a party!　Last time she was mistaken for one of the Demon King&#8217;s henchman because of that!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, that happened a lot too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius is currently travelling with the members of the 『Stardust Light』 I created. Travelling with them has been exciting, for better or worse. More than once or twice, I was mistaken for a subordinate of the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it, the hero party I joined this time is quite sensible and reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I listened to Julius&#8217; complaints and looked at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;? Ah, um, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice is a good girl&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fhew!!? Is that so? Ehehe&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that my mind is at ease, it&#8217;s time to get down to business with Julius.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Julius. I need to have a serious conversation with you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『This is serious talk!　I&#8217;d rather not have any more serious talk──』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Julius”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s really serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called his name seriously, Julius was silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you may know, I&#8217;m going to join the Kingdom of Enuvidia&#8217;s heroic party as an alternative. And now I&#8217;m wondering about my first destination.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;&#8230; so what is it then.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want your opinion. Have there been any clues regarding the Demon King recently?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius is silent for a while and then speaks up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Soon after we left the country, we engaged the Demon Lord&#8217;s men. &#8230;&#8230; The location was the Edwin Mine. Rather than being active in the vicinity, they appeared to be on the move. They were moving north from the coast, so they may have crossed the sea.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they are on the move&#8230;..it seems that the mine itself does not need to be investigated. Even if they do investigate, let&#8217;s leave that to Julius and his team, who actually engaged the Demon King&#8217;s men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Demon King&#8217;s men crossed the sea, towns along the coast would also fall within the scope of investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The range is wide, but it may be possible to narrow it down based on the route and other factors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Thank you. In return, I&#8217;ll give you some tips on how to control Llyod and his friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『What is it then?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius sounded like Husan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The warrior love combat, but they also like hard training. If you give him a branch from a tree and say, [Learn to cut rocks with this,] he&#8217;ll immerse himself in it for a while. I think after a while it&#8217;ll seriously come true, so you&#8217;d better always have backup ideas in mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;. Where did you find such a monster, you bastard?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I killed a monster that was being hunted down and he came out of its belly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He then says [I was sleeping when it ate me]. No one knows how or why he survived. A body that is too robust may no longer be associated with a sense of danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The wizard has a voracious appetite for knowledge, so give her a rare book.Especially if it&#8217;s something she&#8217;ve never read before, she&#8217;ll be happy even if its a home-cooked recipe&#8230;&#8230;.the priest will settle down after a night in the cemetery, so it&#8217;s easier if you talk to the cemetery owner beforehand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;.What about the hero?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He&#8217;s the kind of guy who can&#8217;t leave people in trouble. So you should tell him that you are in trouble too. If you do that, he&#8217;ll listen to what you have to say&#8230;&#8230;Since you&#8217;re Julius, your pride must be getting in the way, and you&#8217;ve never once spoken out against them, have you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;&#8230;Hmph, don&#8217;t associate me with you, who have nothing. As a knight of the Kingsguard, I have a duty to live unashamedly as a knight of the Kingsguard.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, maybe that’s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am aware that I have nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s all the advice I can give you. You see&#8230;..or rather the Kingdom of Intail, has declared the disbandment of the heroes&#8217; party. I thought Julius would return to his country soon, but I see you&#8217;re still travelling together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If I could go home, I would!　Those guys are forcibly taking me around just because my title of Kingsguard Knight of the Kingdom of Intail is convenient!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re getting smarter too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as the kingdom of Intail has declared the disbandment of the heroes&#8217; party, Lloyd and the others are mere adventurers. They have no backing or anything. Julius is the only person with a decent title. They must have realised that Julius&#8217;s presence would make it easier for them to gain trust in various ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cut off communication with Julius and approached Alice and the others again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to keep you waiting&#8230;..I&#8217;ve got some good information. It seems that my previous party from the kingdom of Intail have made contact with the Demon King&#8217;s men. Let&#8217;s cross-check this sighting with the investigated areas in the vicinity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shared what Julius told me with everyone and looked at the map on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The area around the Edwin mine is noteworthy. In particular, the area to the south across the sea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this area, the areas that have already been surveyed are&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is only one place that falls under&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at Kirch&#8217;s murmur.</span></p>
