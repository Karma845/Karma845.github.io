<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is Sakaishi Yuusaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the third volume of the Networking Cheat, Ned finally ventures out.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As already explained in the previous volumes, Ned has been active under the name  『Illusion King』 . The origin of this name is that he is able to use martial arts and magic at will, but in fact, Ned has been hiring the right people for his adventures to become the  『Illusion King』  each time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, after all, Ned is also a normal boy, and he has kept a complex about his own powerlessness. Ned&#8217;s connections are recognised by heroes all over the world, but this complex is the reason why he cannot accept it honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Ned finally has a weapon that makes use of his connections with a certain magical tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This magical tool, which perhaps felt planned because of the name and other factors, was conceived while I was working on the plot of the third volume.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I won&#8217;t go into the specifics of the magical tools here for those who read the afterword first, but come to think of it, that thing seems to be hard to find in this kind of otherworldly fantasy, an element that is almost certainly present in VR stuff, but in fantasy. I&#8217;ve probably never seen it before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am sure that Ned, with his vast network of contacts, will be the pioneer of communication in this world. When I think about it, he&#8217;s gotten a weapon that fits in perfectly with all this.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s very typical of Ned that he has even acquired other weapons afterwards in a chummy way. I think it&#8217;s quite a heroic man to get a new power every time he meets someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a strange feeling, but as I wrote the three volumes I rediscovered the heroic nature of Ned and fell more and more in love with it. I would be very happy if it were the same for any of you.</span></p>
