<h3>Bizarre Love Triangle - Intermission</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Seriously, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m just as worried as you are&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a secluded corner of the hallway, Sudo and Shuji were questioning me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But for two whole days, you haven&#8217;t talked with her, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Perhaps, something happened at the Odaiba? Something we don&#8217;t know about&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of them looked very worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right after going out to play with us, the friends they had been getting along with suddenly stopped talking to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;ve been blatantly avoiding each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be impossible for them to not care about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially when it&#8217;s these two, who care about their friends, they may feel responsible for this event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m going to take that into account and still say this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Well, don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said in my usual tone with my signature fake smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s just temporary and not something serious&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really? Frankly, I can’t see this as the problem of just that level though&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true. We just had a little fight, we&#8217;re waiting for the right timing to make up&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;Of course it was a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not a situation where we could reconcile or just something that with the right timing could be fixed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were no longer able to move even one step ahead of the helpless reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to the classroom and attended the next class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The class of my English teacher, Umura-sensei, whose 60th birthday was just around the corner, was boring and I couldn&#8217;t help but look at Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was almost unconscious, and it lasted only a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Precisely at that moment, she took a small turn and turned her gaze towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as I averted my face hurriedly, she also turned her face forwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my chest with this helpless pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Bye-Bye.</span></p><div class="zetro-9e18d0d02e6f7412fd0fa5b2ef28d97e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9e18d0d02e6f7412fd0fa5b2ef28d97e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled the look on Haruka&#8217;s face when she said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have seen many faces of Haruka until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look on her when we decided to do the exchange diary, the angry look when she switched places in front of me, the happy look when she visited Odaiba. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the recent face when she said, Bye bye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it really going to end just like this&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a dream that I was kissing Yano-kun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was hugged tightly, and I was completely in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dream of overlapping lips with a very calm feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I woke up, I was very confused and I felt helpless and couldn&#8217;t help but loath at myself..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I thinking about at a time like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting Haruka in such a situation and having a dream like that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, it was recess time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw Yano-kun in his usual seat, talking with a group of friends including Sudo-san and Shuji-kun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey Yano, you like that sort of thing, right? It&#8217;s like a passing tale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, indeed! He was imitating them before, wasn&#8217;t he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..Oh, hey! Are you listening, Yano&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Hmm? Ah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he finally looked up and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;S-sorry, I was just spacing out a little&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other members of the group erupted at his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, hey! What happened to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You’re acting really weird!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No-no, I was just a little sleepy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was scratching his head absentmindedly as he said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure the reason he&#8217;s like this is because he&#8217;s worried about Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The future of the existence of Haruka, who is unreplaceable for him&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The future of the girl that I have robbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Then, I suddenly realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dream about kissing Yano-kun, it wasn&#8217;t mine&#8230; but her’s.</span></p><div class="zetro-f6b4ac32467b0197780030d073c11bce zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f6b4ac32467b0197780030d073c11bce"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may have been a dream that Haruka had dreamt of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There have been times when our dreams have been mixed up with each other while we were sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dreams of fancy stuffed animals and cute clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I woke up surprised and asked Haruka about it, she told me that it was just what she had wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, if it&#8217;s the same as before, it all seemed to make sense in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was definitely Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she still thinks that way about Yano-kun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what I can say to Haruka now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you don&#8217;t have a face to face with her or don&#8217;t share the same body properly, then you aren&#8217;t really qualified to be by her side.  (T/N :  not sure whom it was being referred to)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, please.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please, someone&#8212;&#8211;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could still clearly remember the feeling of that dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The warmth of his body. The strength of the arm around my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t remember what kind of face he was making in the dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can still remember the soft touch of his lips and the feeling of happiness that I had felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a class, when I turned around to glance at him, our eyes met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I feel like that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly turned towards the front and sighed so that no one would notice my unnatural behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps compared to other girls&#8230;. I&#8217;m a bit too vulgar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been days since we&#8217;ve last spoken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I should have settled my feelings already&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having a dream of a boy who was originally a friend&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So the Japanese translation of this&#8230; Yes, Minase-san, can you do this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yes&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly switched my mode to Akiha and headed for the blackboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked at the board and wrote out the Japanese translation, I suddenly realized that &#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;Maybe that dream was Akiha’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right&#8230; it must be so.</span></p><div class="zetro-54933d85839a062bb9bd6a0ad2553368 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-54933d85839a062bb9bd6a0ad2553368"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that were the case, it explains everything&#8212;&#8211;I think that&#8217;s the happiest ending for everyone in this scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the day I stopped being friends with Yano-kun, it seems that the distance between Akiha and Yano-kun has only grown further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only could I not find any traces of them any exchanges with each other, but Akiha seems to have stopped talking to</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> anyone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I&#8217;m really sorry about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, someday after I disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope they will meet again and be united once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope that Yano-kun and Akiha will be happy after overcoming the various entanglements that I have set upon them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the scar I made was still present in his chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just that, If there was only just a trace of me left in this world&#8212;&#8211;.</span></p>
