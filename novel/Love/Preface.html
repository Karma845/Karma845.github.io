<p class="p1"><strong>To <em>XXX</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I think this is the first time I’ve written a letter to you.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I think it may surprise you but I’m startled by this determined side of mine.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>To think the last time I wrote any characters on writing paper like I&#8217;m doing now was during elementary school.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This is maybe the first time I&#8217;ve written one ever since I wrote a letter to myself 10 years into the future way back.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I wonder how much time has passed since I met Akiha and Haruka?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I felt like close to a month, a year, maybe even ten years.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Somehow, I never fully believed that the daily life that began on that day would ever end.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I innocently and simple-mindedly believed that the days with you would continue forever.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>That’s why there certainly must have been things I’ve overlooked I think.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>For example, the stars shining in the sky on the road to school, the right hand adjusting the satchel, the lies I told for others’ sake.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The parabola which the ball drew through the air, the rising smoke from the incinerator, the unconsciously repeated speech habits.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The things I could only experience at that time.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The things that already have been lost.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>That’s why,</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>at these final moments, I want to reminiscence together with you, one by one.</strong></p>
