<h3>Chapter 3 - The Galaxy in your Lips.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry but I can’t go out with you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was called to the park after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her so, Sudo Itsuka&#8217;s face twisted into a pained expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why&#8230;&#8230;? I love you so much&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I have another important person I like… .I hope you give up on me&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So cruel&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no.” Sudo said, shaking her head sideways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the color of sadness on her face was quickly filled with anger, and she said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Will not forgive. I will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> not forgive you. I will definitely make you regret rejecting me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that&#8212;&#8211;she pointed at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You… Yano kun… you twit!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;You know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who raised his voice was Shuji, who had been watching this exchange with a wry smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How long will you continue that little charade? Can we get down to the main point now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahahaha&#8211;, that&#8217;s right&#8211;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo smiled as if the upset look on her face up till now was a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I mean, Yano, why did you suddenly start doing a confession situation? Perhaps, do you really like me after all?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course not! Or rather, I thought you were going to confess to me since you suddenly called me and told me to come to the park.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hah?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Why do I have to confess to Yano?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">saying that Sudo inflates her cheeks , but her face look anything but dissatisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo, a positive person at heart who likes fun and interesting things, couldn&#8217;t help but play along in the conversation as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she must be aware of how the people around her see her for who she is, and what kind of position that they expect her to take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But more than that, Sudo is a cheerful person to the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wants not only herself, but also the people around her to always have a smile on their face. I&#8217;m sure she seriously thinks that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why when I talk with her, I have to raise my spirits to go even higher than when I usually talk with others, that’s my way of making myself up for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I wish I didn&#8217;t have to actually do that though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could convey my feelings without making them up, I&#8217;m sure that we both could become even more important friends than we are currently..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I&#8217;m not confident that she&#8217;ll accept me for the low tension type of person I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I played the part of me that Sudo would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> me to play… I feel disgusted with myself for doing such a thing again.</span></p><div class="zetro-1e730f408cb51ac3f1d38742620de10d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1e730f408cb51ac3f1d38742620de10d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Look, you’re off topic again. Don&#8217;t veer out of the main point of this conversation!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, that&#8217;s right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shuji pointed out, and then we moved to a nearby swing set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to Sudo, Shuji seems to be much more aware of his ‘character’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He always seems to take a step back during group conversations, and he often makes comments that encourage the flow of the conversation but doesn&#8217;t actually hurt anyone either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably because Shuji is aware of not only the surface of the conversation, but also subtleties behind each person thoughts, as well as their true intentions that they’re hiding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, whenever I talk with him, I sometimes feel anxious thinking that he knows my true intentions and that he could see through my acting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo stood on the swing, and Shuji and I sat in the enclosure around it. In the evening, there are few people in the park, despite its large size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were quite a few elementary school kids playing on their DS, and a young woman with her child standing around, talking to someone. Somewhere in the distance, the siren of a fire truck wailed, and from a nearby house, I could hear the ending theme of a TV show playing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;So, what is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmm, the thing is&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Sudo fluttered her short skirt and clammed up,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Yano has been hanging out with Akiha a lot recently, aren’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I guess so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ve seen them together at school and sometimes after school as well&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;It&#8217;s been a little over a week since the day I visited the Mizuse house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to stay close to Haruka as much as possible to follow up with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Sudo had said, I was at her side all the time whenever she was at school, and sometimes we even had our review meetings in the club room after school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, I think she’s been making fewer and fewer mistakes lately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, she&#8217;s no longer just on the receiving end of the conversations anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Shuji-kun listens to old rock music, don&#8217;t you? I am not that into it, so I hope you can give me some recommendations.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[About recent movies, I think I like ‘All around us’ the most. I have a DVD at home, if you like it I can lend it to you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, she was beginning to be able to propose something to the people around her.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, her ability is probably high from the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think as long as she is clear headed and doesn&#8217;t lose her focus, she will not fall into a fatal pinch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;The problem is that she sometimes gets distracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, you know I was thinking perhaps&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo jumped off the swing set and asked modestly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;does Yano-kun like Akiha?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, that&#8217;s what she wants to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, it was something I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day we were seen at the coffee shop and getting teased so much like &#8220;are you going to marry?&#8221;. We were together for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s natural for someone to harbor such doubts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I was half prepared for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t care what people thought of me, I am going to follow Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, I like Akiha so instead of being surprised, I was embarrassed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only problem is how should I answer this question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.. hmm,why aren&#8217;t you saying anything Yano?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shuji who was watching over this development attentively laughed at the unexpectedness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought you are going to deny with your full power]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, it&#8217;s a bullseye, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo said with a high spirited voice and jumped on the swing once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought that&#8217;s definitely the case!! It was giving the vibe off a secret! That&#8217;s already love without doubt]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No no, why are you taking it okay when I haven&#8217;t said anything though]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, then do you think we are mistaken? If that&#8217;s the case why are you together so much?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that&#8217;s the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I am embarrassed to say that I like Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been friends with Sudo and Shuji for over a year now, however we have not talked about this topic before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I deny that, then I can&#8217;t explain why we are together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to tell the truth, I would say that &#8220;I follow Haruka&#8221;, but the fact that she has a dual personality is a secret between us. I can&#8217;t reveal that to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then isn&#8217;t it safe to admit that?</span></p><div class="zetro-fd3d66c9236600afa500800d8d687ca4 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-fd3d66c9236600afa500800d8d687ca4"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This way, it will be convenient for both of us too, won&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..well that&#8217;s right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After worrying for a while, I took a sigh in resignation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just like what you both said&#8230;..that, I to Akiha&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hereupon, for a moment I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I like her&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I expected I couldn&#8217;t stand the embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body began to itch, and sweat began to pour down my back and forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[B, but! So what? It&#8217;s just something I can&#8217;t help it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, it&#8217;s not bad, it&#8217;s not bad at all!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo said with glee as I raised my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she were a dog, she&#8217;d be wagging his tail like it was on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Rather it&#8217;s nice! I was wondering why Yano doesn&#8217;t talk about stuff like love etc! Fufufu, so that was the case. So your preference are girls like Akiha. I am a little surprised.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.in what way?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought Yano liked girls who were more easy going]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that if I was truly a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">light-hearted classmate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> character that I usually play with, I might like a girl who is easygoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it&#8217;s not like that at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But I feel like I understand it a bit]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shuji looked at me with a smile that could have appeared in a magazine pinup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano is attracted by something that Minase-san hold but he himself doesn&#8217;t have]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is why you can never be too careful around this guy called Hiro Shuji. He seems to be a gentle and kind man at first glance, but suddenly he gets to the heart of the matter like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, he probably doesn&#8217;t see through Akiha&#8217;s double personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even so, his reading was generally correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.well sometimes like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to admit it honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think it&#8217;s cool being like that&#8230;&#8230;or rather, forgive me already! Although I can endure your teasing, I am also serious here and it&#8217;s embarrassing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry, sorry. We didn&#8217;t mean to tease you either]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While speaking, Sudou begins to swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her checkered skirt swayed so much that her white thighs were exposed.</span></p><div class="zetro-5259daf99b883c5f66ad871ed6f6d186 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5259daf99b883c5f66ad871ed6f6d186"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey Sudo, your panties are almost visible! Move a little more carefully, will you!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What are you panicking about? It&#8217;s not like they are Akiha&#8217;s panties. I don&#8217;t want to tease you more than that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.what&#8217;s it? Then why have you called me here purposely just for that…..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Sudo jumped from the swing and landed splendidly in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I saw a pink coloured fabric but that&#8217;s probably just my imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she looked into my face, looking really happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let me volunteer for the role of cupid!]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry but I refuse.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an instant rejection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo&#8217;s loud voice gathered the eyes of the classroom in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the students and the teachers passing through the corridor seemed to be startled due to the abrupt high tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo, the self-proclaimed Cupid of Love, proposed that the four of us go to Odaiba together.  (Trivia: Odaiba is an artificial island in Tokyo Bay)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, Yano will not be able to go too far in a relationship with him playing a good guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, it seems the idea was that they could make our relationship grow in one breath by creating an unusual atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t too keen about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I would be too self-conscious to move if they prepared a strange place and looked at me expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think Akiha would be too delighted with the choice of Odaiba as a location either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I already have a reassuring ally called Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt that I didn&#8217;t need to follow up any further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I called her at night at the time of her personality to discuss the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, I want to go! I want to go!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was so loud that I had to take my ear off the receiver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Things like Hanging out with friends on weekends, I have always yearned for such things! That&#8217;s why I definitely want to go!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t oppose it when she told me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would probably be much harder to hide her dual personality than it was in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the number of people is small, it is easy for them to be aware of each other, and the time we spend together is much longer than usual, so the danger level is much higher than in a normal school life. But I also feel that this is a necessary experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she wants to perfect the &#8220;Akiha&#8217;s appearance&#8221;, then there is also need to challenge oneself in a different environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I myself was a little swayed hearing Haruka&#8217;s voice.</span></p><div class="zetro-eac9854bb016fa53e4e8883487215c9f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-eac9854bb016fa53e4e8883487215c9f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly I might also want to hang out with Akiha and Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being the case, I told Sudo &#8220;I&#8217;d be happy to go out to play&#8221; but,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, was Odaiba difficult? Um, well if that&#8217;s the case, we can go to Harajuku or Maihama or some other place]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, I don&#8217;t mean that.I&#8217;ve been a little busy on weekends lately.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha, the essential part, bluntly refused it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So I have to decline it. Why don&#8217;t you go with someone other other than me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh, um, that&#8217;s right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s totally meaningless if Akiha doesn&#8217;t come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo&#8217;s shoulder slumped and said, reluctantly separating from Akiha&#8217;s seat,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then I guess I have to reconsider it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she left, sudo glanced at me while making a regrettable face saying &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But rather then the face of Sudo, I felt a bit uncomfortable hearing the Akiha&#8217;s remark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have seen her refusing invitations like this multiple times before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was so unreserved in her refusal that Haruka, who had to copy her, felt sick to her stomach in a sorry way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;.I feel like this time is a little different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I should talk to her a bit.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry but do you have a minute?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to Akiha in the afternoon, she was just putting her school shoes in the shoe box. With her right hand still raised, she turned to me and nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gesture, the silhouette of her in the afternoon sunlight, made my heart skip a beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, it&#8217;s hard for me to maintain my composure in front of this girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I have something I want to ask]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to say it out loud and it seems like she understands my intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said while taking out the loafers from her shoe rack,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, shall we go home together?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going home together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That phrase alone brought a warm fuzzy feeling to my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance between us hadn&#8217;t gotten much closer, but I guess she wasn&#8217;t rejecting me either.</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I shouldn&#8217;t get my hopes up too high, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong to be conceited about it either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, what do you want to ask me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha asks, looking forward as we leave the school grounds together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, um, about this morning. Sudo said that she was going to Odaiba.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You said that you’re busy on weekends, but that&#8217;s a lie, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, a feeling of guilt seeped into my heart as if I was hurting Akiha&#8217;s high spirits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka told me that she only went to the hospital once in a while on weekends, so she was always free. Why did you lie and refuse her invitation?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I may be going too far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be that it&#8217;s just too troublesome to go out with Sudo and me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Akiha, who had refused the invitation with an exceedingly straightforward attitude lied only this one time. I feel like she had some kind of reason to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right. That was a lie]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sigh, Akiha admitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So Yano-kun can find out about those things, too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m trying to create a character out of nothing. I can kind of tell when other people are like that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> lying that I&#8217;m sensitive to the lies of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can often sense the gap between the real intention and the words through their facial expressions, tone of voice or just general small gestures of theirs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, this time the person who lied was Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was more confident in my ability to detect changes in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> her</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> tone and attitude than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maybe you&#8217;re not good at such places? You don&#8217;t like sightseeing places like that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;No. I have never been to Odaiba, so I don&#8217;t know.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, do you just not get along with Sudo then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I think she’s a good girl, though we have yet to become familiar with one another.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then&#8212;-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst keeping my gaze down at my feet, I tried to put my main hypothesis forward to Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You are being cautious for Haruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her response wasn&#8217;t immediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Certainly, this time it may be a bit dangerous. The four of us will be together for a very long time. Going shopping and doing other physical activities. It&#8217;s definitely more difficult doing that than hiding a dual personality at school. Is that why… you refused to let Haruka cross the dangerous bridge?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only assume that was the main reason for her refusal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha would only lie for the sake of others and even more so for the ones who are the closest to her.</span></p><div class="zetro-82f5f68fd46fe98311d1f5dd087651b0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-82f5f68fd46fe98311d1f5dd087651b0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After slowly walking for a few steps,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;That&#8217;s possible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like Akiha to be so unclear about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Perhaps, that’s one of the reasons why.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what she meant by that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to read the true meaning which was hidden behind those words very well. I can&#8217;t guess at all, the meaning that was masked by her scant expression and few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I think about it carefully, it was just like that from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Haruka, whose thoughts were always leaking out once in a while, Akiha seemed to be a bit more&#8230; secretive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though we are so close. We meet each other face to face everyday and even do the diary exchange, she still hasn&#8217;t opened herself up fully to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can&#8217;t even take a step towards the truth of the matter, which is frustrating, worrisome and a bit sad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well I&#8217;m not saying that you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at least I can say everything that I&#8217;ve been thinking about for the past while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on my best fake smile and continued to speak,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But you see, Haruka seemed to be really looking forward to it, I would have liked to let her go if possible. I will do my best to follow her, and Haruka too is recently doing very well in keeping up her facade. I&#8217;m sure it wouldn’t be terrible to do so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Besides, I think I also want to hang out together.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘With whom’ do you want to go out with?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To that question, I couldn&#8217;t say that I want to go out with Akiha. Even so, that&#8217;s all I can say for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it doesn&#8217;t work out then unfortunately I have to give up this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I see, together]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha next to me muttered, mixed with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It’s so unfair&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounded like she said something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like Akiha to say those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was that&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However before I could ask her anything about that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If you say so much, then indeed. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up and smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think I’ll go&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-7c09e23a8597e9c6f86c4011c835e880 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7c09e23a8597e9c6f86c4011c835e880"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the nervousness and worry I&#8217;d been through up to this point seemed to have paid off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I put away all my doubts and worries aside, and took out my smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I will immediately contact Sudo about it.]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are types of people who say that the time to prepare for a trip is the most enjoyable part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, Sudo was one of those people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was before a field trip for the whole school year, when she was just a freshman. She was so excited that she took me and Shuji out to buy her belongings, and was very absorbed in deciding the schedule and route of the trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not satisfied with just looking up recommended spots on the Internet, she finally bought several travel books and put sticky notes on more pages than she could possibly visit on the trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still remember the look of disappointment on Sudo&#8217;s face as she gave up on some of her choices, and the smile on her face when she finally found a course that she was satisfied with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course she enjoys the trip itself very much as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She enjoyed the unagi seiro-mushi (steamed eel) on the way down the Yanagawa River, stroked the heart-shaped stone in Glover Garden, and was so intoxicated by the night view of Kobe from the ferry that she said &#8220;this city is going to sleep&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But looking at her, so excitingly when she is in the preparatory stage. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if that was Sudo&#8217;s main focus for the whole trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than actually visiting the site, she was thinking about a tourist spot far away from her home town and imagining herself there, which was her &#8220;field trip&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And apparently, there is another person of that kind near me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">April 25th (Wednesday), Haruka</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just looking at Venus Fort on my phone, and there are so many stores over there! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do? I can&#8217;t go and look around all of them….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m curious about diversity and the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.</span></p>
<p><b><br />
<p style= "text-align:center;">*****</p>
</br>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">April 26th (Thursday), Haruka</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m interested in bubble soccer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seems a little scary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I guess this is what the Gundam in Odaiba looks like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the decision to go to Odaiba was made, Haruka has been in very high spirits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it was in the club room where we gathered together for the review meeting or in the exchange diary, the topic was only about the trip</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she had never really gone out with her friends before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it, I can&#8217;t help but wish that this weekend would be a fun one.</span></p><div class="zetro-0b50656458b8f12b1b4a0c686802462a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0b50656458b8f12b1b4a0c686802462a"></div>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rain that had been drizzling down the night before had cleared up by the time we arrived at the meeting place, Nishiogikubo station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You are late.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the black wet asphalt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo was already there next to Shuji, with her hands around her hips and a grumpy look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We have been waiting for a long time, you are always late like that, aren&#8217;t you Yano! You are naturally late.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, no, I&#8217;m not late! There’s still five minutes before the meeting time!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked my phone worriedly and I wasn&#8217;t mistaken.There was still time before the promised ten o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s not enough to be on time for the meeting! Some people, like us, arrive early because they&#8217;re looking forward to the event, so it&#8217;s up to the smart high school students to take those people into account!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sudo, who says that, is the one who arrived five minutes later, right after me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Sudo who was fuming with anger, Shuji said that whilst laughing bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then he looked behind my back with that face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, you’re here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really! Hey! Akiha!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see Akiha coming across the intersection of Kita Ginza Street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m the last one to arrive.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came running towards us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, the personality present is Akiha&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrangement for today is to spend the whole morning shopping together with Akiha and in the afternoon after the personality changes to Haruka&#8217;s, we will go to the Amusement facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s okay, we still have time before the meeting!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey! The way you treated me before was very different!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course I will! It&#8217;s always ladies first, ladies first.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying something incomprehensible, Sudo turned toward the station, seemingly unable to wait any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then everyone, let&#8217;s go!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She began to walk lightly. All of us followed her after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, don&#8217;t worry too much, just imagine that you’re in a really big boat.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said in a voice only she could hear whilst walking next to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka has been doing very well recently, so I will properly follow her path.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha was so worried about Haruka that she had refused this plan and even went as far as telling a lie to avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she is filled with anxiety even now.</span></p><div class="zetro-203fcfc61ae609fbe306753e6c6b2f9c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-203fcfc61ae609fbe306753e6c6b2f9c"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I wanted to at least convey my enthusiasm to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of my goals is to make sure Akiha also enjoys herself very well. Of course, the same goes for Haruka too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice of Akiha who said that, felt weaker than ever and was somewhat faint.</span></p>



 

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Are you okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I get anxious and look at her… I feel like Akiha&#8217;s face has turned very pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her originally whitish skin was tinged with a bluish-like tint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her facial expressions seemed like she was tired, her gait seemed heavy and there seemed to be something she&#8217;s bearing under her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you feeling unwell? If that&#8217;s the case, don&#8217;t strain yourself too much.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, I&#8217;m all right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha shook her small neck after saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m just a little sleep deprived, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m sorry for making you worry&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if it was maybe due to Haruka being in a bit too high spirits last night that made her unable to sleep properly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, considering the tension we&#8217;ve been experiencing, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s understandable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I shouldn&#8217;t be overly concerned about her condition anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Changing my anxious mind, I held my phone up to the reader of the automatic ticket gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After changing trains at Shimbashi and Kanda, we boarded the Yurikamome train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst dodging the high spirited Sudo’s questions, we passed over the rainbow bridge and arrived at Odaiba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first stop was the Venus Fort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, this dress definitely looks good in autumn!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really? Isn&#8217;t it a little too mature?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the two women went on a shopping spree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo happily dragged Akiha around, and Akiha followed her, unsure but still not entirely concerned either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I didn&#8217;t know much about clothing, I just watched them from a distance. It was impossible for me to imitate Shuji who is always picking up bags and giving his opinion from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Be that as it may,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What are you saying! It&#8217;s because Akiha is a sombre type of beauty so that much is okay to wear, you know!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was watching Akiha choose her own clothes. Just watching her sometimes trying them on her body is pretty fun in its own way&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then&#8230; I&#8217;ll try them on.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, yeah, go ahead.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Sudo&#8217;s back to her, Akiha headed towards the fitting area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking off her shoes, she entered a small changing room and closed the curtains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was watching her without knowing why,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufufu&#8230;.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p><div class="zetro-bc1d88c31f4f7f6135f2c6284ec6b7a7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-bc1d88c31f4f7f6135f2c6284ec6b7a7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo abruptly crept near me and started laughing meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Akiha is currently undressing behind that curtain, you know&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;You know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflexively, I shouted loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you a perverted old man! Don&#8217;t you have any sense of delicacy!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking the same thing she was before she said it though&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt embarrassed and frustrated, as if someone was peeking inside my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Err, but that&#8217;s the truth, isn&#8217;t it? After removing her coat and dress, I&#8217;m sure she must be in her underwear inside. And you know what? Akiha looks like that but her b***s are splendidly big.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Like I said! You don&#8217;t need to say that! Give me a break, will you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, even I was aware of that myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the overall impression that Akiha gives off is of a thin &amp; slender-like beauty, I was surprised more than just a few times at the volume of her chest whenever she wears her gym or even just some slender-like plain clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I felt that it would be too dishonest of me to be too conscious of Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also felt like I was betraying Haruka in a way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m trying hard not to look at her with such eyes as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;You know, Yano]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly Sudo’s expression slackened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slightly maturish smile appeared on her young but well groomed face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[From a bystander&#8217;s view, I feel like you are awfully careful about Akiha&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Careful&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At an unexpected serious point coming from her, I repeated those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah. It’s like you don&#8217;t want to go too far or you don&#8217;t want to hurt her in any way. It feels like you’re being a bit over cautious&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmm…. Ah&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s true that I may be doing such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s one thing for her to try to keep her distance from the people around her, but at the same time, I&#8217;m definitely trying not to step into her boundaries too much myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Because of her personality, I can understand why Akiha wants to do so. But you know, she’s also a normal 16 year old girl… And she seems to trust Yano-kun quite a lot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Oh, really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, I do. Don&#8217;t you feel that from Akiha&#8217;s attitude?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s, well&#8230; I have]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, sometimes Akiha has that sort of attitude towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like ‘I&#8217;m glad that it was Yano-kun’ or ‘If it&#8217;s Yano-kun, I don&#8217;t mind.’</span></p><div class="zetro-129f16e439238d73b569dec01c9b5d15 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-129f16e439238d73b569dec01c9b5d15"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I understand her words superficially, it would mean that she trusts me a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m not very confident in that regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will Akiha, whose personality is like this, trust others so easily?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t it just a mixture of my wishful thinking and unrequited love?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And besides&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo continued as I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In yesterday&#8217;s PE class, we were talking about Yano-kun. She even said that she was really glad he was there&#8230;]     (T/N : just in case if they don&#8217;t know, PE &#8211; physical education)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Seriously?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’m seriously serious. She said &#8220;I was worried about transferring to a new school, I feel like I am doing well now, thanks to him.&#8221;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I thought, isn&#8217;t it something that Haruka might have said? But then I thought back… yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure the personality at the time of PE was definitely Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Seriously, is that right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So&#8230; maybe I should be a little more confident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was careful not to get too close but maybe it might be a good idea to shorten the distance a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The first thing to do is to be a little more casual. It&#8217;s okay to glance at her b*****s or have lewd fantasies about her because she&#8217;s the girl you like.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, like I said, don&#8217;t say such things!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You don&#8217;t have to be so mad! That much is normal for a highschool boy, normal!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That might be so but don&#8217;t say that deliberately! This is a public place&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;that&#8217;s a serious story]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abruptly, the tone of Sudo&#8217;s voice dropped, and she looked up at me without smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We are already at&#8230;&#8221;that age&#8221;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What do you mean by &#8220;that age&#8221;?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[At 16 years old, we are neither adults nor children. When that happens, it&#8217;s not like &#8220;Yay! We became lovers! What a happy ending!&#8221; Or &#8220;We promptly kissed&#8221; in love either]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That may be true&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but look at her once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo may seem like a cheerful person but sometimes she shows some keen thoughts about human relationships. That&#8217;s the kind of vivid thinking that makes me afraid of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sure this story isn&#8217;t a joke or something said without any consideration to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s natural to go beyond that, and that might hurt or maybe something else will happen. The relationship will probably be much more complicated than it ever could have been before. So, don&#8217;t deny those feelings or make fun of them lightly&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, Sudo finally smiled slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think it&#8217;s better to think about it and come to terms with it on your own.]</span></p><div class="zetro-d314cfbe1e49ca60f736b813458b9263 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d314cfbe1e49ca60f736b813458b9263"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, right&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she&#8217;s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our love is no longer like a cheesy love story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s possible to betray, cheat, and even lie about things sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, maybe we should not only suppress our feelings, but also think of ways to understand and deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you. I will keep that in mind.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah. Anyway, you have to pay four thousand yen for Sudo-sensei&#8217;s romance course.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s too expensive for such a short course!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like that, we returned to our usual arguments,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s so expensive about it!! It&#8217;s much cheaper than a prep school!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why is the standard for your prices a prep school! You think you are a popular lecturer or something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.Suddenly, I felt ashamed of myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo gave me advice by seriously thinking about me and my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I have been creating a character and treating her like a lie all this while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This relationship has been going on for a long time now, and it&#8217;s becoming the norm, but. &#8230;.The truth is, this is very dishonest of me, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no different than just lying to someone all the time, isn&#8217;t it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Isn&#8217;t it obvious that I&#8217;m a popular lecturer! I&#8217;m sure that if there’s such a beautiful lecturer present out there, she will be in high demand for many commercials!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s the kind of commercial that gets people talking! It&#8217;s a pattern that will start appearing in variety shows at this rate!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shall we stop it now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shall I stop making a character in front of her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it&#8230; it&#8217;s not like Sudo will change the way she interacts with me in any way if she knows about my true self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you take the first step, you&#8217;ll be able to get by, don&#8217;t you think?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right! That&#8217;s why I want to think about monetization as soon as possible, so when should I start? Now th&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Hey, Sudo]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out her name in the middle of her rant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Hmm? What is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure if she sensed something from my expression, but she nodded her head without a trace of displeasure present in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those eyes were like a small animal gazing at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cheerful and small face that I&#8217;m used to seeing everyday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.It&#8217;s all right.</span></p><div class="zetro-3887f63c086e52978c01671aa5207348 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-3887f63c086e52978c01671aa5207348"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s her, I&#8217;m sure that she will come to grips with my true feelings, that&#8217;s why just as I opened my mouth timidly&#8230;. At that moment.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Ah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was pierced by an icy anxiety that went through my entire body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if I was standing in a dark black hole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flashback of bitter memories passes through my vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say a thing out of my open mouth. My hands and feet were numb, and I couldn&#8217;t move a finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Sudo was,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.What&#8217;s wrong, Yano?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up at me strangely, who was stiffened with his mouth open. At that moment, the curtain of the fitting room opened up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Akiha came out from the inside, she was wearing a mature outfit of a rider&#8217;s jacket, a subdued red floral print dress, and black pumps, and she was looking here with extreme embarrassment present on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Oh! This looks good]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without giving any damn about me over here, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s really good! It&#8217;s nice because Akiha has a mature face. After all, this kind of thing is also good on you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hereupon, finally my stiffened body started to loosen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Akiha who came out of the fitting room timidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, I think it looks cool. It&#8217;s like a mature-girly sort of vibe.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Mature girly&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Repeating it like a child, Akiha turned towards me and ask,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;How?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha looked a little uncharacteristically anxious at that question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I think it looks good on you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered a bit unconsciously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, I think it looks good on you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not flattery or anything, that&#8217;s what I had thought seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black and red outfit she’s wearing seemed to bring out and accentuate Akiha&#8217;s &#8220;sexiness&#8221;, which had not been emphasized thus far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I liked the outfit &#8211; I thought it was quite natural and suited her well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn&#8217;t really paid much attention to it, but maybe Sudo has a sense of coordinating clothes well too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230; Okay. Then I’ll buy it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Akiha hurriedly returned to the fitting room and closed the curtain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Did you see?]</span></p><div class="zetro-1c4cd573bf2d3fc212dbd6cfb62ebdb7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1c4cd573bf2d3fc212dbd6cfb62ebdb7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo looked at me and smiled proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano just cared about such things a lot and was worried too much. That&#8217;s why first of all, have some confidence.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, that might be so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I lost the timing again and returned the words to Sudo with the usual fake smile plastered on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we had done our shopping, Sudo and Shuji left for the restroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha and I sat in the waiting area, side by side on the chairs </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Finally, it&#8217;s a little calm now.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, a deep breath naturally escaped my lungs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t do this kind of shopping very often, but it&#8217;s quite physically demanding, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guilt I felt towards Sudo was still gnawing at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My self-loathing and regret for not taking the plunge continues to smolder in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re right. I&#8217;m sorry you have to carry them.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t mind it too much. It&#8217;s not like they’re too heavy.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short shopping spree, I was beginning to feel better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It will probably cause trouble to others if I remain depressed as I was, so I think it may be better to hurriedly switch and return to my usual self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Akiha bought the jacket, dress and black pumps from the store earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a set of clothes that she had been trying on earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a bit heavy, and it would be pretty hard for a girl to carry around for a long period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced over at Akiha stealthily but as expected, her face looked pale unlike usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if she is ok or not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if she is in a lot of pain!? After I become anxious, I make up my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wasn&#8217;t Sudo also saying that? That it will be better if I have more confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn&#8217;t shown my true appearance but… I think I should take this opportunity to shorten the distance with Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I should take this opportunity to get closer to Akiha, so as not to waste Sudo&#8217;s feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my mouth on the pet bottle I was holding and before I knew it, the cola inside had become slightly carbonated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a small breath so as not to be exposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, trying to keep my voice as normal as possible,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;You know.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said.</span></p><div class="zetro-aff56ae7acfc3b50ec477d2260fb9448 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-aff56ae7acfc3b50ec477d2260fb9448"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If something happened, you can just tell me&#8230; okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What do you mean by something happening?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha tilted her neck, with a tired look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s&#8230; I hope it’s wrong but&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that as a preface, I confided in Akiha the feelings I had kept in my heart all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I sometimes worry about Akiha, thinking that she might have something that she can&#8217;t tell anyone. I wonder if she&#8217;s keeping her worries and problems to herself&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The palms of my hands were sweating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart started to beat a little bit harder than usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha stared at me motionlessly without saying anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Akiha doesn&#8217;t really show much of her feelings to others, do you? Haruka is too defenseless but you are the exact opposite of her. That itself isn&#8217;t something bad but… there are times I feel uneasy looking at you. It’s as if you are holding something back?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha has been under so much stress that she ended up creating a double personality and even now, the second personality is still alive inside of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that she had already solved the cause of her stress, but I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was worried about her secrecy, her unseen true feelings, and the dark circles under her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And that&#8217;s only if I&#8217;m not mistaken and if Akiha doesn&#8217;t mind either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tightly grasping the handle of paper bag from the clothing store,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hope you talk to me a bit more&#8230; I think.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s eyes widened slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may have been my imagination, but I felt it happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hope you can rely on me more&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after a brief pause,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Is that so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s voice was a little faint as she said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If there&#8217;s something I can&#8217;t say, why is Yano-kun trying to help me? Why are you asking me to rely on you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s because I like you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words came to my throat, but I swallowed them just in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t express my feelings yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have the courage, confidence, time nor preparation to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Isn&#8217;t it obvious? We are friends after all&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-b78fd94b58ccfaf0aaa19b24bf75db2e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-b78fd94b58ccfaf0aaa19b24bf75db2e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I evaded the question with such a pathetic lie. (T/N : originally, it&#8217;s a saying, &#8220;such miserable lie will make the tea go bad&#8221; or something similar but I just simplified it for you guys)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I wish that there was something I could do. For Akiha&#8217;s and Haruka&#8217;s sake.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, silence filled the air between us, with the noise of various tourists going around and the announcement in the hall to inform us about a lost child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, as if to blend into the gap between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;That&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha smiled a little sadly saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano-kun says things like that, don&#8217;t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little caught up within her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a remark as if she knew beforehand what I was going to say to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I don&#8217;t really understand what Akiha&#8217;s thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she turns her crestfallen eyes toward me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hope one day&#8230; I can tell Yano-kun everything.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you, I will be waiting for that time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umm, thank you too&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t know her true feelings about anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s thinking nor do I know how she truly feels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I felt that our relationship had made some progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we aren&#8217;t at odds, if we both aren&#8217;t misunderstanding things, then I should be able to convey my feelings to Akiha a little better now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Ah, after around ten minutes, we are going to switch.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha said abruptly in a muttering voice looking at her wrist watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is it already time&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like recently the time for the substitution is getting shorter and shorter. I haven&#8217;t measured it precisely, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s only by a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for me, who is around her every day, the change is something that strangely bothers me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Take care of Haruka for me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, leave it to me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We kept you waiting&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I nod back to Akiha, Sudo and Shuji finally return back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Iyaaa-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the restroom was unimaginably crowded! I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting so long!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure, these guys must have been late on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While exuding gratitude for that,</span></p><div class="zetro-b40f3963c320724870dc1eaaf1d09e40 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-b40f3963c320724870dc1eaaf1d09e40"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Really! We&#8217;re too late, we&#8217;ve been talking too much!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We laughed at each other and got up from our seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, this is the place&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was before noon that she switched to Haruka and it was a little past twelve pm when we finished a light lunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying so, Haruka looked around the amusement park facility where she arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s the first time I’ve come here, to this place! I don&#8217;t go to game arcades very often&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The excited look on her face made me realise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike us and Akiha, Haruka&#8217;s outing has just begun&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a sports complex with not only game machines and printed sticker machines, but there was also a mini bike track, basketball, tennis, futsal courts, and even a batting center present here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since most of the members like to move their bodies, this is where they decided to go today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo used to play lacrosse in junior high school, and Shuji used to play basketball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it might be correct to say Akiha too is active in PE when she&#8217;s not in her Haruka personality.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since the plan was to bring me and Akiha closer together in the first place, why didn&#8217;t they make the destination more suitable for me who doesn&#8217;t exercise? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there is another problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah! But what should I do? I&#8217;m getting nervous&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Sudo and the others were taking care of the reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka says so and curls up her body restlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I wonder if I can do well&#8230;&#8230;.it would be better if I don&#8217;t make any blunder&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the most critical point of this outing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Haruka has become able to act like Akiha when it comes to everyday conversation and classroom behavior, the only thing she still can&#8217;t do well is in sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently she doesn&#8217;t have much confidence in this place, as it seems that she would drop the ball whenever it passes to her, tripping while running or twisting her leg while trying to jump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, she has been trying to maintain her character by observing PE classes when Haruka&#8217;s personality is on stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there will be a limit to that approach at some point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, I wish she could move her body very well without any problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she can play sports like Akiha, then she won&#8217;t have any trouble in her daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She will be able to play the role perfectly, that&#8217;s the gist of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;hmm, ah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Haruka looked here anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she said&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.. Perhaps Yano-kun is angry?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.huh? Why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. somehow your face is a little more scary compared to usual today&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t meant to be]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, I should have said that I&#8217;m in a good mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a while ago, I was able to get closer with Akiha a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m excited but I can&#8217;t think of any reason to get angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;..just,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m just a little tired from infrequent excursion]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In spite of her words, Haruka&#8217;s gaze is still wandering around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed a little discomfort in her actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I felt these feelings were when I visited her house. It has been like that since I was a little skeptical about uniting her personality.</span></p><div class="zetro-c8585d164b2e66669f58a85293f5aef9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c8585d164b2e66669f58a85293f5aef9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting closer to Akiha, so that they can become one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know what it means and I also know how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;&#8230;I wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why am I getting this uncomfortable feeling from this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry. Perhaps I&#8217;m thinking too much&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Actually, I ended up quarreling with Akiha yesterday]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Quarrel? Akiha and Haruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve had a real fight like that, so I guess I&#8217;m a little too nervous about a lot of things&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I haven&#8217;t heard about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have been with Akiha for around two hours but she hasn&#8217;t said a word about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t imagine it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fight between gentle Haruka and quiet and calm Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What could have caused such a thing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, rather before that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Do two personalities ever get into fights?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. Well it&#8217;s quite different from normal people fighting&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How is it different&#8230;.?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There are many ways to do it, but this time we wrote a lot of things in a notebook and started to argue]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..it&#8217;s going to take some time again]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fight over a correspondence every two hours is&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting restless and jittery while waiting for their response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;. that&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;fua&#8230;&#8230;..].       (T/N : fua &#8211; SFX for yawn)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka nodded and yawned loudly with her hand over her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why we couldn&#8217;t get enough sleep last night&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So that&#8217;s the cause why she had been feeling bad since morning</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, but it&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s not hard and I also don&#8217;t mind the fight as the reason isn&#8217;t something of great importance&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I&#8217;m still curious about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Akiha has deliberately avoided talking about the fight.</span></p><div class="zetro-c0c3c56c92738e6c2d78f350d49d5e01 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c0c3c56c92738e6c2d78f350d49d5e01"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why content is something she isn&#8217;t probably comfortable talking about]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, for now more than that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Finally! We are done with reception work! First is basketball!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you. Shall we go?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Haruka hurriedly fixed her expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope she can enjoy here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to support her so that she can move her body without any hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was late afternoon on the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The facility was crowded with groups of high school and college students like us. It was also crowded with families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We weaved our way through the gaps and luckily secured a vacant basketball court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It became a match of 2 on 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teams were divided into Sudo and Shuji&#8217;s team versus Yano and Mizuse&#8217;s team. Considering the difference in ability, it was probably not the best arrangement, but apparently they were paying attention to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as a result, the match was one sided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Akiha, take care of it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230;&#8230;..ah, I&#8217;m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka dropped the ball I passed on to her who was waiting under the goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is Akiha constantly making small mistakes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m paying attention so that she can be active as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having her stay down the goal, I try to pass the ball as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I intend for her to be in charge of rebound and shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she&#8217;s getting nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her acting better than before, I could still see the lack of confidence in her eyes at times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah! What&#8217;s the matter, Akiha! You moved so much better in gym class!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; let&#8217;s rethink about the team formation]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two exercise enthusiasts couldn&#8217;t help but feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, fine!! Let&#8217;s go without Shuji vs Shuji this time. He&#8217;s so tall, it&#8217;s not fair!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahahaha, well right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Re, really? Then maybe I should ask you&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the game was changed into 1 vs 3, Shuji with basketball experience versus us.</span></p><div class="zetro-c84176de10aefe475c06d37bddf3c303 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c84176de10aefe475c06d37bddf3c303"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I think it turned out to be a pretty good game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even for Shuji, as expected, he had a hard time against three opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was slowly scoring points, and his freshly smiling forehead was sweating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unconsciously, both I and Sudo were absorbed in the perfect balance of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But while Haruka seemed to be enjoying the game, she sometimes showed the expression of impatience at the mistakes she kept spilling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmm, it&#8217;s not going well&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About an hour had passed since we arrived here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the batting corner, where I came to try to calm down a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka&#8217;s shoulders slumped in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I feel like I&#8217;m getting deflated. Mistakes any more than that will be bad&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shuji and Sudo were in a corner a little farther away, making a pleasant sound with their bats. They shouldn&#8217;t be able to hear our conversation from here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka stood in the batter box taking the bat in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A straight pitch was thrown from the pitching machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka swung her bat weakly but she missed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Uuu~ what should I do&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slumped her shoulders down and said with a teary face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, she improved a little then before, this much is enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, she was too afraid of the flying balls to even stand in the batter&#8217;s box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We somehow managed to get past that stage but she still doesn&#8217;t know when to swing the bag. The form has a lot of problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I think she has good sense seeing that she has managed to progress that much despite the short time we have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I need to do is,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If it doesn&#8217;t work with such a small group of students, there&#8217;s no way a gym class can be successful&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time she made a mistake, it made her feel more and more depressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought, while standing in the batter box next to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do so that she can gain more confidence? So that she can relax and exert her all?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8230;&#8230;.I realised suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Speaking of which&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to look at Haruka, who was fiddling with her bat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If I think about it again, it&#8217;s okay even if you can&#8217;t play baseball very well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.huh?why?]</span></p><div class="zetro-c47f1a1b8f4a2d139d8c6afeb1ad9db7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c47f1a1b8f4a2d139d8c6afeb1ad9db7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We talked about it during our lunch break before. Sudo who like professional baseball game very much, when asked Akiha which team she like, she said she doesn&#8217;t even watch professional baseball and in all of the ball games, this was the only ball game she isn&#8217;t good at]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Really? It&#8217;s true, I never talked about baseball with her, but&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, I knew it. I like to play ball, but compared to other ball games, baseball is a bit special, isn&#8217;t it? Hitting it with a bat, running after hitting it&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know, I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable with it.]</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really?&#8230; I didn&#8217;t know that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t need to work hard here. Just do it as if you were relaxing yourself. You must be tired, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see. You’re right&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Haruka exhaled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In that case, I will just do it without getting too worked up about it&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a nod, I also started batting half-heartedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I pressed the switch on the pitching machine and struck out a few times&#8230; I also observed Haruka&#8217;s current condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first, second and third pitches she striked out are pretty much the same until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, at the fourth pitch, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Woah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time, the ball grazed the bat and flew in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you okay? It didn’t hit your face or anything, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I&#8217;m fine. But did you see it? I just hit it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, you did.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I smiled at her and, pretending to be nonchalant about it, returned to my batting centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From that point on, Haruka&#8217;s growth was remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the blink of an eye, her hit rate increased and so did the distance the actual ball covered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, I hit it! Yano-kun! I hit the board for double the points!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In less than fifteen minutes, she was able to hit long shot distances consistently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s amazing&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it was far beyond my expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought that she might improve a little bit, but&#8230; I didn&#8217;t expect her to reach this high of a level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think she’s already more of a pro than me now, no doubt about that..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s time to reveal the truth now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Hey, Haruka]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Haruka, who was smiling and pointing at the double base hit board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How is it? Are you feeling a little more confident now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, I&#8217;m really happy releasing this, I can hit it so far and it&#8217;s really fun!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, then I&#8217;m glad. And I have something I want to apologise for]</span></p><div class="zetro-141d1e6161c912edd31ef8fca4a13771 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-141d1e6161c912edd31ef8fca4a13771"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Earlier, I said that Akiha didn&#8217;t like baseball, that was a lie.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Huh? Really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a bat in her hand, Haruka looked puzzled at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah. I have never heard Akiha talk about this before. I think she can play baseball just fine. But then I thought, “Maybe Haruka can&#8217;t do well because she has a high hurdle set against her from the beginning.” And so, I thought, if I could remove those hurdles burdened on you and you play with an ease mind, maybe it could bring out your true potential.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s like the royal road in Novels, movies and manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;A rare genius composer and an earnest court music director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;A honor student brother and an inferior brother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-A legendary hero and a mediocre sorcerer for a sibling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When faced with a hurdle too high, no human being can help but be affected by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They can&#8217;t help but be jealous, go astray, and lose confidence in themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is true even if the person has superior talent within them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka probably has something similar to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Akiha can handle anything dexterously, it was a high hurdle imposed on her who had to cross it to release her potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8212;&#8212;-what if you remove those shackles, even if it’s temporary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you can&#8217;t see it, even if it&#8217;s a lie, Haruka can show her true power without any issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Indeed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying this, Haruka stared at her palm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I feel like I can do it more normally now.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see. Then as an experiment, try batting again. You probably can already reach the same level as Akiha, so take it easy.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ok… I’ll try it out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Haruka returned to her batting box and pushed the button for the pitcher machine to begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She missed the first two strikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that she has regained her instinct already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next pitch was a sharp second liner, followed by a fly to left field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next one was a long shot to the third base board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s when I heard someone&#8217;s voice coming from behind&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Akiha is amazing&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Sudo&#8217;s voice, coming from next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked over to see that Shuji and him had already finished batting, returned their bats and helmets, and came over to check on us.</span></p><div class="zetro-3456b6f34860cbb41edd4502aa6a581e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-3456b6f34860cbb41edd4502aa6a581e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That hit just now was amazing!!! It was Akiha doing that, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I didn&#8217;t know you could even hit that long with such dainty hands.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo and Shuji seemed to be really impressed with Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked at the situation here with a fleeting glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Now then, what’s gonna happen next?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem is definitely, beginning here onwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, Haruka was able to overcome her lack of self-confidence with no issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8230; how about in front of her classmates?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can you hit such shots in front of Sudo and the others who represent them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first pitch&#8212;-Bad, she made a tsk sound and grazed the ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Foul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second hit&#8212;&#8212;It was slightly off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strike. With this, it&#8217;s now two strikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now then, the third strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked at me briefly, gave a small smile, and swung the bat just in time with the timing of the ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pleasant sound resounded within the box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ball was caught in the center and flew straight towards the right side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Woah, amazing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You really got it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It splendidly hit the third board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Thank god, it hit.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked back and displayed her clenched fist.   (T/N : victory pose)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I ended up a little nervous seeing Sudo and the others watching me&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We met up again and played a few more sports together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Futsal, tennis, golf, and mini-bikes.     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka was only able to participate in the futsal and the mini-bike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time in between other sports was spent by Akiha but at least Sudo and the others didn&#8217;t suspect the boundaries between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Haruka made her fair share of mistakes in each sport too.</span></p><div class="zetro-c37415f5d688860464bedffa8844e8f7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c37415f5d688860464bedffa8844e8f7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, she stumbled and missed quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, once she learned to play with confidence, she soon began to improve rapidly and play with a good sense of style.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This must be it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here on after, she will not be afraid to play with the others in gym class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She might make some blunders in the beginning but she should be able to improve herself from there on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, the goal of Haruka to get closer to Akiha in general is now clearer than before.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ve always wanted to ride one of these!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the slowly ascending gondola.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka said as she looked through the glass at the city of Tokyo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wah! It&#8217;s my first time riding like this. I’m kind of nervous&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her profile was glittering with the lights of the commercial facilities below her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scenery outside the window was in the midst of transitioning from the evening to night, intricately colored with the orange of the western sky, the dark blue of the eastern sky, and the marble pattern of clouds in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just before eighteen o&#8217;clock when we left the amusement center. [ED: 6 PM]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun was just about to set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had been there for almost six hours, and we were all exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we have scheduled to return before dinner, we decided to take one last ride on the Ferris Wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m not Akiha.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka said, as if she had suddenly realized what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even though it&#8217;s the most awaited romantic moment between you two, I&#8217;m the one who’s outside right now&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What are you saying?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but smile at her apologetic expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka is also an important friend of mine, so it&#8217;s okay. I had a really good time today&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I also had a good time toge&#8212;-ah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Haruka looked here and returned to her seat,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you very much for today! Really! Thanks to Yano-kun, I now know how to be more confident. Thanks to your support, I feel like I can do much better from now on.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see…  I&#8217;m glad.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You know, I&#8217;m really, really, really grateful!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Squeezing her hand, Haruka insisted desperately for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Going out with friends for the first time, having the most fun I ever had in my entire life, and on top of that I have finally resolved the issue which was troubling me for a long time&#8230; I really don&#8217;t know how to thank you]</span></p><div class="zetro-eeb70c3f9f0b44e608e9f51f33d66c59 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-eeb70c3f9f0b44e608e9f51f33d66c59"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s fine. From here on, you just have to co-operate to set up a situation between Akiha and me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..I really wonder if it&#8217;s enough with just that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s fine. See, aren&#8217;t we guys friends? We both have the same thought, we want to become ourselves, with each other.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Friends&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those words, Haruka returned back to her seat again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;You know, there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s bothering me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano-kun hates that he had to make a character, right? It&#8217;s because of that that you are concerned about me, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, yeah..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But, I&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked up at me with a serious face and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing that Yano-kun has to create a character. It’s different from a dual personality, but I think it&#8217;s also a part of making the surrounding people happy. Or rather, both Sudo-san and Shuji-kun, the guys from the other class, all of them are having fun thanks to Yano-kun&#8217;s efforts&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m not so sure about that&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed and rubbed my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I just haven&#8217;t seen it in that way. I mean, I feel like I&#8217;m lying to them, or like I&#8217;m doing something wrong&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right… Moreover, despite what Yano-kun thinks, you continue to act as your characters. That means-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka cut her words here for once and opened her mouth timidly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Is there a reason why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;A reason?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The reason, or like, the trigger that led you to continuously create your character even though you dislike it so much&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly look flustered,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, I&#8217;m sorry for asking such a strange question! You don&#8217;t need to reply to that, it&#8217;s okay even if you don&#8217;t answer!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not like I mind that… but trigger, huh&#8230;]</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, I am feeling overly guilty for ‘Creating a character’ towards others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, why is that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why do I continue to create characters in spite of this sense of rejection within me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I think I have some idea of why&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Can I ask you why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, it&#8217;s fine.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I began explaining about my junior high school memories to Haruka, something that I had never told anyone before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I was never really the type to create a character or anything like that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[A bullying character, a bullied character, a clutz¹ character, a tsukkomi-like character, an S character, an M character, an Otaku-like character, a Delinquent-like character. In the first year of high school, such guys began to appear in our class; however, originally, human nature is not supposed to be that easy to separate or label themselves, right? So I couldn&#8217;t understand the reason why they could label themselves and any others and why it was the norm to do so.]  (T/N :Clutz, people who often trip around and make some kind of mistakes. Tsukkomi, a person who retorts to jokes or something like a stand up comedian. An S and M character, which stands for a sadistic and masochistic person.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I can understand why entertainers act it out on TV. They are playing characters in order to clarify the role they were given and create a laugh track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same goes for any characters in a story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As their characters are fixed, their relationships become clearer and it becomes easier to create ups and downs in the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we are not entertainers, much less the characters in a story. And yet, why do we have to push ourselves to play such characters?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka listened to the conversation with a serious face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And the number one thing I couldn&#8217;t understand was deciding what is acceptable and what is not, depending on the characters you play. A bullying character will torment a bullied character as much as he wants. In fact, the person being teased should feel good about that. The reason why he talks so badly is because he has a sharp tongue-like character and you shouldn’t complain about it at all. Everything the idiotic character says is just an idiotic remark, so it&#8217;s okay to make fun of them. That&#8217;s what I couldn&#8217;t understand. All I could think was that it couldn&#8217;t be so simple.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In those days, although it was vague, I had an unpleasant hunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t able to verbalize my thoughts as clearly as I do now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still&#8230; No, that&#8217;s why. I had a strong sense of rejection about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why, I said it one day. At the time, there was a &#8220;S-character&#8221; in my class who would say harsh things to the &#8220;Bullied character&#8221; and I wondered why he would do that. Just because he has that sort of character doesn&#8217;t mean that he wouldn’t be hurt from such bullying and it doesn&#8217;t absolve you of the cruelty of your comments. Besides, it didn&#8217;t seem like many of the &#8220;Bullied characters&#8221; really enjoyed being bullied.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W-What happened then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a breath, Haruka asked while tightly holding her hands together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did&#8230; it turn into a fight?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t think the reaction was as strong as I had expected. I think the S-character just lashed out at me with some rough words and that was the end of it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although my memories were vague at that time, I&#8217;m sure it didn&#8217;t turn out to be such a messy situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surface of the water, which had been calm, surged a little with my words, I covered myself with a little water, and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;But]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Everyone started to distance me from then onwards. Although they didn&#8217;t say it out loud nor show anything in their attitudes, but they silently began ostracizing me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I remembered the reaction that happened back then very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t sure what had changed. However, the eyes looking at me or the words directed to me had become somewhat distant. And before I knew it, the friends which were always beside me had become distant.</span></p><div class="zetro-54b1a8325cd9d0ea38e7072118522296 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-54b1a8325cd9d0ea38e7072118522296"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I felt a thick sensation as if the temperature in the classroom had begun to drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did that S-character tell everyone in class to act like that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t think so. I think everyone just did it voluntarily, if I have to say what it was, it was like they were rebelling against the class complicity. I don&#8217;t think they did it out of malice towards me, but rather simply because I became someone difficult to include in the circle between them.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka&#8217;s expression fell and she exhaled deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So there are things like that that happen too&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, now it doesn&#8217;t seem like much but at that time, I was really shocked.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I said that in a light tone, I guess my feelings were showing on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked at me with concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The guys who laughed together with me everyday now looked at me from a distance. The ones who had been keeping close to me started to ignore me casually&#8230; things like that happened often, and honestly, it was hard. It was all because they couldn&#8217;t stand up against my thinking. For them, someone who could read the air was more important than someone who reminds them of their own actions&#8230; honestly, it was really painful.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka twists her face and bites her lip silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, she stares at me with eyes that have begun to moisten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, when I entered high school, I once again tried to play with the character that I had dropped and sure enough, I managed to have some relationships fall into place. I was able to make my friends laugh, and my conversations became much smoother, yeah. Certainly, I did find it fun.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Becoming friends with Sudo and Shuji was probably the best part of it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By nature, I was not the type of person who could be friends with two such popular and well-rounded people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I am able to spend time with them like this is because I played a character. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s because I bent my own beliefs and pandered to the people around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, I didn&#8217;t hurt anyone by doing that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This should be the best solution that I could choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;But still]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leaned my head on the window and looked at the Tokyo lights that were beginning to slowly become brighter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I can&#8217;t get rid of the feeling that this is the wrong choice. I can&#8217;t stop feeling self-hatred towards myself for making that choice. By all means, I want to be myself and not play a character.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I turned my eyes towards Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staring at me with a teary face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why, when I look at Haruka, I want to support you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I want a girl like Haruka to be happy. I want that wish of yours to come true.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she finished listening, Haruka exhaled deeply, as if she had eaten her fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So that&#8217;s what happened to you, Yano-kun. So I&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-d0e9baef700c4e7fc860e31511426ee4 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d0e9baef700c4e7fc860e31511426ee4"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, yeah, thank you. I am really happy that you told me that. Thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Same here, thank you for listening to me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sharp silence falls between us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Far below our feet, distant music plays from somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the wind blowing envelops the gondola, and I look out the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The joy of being able to speak my mind to my dear friend. I was sure that she would not change her attitude toward me even if she knew what was going on inside of me. I had such a happy feeling of certainty within me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe… This kind of relationship might be called a &#8220;real friend.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A relationship where you can confide your true feelings and accept each other without any issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, Haruka is my first real friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was somewhat dazed by the happiness of having such a presence in front of me, and the happiness of being able to think of someone in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Say]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as the gondola reached the peak point in it&#8217;s round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t understand what she meant when said&#8212;&#8211;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Shall we kiss?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a long silence, all that came out of my mouth was a dumbfounded voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, sorry! That&#8217;s not what I meant!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka began to explain flusteredly after realising what she had just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, I don&#8217;t think it may be that much of a good body but my body is still Akiha&#8217;s body! Although I&#8217;m sorry that it&#8217;s the time when my personality is currently out and I&#8217;m doing it in secrecy from Akiha&#8230; because this body is like that, that&#8217;s what I could do at most for you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;N-No, no. That&#8217;s not what I meant! Why are you suddenly talking about a ki&#8230;ss?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[B-because!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if it was a habit, but when she squeezed her hand again, Haruka put a little more energy into her voice,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I just wanted you to be happy!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Happy?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded back at her&#8230; Haruka looked at me with a desperate expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought that Yano-kun worries a lot about us being very kind. It’s because you are such a person, that I was wondering if I can also help you in any way. That&#8217;s why as a friend, I really want you to be happy. I hope a lot of nice things happen to you&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-e65ef7273abb97b7ebdddd2ddf42ee58 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e65ef7273abb97b7ebdddd2ddf42ee58"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why I thought about what I could do. Supporting your relationship with Akiha is a given, so what more can I do for you?]</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying so far, Haruka averted her gaze to the outside of window,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If that&#8217;s the case, my body also belongs to Akiha, and that&#8217;s all I can do&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her gaze to me once again. Then , with a clearer intention than before,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why&#8230;.. let&#8217;s kiss]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Haruka slowly closed her eyes and lifted her face slightly. Her face was dyed in a peachy color. Her slender body relaxed to receive all in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Haruka&#8217;s face was illuminated by the lights of the distant Tokyo nightscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face looked younger than Akiha&#8217;s, but still delicately formed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her thin lips, which were probably covered with lip balm, were moist and glossy, and glittered like a galaxy in the light beneath her feet.    (T/N : I guess that&#8217;s where title of this chapter comes, the Galaxy in her lips)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;In front of this sight, my heart was beating like a horse running at full speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> It was still cold at night, but I was sweating all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-It was the first time a girl had ever said such a thing to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until now, I had a person like everyone and I&#8217;ve wanted to confess my love as much as anyone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;ve never taken concrete action, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone take concrete action against me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, this was the first time someone made such an offer to me and it was adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look at the body of Haruka in front of me, she is exactly like Akiha whom I have a crush on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I ignore this, I simply think that Minase Haruka is a cute girl. Because she&#8217;s my friend, I don&#8217;t think much of it that way though. She has a modest personality, a kind heart, and is more than pretty enough to look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she makes an unexpected proposal, I feel an irresistible pull and a temptation to go with the flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good idea.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was somehow able to answer after suppressing my desire desperately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka opened her eyes, which had been closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Uhm, well&#8230;.. I&#8217;m really happy that you think that though&#8230;.I really appreciate it. I mean I want to do this after having some serious development. I feel like this is a bit&#8230;.unfair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Th-That&#8217;s right! I&#8217;m sorry!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she seemed to come to her senses, Haruka vigorously waved her hands as if to say &#8220;Earlier words didn&#8217;t count.&#8221; Her face turned bright red as if she was joking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I end up saying something strange, um, after all that is no good&#8230;..I feel bad for Akiha]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh yeah&#8230;..Besides, it&#8217;s not good for Haruka herself to be with a guy she doesn&#8217;t like&#8230;You should take better care of such things&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, well&#8230;. you are right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why she suddenly lost her temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I did thought it will turn out like that&#8230;..but]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But?]</span></p><div class="zetro-a0ab28159f2a620b16dda6a3c635af50 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a0ab28159f2a620b16dda6a3c635af50"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I probably don&#8217;t think&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s bad doing this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t reply back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inadvertently, I might have perceived the word in a strange way. I might have perceived the feeling of a non-existent girlfriend arbitrarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka is an important friend. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t want to misunderstand her feelings or interpret them in a selfish way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;. sorry, it&#8217;s nothing. Please forget about it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Haruka smiled and looked outside the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s already the end.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s true]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She noticed that the gondola had dropped in altitude and was almost at the boarding point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she squinted her eyes somewhat lonely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s about time Akiha change place]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said it, I realised it&#8217;s already the time for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day had gone by so quickly that it was strange to see the two of them switch places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It was fun. It was really fun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka mumbled as if saying to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the end for today&#8217;s &#8220;Outing&#8221; for Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The special day she had been looking forward to, today&#8217;s day she had been waiting impatiently for, would end in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it, I feel strangely regretful,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.Let&#8217;s come back again]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an embarrassed mood, I said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let&#8217;s come back next year, even after graduation or when we become adults with everyone again.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At these words, Haruka narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;. that&#8217;s right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slight smile appeared on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It would be nice to come back]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t why but her expression seemed a bit&#8230;&#8230;sad, I wonder why. Maybe it was the sadness of knowing that the next time she noticed, she would be at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[See you later]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.um]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After nodding, Haruka smiled and made a small bow.</span></p><div class="zetro-a54a5c972b4681984f2e4acb78e099a1 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a54a5c972b4681984f2e4acb78e099a1"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after a few minutes&#8212;&#8211;Akiha slowly raised her head and looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Ferris wheel]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said in a voice that sounded like a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah. If you were a little earlier, you might have been able to see the scenery&#8230;&#8230;but that&#8217;s too bad]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, but it can&#8217;t be helpe&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Akiha suddenly stood up from the chair with a face as if she had realised something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s the matter?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s nothing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Replying brusquely, Akiha took a short breath and once again looked at the scenery outside the window.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s night time!? Moreover, there is a girl as beautiful as Akiha!  You can&#8217;t let her walk alone!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being told that by Sudo, I was walking home with Akiha. It was a narrow street in a residential area, off the main street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the houses along the street, I could occasionally hear the sound of the piano, the television, and the voices of families talking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder why&#8230;..even though I also led that kind of life myself in my home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, when I sense such things through the walls and windows of houses in the city at night, I feel an irresistible pain in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lives of people who may never come in contact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nights of people who may never come in contact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if the reason I&#8217;m strangely moved by such things is because Akiha is walking next to me. I wonder if it&#8217;s because the girl I love is here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walked alongside the river, I stole a glance at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lips that asked me &#8220;Shall we kiss?&#8221; Just an hour ago&#8212;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but think about it, and my heart fluttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what would have happened if I had kissed her at that time&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I wonder how it would have felt&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why is she asking for a kiss? I hope the truth will come to light.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little unsettled, partly because Sudo had told me so on the way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m also impressed with Sudo&#8217;s kind of sense to say this at this timing though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you so much for today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha spilled these words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That girl was also happy, wasn&#8217;t she? I&#8217;m really glad that Yano-kun was there. I&#8217;m really sure you&#8217;ve become the first special person for her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hope you are right&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-a8207a55b29f711bf7a8e5a33ca8919e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a8207a55b29f711bf7a8e5a33ca8919e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[From here on will be quite easy. That girl will be able to play me better. People will be able to live without noticing that Haruka was there&#8230;.]    (T/N : there&#8217;s no direct reference  saying who will be able to live without noticing, people/Yano or anyone. So since I think it will be quite weird if it&#8217;s yano, I decided to choose people)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I nodded, the uncomfortable feeling once again begin to rise inside me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something is off here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uneasiness from walking into the wrong road even though we should have been walking on the correct one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I know, I and Akiha were in front of Minase house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.hey]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmm?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned around with her back to the apartment building and looked up at me as if she had made up her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did something happen&#8230;&#8230;.with Haruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My reaction was delayed for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t understand the reasoning behind the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano-kun, did something happen with Haruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the h**l does that mean? Why is she saying that suddenly&#8230;.? I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t understand the aim of Akiha, however Haruka&#8217;s face flashed passed inside my head and my heart slowly accelerated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even more, Akiha keeps looking at my eyes, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For example, in the Ferris wheel]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-I&#8217;m sure my face must have looked agitated now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You were alone with her there, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s well&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Especially, was it the same as ever?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right but&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incomprehensible feeling of guilt assailed me and I ended up speaking ambiguously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Akiha, with her jet black eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With eyes as if Galaxy was swirling in them, She looked at as if she could see through anything and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did You also Kissed?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t keep up here. Akiha must not have known what happened there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither Haruka nor I have revealed the remark [let&#8217;s kiss] to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Sudo and Shuji must have been unaware that such an exchange had taken place. Neither of them showed the slightest hint of it.</span></p><div class="zetro-7ffdaf48fc7584c8733c8764763403f2 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7ffdaf48fc7584c8733c8764763403f2"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for some reason, everything seemed to have been seen through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like she sensed the insincere thumping in my chest that I remembered from that moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what she had read from my expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s face distorted as if she was gravely hurt. Tears pooled in her slit eyes, blotting out the galaxy in her pupils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks were slightly flushed and stiff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands gripped the hem of her dress as if she was holding on to something. And she was devastated by the sight of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me who was standing in front of her emotional outbursts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if confessing a mortal sin, she said one word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sure it will make mess of everything]</span></p>
