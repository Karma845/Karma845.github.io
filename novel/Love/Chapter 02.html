<h3 class="entry-title">Chapter 2 - Let&#8217;s Listen to the song of the bubble</h3>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I really appreciate it.</p>



<p>Akiha said this in a voice that didn&#8217;t sound very grateful.</p>



<p>However, that&#8217;s her natural disposition I guess.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure there is no lie in her words.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m also really happy that you are getting along with that child.thank you very much]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s nothing to thank me for, I just wanted to do it, that&#8217;s all. Oh, do you want some milk?]</p>



<p>[No, I&#8217;m fine.I&#8217;ll just have it. You know, I&#8217;m grateful that you feel that way about Haruka. It&#8217;s so valuable that it has nothing to do with a sense of duty or justice. Wow, this coffee is delicious.]</p>



<p>[Right? I also sometimes come here after school.]</p>



<p>Somewhere in the store, an antique clock chimed its bell as if to chime in with me.</p>



<p>A little early before school, around 8 o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>



<p>There were four customers in this little old but cozy coffee shop near the school: a woman in a suit, a young man with a bad sleeping habit, and us.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was the shop manager&#8217;s habit.</p>



<p>Antique clocks of various shapes and sizes were displayed here and there in the store. As far as I could see, none of them seemed to be showing the correct time.</p>



<p>And talking about the shop manager in question, he was sitting at the counter in the back of the store, wearing a worn shirt that was as antique as the clocks, idly looking at the morning paper.</p>



<p>[Now then to the real issue at hand]</p>



<p>Akiha put the coffee on the table and looked at me.</p>



<p>[Haruka requested me to teach Yano-kun the details again.]</p>



<p>&nbsp;[Oh,I see]</p>



<p>[Surely if we talk about that child, she might have forgotten to tell you all the details. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to explain to you [Our arrangements] again, even though you may already know it.]</p>



<p><strong>Minase [Good evening, I am Akiha.Tomorrow morning, I have something I want to talk to you about, can you spare some of your time?]</strong></p>



<p>When I received such a message on LINE last night, I braced myself to see what would happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps&#8230;&#8230;.don&#8217;t enter your nose in other affairs too much or maybe she is angry?</p>



<p>I wondered if they would reject me for not getting involved&#8230;.</p>



<p>However, now I see.</p>



<p>It was something arranged by Haruka.</p>



<p>I guess she made time for me and Akiha to be alone together.</p>



<p>As I was thanking Haruka in my mind, Akiha started the explanation.</p>



<p>[Haruka may have already conveyed this to you but each of our personalities at present lasts for around 1 hundred and thirty one minutes.]</p>



<p>Feeling a little embarrassed now that I was facing my unrequited love, I began to imprint the contents in my mind.</p>



<p>[I can watch &lt;Sansho-Dayu&gt;, but it&#8217;s going to be tough to watch &lt;The First Woman of Saikaku&gt;]</p>



<p>[ I see,one hundred and thirty one minutes.Does it vary a lot from day to day?]</p>



<p>[Yes, depending on our moods or various influences affecting us.After that, we don&#8217;t share our experiences or memories with each other.I don&#8217;t know the experience of Haruka and reverse also apply for her.That&#8217;s why Haru and I write down what happened on this smartphone every day, and share our memories as much as possible.]</p>



<p>Saying so, she showed the smartphone in her right hand.</p>



<p>[Basically, we write down what happened that day at the end of the day, but for urgent matters like conversations with classmates or requests from teachers, I make a file for it and check it every time we switch.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;..kind of a hassle, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>[Yes, it is. Besides, Haruaki often misses things and forgets to check information, so honestly I was thinking of more better ways]</p>



<p>Even as she said this, a hint of a smile appeared on Akiha&#8217;s cheeks.</p>



<p>Apparently, Akiha doesn&#8217;t hate such Haruka.</p>



<p>Indeed I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to hate her for a gap like that.</p>



<p>[And what happened at the time when we changed&#8230;&#8230;. Yano-kun already knows that from the day before yesterday&#8217;s morning.Do you remember what happened that time?]</p>



<p>[Yeah, I was a little surprised wondering what was going on&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Yeah. You didn&#8217;t look at my strange face? Haruka gets angry when people see her face when she switches places&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Ah, that was all right.its just that her expression changes a little]</p>



<p>[Then I&#8217;m glad to hear that]</p>



<p>As if in sympathy with the relieved Akiha, A pigeon flew out from an antique clock near my seat.It chirped four times and went back into the clock, but the actual time was past eight o&#8217;clock.</p>



<p>[And then&#8230; This is the exchange diary.]</p>



<p>She then pulled out a notebook from her bag and handed it to me.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s really a girl&#8217;s thing, isn&#8217;t it? But it would be great if you could go along with her]</p>



<p>[Ok&#8230;]</p>



<p>when I recieved it, I thought&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>It was a very fancy notebook.</p>



<p>A notebook with ruled lines, but there were bear characters drawn all over it. &#8230;&#8230; I thought that only junior high school students use this kind of notebook.</p>



<p>I opened it to look inside and saw that Akiha and Haruka had already written yesterday&#8217;s journal.</p>



<p>April 10th (Tuesday) Haruka</p>



<p>Today is a memorable day.</p>



<p>Yano-kun from my class is going to help me hide my double identity!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy! Yay!</p>



<p>Moreover, he said he&#8217;s my friend. oooo (tears)</p>



<p>I have to do my best not to bother him.</p>



<p>And then since we are going to start exchanging diaries, first I will introduce myself.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m Minase Haruka.Age is&#8230;&#8230;..16 years old?I was born when Akiha was 9 years old, so I guess I should be 7 years old.The thing I like is manga , I&#8217;m bad at dealing with bugs or physical exercise&#8212;&#8212;-.</p>



<p>April 10th Tuesday, Akiha</p>



<p>The Mal Waldron record I had ordered arrived.</p>



<p>I had the CD of &#8220;Left Alone&#8221;, but I like to be able to listen to my favorite works in the medium they were intended for when they were recorded</p>



<p>And I also like the cover design for this album.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll decorate it above the chest, between Coltrane&#8217;s Blue Train and Getz&#8217;s West Coast Jazz.</p>



<p>Now, I have decided to start exchanging diaries invited by Haruka, but I wonder what kind of things are better to write&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;.</p>



<p>I like this one.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I was thinking as I looked through it.</p>



<p>Perhaps a little but I think I will be happy to read it everyday.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never been interested in the diaries of my friends on SNS before.</p>



<p>[They just write about anything with a exaggeration]</p>



<p>I thought that and not even once I was excited about them.</p>



<p>And the content of Haruka&#8217;s and Akiha&#8217;s were no different from those on social networking sites. In fact, the content may be more limpid then the contents available throughout the world via internet I&#8217;m not interested in.</p>



<p>Even so, my eyes were strangely attracted to the simple letters written on this notebook which looked like a model for dictation.</p>



<p>Maybe that&#8217;s because I like Akiha and because I thought of Haruka as my important friend.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;but still]</p>



<p>I looked up from the pages of my notebook at the sound of Akiha&#8217;s voice&#8230;&#8230;I was surprised</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.is it really okay with Yano-kun?]</p>



<p>I can see the nervousness and hesitation on Akiha&#8217;s face when she said that.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never seen this expression on her face before.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.what is?]</p>



				
<p>If I were to become friends with Haruka, would there be any problems?</p>



<p>I wonder if there is something to worry about?</p>



<p>[Because maybe you will be troubled&#8230;&#8230;no, not maybe, you will definitely be troubled.i don&#8217;t think it will benefit Yano-kun in any way. Maybe it will be painful, sad or you may get hurt&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Really?]</p>



<p>[Yes&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Why?]</p>



<p>[Well that&#8217;s..]</p>



<p>Then she lowered her eyes to her lap,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.that child&#8230;&#8230;that]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;.I wonder what?What does Akiha want to say?</p>



<p>What&#8217;s that making her so worried about?</p>



<p>At that time, the smartphone inside the pocket buzzed.</p>



<p>After seeing Akiha looking down, I look at the screen&#8212;&#8212;-a line message was sent to a group of some friends.</p>



<p><strong>Itsuka [Breaking News] Yano-kun and Miss Minase decided to have alone time together in a cafe from the morning.</strong></p>



<p>[TN &#8211; originally it was Minase-Shi where Shi is used in formal writing, and sometimes in very formal speech, for referring to a person who is unfamiliar to the speaker but since not many people know it like -kun and -san honorific, I have changed it to Miss]</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8211;I raised my face in panic.</p>



<p>I look around the store&#8212;&#8211;they are not here.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case then outside the cafe&#8212;-</p>



<p>I looked out the window near my seat to the street&#8212;&#8211;found them.</p>



<p>Over a small intersection.A petite girl hiding behind a telephone pole and looking at me with a grin.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s one of my classmates, Sudou Itsuka.</p>



<p>I think she is hiding herself but I can see her left and right tie up hair and half of her face peeking out.</p>



<p>I mean, Shuji is laughing near her, not even trying to hide.if you are together then at least stop her.</p>



<p>[&#8230;.. what&#8217;s the matter?]</p>



<p>Before I knew it, Akiha was looking up at me suspiciously.</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s just&#8230;..I receive such messages]</p>



<p>Putting off the earlier story for the time being.</p>



<p>I said so and held out my smartphone to Akiha.</p>



<p>[ <em>Itsuka</em>&#8230;..is that your friend?]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right. Or rather she is Sudo, who is in the same class as us. Look, that person who is Secretly trying to hide behind the telephone poll]</p>



<p>[Ah, that girl&#8230;..who is the person beside her?]</p>



<p>[He is Hiro Shuji. He is also friend of mine from same class]</p>



<p>While we were talking, my smartphone kept vibrating in my hand, alerting me to new messages.</p>



<p>I looked at the screen.</p>



<p><strong>Tommy &nbsp; &nbsp; [ Are you serious?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>SHIZUKU [ wh, what? Are they dating?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Itsuka.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Maybe so!]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Itsuka &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [somehow, they seems too close]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Itsuka &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [(Sticker of a dog with complacent smile)]</strong></p>



<p><strong>SHIZUKU [Actually if you aren&#8217;t going out then you will not meet in cafe so early]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tommy &nbsp; &nbsp; [Indeed]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [All wrong, I&#8217;m not!]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ we just happened to meet while commuting to school, that&#8217;s all, you idiot]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Itsuka&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Oh! Here comes the person in question]</strong></p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.what kind of exchange are you having?]</p>



<p>As I was typing a quick message, Akinami leaned forward.</p>



<p>[I also want to see]</p>



<p>Her face came close to mine, at close range.</p>



<p>The scent of shampoo tickles my nose, and her lips are glossy up close.</p>



<p>For a moment I couldn&#8217;t breathe&#8230;&#8230;but I kept my composure and tilted my phone 90 degrees so that we can both look into the screen.</p>



<p>[Well, that&#8217;s just a silly experience, just a joke so you don&#8217;t need to mind&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Umm]</p>



<p>With an honest face, Akiha nodded her head like a child.</p>



<p><strong>Itsuka &nbsp; &nbsp; [Oh hey, they started to get there shoulders close]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tommy&nbsp; [Seriously?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tommy.&nbsp; [Yano-san, is it true that you are engaged with Minase-san?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>SHIZUKU [When are you planning to fill up entry in the family register?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Are you guys elementary kids!?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [I&#8217;m just showing the screen of my smartphone]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shuji.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Congratulations, be sure to invite us to the ceremony, ok?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Itsuka.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Throw your bouquet toward me,ok?]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Ok, the congratulatory gift per person is 100,000]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shiki.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Who&#8217;s the bride and the groom?</strong></p>



<p>They are really hungry for a topic&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>This time, I&#8217;m being used as the topic of conversation, but I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter what the subject is. They just want to have a little fun in the unexciting morning.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;well, as a Matter of fact, myself too.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t hate when people start rumors like this with the person I have a crush on, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;fufu]</p>



<p>Suddenly Akiha spilled a laugh.</p>



<p>[What, what&#8217;s the matter?]</p>



<p>[No, just&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Akiha held her mouth and squinted her eyes when she felt uneasy that I had seen through her feelings&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>[Yano-kun&#8212;&#8212; you really changed completely in front of Everyone unlike in front of me and Haruka. That&#8217;s really splendid multiple personalities you have]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I was so embarrassed that I unconsciously looked up at the sky.</p>



<p>The clock above her head read eleven o&#8217;clock, and the wooden dwarf began to dance with the music.</p>



<p>*</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;-Man, I really thought something was wrong this morning.]</p>



<p>Sudo threw the meatballs into her mouth as she said at the desk opposite each other.</p>



<p>She popped a second one into her mouth again, her cheeks puffing out like a squirrel.</p>



<p>[It was an unexpected two-shot, you know. I was so surprised to find out that you two had been making love without my knowledge.]</p>



<p>[TN &#8211; (Two shot) man and woman being alone together]</p>



<p>[Of Course not]</p>



<p>While picking up some broccoli with my chopsticks, I answered in a voice that was two-tone higher than I was used to.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve only known her for three days! How quick can I be? If I could do that, I&#8217;d have a much more impressive dating history!]</p>



<p>[But even from my point of view, your atmosphere seemed to be very close.its really strange for Yano to have those feelings]</p>



<p>[Well&#8230;&#8230;it was simple morning in the coffee shop]</p>



<p>Even though Shuji pointed out sharply, I managed to come up with reasonable excuses.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not excited, and even if I was, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to shout in that situation. We just bumped into each other and talked for a while, that&#8217;s all.]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m sorry for misunderstanding you, Akiha]</p>



<p>In contrast to me, Sudo offered her juice with an apologetic look on his face.</p>



<p>[I got a little carried away. Here&#8217;s some orange juice as an apology. You can drink it!]</p>



<p>After the event of this morning&#8212;-</p>



<p>Sudo said [ I want to eat together with Minase-san] and now the four of us, Sudo, Shuji, Minase and myself were having lunch.</p>



<p>Sudo and Shuji have been friends ever since they were in the same class last year and occasionally spend their lunch break together like this. Sudo Itsuka, who is popular in one part of boys for her petite build and cheerfulness and Hiro Shuji who is popular with many girls because of his tall stature, gentle manner and good looks.</p>



<p>Apparently The two highly social people have been watching for an opportunity to get close to Akiha, the new student, for some time now.</p>



<p>I have always been impressed by Their openness.</p>



<p>Of course, they probably know what kind of character they are seen as and what kind of guy they are expected to be. Still, their behavior is natural. There is no sarcasm or falsehood that I can see.</p>



<p>Such being the case, they naturally have a lot of friends and lately they seemed to be having lunch together with the childhood friend from another class.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.which reminds me, was it okay today to not eat with them, umm, Hosono of class was it? Didn&#8217;t you say he was having some trouble with his girlfriend and couldn&#8217;t leave him alone?]</p>



<p>[Ah, he is already fine now]</p>



<p>Sudou laughed as she handed Akiha juice.</p>



<p>[The two of you pretend to be indifferent but you&#8217;re secretly in love, so I thought I&#8217;d leave you alone and get to know Akiha.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.. yeah]</p>



<p>Akiha nodded nervously while taking the straw out from her mouth.</p>



<p>[Oh , please be gentle with me&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>She picked up her fork again.</p>



<p>However her eyes were swimming a lot&#8230;&#8230;it should be that.</p>



<p>The truth is, the personality that is currently on display is not Akiha, but Haruka.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve told her what happened this morning, but she seems to be deflated by the sudden involvement of the two so-called &#8220;normies&#8221;.</p>



<p>I guess I will have to follow up here immediately, it&#8217;s dangerous and also bad for my heart.</p>



<p>[Akiha, are you in some kind of club?]</p>



<p>Promptly, Sudou started asking questions from Haruka.</p>



<p>[This school has quite a lot of club activities, are you thinking about joining any?]</p>



<p>[Ah un&#8230;.no, there wasn&#8217;t any particular club I wanted to enter, I still haven&#8217;t thought about what kind of club to enter]</p>



<p>[Then, Go-home clubs?What do you usually do at home? Do you like reading books or playing games?</p>



<p>[I read books, but lately I&#8217;ve been listening to records and watching movies.]</p>



<p>[Oh, record!]</p>



<p>Shuji&#8217;s voice was unusually loud. He swallowed the bread he had bought from the store.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve been interested in them too. But aren&#8217;t players pretty expensive? How did you get it?]</p>



<p>Oh, does this guy also have the same hobby? If I were to inadvertently buy a record, I might think, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a Murakami Haruki fan,&#8221; but when Shuji says it, it doesn&#8217;t sound disgusting at all. In fact, it makes him look even more stylish, which will spur his popularity.</p>




<p>[That&#8230;&#8230; getting along with Haruka]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;what do you mean?]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t understand the meaning very well.</p>




<p>But&#8230; the topic has spread in a slightly maniacal direction.</p>
<p>Haruka, can you answer well&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>[Well&#8230;..my father bought it for me.]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s nice.was it a birthday gift?]</p>
<p>[No, it was a&#8230;&#8230;.hospital discharge gift.]</p>
<p>[Huh, hospital discharge gift? Was Minase-san hospitalised?]</p>
<p>[Ah,umm&#8230;.that&#8230;]</p>
<p>Haru&#8217;s eyes begin to swim in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>She seems to be mumbling, unable to say the following words.</p>
<p>So I guess &#8220;discharge&#8221; is when she was discharged from the hospital due to dual personality&#8212;&#8212;That&#8217;s where I come in.</p>
<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;..are you talking about that? About the appendix, you mentioned this morning]</p>
<p>I fabricated the story suddenly.</p>
<p>[You were in the hospital for a while last year with your appendix, right? You said your father was the overprotective type. &#8230;&#8230; Isn&#8217;t that right?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.. that, that&#8217;s right]</p>
<p>With an expression as if she was saved, Haruka nodded.</p>
<p>[I see, father was very worried about you, so he said he would buy you anything you want&#8230;!]</p>
<p>[I see, I&#8217;m jealous. I wish my parents were like that]</p>
<p>Haruka&#8217;s true colors almost came out, but it could not be helped.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing that Shuji didn&#8217;t seem to notice the change in character because he was focused on the main topic, and he was able to avoid the pursuit.</p>
<p>[By the way, what kind of songs did you like? Rock?]</p>
<p>Are you going to continue the conversation?</p>
<p>[Well&#8230; lately I&#8217;ve been listening to Lionel Hampton &#8230;&#8230;.]</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Haruka gave a good answer.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had been preparing for something in this area in case she was asked something.</p>
<p>However, her reserves seemed to have been exhausted easily.</p>
<p>[I see, so jazz huh&#8230;.. what else do you listen to?]</p>
<p>[Um, umm well&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>
<p>[Do you have a favourite instrument or a favourite group?]</p>
<p>[Well yeah&#8230;..]</p>
<p>Just in a short time, she seemed to be in a dilemma again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s problematic as it is.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t have any knowledge about jazz.I couldn&#8217;t follow this topic very well&#8230;.</p>
<p>And then, after a blatantly unnatural silence, Haruka, who was clearly upset even to the casual observer&#8212;&#8212;-finally said something like this.</p>
<p>[Oh that&#8230;.that&#8230;lady Gaga]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m listening to lady Gaga recently]</p>
<p>Shujis face which was exciting till now suddenly turned down in bewilderment.</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s not&#8230;..jazz?]</p>
<p>[Ah? Is that so?]</p>
<p>Haruka rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s even I know that much though.</p>
<p>She Finally desperately found a westerner music artist but Lady Gaga isn&#8217;t probably one from jazz.Jazz is more like a live instrumental&#8230;&#8230;music with a swaying rhythm.</p>
<p>Haruka opened and closed her mouth repeatedly, it seems like she couldn&#8217;t say anything now.</p>
<p>[Ah, um that should be it!!]</p>
<p>If this happens, I have to fix the story, even if it&#8217;s a lie&#8230;&#8230;.!</p>
<p>After attracting attention with a loud voice for the time being, I turned my head at full throttle and turned my head.</p>
<p>[That&#8230;.you mean when Lady Gaga collaborated with a great jazz musician, quite a while ago right? I remember seeing it on the TV or something]</p>
<p>[Y, yeah that]</p>
<p>Haruka joined my story with a ghost-like face as if she had found the spider&#8217;s thread.</p>
<p>[I saw it too, and I&#8217;ve been listening to it ever since&#8230;..]</p>
<p>[Oh , I didn&#8217;t know there was that! As expected of Lady Gaga, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>
<p>At the thoughtless words of mine, Sudo&#8217;s impression of Lady Gaga seemed to have increased.</p>
<p>And Shuji too,</p>
<p>[Yeah, it was great&#8230;&#8230;]</p>
<p>Shuji said, and then, with a natural motion, started playing with his phone.</p>
<p>[I wonder what kind of music it is&#8230;.I will search it]</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;awful.</p>
<p>What I have said earlier was completely made up by me.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard any collaboration of Lady Gaga with a jazz musician, there&#8217;s no way you can find it just by searching.</p>
<p>When I turned to look at Haruka, she was already unable to say something while her eyes were swimming around.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;.. however,</p>
<p>[Oh here it is.that must be the one]</p>
<p>Shuji said it.</p>
<p>[Oh amazing, I didn&#8217;t know she did it with Tony Bennett&#8230;.]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Huh?]</p>
<p>Looking at the smartphone presented by Shuji, there was certainly a video of stylish Lady Gaga doing a duet with an astringent looking middle-aged man.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.you are kidding, right?</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.yes, yes.that&#8217;s the one.]</p>
<p>Even though I pretend like I know this but inside I was bewildered at the coincidence.</p>
<p>[Minase-san&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. that&#8217;s the one right? the song you mentioned?]</p>
<p>[Yes, th, that&#8217;s the one.]</p>
<p>Haruka also looked as if she had been pinched by a fox.</p>
<p>But well,it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe such a picture-perfect &#8220;A horse from a gourd&#8221; thing happened&#8230;</p>
<p>[TN &#8211; it&#8217;s a japanese idiom which as you can see from context means something completely unbelievable/unexpected happens from someplace you never expected]</p>
<p>As I was letting out a breath of relief, Haruka, who was sitting across from me, glanced over at me.</p>
<p>And then, she knitted her eyebrows as if to say [I&#8217;m really sorry], and bowed her head in a small way so that Sudo and the others would not notice.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">*</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I spent my first day with Haruka.</p>
<p>I felt like an apprentice craftsman who had just finished his first big job.</p>
<p>It had been a really, really hard day.</p>
<p>I felt like I had sweated out half a year&#8217;s worth of cold sweat, and used up a year&#8217;s worth of luck.</p>
<p>But for all that,I will not not be in such a pinch anymore.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, I should be able to spend my days more peacefully.</p>
<p>And if something still happens, then I should be able to get around it based on this time&#8217;s experience.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I was thinking.</p>
<p>As It turned out&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;my expectations were totally out of place.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">*</p>
<p>April 12th (Thursday), Haruka</p>
<p>I was careless and dozed off in the middle of the class&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Moreover just right before switching places with Akiha&#8230;&#8230;<br />
I guess it&#8217;s because I was up late watching cat videos last night&#8230;&#8230;..I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
I don&#8217;t know how it would have turned out if Yano-kun hadn&#8217;t woken me up with a line.<br />
Because it was Chiyoda sensei&#8217;s Class, I think she didn&#8217;t get much angry&#8230;&#8230;<br />
Thank you very much. I&#8217;ll try my best not to fall asleep from now on.</p>
<p>&gt;Akiha<br />
The stain on the pencil case is my drool.<br />
I&#8217;m sorry to dirty it&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>April 12th (Thursday), Akiha</p>
<p>&gt;Haruka<br />
So that was a stain from drool huh.you don&#8217;t need to worry since it was washed off.<br />
Also, it was a relief to know why I kept getting calls from Yano-kun.<br />
I was surprised to find out that something had happened.<br />
From now on, I&#8217;ll set an alarm on my phone to go off five minutes before we switch</p>
<p>April 13th, Yano</p>
<p>You have made a blunder once again.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get the conversation going with Ishikawa (a movie maniac from the next class), who came to meet because after hearing that Akiha likes movies.<br />
Well most likely it will be seen as an impromptu skit.<br />
But I guess Haruka was too sensitive to talk about Doraemon with such a type of maniac.<br />
But it was definitely a good movie.<br />
Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to get something a little more connoisseur-friendly?</p>
<p>April 13th (Friday), Akiha</p>
<p>Physical education class in 3rd period.<br />
In the volleyball class, Oshinari-sensei surprised me by saying, &#8220;Mizuse-san, you look so different from yesterday&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m sorry.I completely forgot that Haruka is bad at ball games.<br />
I will make sure not to overdo it next time.</p>
<p>April 13th(Friday), Haruka</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I cried watching Doraemon the night before, so that&#8217;s all I could think of.<br />
By Movie connoisseur you mean like Crayon shinchan?<br />
Maybe live action movies are better&#8230;&#8230;.?</p>
<p>&gt;Akiha<br />
You can&#8217;t do that! Akiha you have to live a normal life!<br />
I will find a way to fit in!<br />
Not only in physical education but I will also do my best in study!</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">*</p>
<p>[The last three days&#8230;&#8230;..were considerably tough, no?]</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s right]</p>
<p>After school on Friday.</p>
<p>The evaluation meeting that started in the club room had a heavy atmosphere from the beginning.</p>
<p>[We were able to cross them somehow&#8230;&#8230;but it was almost a coincidence&#8230;&#8230;. perhaps it might be just a matter of time before we get caught]</p>
<p>As I threw my upper body on the old desk, I expressed my impressions of the meeting so far.</p>
<p>[You&#8217;re right&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s not good as it is]</p>
<p>Haruka turned the globe with the Soviet Union still on it with an exhausted look on her face and sighed around the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>Really, I&#8217;ve been in shambles for a while now.</p>
<p>We have been in pinch multiple times and it&#8217;s a repetition of barely clearing them or not.</p>
<p>I forcibly conceal the rough conversation, hurriedly supporting it when it was about to become a mess, tired of waking her everyday when she was nodding off through mail, Haruka was also exhausted from all the successive tension.</p>
<p>Although the double personality hasn&#8217;t been exposed, there must be some people who thought it was strange.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m really sorry for causing all the trouble. I also didn&#8217;t think things would go so haywire myself&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>
<p>[No, I don&#8217;t mind that at all. I do have a connection with Akiha after all&#8230;..]</p>
<p>Being around Haruka meant that I was able to spend time around Akiha.</p>
<p>I have been able to talk with her multiple times in the last three days and Haruka also has been actively making opportunities.</p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more is that in an exchange diary, you could easily see what she thinks of her everyday life from the words she writes herself. Although there isn&#8217;t any progress in our relationship, I was overjoyed at learning her everyday habits from the diary. I think I can&#8217;t thank Haruka enough for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why I want to do better for Haruka, too. If things continue like this, the atmosphere will just get weirder and weirder.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you. But what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I do from now on&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka fiddled and created a worldwide earthquake with the globe, while saying this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I also don’t have any idea what would be helpful anymore&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;So I see that the problem is probably that we’re insufficiently prepared.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Setting my body up from the desk, I started to explain what I have noticed so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[To get closer to Akiha, you need to know more about Akiha, right? Well of course Haruka is more detailed about this then anyone else but it was still insufficient. It’s because Haruka and Akiha both have different hobbies or things that they like. So if you want to behave like the other, you’d have to prepare a LOT beforehand. That’s what I think so far.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, that&#8217;s true&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka nodded with a meek look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There were many times when I didn&#8217;t know how to behave like Akiha at all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then suddenly, her face lit up as she thought of something,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umm, then how about we have a… study session? By keeping all the information related to Akiha in the notebook, if we can study it together after school and remember it well, I think I&#8217;ll be able to act more confidently like her&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Study session?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To study about Akiha&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s certainly a fascinating proposal. I do want to know more about her too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230; that might be good. Let&#8217;s try having one then, a study session.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really? I&#8217;m glad.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka nodded happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was suddenly struck by an uneasy feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh&#8230; There’s just one more thing. Make sure you get Akiha&#8217;s permission beforehand, okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Huh, why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Because it might be unpleasant to have a boy from the same class know every little detail about you&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though there are certain circumstances in play, it&#8217;d still be a little unpleasant to have your private life probed by a person of the opposite s*x whom you don&#8217;t have any feelings for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I as a boy thinks like that, then it might be more so for Akiha as a girl to think like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she hates me because of this, I&#8217;ll definitely regret it later on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to be Haruka&#8217;s support, but I want to confirm about it beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;That might be true.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka has a face that looked like she didn’t understand it but,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I get it. I&#8217;ll ask her beforehand. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll say yes anyway.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please do. So, about the study session, do we do it here like usual?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a thoughtful expression, Haruka started to turn the globe again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so after spinning the volleyball sized globe for a one week rotation, she stopped and pointed her finger at Kyrgyzstan and said,  [TN &#8211; I didn&#8217;t understand that part, that&#8217;s the literal translation.maybe related with mapping or something? If anyone knows let me know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ah, that&#8217;s right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s the matter?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, Haruka who was smiling somewhat proudly said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I have a suggestion.]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never knew the sight of your unrequited love in a casual dress would be so devastating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry for calling you all this way during a holiday.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words for a while when I looked at the figure at Akiha who had just arrived in front of the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a fluffy dress with some small flower patterns engrained on it. And on her feet she was wearing a pair of heavy boots that looked as if they had belonged to a man. The gray hoodie she had worn was simple but elegant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not much of an expert on women&#8217;s fashion but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure if what Akiha is currently wearing is in good taste or not…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, having only seen her in her school uniform before, I was instantly knocked out by the slightly swaying frills and the bulging calves from her racy boots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, um, it’s nothing.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I accidentally delayed my reaction by a few seconds due to that sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright, then shall we go?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked half a step behind Aki, but my heart was still beating extremely fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It all started with,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[一一一I think it&#8217;s better to have person in question explain themselves.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what Haruka had said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We could study about Akiha by ourselves but in any case, it would be much better to learn about it directly from the girl herself, right&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, that&#8217;s true. You can directly ask the person if she, herself is right in front of you. Besides, I’m just… I’d be happy to talk with Akiha alone too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka smiled, looking as if she was pleased with herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And then, about the location… how about we have it at our home?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.huh, your home?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. Our house, in our room.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart skipped a beat. I was afraid that Haruka would hear my thumping heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, that meant&#8230;  I’d be going to the place where Akiha lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It means that we’d be alone together in that private space&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, o-of course there isn&#8217;t any strange meaning behind it or anything!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure if it was due to my expression or something, but Haruka began to panic immediately after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T-That, don&#8217;t do anything strange just become you’re alone with Akiha, okay?! Um, no but if the person herself acknowledges it, then it doesn&#8217;t matter. Ah; but I’m also in the body of Akiha, so then, th&#8230;at mea..ns&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, relax! Calm down for a second.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly stopped Haruka who was panicking with her face turning a shade of bright red..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s alright because I won’t do anything strange to her&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yo-You&#8217;re right. I’m sorry. I was thinking too much just now. But you see, it&#8217;s much more convenient to have it at home, right? You can also see her favourite record, book, movies and whatever else over there.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a wonderful suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be easier to get into her head if I could actually touch, read, watch, and listen to the things she liked, rather than just seeing a list of what she liked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So… why don&#8217;t I first go home and discuss it with Akiha then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;The place I was taken along to by Akiha was a short distance north to the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a relatively new apartment near the Zenpukuji river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A spacious building with pale brown exterior walls, a driveway, wide passageway, and a plantation too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just in front of me was a library that I often used. I was strangely moved by the thought</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, it&#8217;s just across the street from here…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked through the auto-locked entrance, past the lobby with its sofas, and took the elevator up to the third floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..Both of my parents are out today.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha said so whilst keeping her back against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You don&#8217;t need to be so formal, okay? Just relax.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Ah, um&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head in agreement but&#8230; I see, her parents aren&#8217;t here today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a space where there’s no one except the both of us&#8212;&#8212;-.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All alone with my unrequited love&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The palpitation of my heart which was already accelerating rapidly, began to slowly accentuate with each beat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surging up tension and anticipation almost let me out an &#8220;Ugh&#8221; grunt..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just relax, that&#8217;s what she told me just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think there&#8217;s any other situation that would make me so nervous currently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;This is our room.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Oh, this is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But rather than feeling nervous and anxious about the room I was shown, I had a strange feeling arise instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, the room might give an impression of a [sister&#8217;s room with different tastes].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were fancy stuffed toys with lovely accessories lined up alongside a record player and austere records on a shelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the bookshelf, you could see old movie Blu-rays, pure literature novels and romance manga for girls coexisting together. And on the clothing rack, there was a gradation of various colors between a cute and chic clothing level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If one would think normally, it would only look like “A room where two or more people stay in”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However&#8212;&#8212; there was only one set of your usual essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a lone study desk, a singular bed and just one dressing table&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unique appearance of the room seemed to represent both, Akiha and Haruka, and I was completely mesmerized by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;It&#8217;s an unusual sight, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha tilted her neck, perhaps she was concerned about my feelings about her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t know much because I haven&#8217;t gone to a room of a person of the same age but… I wonder if it&#8217;s different from usual.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Oh, yeah. True]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded whilst remembering the room of the friends I have visited so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It might be a little strange. It </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> different from the room of someone like Sudo or Shuji… No, it’s not different in a bad way per say but… more of an interesting way instead. Just like Haruka and Akhia.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see… I&#8217;m glad if it doesn&#8217;t give off any strange feelings. For the time being, sit down on the bed. I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t really have many friends over, so I don&#8217;t have any cushions or such to give you&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, you don&#8217;t need to worry about that at all. Then, pardon me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that and sat down on the bed, trying to look calm and normal, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-The soft feel of the bedsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;The drifting sweet smell coming from beneath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;The elasticity of the squeaking mattress I’m on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I couldn&#8217;t stop the overflowing bad thoughts popping into my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m currently on the bed where Akiha sleeps every night….. the bed where she lies on in her unprotected nightgown.</span></p>



 
<p>It’s not only that though, Akiha not only <i>lives</i> in this room, but she also does her make up, studies and even changes her clothes right in this very space.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, for example, the chest over there, or maybe even the closet there, is where she keeps all her underwear and accessories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she went and accidentally opened one of them, I’d be able to see what she was currently wearing&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;What am I thinking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shake my head and rebuke myself for thinking like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such rude thoughts, even though Akiha led me over here with only good intentions in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, whether it&#8217;s her bed or underwear, half of them belong to Haruka as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it&#8217;s really insincere to hold such feelings against a girl who’s also your friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;But that was really unexpected.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcibly opened my mouth to force these evil thoughts away from my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought you&#8217;d say no to me coming over to your house.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you think about Akiha&#8217;s personality, one might think that she wouldn&#8217;t really let anyone enter her private space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even if Haruka asked me to visit her, I thought that she would refuse instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hereupon, just as I thought,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Certainly, I’m not very good at inviting people into my house.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha replied simply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think this is the first time that someone of our age has actually been in our room.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So it was like that after all… that means&#8230;  I&#8217;m sorry, perhaps we’re forcing you too much here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up from the bed feeling a surging impatience from those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be helped this time since we had selfishly advanced with our talks without even consulting her… so there’s no excuse for what we did this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s fine.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But once again, Akiha simply shook her head in refusal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, in the same tone of voice as before&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It was only about choosing the right person to be here. I don&#8217;t mind if it&#8217;s Yano-kun.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s better not to expect too much from this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she’s saying it just because we are friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or maybe it’s because I&#8217;m helping Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still… the way she&#8217;s treating me like I&#8217;m someone special to her made me feel so hot-headed that I even stopped thinking for a bit.</span></p><div class="zetro-bbdf2150aae766fb2f332ea9ce5d9182 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-bbdf2150aae766fb2f332ea9ce5d9182"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a smirk creeping onto my cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, let&#8217;s get into it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the perfect moment, Akiha&#8217;s voice shut me out of my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, I should explain my hobbies and lifestyle, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230; that&#8217;s right. As impudent as it may be, your cooperation will help me out a lot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Okay. I understand. Yano-kun is helping Haruka, so I&#8217;ll do this much for you. Besides&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha chuckled and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Rather than teaching them to Haruka myself, I&#8217;m more at ease to pass them through Yano-kun instead.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but blurt out to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Certainly. If it&#8217;s Haruka we’re talking about, she might misunderstand or even lose focus or something.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Right? Then, first is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she moved towards the bookshelf,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let&#8217;s start with books. Yano-kun may also be interested in this.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cleared her throat and began to talk about her hobbies&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;-Well actually I think I have read most of what Yano-kun has read.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;The only thing I could enjoy in the hospital is the radio, so that’s how I got interested in jazz. Let&#8217;s listen to some of it for a bit&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I watch at least one movie a day, but I feel frustrated that I can&#8217;t watch anything longer than the changeover time in one sitting.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8211;I hate being called by the store employees, so I usually buy my clothes online at a site called Glacier Mall&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I listened to her story for about an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were trying out some records and watching a couple movies, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Roughly speaking&#8230; that’s kind of feeling it is.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha turned towards me as she put the records back on the jacket we’ve just listened to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s still superficial knowledge but I don&#8217;t think others will get into anything deeper than this. Let&#8217;s leave it at this, since we’ll change in around three minutes now.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha said &#8220;Three minutes&#8221; without even looking at the clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little surprised but maybe the time it takes to switch from one personality to the other is ingrained in her body due to living a long dual personality lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you. You have been a big help to us.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked her and finished summarizing what I had heard in my notebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think knowing that much should be enough for the time being&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because of her reasonable way of speaking, but Akiha’s explanation was packed with a high density of information. If I could engrain all this into my head,just like she said, I’d have no trouble finding something to talk about for the time being.</span></p><div class="zetro-314bae4d0aae5d35a37d7e8cf429c5e5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-314bae4d0aae5d35a37d7e8cf429c5e5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This harvest was well beyond my expectations, and I felt happy as I looked at the pages filled with words about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..You&#8217;re working really hard, aren&#8217;t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the bed I was sitting on swayed a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking towards the area with a sudden movement&#8212;&#8212;I could see Akiha sitting right next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was sitting in a position where our shoulders were almost touching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the fabric of her clothes and the air that separates the two, I could almost feel her body heat fro&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My attention, which I had been devoting to writing the information about Akiha, was suddenly drawn towards her..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The minute hand of the clock on the wall slowly ticked forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You know, I’ve been wondering about this for a while&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.Wh-What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why do you care so much about Haruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha tilted her head and looked me in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano-kun, you’ve been really good to her, haven&#8217;t you? Why is that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;When she asked me that question, I realized that I hadn&#8217;t really explained anything to her yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the present situation from Akiha&#8217;s point of view, it&#8217;s something like a boy from the same class as you is eagerly helping Haruka, who is a part of you for some reason. That might be a little unsettling for me too, in that case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.It’s probably because we somehow resemble each other, Haruka and I]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I said clearly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka, you see, she seriously thinks about wanting to be a ‘single person’, doesn’t she?&#8230;I also think the same way. You see, the first time we met, I was making a character, wasn&#8217;t I?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, that was the case]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I really don&#8217;t want to do that but to persist in class or school, I didn&#8217;t have any other choice. I had to create a character, make it easy to understand how to handle yourself in certain situations, play a role&#8230; to make the people around you laugh, put up with a facade to hide the hurt and sadness within. I thought that if I didn&#8217;t do that, the people around me wouldn&#8217;t accept me for who I was. That&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t stop making those roles, forever&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It was at that time, I was told by Haruka. ‘I want to be a single person’. I thought the same thing myself. This girl is struggling with the same thing I am. If that was the case, I wanted to help her out and so I went and asked her to let me help her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So it was like that&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;In truth, that&#8217;s not the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">whole </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say that I was actually hoping to get closer to her or that it was actually who was following Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know it couldn’t be helped. But I felt guilty because I felt like I was making myself look like a ‘good guy’ in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I haven’t been able to show my true self even to Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.It has been like that for a long time, hasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered those words quierly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was strangely curious about Akiha&#8217;s voice when she mumbled those words.</span></p><div class="zetro-9e905ce3ba362dd34a759b2ad80cd8fe zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9e905ce3ba362dd34a759b2ad80cd8fe"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a voice tinged with dissatisfaction and a little sullenness present in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, the minute hand of the clock ticked and moved forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;See, that girl&#8217;s gap is completely visible to everyone around her, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no trace of dissatisfaction in Akiha&#8217;s face as she said those words with a slight smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That quality of hers seems to attract a lot of good natured people towards her. That&#8217;s why, at the facility and the hospital, she was worried about by various people, and was taken care of very naturally.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she was remembering the old days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slight smile appeared on Akiha&#8217;s face as she said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that her face is just within arm&#8217;s reach upsets me every time I look at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I was&#8230; always the type of person to be left alone .Sometimes I envy the girl who’s cared for by those around her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s voice sounded happy yet also a little sad at those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those gentle eyes that make you think of yourself, as if you were looking at the lights of a distant city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her chest was rising and falling just in time with her breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s step out of my comfort zone for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Haruka prepared this situation for me with so much trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s make an effort to move our relationship forward, even if it&#8217;s just a little bit further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I-I also&#8230;&#8230; to Akiha]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pretending in a nonchalant manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said while desperately hiding the shakiness of my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Certainly, Haruka is important to me but… so is Akiha.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if she was finally noticing something&#8212;&#8212; Akiha looked at me with such a face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her deep jet-black pupils looked straight at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I care about you just as much as I care about Haruka.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet at that exact moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clock ticked again&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Oh!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, with a look of extreme disappointment on her face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s already time for me to change&#8230;..]</span></p><div class="zetro-e77637a3043e213acfdb677e1d069cd2 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e77637a3043e213acfdb677e1d069cd2"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;And then suddenly, all the tension disappeared from her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was expressionless, like a badly made doll. It was as if her emotions had been drained away from her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt;&lt;Part 6&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a moments of gasping,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.ah, we switched]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And her liveliness returned to her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka, who had just switched from Akiha, looked around and puffed out her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Mu&#8211;, Akiha once again switched in front of Yano-kun like usual even though I said I don&#8217;t like it&#8230;&#8230;..ah, so, how was it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She changed her grumpy expression and looked at me with a curious look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did you make any progress?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Progress&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I think I just missed it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.what&#8230;&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lecture to Haruka lasted until just before her personality Changes again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It continued for about two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was considerably worried about her who was in carefree mode preparing sweets and juice as if she was having a girl&#8217;s talk but after two hours, I realized something unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I prefer trios and quartets for jazz rather than large groups. I also like albums recorded in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s rather than the modern sound. Famous names in that area include Bill Evans and John Coltrane.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, we decided to review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka was now reciting as much knowledge as she could recall from today&#8217;s lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;she absorbed all the knowledge faster than I expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she has already memorized most of what she was taught. She can easily recite what Akiha likes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;even in movies, she likes old ones and her favourite story is &#8220;Tokyo&#8217;s story&#8221;. She likes the story, but she also likes to look at the scenery of the time.She also likes &#8220;The Man Who Stole the Sun,&#8221; so maybe she likes extreme stories too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..maybe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I might have misunderstood her a little bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn&#8217;t making blunders just because she was not good at them&#8230;&#8230;.but that there were other factors that prevented her from reaching her full potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For novels, I prefer ennui novels from the early Showa era, especially the one where feeling of young girl&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;-wa, wait a Minute, Haruka]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to cut through the seemingly endless recitation and ask her.</span></p><div class="zetro-2e5e1825ea29c1d895652591c07a36a0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2e5e1825ea29c1d895652591c07a36a0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well&#8230;&#8230;I am going to change the subject]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ok&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You took the entrance test when you transferred to our school, right? Did Haruka also take that? Not only Akiha]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, that&#8217;s right. I also took it&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Was it really hard? Did you have to study a lot?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I went to school as much as I could and studied on my own at the hospital, so it wasn&#8217;t too hard. &#8230;&#8230;.. I even studied for the test briefly&#8230;&#8230;.I more or less studied for it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Didn&#8217;t you have a hard time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyamae High school, the school we attend, is one of the top preparatory High schools in this area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard that the entrance exam is harder than the regular entrance exam, so it can&#8217;t be that easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, since their memories are not shared, they only have an average of twelve hours a day to spend. The time they spend studying must be much shorter than the other students&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I didn&#8217;t understand very well as a long time hasn&#8217;t passed since they have transferred schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seems like Haruka isn&#8217;t a slow learner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, isn&#8217;t she pretty smart?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..then, is there something you are good in physical education?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been watching her during class to follow her, but I can&#8217;t do the same for the boys and girls PE. In image alone, it doesn&#8217;t seem like she is very good at sport but I wonder how it&#8217;s in reality?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um&#8230;.. I&#8217;m not very good at it. When I&#8217;m in gym class, it&#8217;s so depressing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, as expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, what are you bad at?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ball games&#8230;&#8230;I guess. I&#8217;m playing volleyball with others but it&#8217;s hard to not get run down&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230;by the way, have you ever timed a 50-meter dash?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. It was measured in the first gym class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What was your time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, well. I guess it&#8217;s around 7 Seconds&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really&#8230;.?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at the unexpected timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven Seconds. I am also around at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The average time for the 50-meter run is quite different between men and women, so it should be quite fast for women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;with this, I feel one possible theory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s wrong? What do you mean by that question?]</span></p><div class="zetro-f5226523405ddd2667e42ca1bb86c89b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f5226523405ddd2667e42ca1bb86c89b"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka peeked at me curiously from next to the bed I was sitting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I was just wondering if the reason Haruka make so many blunder is because she doesn&#8217;t have confidence]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; confidence?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. You make mistakes not because you lack the ability but because of your feelings. But when you think about it, it&#8217;s natural. Akiha is obviously good at both study and sports, right? Since Haruka shares the same body with her, it&#8217;s not surprising that she can do the same.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.Ah, that&#8217;s right. That might be so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In fact, you&#8217;ve been able to get good results in competitions where the body&#8217;s natural specs can be easily displayed, like the 50-meter dash. Besides, it was so easy for you to remember what Akiha taught you today, wasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; isn&#8217;t that something everyone can do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s not like that. At Least I can&#8217;t do that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a bad student, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m any worse at memorizing than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means the memorization power of Haruka is by far the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But when you&#8217;re not confident, you can&#8217;t show off your abilities well, right? In fact, it seems that Haruka is quite worried about her own mistakes&#8230; maybe that&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t do well?.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, I see. That might be so&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well at best that&#8217;s just a hypothesis. There&#8217;s also the possibility that the effects of dual personality are restricted from what you can do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not an expert in that area, so I can&#8217;t say for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a case of multiple personalities, there are psychological effects that limit what the main personality can do. I have heard that there are cases where a person can do things that his main personality cannot do. It&#8217;s possible that such restrictions are put on Haruka this time too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at least&#8212;&#8211;there isn&#8217;t doubt that Haruka can also work dexterously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, you&#8217;re right&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka nodded while looking down at the rug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You are right. It&#8217;s strange that Akiha, who can do so much but I can&#8217;t, who has the same body, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, if you want to unite your personalities, maybe you should set a goal to become more confident&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said that&#8212;&#8212;-I noticed that I was feeling a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words &#8220;unite your personality&#8221; that I had just said as if it were a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the goal Haruka is aiming for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you think about it&#8212;&#8212;-what exactly is that supposed to mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, I have unconsciously thought of it as a &#8220;good thing&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have innocently believed that it is our goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However I wonder if it&#8217;s that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if it would be enough to just say, &#8220;Good for you&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.I see, confidence]</span></p><div class="zetro-1cee7464dc7fbd0056eb7aee196ac499 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1cee7464dc7fbd0056eb7aee196ac499"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up to express my doubts, Haruka folded her arms and pondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Indeed that wasn&#8217;t the case until now&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrinkled her brow and slumped down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that expression and posture, Haruka looks like splitting image of Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, she looks like Akiha on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, I noticed that the pace of my pulse started to accelerate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know the one in front of me is Akiha.And yet, my heart felt a little higher than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;wait a min.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up until now, I had been able to properly differentiate between Akiha and Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have unrequited feelings only for Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Haruka, I should have only feelings as friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is it that now I suddenly feel like I&#8217;m merging the two&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly cover my emotions from guilty feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding such feelings when she is Haruka is betrayal to both Akiha and Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;&#8230;once you are aware of that, it&#8217;s not easy to suppress your emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet scent in the room, the warmth of her body over my shoulder, it&#8217;s hard to stay calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to her, from this angle, I could see a little of her cleavage through the loose collar of her dress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked slender, but her bulge stood out unexpectedly.Her skin was as white as soap, with no scars or blemishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I knew it was wrong, even though I felt terrible self-loathing, I just couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..hm? what&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes met with Haruka who looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t gloss it over or make an excuse anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N, no, nothing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I said this, I can clearly feel my cheeks getting hotter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually Sweat gushed out from my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps noticing the meaning,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.huh?ah, well, that&#8230;&#8230;ahaha&#8230;..]</span></p><div class="zetro-870f93332fa441ab4a19aae5ac4993d5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-870f93332fa441ab4a19aae5ac4993d5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After her eyes fluttered here and there for a while, Haruka held her chest, laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, sorry. I&#8217;m not Akiha. She will be out soon, so wait a min]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no. I didn&#8217;t mean it like that, I am sorry for looking with strange eyes. I was kind of confused somehow&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt;&lt;&lt;PART 2&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, I don&#8217;t think it can be helped. If I were in the same situation, I am sure I would be in confusion as well&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I, I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were cut off, and an awkward silence fell over the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little uncomfortable at the atmosphere that was there before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Any, anyway, I think the confidence will become the key from here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forced myself to continue the conversation we just had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why I think you might need to ask Akiha how to act with confidence or find your own method how to be confident]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t meant to be a meaningful remark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to change the atmosphere so I just said something we could agree upon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, to that girl&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka says that and looks down at her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Does Akiha look like that from Yano-kun point?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;what?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Does she look confident to you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heat on my cheeks immediately subsided at the unexpected question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, all I have attention to is the way she carries herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha, who didn&#8217;t Carried away by her surroundings, didn&#8217;t go along with the flow and kept her true feelings to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was a sign of her self-confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, of course she has a lot more confidence compared to me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka waved her hands in panic as if to correct what she just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Or more precisely, it&#8217;s funny comparing her to me who has no confidence at all&#8230;..but&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she smiled affectionately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like how Akiha smiled when she talks about Haruka,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think they are lot of things she wants to say but she can&#8217;t]</span></p><div class="zetro-8c4b1b2c876391142d02a34fe1f74fcf zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8c4b1b2c876391142d02a34fe1f74fcf"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Things she wants to say but can&#8217;t]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. Because she isn&#8217;t very good at showing her weakness, she couldn&#8217;t ask for help&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka reached over and picked up the record on the chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an old, austere record with a design that seemed out of place for a high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She caress her lovingly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why I think that might be the reason I was born&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;This is the reason why Haruka was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, it must exist in Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, then it&#8217;s just what she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that Akiha is strong or has self confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;she may have developed such a personality in order to protect herself from something, in order to defend herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then Haruka&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;It&#8217;s about time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka confirmed the time on her smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, is it already&#8230;&#8230;.?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said so, I looked at the watch to confirm, 5:21 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around 126 minutes has elapsed since Haruka has switched to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is still some time left from the 131 minutes I heard before&#8230;&#8230;.but just as she said, time changes slightly from day to day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry but can you turn your back around for a moment&#8230;&#8230;.it&#8217;s embarrassing to be seen&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[O, ok]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was told, I turned away from her, changing the angle I was sitting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a vexing few seconds or so,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha was already there when I turned around at the voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I wonder why that cold face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only a little but I could feel the lonely sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..well, that&#8217;s it for today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before I could say that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha stood up without resuming the conversation before she was replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you for that girl. I will take you to the station]</span></p><div class="zetro-5c234abf3d2fbfebe22046f0da910c15 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5c234abf3d2fbfebe22046f0da910c15"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.yeah, thanks to you too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I couldn&#8217;t say the rest of that line either.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">April 15th (Sunday), Akiha</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Yano-kun came to our house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glad that he enthusiastically note what I said and understood it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glad that the lecture to Haruka goes well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really glad.</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a few moments of her gasping,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Ah, we switched.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her liveliness quickly returned to her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka, who had just switched from Akiha, looked around and puffed out her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Mou&#8211;, Akiha once again switched in front of Yano-kun like usual. Even though I said that I don&#8217;t like it… Ah, so, how was it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She changed her grumpy expression and looked at me with a curious look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did you make any progress?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Progress, you say…&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.I think I just missed it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.what?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lecture lasted until about just before her personality would change again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It continued on for about two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was considerably worried about her, who was in a very carefree mode preparing sweets and juice as if she was having a casual girl&#8217;s talk with her friends but after two hours, I saw something unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I prefer trios and quartets for jazz rather than large groups. I also like albums recorded in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s rather than any modern songs. The famous names in that era include Bill Evans and John Coltrane.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had decided to review everything we had learnt today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka was currently reciting as much knowledge as she could recall from today&#8217;s lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;She absorbed all the knowledge much faster than I had actually expected from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she has already memorized most of what she was taught today. She can easily recite what Akiha likes from the top of her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;In movies, she likes old ones and her favourite story is ‘Tokyo&#8217;s story’. She likes the storyline, but she also likes to look at the scenery most of the time. She also likes ‘The Man Who Stole the Sun,’ so maybe she likes extreme stories too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.maybe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I might have underestimated her a little.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn&#8217;t making any blunders just because she was not good at them&#8230; but there were many other factors that prevented her from reaching her full potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For novels, I prefer ennui novels from the early Showa era, especially the one where the feelings of young girl&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;-Wa-Wait a Minute, Haruka.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to cut through the seemingly endless recitation and ask her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I’m changing the subject real quick.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Okay&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So Akiha took the entrance test when you transferred to our school, right? Did Haruka also take that test?]</span></p><div class="zetro-6deda7f765d5efa35c5f54788aae85e9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6deda7f765d5efa35c5f54788aae85e9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, that&#8217;s right. I also took the test&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Was it really hard? Did you have to study a lot?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I went to school as much as I could and studied on my own at the hospital, so it wasn&#8217;t too hard. . I even studied for the test briefly&#8230; I more or less studied for it as much as I could.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.Didn&#8217;t you have a hard time with it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyamae High school, the school we attend, is one of the top preparatory high schools in this area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard that the entrance exam is harder than the regular entrance exam, so it can&#8217;t be that easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more is that, since their memories aren’t shared, they only have an average of about twelve hours a day to properly spend. The time they spend studying must be much shorter than any other student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I didn&#8217;t understand it very well, since it’s not been that long since they’ve transferred schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seems like Haruka isn&#8217;t a slow learner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, isn&#8217;t she actually pretty smart?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..then, is there something you are good at in physical education?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been watching her during class to follow her quietly, but I can&#8217;t do the same during the boy’s and girl’s PE. Using purely her image alone, it doesn&#8217;t seem like she is very good at any sports but I wonder how it actually is in reality?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um&#8230; I&#8217;m not very good at it. When I&#8217;m in gym class, it&#8217;s really depressing.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, it’s as I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, what are you bad at then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ball games… I guess. I play volleyball with others but it&#8217;s hard not to get run down by the  others&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see… .by the way, have you ever timed a 50-meter dash before?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. It was measured in the first gym class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What was your time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Um, well. I guess it was around 7 Seconds&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Really&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at that unexpected timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven seconds. My time was also just about 7 seconds as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The average time for the 50-meter run is quite different between men and women, so it should be quite fast for women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;with this, I felt one possible theory pop into my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s wrong? What do you mean by that question?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka peeked at me curiously next to the bed I’m sitting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I was just wondering if the reason Haruka makes so many blunders is because she doesn&#8217;t have confidence in herself.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;confidence?]</span></p><div class="zetro-8b870c50628112f55d2d2a67673c3e13 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8b870c50628112f55d2d2a67673c3e13"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. You make mistakes not because you lack the ability to do so, but due to your feelings when doing so. But well, when you think about it, that’s natural. Akiha is obviously good at both studies and sports, right? Since Haruka shares the same body with her, it&#8217;s not surprising that she can also do the same.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Ah, that&#8217;s right. That might be so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In fact, you&#8217;ve been able to get good results in competitions where the body&#8217;s natural specs can be easily displayed, like the 50-meter dash. Besides, it was easy for you to remember what Akiha taught you today, wasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;isn&#8217;t that something everyone can do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s not like that. At the very least, I can&#8217;t do that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a bad student either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m any worse at memorizing something than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means the memorization power of Haruka is by far some of the best that one can have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But when you&#8217;re not confident, you can&#8217;t show off your abilities well, right? In fact, it seems that Haruka is quite worried about her own mistakes&#8230; so maybe that&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t do well?.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, I see. That might be so&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well at best, that&#8217;s just a hypothesis that I thought of. There&#8217;s also the possibility that the effects of your dual personality restricts you from what you can actually do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not an expert in that area, so I can&#8217;t say that for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a case of multiple personalities, there are also psychological effects that limit what the main personality can do. I have heard that there are cases where a person can do things that his main personality cannot do. It&#8217;s possible that such restrictions are put on Haruka this time too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the very least&#8212;&#8211;there isn&#8217;t doubt that Haruka can also work dexterously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, you&#8217;re right&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka nodded whilst looking down at the rug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You’re right. It&#8217;s strange that Akiha can do so much, but I can’t even though we have the same body, isn’t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, if you want to unite your personalities, maybe you should set a goal to become more confident&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said that&#8212;&#8212;-I noticed that I was feeling a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said the words ‘Unite your personality’ as if it were a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the goal Haruka was aiming for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you think about it carefully&#8212;&#8212;-what</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> exactly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is that supposed to mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, I’ve unconsciously thought of it as a ‘good thing’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve innocently believed that it was our main goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I wonder if it actually is that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if it would be enough to just say, &#8220;Good for you&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, confidence&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up to express my doubts, Haruka folded her arms and pondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Indeed that wasn&#8217;t the case up until now&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrinkled her brow and slumped down.</span></p><div class="zetro-ed06899cded08c2b4ea9db8d4d065e4f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ed06899cded08c2b4ea9db8d4d065e4f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that expression and posture, Haruka looks like a splitting image of Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, she looks just like Akiha on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, I noticed that the pace of my pulse began to accelerate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know the one in front of me is Haruka. And yet, my heart rate felt a little higher than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;.Wait a minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up until now, I had been able to properly differentiate between Akiha and Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only have these unrequited feelings for Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should only have a feeling of being friends towards Haruka..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But yet, why is it that now I suddenly feel like I&#8217;m merging the two together&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly cover my emotions from these guilty feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding such feelings when she’s Haruka is a betrayal to both Akiha </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230; once you are aware of that fact, it isn’t easy to suppress your raging emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet scent in the room, the warmth of her body over my shoulder. It’s really hard to stay calm in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to her, from this angle I’m seated on, I could see a little of her cleavage through the loose collar of her dress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked slender, but her bulge stood out unexpectedly. Her skin was as white as soap, with no scars or blemishes sewn upon it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I knew it was wrong, even though I felt such terrible self-loathing, I just couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Hm? What&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes met with Haruka who had looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t gloss it over or make an excuse anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N-No, it’s nothing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I said it’s nothing, I could clearly feel my cheeks getting even hotter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually sweat began to gush out of my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked at me. And perhaps noticing the meaning she&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..Huh? Ah, well, that&#8230;&#8230; Ahaha&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After her eyes fluttered here and there for a while, Haruka held her chest, laughing at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry, sorry. I&#8217;m not Akiha. She will be out soon, so just wait for a bit.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no. I didn&#8217;t mean it like that. I am sorry for looking at you with strange eyes. I was a bit confused somehow&#8230;.]</span></p><div class="zetro-f03dcb3725751a1e8ad4b2e12e8a7c78 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f03dcb3725751a1e8ad4b2e12e8a7c78"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt;&lt;&lt;PART 7&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, I don&#8217;t think it could be helped. If I were in the same situation, I’m sure I‘d be confused too&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I-I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words cut off and an awkward silence fell over the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little uncomfortable at the atmosphere that was present before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[An-Anyways, I think that confidence will be the key here onwards.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forced myself to continue the conversation we just had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why, I think you might need to ask Akiha on how to act with confidence, or maybe you can find your own method on how to be confident.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t meant to be a very meaningful remark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to change the atmosphere so I just said something we could both agree upon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, to that girl&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka says that and looks down at her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Does Akiha look like that from Yano-kun’s view?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Does she look that confident to you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heat on my cheeks immediately subsided at that unexpected question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, all I’ve paid attention to is the way that she naturally carries herself forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha, who doesn’t get carried away by her surroundings, doesn’t go along with the flow and keeps her true feelings to herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that it was a sign of her self-confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, of course, she has a lot more confidence compared to me though!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka waved her hands in panic as if to correct what she just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Or more precisely, it&#8217;s funny comparing her to me, who’s someone who has no confidence at all&#8230; but&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she smiled affectionately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That smile was just like how Akiha smiles when she talks about Haruka,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think that there are a lot of things that she wants to say but she just can&#8217;t.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Things that she wants to say but can&#8217;t?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. It’s because she isn&#8217;t very good at showing her weaknesses, that she couldn&#8217;t ask for help&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka reached over and picked up the record on the chest.</span></p><div class="zetro-d6bed34e10f17d5c5f3983c426d271a5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d6bed34e10f17d5c5f3983c426d271a5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an old, austere record with a design that seemed out of place for a high school girl to own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She caress it lovingly and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think that might be the reason I was born&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;That is the reason why Haruka was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, something like that must exist in Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, then it&#8217;s just like what she just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that Akiha is strong or has a lot of self confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather… .she may have developed such a personality in order to protect herself from something else. It was made in order to defend herself from something we don’t know about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking more about it, Haruka said&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;It&#8217;s about time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka confirmed the time on her smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, is it time already&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said so, I looked at the watch to confirm, and saw that it was 5:21 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around 126 minutes have elapsed since Akiha has switched before..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s still some time left from the 131 minutes that I had heard before but…  just as she said before, the timing changes slightly from day to day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry, but can you turn your back around for a moment&#8230; it&#8217;s embarrassing to be seen like this&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[O-Okay.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was told, I turned away from her, changing the angle I was currently sitting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a vexing few seconds or so,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s okay now.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha was already there when I turned around at her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I wonder why she has that cold face on her right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only a little but I could feel the loneliness stemming from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Well, that&#8217;s it for today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before I could say anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha stood up without resuming the conversation we had before Haruka took over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you for taking care of that girl. I’ll take you to the station]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Yeah, thank you too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say the rest of that line to her.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">April 15th (Sunday), Akiha</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Yano-kun came over to our house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glad that he enthusiastically noted what I had said and understood it very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glad that the lecture to Haruka went well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really glad.</span></p>
