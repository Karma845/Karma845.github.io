<h3>Chapter 4 - Abandoned mirror in the awn </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was in the morning of the next day that I felt a sense of discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the break time after the first period ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a slight doubt looking at Akiha who was reading a paperback sitting three seats in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.why is it that Akiha is out right now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Haruka&#8217;s pretense of Akiha had improved, I could still vaguely tell which of the two personalities was outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, to most people, they just see her as [Minase Akiha].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can tell the difference between Akiha and Haruka by their facial habits, small gestures, and tone of voice. I was quite confident in my accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And currently, it should be Haruka&#8217;s personality time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just around fifty minutes ago, right before the class, she had left for the restroom and had just come back when she had changed to Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> She still has enough time before changing to Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Am I misunderstanding?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that my perception to recognize the difference between them has become dull?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is also possible that after the incident in Odaiba, Haruka&#8217;s impersonation has become more advanced than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, it can&#8217;t be helped in this case]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I&#8217;m sure I will mess up the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still couldn&#8217;t understand the meaning behind the words of Akiha who said it last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What does she mean my it will become a mess? Why will it become a mess?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, it&#8217;s still incomprehensible to me why she asked [Did you also kiss?].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though saying that, there&#8217;s no way I can go to Akiha and ask &#8220;what does that mean?&#8221; after all that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I wanted to talk to Haruka about it today&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But I still have a chance&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up at my wristwatch and thought back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have almost six hours left before I have to leave for school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There will be plenty of chances to talk with Haruka before that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Letting out a breath, I plunged my hands into my desk and began to prepare for my second period class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after looking at her situation for a while, my doubt turned into conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are they going to switch now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the fourth period class, Haruka secretly switched places with Akiha while keeping her face down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, no matter how I think about it, the timing was strange.</span></p><div class="zetro-7826c8a640a959a21c12beb8821f2305 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7826c8a640a959a21c12beb8821f2305"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Akiha&#8217;s personality lasted for almost two hours as before, only Haruka&#8217;s personality seems to have switched in less than an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..hey]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;hmm? What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lunch break has passed and the fifth period is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a corner of the corridor, I was finally able to catch Haruka on her way back from the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there weren&#8217;t any people around, Haruka continued to play as Akiha just in case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was too frustrated to go to the club room now, so I asked her straightforwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka, isn&#8217;t the time of your personality being outside kind of short&#8230;..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka&#8217;s eyebrows knit in annoyance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahaha, you noticed?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she laughed in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, somehow it has been like that since last night&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Seriously, are you all right? That]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time it has happened since I have met them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the time to change their personality did change, the timing for both personalities to be outside was equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time since I met them that I had seen such a difference, I felt an unpleasant premonition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Probably, I wonder if it&#8217;s really all right&#8230;..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Haruka&#8217;s face lacks any sense of crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Up until now, the time of change has changed quite a bit&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Was there also a difference between the time both personalities are out?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. I feel like there was]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the question was growing in me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Haruka seems to be unnaturally calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, is she trying to hide something from me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth she has perceived the changes happening to her body&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, before I could say it,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, sorry. It&#8217;s about time for the next period to start]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Says Haruka, confirming the time in her wrist watch.</span></p><div class="zetro-03ddfc79db76a1e715b148f02bc17611 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-03ddfc79db76a1e715b148f02bc17611"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Shall we go to class? We will be late]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y-yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and started walking alongside Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8212;-I soon realized that the uneasiness I was feeling at that moment was not a misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;-So, when reading the novels of this era, it might be interesting to keep in mind the &#8220;Modernistic ego.&#8221;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the fact that it was afternoon class, there were no students dozing off in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than saying it&#8217;s because students of this class are hardworking, it might be better to say that&#8217;s because of the ability of the modern literature teacher, Chiyoda sensei, who was speaking on stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If you look at it with today&#8217;s sensibilities, you might think that he is the worst kind of dishonest man. When I was in high school, I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dancing Girl</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and was very angry with it. But after I learned the concept of modern ego, no, it&#8217;s still not good. Still, I couldn&#8217;t help but dislike Toyotaro.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N : dancing girl is a short Japanese novel written in 1890. In short, the story is about a Japanese man who had to choose between his Carrier or the girl he had fallen in love with, a  German dancing girl. He chose the carrier leaving behind the girl who was pregnant with his child, sending the girl into a nervous breakdown. Toyotaro is the name of protagonist)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small laugh went up from the students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei, who has been my homeroom teacher since last year, is now twenty-seven years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From a student&#8217;s point of view, her impression is that of a &#8220;petite, mysterious ex-literary girl.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she is not difficult to get to know, and with her easy to understand lessons and student-friendly personality, she is basically treated as a beautiful teacher who understands what she is talking about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumour has it that she is about to get married to her boyfriend she has been dating for many years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was even an incident where one part of male students were so shocked to hear this that they took a day off from school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, let&#8217;s begin the reading of the next paragraph. Students from there, please start reading from next paragraph in succession]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Chiyoda Sensei points to the row beside the hallway&#8212;&#8211;the row that has been assigned to Me, Akiha and Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, she glanced at Akiha&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; that must be my imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei seemed to be paying a lot of attention to Akiha, the transferred student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I often saw her talking to her in between homerooms and before and after class, and sometimes she would also ask me, Sudo and Shuji how she was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So maybe there was some kind of intention behind her to do like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first student stood up and began to read in a stuttering voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my face and looked towards Akiha&#8217;s seat, it seems like it&#8217;s currently Haruka from her expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to have just changed back when I talked to her in the corridor&#8230;&#8230; so there&#8217;s still time before she get replaced by Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when it was soon Haruka&#8217;s turn to read aloud, there wasn&#8217;t any sign of impatience in her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a certain length of the reading, Chiyoda-sensei instructed the students behind her to take their roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the story, Toyotaro wanders around the city in a state of exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well that&#8217;s it. Please continue from here Minase-san]</span></p><div class="zetro-44b5258f2ba69b1bf66cb50d728f589e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-44b5258f2ba69b1bf66cb50d728f589e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The turn came to Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Since it was a night in early January, the pubs and teahouses of Unter den Linden would have been crowded with people coming and going, without thinking&#8212;-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice that sounded like the rolling of bells echoed in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda Sensei was looking at Haruka with a happy face. Just a little while ago, Haruka had stuttered and stammered many times in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even know how many times she had practiced her reading in the club room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her tone of voice was not stagnant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To a passerby, it would be impossible for them to distinguish her from Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The only thing that fills the brain is that I&#8217;m a sinner who cannot be spared&#8212;&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked down at my textbook, feeling somewhat comfortable with Haruka&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, it would be my turn to do the reading. I had like to confirm what part I am going to read while I&#8217;m at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In the Attic of the fourth floor, Eris was still awake, unable to slee&#8212;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After reading that much, Haruka suddenly stopped reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unnatural silence suddenly descended on the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reflexively looked up and stretched out from my chair to look at Haruka, and I was shocked to see her expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was like that of a badly made doll, so much that I wasn&#8217;t even able to read any of her feelings.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;She switched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time her expression changed at this time. And just a few seconds later,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The color of astonishment appeared on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she had just switched, Akiha raised her face from the textbook, looked around and grasped the current situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face scrunched up in impatience. Her eyes widen and she stands there silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Minase-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she has noticed the strangeness coming from Akiha. Chiyoda-sensei&#8217;s voice was tinged with seriousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s wrong with you? Are you feeling well?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, just&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha fumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bead of cold sweat broke out on her pale cheek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that, a little commotion broke out in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so when she bit her lip, unable to do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, perhaps&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Chiyoda-sensei raised her voice in an unnaturally cheerful way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You couldn&#8217;t read the next kanji?] (T/N : just think of it as spelling in English for those who don&#8217;t know)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her face, a smile formed in her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s very unusual for you, Minase-san. This one is read as &#8220;Brilliant.&#8221;  So this five line order is &#8220;Fire of Brilliant stars.&#8221; Can you read it again from there.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The follow-up seemed to have helped her understand what she needed to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha stared at her textbook and then wiped the sweat off her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;.Y-Yes. I&#8217;m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recitation begins once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The fire of a brilliant star, if you put it in the dark sky, you can see it clearly, but it becomes a snowflake like a heron that falls down&#8212;-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the crisis had been averted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a sigh of relief and looked at my wristwatch, the time was around 15:15. [ED: 3:15.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has only been about 40 minutes since she LAST switched from Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I rethink about that event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, no matter how much I think about it, I can only think that something is definitely happening with Haruka and Akihi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something very important must be happening between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To both Akiha and Haruka, it must also be something unexpected.</span></p><div class="zetro-5c8a7aeb81a284f96a7138c8700fcb67 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5c8a7aeb81a284f96a7138c8700fcb67"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I&#8212;-.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stared at Akiha&#8217;s back as she continued reading her lines, I made a small decision in my heart.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umm, there’s something I want you to hear]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was past sixteen o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the corner of the hallway leading to the elevator, I called out to Akiha, who was leaving alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[About Haruka&#8230; What&#8217;s happening to her today&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little reluctant to talk to her in this way after the exchange we had yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still couldn&#8217;t understand what Akiha&#8217;s thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t guess at all, I couldn’t understand the meaning behind her words. But I didn&#8217;t feel like taking it in an easy-going manner anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but feel awkward. But I still want to know what&#8217;s going on with the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I want to understand what&#8217;s going on between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha looked down and didn&#8217;t speak back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to ask her a few more questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;The time that Haruka is out is getting shorter and shorter. What&#8217;s more is, it&#8217;s getting shorter and shorter throughout the day. It didn&#8217;t even last fifty minutes in the morning and it barely lasted about forty minutes earlier.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha still didn&#8217;t reply back to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hope it&#8217;s nothing&#8230; but I&#8217;m a little worried. Even for Akiha, it seems like something unexpected is going on. That&#8217;s why, I hope you can let me know if you know something. If something has happened&#8230; I&#8217;d be really worried.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to be as sincere as I could. I was concerned about them and wanted to help them as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have included such intentions properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;But.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha continued her silence, looking down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Hey, Akiha.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You aren&#8217;t going to tell me anything&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A little past dismissal time, in an empty corner of the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to mention words, she didn&#8217;t even show any emotion on her face&#8212;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a burning sensation in my stomach and realize that I&#8217;m getting frustrated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up to now, I have tried to talk with Akiha countless times.</span></p><div class="zetro-e7959431440f8b942ad5cb31997d500e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e7959431440f8b942ad5cb31997d500e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to help them if they are in trouble, if it&#8217;s possible, I hope she can confide it to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, Akiha didn&#8217;t say anything in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All she does is sit in silence with a pensive expression on her face..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said such words mixed with a deep sigh, even I was surprised by my sudden harsh voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8212;-I can&#8217;t stop now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..is Akiha not going to talk again? Are you going to keep silent about this? All alone?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The anxiety of not being able to read her expressions and the loneliness of not being able to come to grips with them come out from my mouth in the form of words of condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heat on my forehead covered up my awareness of my selfish anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then that&#8217;s fine. I will not ask Akiha. Do whatever you want.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said as if to sort my feelings out and walked towards the exit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was upset with myself for spitting out those words so violently, but I also felt a little relief from doing so that I couldn&#8217;t deny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hands were shaking, my body was sweating, and the air was cold against my cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sleeve of my uniform was pulled down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around to look, I saw Akiha looking down while gripping my blazer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped a small breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep blue skin, like a tanned portrait. Weak and Haggard eyes. Her cheeks were stiff due to the tension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;That&#8217;s right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yano-kun is also angry&#8230; that&#8217;s also the same for me. Everyone is determined to be that way.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked as if she would fall apart at the touch of a finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being in front of her, I couldn&#8217;t say a single word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s all my fault&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Akiha said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Going to disappear&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8230;.?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a pale face and a terribly hoarse voice, she informed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka is going to disappear soon&#8230;]</span></p><div class="zetro-f7e02d4a870b94fa64b9ab4ccc6ae5bb zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f7e02d4a870b94fa64b9ab4ccc6ae5bb"></div>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the park after being driven out of school after school had ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka, who had just switched personalities, had a soft expression on her face as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I, whose mind has gone blank, don&#8217;t know what kind of face I should make for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I cry or should I smile?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I make a serious face or a face where I’m poking fun at her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, even if I knew what I needed to do, there was no way I could act like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just stared at her while biting my lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Oh, it seems like Akiha told you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the light of a cheap street lamp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Haruka heard the detailed story, she gave a small laugh like a child who had been caught in a prank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well indeed, when it&#8217;s told like this, it’d be hard to hide. Yes, it can’t be helped&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;is that the truth?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a parched throat, I asked as if clinging to a small glimmer of hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haruka is going to disappear&#8230;. isn&#8217;t it some kind of misunderstanding or that you might have just guessed it wrong&#8230;.?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unpleasant sweat didn&#8217;t stop overflowing from my body after hearing about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both my hands and feet were trembling so awfully that I felt like I would collapse on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Of course It&#8217;s not possible! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I was just kidding!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all honesty, I was anticipating such an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Yeah. That&#8217;s what the current situation looks like.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;After all, it was the flu.      (T/N : why suddenly flu)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;My bones are cracking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka continues to say such words with a light tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m going to disappear slowly, as the time for me to come out is decreasing&#8230;]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Originally, this was a story that was bound to happen sooner or later&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the after-school club room, where there were only the two of us, she sat down on the chair across from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha, who looked as if she was in a mayhem, spillt out these words from her ghastly pale lips falteringly.</span></p><div class="zetro-6c43966dcfe2ee7fb464de4a5954182a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6c43966dcfe2ee7fb464de4a5954182a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The problem in my house&#8230; was solved last year. There is no longer any reason for the dual personality, that&#8217;s why&#8230; the time of us switching&#8230; is getting shorter.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Ah, y-yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded awkwardly, agitating from seeing Akiha who has lost her usual composure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I didn&#8217;t survey it clearly, I definitely felt like their time between switches was getting shorter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[When I had the dual personality disorder, the timing was around 200 minutes&#8230;.. When I met Yano-kun, it was around 130 minutes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Before going out, it was getting shorter and shorter, and it ended up around 109 minutes&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe it was getting that much shorter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at the numbers again, I was horrified for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a distinct feeling that the number was a countdown to &#8212;&#8211; something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just as I thought,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[When this number decreases, the time keeps getting shorter.. .and finally when the timing reaches 0&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then after saying that, Akiha squeezed the hem of her skirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I was told that&#8230;&#8230; the double personality disorder will end, and that Haruka will disappear&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;I felt my head lurch in shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scenery shook, and for a moment I didn&#8217;t know where I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;Being told that she was going to disappear was&#8230;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Seriously&#8230; So, that was happening from the very beginning&#8230; that&#8217;s&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ending was simple and cruel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their unknown future I didn&#8217;t know about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words that she spoke seemed to penetrate Akiha herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..I have heard it over and over but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She continued, with her voice trembling awfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have confirmed it with the family doctor multiple times but there’s nothing that can be done about it… In the first place, it was already strange for the main personality to divide into two&#8230; it will end someday, cause once the cause is gone, there was no reason for it to continue&#8230; that&#8217;s what I was told&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And so I was thinking, I want Haruka to&#8230; live her own life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha put more power on her hand holding the hem of her skirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even if her time is short, I want her to live happily, have fun&#8230;make friends, fall in love&#8230;. and yet that girl is hiding from them! Pretending to be me! Because in the first place, I shouldn&#8217;t be here&#8230; No matter how many times I try to convince her, no matter how many times I fight with her, she always, always&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that was revealed to me for the first time cleared up the doubts that had been smoldering in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka, pretending to be Akiha, and Akiha, who seemed to be reluctant sometimes… The unbelievable story behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the fight they had the day before in Odaiba may have been caused by this disagreement.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T/N : In this section it’s Haruka and not Akiha, even I was a bit confused as there wasn&#8217;t any line about them switching.From here till end every * will denote the change of personality]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Then what was that about wanting to become &#8221;Herself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly realized the question, and my voice became loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You said that, right? You said that the closer you get to Akiha, the more your personality becomes one. That&#8217;s why you wanted to imitate her. What was that all about!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what Haruka had said when I talked with her for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka was pretending to become Akiha because she wanted to become &#8220;Herself&#8221;, and hiding her existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I felt a sense of camaraderie​ from her&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Haruka was going to disappear one day, then what was all that we had talked about&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry&#8230; That was a lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka plopped her head down and replied in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It was the truth that I wanted to become &#8220;Myself.&#8221; But&#8230; it was a lie when I said that if I were able to get closer to her, our personalities would become one. I&#8217;m sorry, but if I told you the truth, you would have been surprised and perhaps you would have even been taken back from us and take some distance away from me&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying so, Haruka raised her head and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for deceiving you&#8230;. and I&#8217;m really sorry for making you help me for so long&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted a place to hang out, even if it were only for a little while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I screamed in a disgraceful way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Until Odaiba, there was still 109 minutes left, so there was still some time left, right? There&#8217;s no way she should be disappearing so soon, right!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right. In truth, that&#8217;s how it was supposed to be&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Akiha bit her lip so hard that it looked like it was going to tear from the pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even the doctor said that it would last several months&#8230;. around six months&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why!? Why is Haruka going to disappear so soon!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s getting shorter, isn&#8217;t it? The time&#8230; she&#8217;s been staying outside.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Among us&#8230; It&#8217;s because the feeling inside of us… has become too strong&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What feelings?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That question made Akiha look down a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, without looking at me, she said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The feeling of&#8230; denying Haruka&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-That is the one feeling that became too strong in both of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s… in other words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka to herself and Akiha to haruka&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So far&#8230; I had been saying that. You are indispensable. I want you to be happy. No matter how much, no matter to what extent that girl denies herself, I have been denying her claim every time&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But&#8230; but. That&#8217;s not the case right now. So, at the rate we&#8217;re going, we&#8217;ve only got a few more  days&#8230; almost no time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..Akiha is&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my voice echoing from afar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You really cared about Haruka, didn&#8217;t you? You wanted her to stay by your side forever, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yes&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-adc38267e0424bf89d5d7e9a4c8f72b8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-adc38267e0424bf89d5d7e9a4c8f72b8"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I ask Akiha, clearly feeling like I was sticking a knife into her heart and gouging out her emotions deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, why are you denying&#8230; Haruka now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t understand it at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl who had been talking about Haruka with such a compassionate face .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl, that was trying to protect Haruka even by lying to her at times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would she deny the existence of Haruka all of a sudden?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To that she said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shuddered from seeing the reaction Akiha had shown me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you! I definitely can&#8217;t tell you about it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly bursts into tears and hugs herself tightly with both her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it&#8217;s fear or impatience that&#8217;s distorting her face.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Is it really something that can&#8217;t be helped?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hugged my head on the bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that spills out of my mouth is a dribble of emotions slowly coming out from within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why does Haruka have to go through something like that&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew about it all along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka smiles at me in a caring way &#8212;- like she&#8217;s considering my feelings at a time like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Since the day I was born, I knew all along that I would disappear one day. I was born to protect Akiha and that role has been fulfilled now. So this can&#8217;t be helped anymore&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Saying that it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Ah! But I don&#8217;t want you to get the wrong idea. Akiha was really really considering me as someone important. Ever since the beginning, she has always been worried about me. She&#8217;s been persistent in talking to many doctors, reading books and even doing some research. When she found out that she had a double personality, she even threw away her previous name. For her to do her best, I am really grateful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wa-wait a minute. Name?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I had heard this story, and I couldn&#8217;t help but ask back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Threw it away&#8230;. what do you mean by that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, well, she said that since she and I are different people, it&#8217;s strange to call us by the same given name. So she suggested that we should call ourselves Akiha and Haruka.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Huh, then that&#8217;s&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t keep up with her reasoning so I immediately asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So the name Minase Akiha, wasn&#8217;t the real name in your family registry?&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-58d158917d3a41911746d5377ddb8821 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-58d158917d3a41911746d5377ddb8821"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Initially I opposed it. After all, she was the main personality in the end&#8230;. I was just born inside her body. So we should just use the same name as before. But she was very much against it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then&#8230; What&#8217;s your real name?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if the Haruka in front of me was someone different than I had ever seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been through circumstances that I couldn&#8217;t even imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl who knew she was going to disappear and still living life courageously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t even know her real name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I wanted to know her real name at least to grasp her existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I can&#8217;t tell you that&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka bit her lip in a truly apologetic manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s what she decided&#8230;. She decided not to use her former name while we were together. I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t really want to hide anything from you but&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My shoulders slumped at the feeling of being left alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I&#8217;m not a family member or anything to them, I’m just [one of the friends].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just in case, we have told the school everything. including my dual personality and our names. Well, the only people who know about it are the principal, vice principal, school nurse and the teacher in charge of all classes&#8230;and Chiyoda-ensei only. In particular, Chiyoda-sensei often follows me in places that I can&#8217;t even see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, I understood why Chiyoda-sensei was so quick to respond to her today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s because she knows all of that… was it possible to follow-up so precisely?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for dragging you into this dark story because of my circumstances&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t care about that. More than that! More than that&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;but, is Haruka not feeling sad too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to ask her that, but I hurriedly shut my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka&#8217;s expression was like she had accepted everything that was happening to her. The smile on her face was so compassionate. But &#8211; how could she not be sad at this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could this timid girl not suffer when she was being confronted with the fact that she was going to disappear anytime soon?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-It can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how many tears Haruka cried until she came to think that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have any qualification to say anything about Haruka&#8217;s determination, when I wasn&#8217;t beside her at that time and when I couldn&#8217;t disappear together with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Even if that’s the case!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reflexively stood up from the bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At the very least, let&#8217;s stop hiding about your double personality! Isn&#8217;t it all right if Haruka lives as Haruka in her remaining time! You don&#8217;t have to pretend to be Akiha anymore!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up at me with a strangely calm and peaceful expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that Sudo, Shuji and the others will accept you too! So why don&#8217;t you just tell them the truth now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8230; can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because, everyone would be troubled when they suddenly know the truth, right? If they remember me as a friend&#8230;. They might be sad when I won’t be there any longer, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that! Besides&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just couldn&#8217;t accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want Haruka to just disappear like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want her to disappear quietly without anyone knowing about her existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Besides, you told me about this, right? You told me that you have a dual personality disorder! So why don&#8217;t you reveal it to the others as well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well that&#8217;s right. I have already told Yano-kun about it. I&#8217;m sorry, that was a bit mean&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka smiled as she turned her gaze to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So&#8230; The truth is, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it. When I&#8217;m gone from here, it might be better if it&#8217;s only Yano-kun who will be sad or hurt.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was beating accompanied with a dull ache.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to start crying, but I tried my best to hold it back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I hope that even after I&#8217;m gone, Yano-kun will always remember me and miss me from time to time. I&#8217;ll be happy if he stays like that for the rest of his life&#8230; I think that&#8217;s enough to make me happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Haruka who seemed to be nothing but a good natured person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl who seemed to be living a carefree life with no sense of danger somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just devastated that she had such feelings inside of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why, it would be better if I could have kissed Yano-kun at that time&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Why?&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-e529c618c10d4e2deb740b8cb42d02b7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e529c618c10d4e2deb740b8cb42d02b7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If that had happened, I could have left a life-long scar on Yano-kun, right? I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m disqualified for being a friend who thinks of hurting you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing left for me to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t stop her, I can&#8217;t persuade her, all I can do is stand there like an idiot and watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, shall we end this with that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;With what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I couldn&#8217;t even raise my voice at her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t bother Yano-kun any more. I can&#8217;t bother you any more than I already have. You don&#8217;t know how to treat me after this, do you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t raise my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I&#8217;m alright. It&#8217;s regrettable but it can&#8217;t be helped, I am satisfied with all these memories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Yano-kun. Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But that&#8217;s why we have to say goodbye here. Thank you for being my friend until now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with a small wave of her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bye bye&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turns around and walks out of the park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her back disappears into the shadows of the buildings as she turns around the corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And still, I wasn’t able to say anything to her..</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, three day later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei said in the morning homeroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a gloomy expression on her face and her eyes downcast, she announced to everyone,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Minase-san will be transferring schools as of this week!”</span></p>
