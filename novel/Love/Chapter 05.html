<h3>Chapter 5 - After School, Take me Somewhere</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;&#8211;Sensei!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was after 7:00 p.m. when I was finally able to catch up with Chiyoda-sensei. She was in the staff parking lot in front of her car, a little after the complete school dismissal time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her in the staff room, she said she was heading out of the office for a meeting or something but it seems like it had finally ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, about Minase-san&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I ran up to her, she looked at me and narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear about any of it at all! I don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s going on, but why did she suddenly transfer schools&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was the usual me, I would never have done this, absolutely not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At best, I would have just acted idly and tried to gather some information casually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;.. I could no longer play the role of a good listener and plain student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to get some information about the reality that I was suddenly confronted with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a brief worried look flashed through her face, she said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230; perhaps Yano-kun may need an explanation. Which way’s your home?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s on the opposite side of the station, the Zenfuku temple side&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then, let&#8217;s talk about it as I drop you home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she opened the lock of car and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you coming?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">✳✳</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, I think it would be better if you ask the person herself directly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei began to talk as she drove the car towards my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Somehow, the situation doesn&#8217;t permit me for that&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Did you know about it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking at the familiar cityscape near the school when I unconsciously turned towards her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve been asked by her doctor to let him know about how she&#8217;s doing in school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m amazed that this doctor was so involved in the girl&#8217;s double personality even till now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I can guess why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, it’s no wonder that there was communication with the hospital side when they allowed her to go to school under a name other than her family register. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Initially, the purpose was rehabilitation.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-30918ef3fdd1bfc2dc221ef9493f34d1 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-30918ef3fdd1bfc2dc221ef9493f34d1"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei said as she turned the steering wheel and headed out onto the main street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You have heard it directly from her, haven&#8217;t you? The problem in her home has been settled. Then, if her personality gets combined together, the treatment will basically be complete. However, in the process, she should get used to society as much as possible. It is also preferable if she can be accepted by the world, alongside her dual personality&#8230; at the end, it&#8217;s preferable if her personality gets combined. With that in mind, it was decided to transfer her to a regular class in a normal school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn&#8217;t been informed of any such thing at all. I wasn&#8217;t aware that the girls had come to this school with such clear intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But then… she&#8230; Haruka tried to hide her personality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, despite the objections of others. All of them, Akiha-chan, her doctor and her family said and hoped that Haruka-chan could live her life as Haruka-chan but she pushed all that aside and did that instead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So that&#8217;s what happened&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And to their surprise, even among the students, there was someone who decided to cooperate with Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I began to feel a headache from my lack of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn&#8217;t I notice the discomfort of what Haruka was doing earlier&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think what Yano-kun did was wrong.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei comforted me with kind words as I was holding my head in my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think you did your best because you were thinking about Haruka-chan… I&#8217;m sure that won&#8217;t have a negative impact on you in the end.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just answering that brings back the bitter memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Self loathing toward myself who has made a terrible mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was just stirring things up with them&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then suddenly, I had a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, how did Sensei know that I was helping her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve never told anyone about it before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also felt that Chiyoda-sensei never showed anything in her behavior that made it seem like she knew. And yet, how did Chiyoda-sensei know about this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she replied with a somewhat lonely smile,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in close contact with her family and the hospital&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see. Then maybe that day, in the beginning, when I had taken Haruka to the clubroom&#8230; or the day when you opened the club room and came in&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I wanted to understand as much as I could about what Haruka was doing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;So that was it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My back felt a chill knowing that the adults, including Chiyoda-sensei, knew about it all along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;So, that&#8217;s the present situation of those girls.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While speaking, Chiyoda-sensei stepped on the brakes and stopped at a red light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Old people, young people with unknown occupations and housewives with children passed by ahead of us.</span></p><div class="zetro-52aa34c2a25906f4590a6b043869a868 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-52aa34c2a25906f4590a6b043869a868"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This was unexpected even for the doctors. They didn&#8217;t expect that the balance between the two existences would suddenly collapse. But now that it&#8217;s happened, they can&#8217;t just leave her there. They have decided to take her back to the hospital now and treat her so that Haruka-chan will not disappear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230; So, if the treatment goes well, there is a possibility that she will come back here as soon as it is over.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There&#8217;s not much of a chance for that, unfortunately. It would not be a very flat rehabilitation to go back to the environment that you have already left once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yano-kun doesn&#8217;t need to feel responsible for it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up, Chiyoda-sensei wrinkled her brow and gripped the steering wheel tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It really is an unforeseen situation. If someone was to be blamed here, then it&#8217;s us, the adults fault. They should have come to the school when they were more stable. Or we should have intervened more before this situation even happened. It&#8217;s completely a matter of poor judgment on behalf of the hospital and us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei bites her lip in frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The car started moving again, and Sensei swerved wide at the intersection of the main street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s just&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it clearly while looking forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I still can&#8217;t give up yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the problem she is currently burdened with can be resolved by just going to the hospital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Then, what are you going to do? Or rather, is there even a way to solve her problem?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there was, I wanted you to try it at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t care if I can&#8217;t relate to them anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t care if I can&#8217;t see them again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to save Haruka’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All that was missing was a little bit of courage and a little bit of self-kindness. I don&#8217;t have any concrete proof though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, the car stopped just before the red light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei reached out and began to rummage through her handbag, which laid beside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If there&#8217;s anyone who can do something for those kids&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei then held out ‘something’ to me..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long, slitted eyes smeared with a dark hue of intent as she said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think the only person who can do that is&#8212;&#8212;Yano-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">✳✳</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to go straight home, and that was my downfall.</span></p><div class="zetro-061c3a6aac9d2acaeacc218270e71b70 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-061c3a6aac9d2acaeacc218270e71b70"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to a nearby bookstore and browsed aimlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking about what I could and couldn&#8217;t do, and as I was leaving the store, I saw a classmate from middle school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A self-proclaimed sadistic character, Koshino and his friends, Shikishima and Hoshimoto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These were the students who naturally kept me away from them back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without thinking, I went back inside the store and hid behind a bookshelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were oblivious to my presence, and while chatting and laughing, they passed in front of the bookstore and headed towards the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sigh of relief and disappointment in myself spilled out my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to create a character, I want to be a normal human being too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I said so with my mouth, in the end, I couldn&#8217;t change myself after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The loneliness and the anguish of being ostracized is still engraved in my body even now and I couldn&#8217;t take a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I am right now, can I really do something for Akiha and Haruka?</span></p>
<p><b>一一一Part 5.2一一一</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I do to help them at this stage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Damn it&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exited the store and confirmed the ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Something’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in my bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was something that was given to me by Chiyoda-sensei in the car, saying &#8220;it was left in the club room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">a notebook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I hadn&#8217;t seen for quite some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After pondering for a while, I started up the line and started to compose a message to the account &#8220;Minase&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This might be the last message I ever send to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if she will respond but I know I have to send it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha or Haruka, any of them is fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as long as it reaches her in the end.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align: center;""><span style="font-weight: 400">✳✳</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clubroom after school was dyed in a cream-like shade due to the sunlight passing through the curtains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air was dusty and musty, and there were a few unfamiliar items placed here and there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha was standing at the entrance of the club room which at best looked like a hiding place, and at worst like a storage room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Hello&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a stiff expression as she stood there while holding her bag tightly on her shoulder and looking down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this will be Akiha&#8217;s last visit to this room. It&#8217;s also quite possible that this might be the end of my love too.</span></p><div class="zetro-01e0e9135ef5b641d69866660d475b49 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-01e0e9135ef5b641d69866660d475b49"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Come in&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Akiha stepped into the club room and closed the door behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to call you here on such short notice&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I first apologized to Akiha who sat down on a nearby seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know you probably don&#8217;t even want to talk to me anymore&#8230; but I&#8217;m glad you came. I just wanted you to have this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slipped my hand into my shoe and pulled out a notebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N : nope, no mistake here. I don&#8217;t know how can one take out notebook from their shoes)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the cover of the notebook, which was placed on the old desk in front of Akiha, the words with a somewhat misleading impression were written.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Exchange diary ♥️ | Yano-kun•Akiha•Haruka]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, this is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha looked at the cover as she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’ve been wondering where this was&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the day they had gone to Odaiba, we had stopped exchanging this with each other, so she had no idea where the book had gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Haruka must have left it in the club room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chiyoda-sensei handed it to me saying, &#8220;Return it back to the girls.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha was looking at the words on the cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was just a little, I feel like the air inside the room has softened by a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The round letters of spring may have calmed her wispy feelings a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking she will soon return to her usual attitude, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha turned the page and started to read the diary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This girl really relied on Yano-kun, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And spilled out such lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Always&#8230; it was always about Yano-kun&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s eye narrowed, like a parent caring for their child lovingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I peeked at the diary, it was just as she said. On every page that was opened, Haruka was bemoaning her s***w-up and asking me for help.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">17th April (Tuesday)| Haruka.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I forgot that my English class had changed from the audio-visual room to the classroom today.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I was flustered when I was the only one who moved.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you Yano-kun for noticing and telling me about it!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I&#8217;m sorry for stepping on your foot with all my might</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p><div class="zetro-d8cf34c27c1e35684160866abd0d0b62 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d8cf34c27c1e35684160866abd0d0b62"></div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">19th April (Thursday)| Haruka</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ugh, I&#8217;m sorry, Akiha.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I spilled Cocoa on my uniform&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I don&#8217;t think the stain will be left on it as Yano-kun immediately wiped it but it might still smell a bit&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it might be better to take it to a cleaner&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">20th April (Friday)| Haruka</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yano-kun, perhaps you bought those wet wipes for me?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sorry, I will also pay for it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really thankful for Yano-kun to teach me today too.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Thank you, Yano-kun.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-Yano-kun!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;Yano-kun.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the words on pages was blurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s hand that was holding the notebook was shivering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Akiha&#8230;.?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Akiha and saw she was biting her teeth strongly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at the page, unblinking, as if she was trying to hold something back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, it looked as if something was about to break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s expression looks like everything will fall apart if I just poke at her a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Akiha took a deep breath and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s enough&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that in a whisper and raised her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s the end… I will stop hiding things and lying about everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.Aki&#8230;.ha&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she turned to look at me, I gasped at the expression on her face, it was as if she had lost the thing that was possessing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she said with a smile,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know… I&#8217;m the worst&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I always said thank you to Yano-kun, didn&#8217;t I? Saying things like ‘Thank you for being friends with Haruka’ or ‘Thank you for helping her out’.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-4ee9d8a5e3b8a5a895f6c57ec59def44 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4ee9d8a5e3b8a5a895f6c57ec59def44"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That was all a lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart skipped a beat at the simple words she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t happy. I wasn&#8217;t happy at all. Not only that. Everything about Yano-kun exchanging diaries with Haruka, going out to Odaiba with Haruka, everything, everything was so painful. My heart felt like it was going to collapse and I was always on the verge of crying.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart skipped a beat at every word she said as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was unable to grasp the meaning of her words and soon my head started to get hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she said to me with the preface &#8220;Because&#8221;, narrowing her eyes as if she was telling me an old story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth is&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I wanted you to help me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so shocked that I couldn&#8217;t move my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I always wanted you to save me and not Haruka.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt so thirsty and choked at her words that I couldn’t move an inch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When Haruka made a blunder on the first day, when she made a lot of mistakes in class, when you came to my house, when we went out together with everyone, it was always the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to talk to you a lot about her, and I wanted you to listen to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time, Akiha&#8217;s true feelings were revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The true feelings of Akiha that I couldn&#8217;t even notice which gradually overwrote our significant memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did you know, the first day I met Yano-kun, I thought I might have finally found a friend?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe, we might be similar in some way. We&#8217;re both hiding our true feelings, and we can&#8217;t really say what we&#8217;re thinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was happy, and I thought that maybe we could get along together. We might even become friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, I was thinking maybe we could have a much better relationship than others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;So that was it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I met with Akiha was before the first day of school. (T/N: First day of school here is referred to the day before any actual classes start. As such, there’s an opening ceremony day and on this day, there are no classes held except for self introduction and some schedule handouts. So the actual first day is when the classes start which is the next day.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time when I fell in love with her&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did Akiha also think of me that way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I have always been jealous. Jealous of Haruka who can consult with Yano-kun  so easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka who can think together with you about a lot of different things, being able to perceive, or rebuke her at her blunders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like her, I also wanted to be praised when I did well or get comforted when I made a blunder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to make mistakes with Yano-kun, to get lost, to be troubled, and all those things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..T-Then!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I noticed, I found myself wondering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s what Akiha was thinking&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Akiha was holding all of these things alone&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><div class="zetro-c147c5b0b39c7eaa12220ec6f14e97c0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c147c5b0b39c7eaa12220ec6f14e97c0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you talk with me! I told you, right!? That you can talk to me anytime!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is she vehemently denying her right to rely on others? Why does she keep trying to keep everything to herself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Am I really so untrustworthy to you!? Did I look so unreliable to you that you couldn&#8217;t rely on me!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, why!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my question, Akiha looked up and stared at me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There&#8217;s no way I could say that to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-The sharpness of her voice, the anger in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t able to say anything to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way I could have said that! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because&#8230; it&#8217;s all my fault that Haruka is suffering! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s because I was weak and unable to protect myself that that girl was born! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had been stronger, she wouldn&#8217;t have gone through this! If I had been strong, she wouldn&#8217;t have needed to disappear!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain that ran in my chest wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;shock.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the inexplicable guilt that she was carrying around in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Akiha couldn&#8217;t forgive was not anyone else&#8230; but herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However&#8230; isn&#8217;t it too selfish that you are the only one who&#8217;s having fun! You should be able to handle all your problems on your own!  Besides, I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not the kind of person who needs Yano-kun help!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;W-why?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, she choked on the question.</span></p>
<p><b>一一一Part 3一一一</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I looked at her cloudy eyes,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yano-kun became friends with Haruka. Then I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If&#8230; what if… she wasn&#8217;t here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Haruka wasn&#8217;t here… it might have been me who was there instead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was slightly shivering, just like a frail glass that would get destroyed with just little effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If she wasn&#8217;t inside me&#8230; perhaps, I could have been the one who would have been next to Yano-kun.</span></p><div class="zetro-08588741535b122dfe9e358b9c32732f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-08588741535b122dfe9e358b9c32732f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I could have been the one to invite Yano-kun to my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I could have been the one to ride the Ferris Wheel together with Yano-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart kept thumping harder, sending hot blood that was surging through my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My breathing quickened and my palm began to sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Akiha asked,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Am I not the worst?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She narrowed her eyes coldly and laughed scornfully at herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are disillusioned right? I am unforgivable, am I not? I am the one who&#8217;s going to erase Yano-kun&#8217;s beloved Haruka.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she said once again in an shivering-esque voice,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haruka&#8217;s going to disappear because of my selfishness. It&#8217;s all because of me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence fell in the dusty air of the club room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that could be heard were the shouts of the members of the sports club practicing in the schoolyard in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m qualified to ask Yano-kun for help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;Finally, I feel like all the links were connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha who had been tense until now. Her relationship with Haruka and her intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing I have overlooked until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the things that were really important that I hadn&#8217;t realized&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I&#8212;&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Even so&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth again and looked straight at Akiha,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It still doesn&#8217;t matter to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s eyes widened at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even so&#8230; I want to help Akiha&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha tilted her head, not understanding what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haruka is a special person for Yano-kun, isn&#8217;t she? There&#8217;s no way you can forgive me&#8230; right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Indeed, Haruka is a special person to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s expression twisted in pain when I admitted this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But&#8212;&#8212;Akiha is also important to me. You’re an irreplaceable existence to me&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;D-Did you really think of me in that way?&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-34ff00dde154ab88f4ec38eaaa812190 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-34ff00dde154ab88f4ec38eaaa812190"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like slight anger can be seen on the face of Akiha who asked me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can you repeat that in front of Haruka?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because I&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, of course I can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t realize it for a long time, but it was me who was making you cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have been hurting you because I have been hiding my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, there&#8217;s only one thing to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s because I like you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha looked at me with a flabbergasted face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I said it once again,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I like Akiha.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I conveyed it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I still want to help you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hot sweat poured out of my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was beating so strongly that I could feel it thumping all over my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I don&#8217;t have any regrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, Akiha is suffering in front of my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to regret anything, and that&#8217;s why I laid out my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-that&#8230; by like you mean&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I like you as the opposite s*x. From the very beginning. Ever since I met you&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s flabbergasted face was dyed bright red in the twinkling of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes fidgeted restlessly and the tears pooled up in her eyes began to sway about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened her trembling lips awkwardly and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I-It&#8217;s a lie, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked me with a trembling voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe that Yano-kun likes me like this&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Indeed, the Akiha right now may be quite different from the impression you gave me in the beginning.”</span></p><div class="zetro-4233f8e68cb206372d7d7dc5af98b3c6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4233f8e68cb206372d7d7dc5af98b3c6"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what, I couldn&#8217;t deny that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I had misjudged the girl, Minase Akiha, for a really long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But when I saw her reciting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Still Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I thought, I wanted her to be there for me. I wanted her to feel the same way as me. That feeling&#8212;&#8212;-hasn&#8217;t changed even now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand on my chest and checked my feelings again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart is beating in my whole body just like that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am in love with Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-but&#8230; then what about Haruka&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you talking about Haruka now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because Yano-kun is&#8230; you guys are&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stammering for words, Akiha distorted her face as if she were spitting out solid food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Aren&#8217;t you guys dating?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short pause, the whiteout of confusion faded from my mind, and I finally understood </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was Akiha misunderstanding everything? Was she under the impression that I and Haruka were boyfriend and girlfriend?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she drive herself to the corner under the impression that we were a couple?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Ah, we aren&#8217;t dating&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a deep sigh, I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Really? I thought you were&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true. I don&#8217;t think she sees me in that way either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-Is that so&#8230;? But you both were getting along and Haruka was even relying on Yano-kun so much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.That&#8217;s right. So yes&#8230; we are best friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Best friends?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. We are fellow comrades who share the same desire to become one single person&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I talked to Haruka in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I became best friends with Haruka that day itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sense of camaraderie I had at that time may have been wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the friendship I still have in my heart will just suddenly disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So I felt like we were friends of the same s*x&#8230; I mean, to be honest, I consulted her about Akiha too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Was that so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if she were finally convinced, Akiha dropped her gaze to the floor.</span></p><div class="zetro-656dbca667a4aacb0973d9f55d9e86db zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-656dbca667a4aacb0973d9f55d9e86db"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yano-kun, Haruka is a close friend for you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after mumbling something to herself, she said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8212;&#8212;-But, then&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, she suddenly raised her face vigorously,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was about to erase that girl, Haruka&#8230; by mistake?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her dainty hands began to shiver. Her originally white face turned pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-because of my selfishness and jealousy, that girl had to go through so much pain&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. The problem hasn&#8217;t been resolved yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, maybe Akiha will no longer feel the need to deny Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, Haruka might not be disappearing anytime soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Haruka must have realised this. That Akiha is denying her existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, more than ever, she feels that she is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">unnecessary</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8230; should I do? I have done something horrible to her&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s expression looked as if she was seeing the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I prepared my resolution in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Hey, Akiha&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called her name, I said only a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said these same words to Haruka just a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Won&#8217;t you&#8230; let me help you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large tear spilled from Akiha&#8217;s eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. I should have told you earlier. But I want to help you from here on. I want to be your support.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, with this preface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked straight into Akiha&#8217;s eyes, which were like swirling galaxies among the night stars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Rely on me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;can I?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked with a frightened look on her face, her lips trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it all right for me to&#8230; rely on Yano-kun? Is it okay? Can I, who&#8217;s so selfish and wilful, rely on you after all that&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s, of course.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded sincerely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s because I like you.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-083e071f1bf7ef783d3ad6b1d8f54a59 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-083e071f1bf7ef783d3ad6b1d8f54a59"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Thank you&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, please.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She quietly opens her eyes and looks back at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please help me, Yano-kun. Please help me convince Haruka that it&#8217;s ok for her to live her life normally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.I understand&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like Akiha&#8217;s word filled my whole body with much needed strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She needs me. The girl I love needs my help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I wanted to give her everything I could&#8212;&#8212;-and help her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to make Akiha happy, even if it meant hurting her, even if it meant losing something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the clock in the clubroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time limit is approaching really quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I want to persuade her, today is the only day I can do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what can I do in this limited time? What words could I say to Haruka to make her stay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I who hasn&#8217;t even changed one bit since junior high school,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally realised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I didn&#8217;t have the qualifications to tell Haruka</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">to</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> ‘live as she wanted’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is not a single thing I can say to her now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I know exactly what I have to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How much longer until you return to Haruka?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;About ten minutes, I think&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to Akiha, who looked up at me, and got up from my chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>一一一Part 5.4一一一</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;There they are!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;It wasn&#8217;t until a few minutes later that I found Sudo, Shuji, and a couple other friends hanging out together..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were near the main gate, just after leaving the shoe box in the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was completely out of breath from all the searching in the corridor, classroom and the entrance.</span></p><div class="zetro-35fbc14455a85bbddafad3279d479f1a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-35fbc14455a85bbddafad3279d479f1a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around to look, Akiha&#8217;s hair was also in disorder due to the air and her shoulders were heaving up and down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right! Let&#8217;s chase after them!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance between us and Sudo and the others was about ten meters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to run towards them to stop them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Akiha suddenly stopped in her tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her, she was looking at me with a confused face amidst the wind of may.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha has been replaced by Haruka at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, we couldn&#8217;t stop here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Hey Haruka&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was looking at me with a face as if she didn&#8217;t know what to think of currently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right for Haruka to live as Haruka from now on. We will do our best so that we don&#8217;t have to lie to anyone anymore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka frowned but I continued my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am sure it&#8217;s much smaller than the step Haruka has to take. It&#8217;s definitely a trivial thing for Haruka. Still, if you like, I hope you can watch it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, I left Haruka standing there and headed towards the direction of Sudo and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Oh? Isn&#8217;t it Yano?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did you notice the footsteps?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shuji turned around to look, his eyes opened wide in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Why are you breathing hard&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Or rather, even Minase-san is here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, maybe you’re making your final memories together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two members of the group were in particularly high spirits. Tomigaya and Sakurai asked me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of them, my heart began to accelerate like a progressive rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My breathing becomes shallow and my back begins to sweat unpleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I would have said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right, we got a little carried away… Marika!!&#8221;] [TLN: Marika is like a high spirited greeting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And made a joke like that in return.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I swallowed it down and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;No, there was something I wanted to talk about with you guys.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shuji looks at me anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To them who were somewhat flabbergasted,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I am thinking of quitting it&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first thing I said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Huh, quit what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Forcing myself to fit in with everyone, creating a character, all of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, what? What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been acting all along. I was pretending to be something I&#8217;m not to suit everyone&#8230; I&#8217;ve been playing a cheerful, good-natured character.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At those words,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere of the place, which was cheerful until now, clearly changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What had been a peaceful after-school moment turned into a tense confession session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The faces of the five members in the room lost their composure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, when I tried to open my mouth once again to continue the story, I found myself unable to speak any further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;What&#8217;s wrong with me? Is it because I&#8217;m out of breath?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or that I haven&#8217;t thought of another word to say&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;No, it&#8217;s wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m&#8212;&#8212;-scared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day in junior high school when I denied that S character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere is the same as the classroom at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I considered smiling and covering it up right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to pretend that all of this had never happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t back out anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8230; so… I&#8217;m sorry! I lied to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forced myself to open my mouth and was surprised at how loud my voice was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still expressed myself in front of my friends just like that.</span></p><div class="zetro-cf5f450c765cfc545319cd1175c40036 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cf5f450c765cfc545319cd1175c40036"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t like going out after school making a clamour, I continued telling dirty jokes forcefully, in the first place, I&#8217;m not a person who&#8217;s too cheerful&#8230; More than that&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hands into the bag that was on my shoulders.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I like this kind of thing! Literature and Arts!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put up the paperback book I was reading the day I first met Akiha, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Still Life.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In other words&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I took a big breath and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was making a character! To get along with everyone, to enter into the group, I was forcing myself to do all that. But honestly, I hate all of that&#8212;-that&#8217;s why, I&#8217;m going to stop making characters from now on! I’m sorry to everyone but I&#8217;m going to be myself!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, looking at the faces of everyone in the room again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So&#8212;&#8211;I hope you can accept me as I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence swoops down in place after I finish saying everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the gloomy silence, no one was able to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dusty breeze danced past us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomigaya was the first to speak up, crawling out of the silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, aren&#8217;t things like that all right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Beats me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai followed Tomigaya, saying this in a light tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then both of them said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going home first. I have a part-time job.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I also need to go. See you later!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, they quickly left the main gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh… see you later&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel my mouth rapidly drying up as I replied to their backs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Well, aren&#8217;t things like that all right?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the surface, it sounded like they were accepting me. But in reality, there were no emotions in the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-I am sure I wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue my relationship until now with them anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them taught me how to react at a good pace and how to position myself in a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered it because of our friendship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t be like that anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my fingertips grow cold as I realized this fact clearly.</span></p><div class="zetro-f9ff31946b396c65ad0e24c715c71f3d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f9ff31946b396c65ad0e24c715c71f3d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each beat of my heart grew heavier with anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, no one would accept me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I don&#8217;t make a character, as long as I don&#8217;t pretend to be something, I will not be needed anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tell me~~~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unexpected cheerful voice suddenly rings out from next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my gaze to that, Sudo was looking at me as if she was deflated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehm, seriously!? So Yano-kun was always making a character? I didn&#8217;t notice it at all! You should have told me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyebrows were raised as if she was in trouble. She closed her eyes sulkily and pouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At her behavior and action which was just like as usual,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, N-No&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t find the words to reply right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Somehow&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she crossed her arms violently and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But then, I&#8217;ve been making a lot of crazy requests to Yano!  Now I sound like a horrible person&#8230; You should have said so earlier!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.I was indeed feeling something like that&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Shuji laughs bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought Maybe Yano was exaggerating a little. But even I hadn’t thought that far ahead&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Compared to other members, I feel like Shuji never asked me to act like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">cheerful character</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought he might be that kind of guy, but really, did he actually have a hunch about it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But still so, you&#8217;re overreacting too much&#8230; Also that novel, it&#8217;s quite a literary novel, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s too different from your usual character&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m really sorry&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay though&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reaction was the same as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo and Shuji are the same as always.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short pause, I understood what it meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I knew it all along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that these two people would accept me like this.</span></p><div class="zetro-c01ae4f18f5b7ad246f8483f3900ec2a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c01ae4f18f5b7ad246f8483f3900ec2a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I don&#8217;t pretend, they would be friends with me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Thank you&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These words spilled out naturally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m really glad that I am friends with you&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you saying all of a sudden? It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Indeed, it&#8217;s really embarrassing when you said it again&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While being thankful for the two who were squirming in embarrassment, I turned to look at Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has been watching my affair from there since a while ago, with the expression of Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently she still can&#8217;t seem to take the step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I was holding a notebook in my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the page of our exchange diary and held it up to Haruka. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That page was filled with scribbles in Akiha&#8217;s writing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;You are indispensable to me.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she laughed somewhat dazed at the page, I could see a slight amount of determination filled within her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down and with a slow gait, she took a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, what&#8217;s wrong Akiha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did something happen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she stand up in front of them who had a dubious express and raised her face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Minase&#8230;San?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyebrows knitted in anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her timid eyes that look as if they were going to cry anytime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands were tightly holding the bag and her feet were trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time Haruka had shown Sudo and Shuji her own face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo and Shuji were surprised to see an expression that looked nothing like Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And to them, Haruka opened her mouth hesitantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said her name for the first time&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-Nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Minase&#8230;..Haruka.&#8221;</span></p>
