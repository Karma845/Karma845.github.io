<h3>Epilogue : The 1/2 Kiss</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First of all, I will try to talk with my parents and doctor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha said as she walked next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t promise anything, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll cancel the hospitalization. If both, I and Haruka explain it to them properly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I&#8217;m still not out of my mind, I&#8217;m a little relieved at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exhaled deeply and looked up at the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad then&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The eastern sky, which has begun to turn into an indigo one, and the pale yellow sunset that remained in the west.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Precisely at this timing, an airplane flew over the clouds, pulling them apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main street was crowded with students going home and women shopping, but once I turned off the main street, I found myself in a quiet residential area that looked like a provincial city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I was also relieved when Sudo-san and Shuji-kun accepted me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha spilled out these words with her cheeks slackening a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I told Haruka that she didn&#8217;t have to hide it, but I was still worried about her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had already been more than three hours since Haruka had revealed herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, both Sudo and Shuji seemed to be very flustered, but they eagerly listened to Haruka&#8217;s story, and then Akiha&#8217;s, who had replaced Haruka later on… and finally, they understood her past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-then, you&#8217;re saying you use notes to convey what has happened to you every time? So that the other classmates wouldn&#8217;t notice&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I still haven&#8217;t completely grasped the situation but, after a while, you&#8217;ll go from being Haruka-san to Akiha-san again, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then in the end. Shuji said with a regretful face that looked like he was about to cry, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for not noticing that&#8221; while Sudo on the other hand was already crying, tears spilling out from her eyes as she said, &#8220;From now on, don&#8217;t hide it anymore&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, I will convey it to Haruka too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s eyes also seemed to glisten with tears as she replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the situation has calmed down for the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haruka will not have to hide herself anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha will also not have to hold all the pain within herself like she had been doing until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, I also don&#8217;t need to force myself to pretend to be someone else anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the time we were leaving,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Speaking of which, after hearing Haruka’s story, Yano-kun&#8217;s confession earlier was a bit too lackluster in comparison.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudo retorted to me for which I couldn&#8217;t reply back at the too sound argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nevertheless, there&#8217;s nothing more happier for me if my courage was able to push Haruka ahead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And then… I have to apologise to Haruka too. That girl had to go through such painful things all because of my misunderstanding.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-490c8a3937d0219e9d6d43ebb7a6dcfc zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-490c8a3937d0219e9d6d43ebb7a6dcfc"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ll apologize to her too. It&#8217;s half my fault. And as long as Haruka doesn&#8217;t mind&#8230; I&#8217;d like to start helping her be happy again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding, Akiha looked down at her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The future that awaits her will never change, right? So, at least until then, I want her to spend her life happily at least.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re right. But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;But?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha turned to look at me whilst tilting her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes, which seemed like they were light years ahead, stared at me. While feeling the rising of my heartbeat through the palm of my hand, I looked into her eyes,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;From now on, I also want to help Akiha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her white face quickly turned into a red one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Not only Haruka but Akiha too, I really want the both of you to be happy&#8230; So I hope you can tell me anything you want to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I see&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha hurriedly diverted her eyes and looked down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yano-kun is also sly. You can say that to two girls at the same time&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Maybe so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Be careful, to not get resented one day&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I will keep that in mind&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;And, um&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Akiha&#8217;s words started to falter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then said as she looked down at her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;About the confession&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yes&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden change of topic sent a sense of tension down my spine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I know it&#8217;s a little late, but I had confessed my feelings to Akiha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was wondering what kind of reply I should give&#8230; that, should I go out or should I not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, well, you&#8217;re right. As for me, I&#8217;m serious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I see&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akiha&#8217;s face turned red and she looked down.</span></p><div class="zetro-a39a7cc8485610778853d5c4c19ae751 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a39a7cc8485610778853d5c4c19ae751"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m prepared, so tell me&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stammered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, in a squeezing voice, she said to me who was mentally preparing myself,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I will consider it positively&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I haven&#8217;t sorted out my feelings yet. But really, I will consider it positively&#8230; It would be great if you could wait for a while.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I see&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I was disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I have been let down&#8230; but, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the only thing that happened between us a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a little too fast to ask for the answer here and now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;okay, I understand&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have a little more time left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I think we should think it over slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s enough for now that she said she would consider it positively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly looked at her wristwatch to check the time,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I guess it&#8217;s about time we have to change&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The next we meet&#8230; will be at school tomorrow. Somehow I feel a little embarrassed&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haha, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, really. Thank you so much for today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Akiha turned around and stopped, then bowed her head deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please take care of me and Haruka from now on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, same here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;See you tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Akiha turned around and turned her back to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds later, she turns around and looks straight at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Hey, Yano-kun&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-fc3f313f88bdfef8100e32570fd08f5d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-fc3f313f88bdfef8100e32570fd08f5d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can you tell </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">who</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I am right now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Huh&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my voice in an absurd manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Which one&#8230; aren&#8217;t you Haruka?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The personality should have already switched from Akiha to Haruka just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had just hidden her face earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just&#8230; certainly I don&#8217;t know the &#8220;precise time&#8221; of when they actually switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I know roughly how many minutes it is, I haven&#8217;t been able to grasp the concrete timing or how many seconds it actually takes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then &#8211; I looked at her again and was surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of voice and the expression on her face were deliberately kept in the middle of both their expressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s currently Akiha or Haruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.fufufu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. It seems like I have done well. You shouldn&#8217;t underestimate my acting skills.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that, she took a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know, Yano-kun? We&#8217;ve been through a lot of hard times because of our dual personalities. That&#8217;s why I think we can be forgiven for a little bit of foul play.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Foul play?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, She tip-toed a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as if she was talking in private, she naturally brought her face closer to mine&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;She kissed me on my lips.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a short, soft touch on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet smell of her hair tickled my nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The circuits in my head started thinking at a very high speed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">W-W-Why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that all of a sudden? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which one is it!? Akiha? Haruka?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which personality was the one who kissed me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My brain starts to overheat without knowing what&#8217;s happening anymore. Questions poured out my mind one after another, and I couldn&#8217;t control them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sweat broke out all over my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My arms and legs trembled in disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me, unable to move, and said happily as her face turned bright red.</span></p><div class="zetro-dc278f8ea4f5bd29345958bd8eb1f0c3 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-dc278f8ea4f5bd29345958bd8eb1f0c3"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I like you, Yano-kun&#8221;</span></p>
