<p>Situation : waiting for the opening ceremony&nbsp;</p>



<p>Character pattern 1 : loose lipped classmate</p>



<p>[Oh, we are again in the same class as yano this year too!?]</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s it, Sudou? Aren&#8217;t you glad to be with a handsome guy again?]</p>



<p>[Yes yes, Don&#8217;t say that, aren&#8217;t you also happy to be with me?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Ah.Actually, even now just being with Sudou&#8230;&#8230;.make my chest painful]</p>



<p>[Haa~ after all, being too cute is a crime.I have made another young man unhappy again.]</p>



<p>[Oh, that&#8217;s why you should give me juice as compensation, right?]</p>



<p>[No way, you can only heal your emotional scars yourself.]</p>



<p>Situation : Hallway to the classroom.</p>



<p>Character pattern 2 : A well behaved student</p>



<p>[Wow~ that look heavy Sensei]</p>



<p>[Yes, it is.There is a lot to distribute at the beginning of the school year after all&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Then I will carry that one.]</p>



<p>[Are you sure? It&#8217;s quite heavy, you know?]</p>



<p>[Yeah. I&#8217;ll take it. &#8230;&#8230; Oh, it&#8217;s really heavy. By the way, is it ok to hand these out as soon as I get to class?]</p>



<p>[Yes, it&#8217;s alright.You really helped me there.Thank you]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s ok.In exchange, please be lenient on this year too]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not good, I will make it fair.]</p>



<p>[Eh-, that&#8217;s harsh]</p>



<p>Situation : In a classroom full of classmates</p>



<p>Character situation 3 : An easy to talk guy who is in the same class for the first time</p>



<p>[&#8230;..Yano, isn&#8217;t it? You resemble that entertainer, Kashiwada from the Munchkins.]</p>



<p>[What? No, no, no! I don&#8217;t look like him!]</p>



<p>[Amazing naturalistic side and face. Wow, you look exactly alike!]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not naturalistic, we don&#8217;t look alike at all!!</p>



<p>[But you really look so. I will call you Kashiwada from now on.]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s why stop it! Are you really going to keep it?]</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">✳️</p>



<p>By the time homeroom was over, I had finished playing all the characters I had on my hand.</p>



<p>[ So that&#8217;s it for today.]</p>



<p>Chiyoda-sensei, who had been my homeroom teacher since the first year, ended the first day of the first semester of the second year.</p>



<p>[Tomorrow we will start our regular classes, so please be careful not to forget anything.Then, goodbye.]</p>



<p>Goodbye, classmates greeted in a chorus.</p>



<p>I let out a thin breath like an octopus thread, blending in with the rattling of chairs and desks.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;I&#8217;m really getting sick of it.</p>



<p>Reading the air, infer what you&#8217;re expected to do, and create a character to match.</p>



<p>Why am I even pretending to do something I am not like this?</p>



<p>When I started thinking about it, my thoughts quickly stuck as if it&#8217;s hole.</p>



<p>In the first place&#8230;&#8230;.[character], what the hell is this?</p>



<p>Even though I am a living person, why do I play it in my everyday&#8217;s life?</p>



<p>I Looked through the window which already had my fingerprints stuck, and gazes at the cherry trees around the main gate that were in full bloom.</p>



<p>The classroom is filled with a floating buzz, and there is an unidentified cheer coming from the class next door.</p>



<p>Somehow all of this seems to be made up.</p>



<p>The cherry blossoms bloom on the first day of school.</p>



<p>High School students that are in high spirits after school.</p>



<p>Perhaps also at least one group who shout in a loud voice.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t that how everyone creates Their character?</p>



<p>[Eh, you are worrying too much, aren&#8217;t you?]</p>



<p>Someone&#8217;s words reached my ears through the buzz.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, I might be thinking too much.</p>



<p>To some extent, we can&#8217;t help but exaggerate or suppress ourselves in order to facilitate communication and make conversation more enjoyable.</p>



<p>However, if it goes too far, it becomes a lie to yourself and It becomes a deception to the other person.</p>



<p>And I know very well that this deception can also sometimes hurt someone.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then I want to be unshakeable in every situation.</p>



<p>I wanted to be the one who never pretended to be someone else, [only himself].</p>



<p>[Hey, Minase-san, do you want to go out for tea with us afterwards?]</p>



<p>At the sound of this voice, I was in front of three years myself.</p>



<p>I looked at the seat of attendance number 37, Minase-san.</p>



<p>[Recently a store opened here, their waffles are very delicious with blueberry sauce on them.]</p>



<p>[Since we&#8217;re here, how about a little welcoming party?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry.]</p>



<p>Minase-san shook her head without smiling affectionately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not in the mood for that right now, and I still have some paperwork to complete for my transfer to a new school.]</p>



<p>Minase-san replied to her classmate&#8217;s invitation without hesitation.</p>



<p>She has been like that whole day.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t force herself to smile or raise her voice.</p>



<p>She only exposes her emotions a bit only when it&#8217;s really necessary.</p>



<p>&nbsp;[Loner], definitely not something created.</p>



<p>She was the only thing that supported my heart in a classroom full of fake people.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Oh, it&#8217;s regrettable.]</p>



<p>[Then, see you again next time.]</p>



<p>The girls who were at loss of words due to cold reply quickly fixes Their expression and left the classroom with smiles on Their faces.</p>



<p>Perhaps She might be treated as [a difficult child] between those two.</p>



<p>She is just a clumsy girl perhaps, I thought.</p>



<p>It might not be that she always coldly deals like that, maybe she hasn&#8217;t yet adapted to the class atmosphere.</p>



<p>But I thought it was okay.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I want to gaze at those deep jet black eyes forever, I thought.</p>



<p>I want to touch her graceful silky black hair, her peach-like cheeks.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about those things, Minase-san stood from her chair and exited the classroom.Her bag was left on the desk.As she said, she might still be going through the procedures for transferring schools.</p>



<p>Then, I should go home too.It seems that both Sudo and Shouji are going home today without stopping anywhere&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>As I stood up from my seat, thinking,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right]</p>



<p>It suddenly occurred to me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the first day of the new school year.</p>



<p>[Let&#8217;s go to the club room.]</p>



<p>✳️</p>



<p>After spending some time in the clubroom.</p>



<p>As I started to head for the gate to go home, I realized that I had forgotten something.</p>



<p>It was the time table printout that had just been handed in today.</p>



<p>Maybe if I called Sudo, he would send me a copy of it, but it would be boring to owe him for something like that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a pain but I guess I will recover from the classroom and then go home.</p>



<p>I walked down half a flight of stairs and came to a corridor.</p>



<p>Somewhere, long tones of trombones and tubas were practicing.</p>



<p>The not so sincere percussionist was playing a tune from &#8220;Three Minute Cooking&#8221; on his glockenspiel. A Kewpie doll dances in my head.</p>



<p>There I suddenly realised it&#8217;s already been a while since 12&#8217;o o&#8217;clock.I am getting hungry.</p>



<p>As I entered the north school building, I thought about what I would have for lunch today.</p>



<p>I was sure there would be some shimmered righteye flounder left over from last night, so that would be the main course.Speaking of that, my mother had made the potato salad in the morning.It Should be in the fridge too.</p>



<p>Later all I needed to do was have instant miso soup, some frozen rice to cook, and pickled plums that my grandma had sent me, and It will be perfect.</p>



<p>Actually, I&#8217;d really like to eat pasta or something, but since my working parents prepared it for me, so I should be grateful.</p>



<p>While I was thinking about the Yano family&#8217;s household situation, I arrived at the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I put my hand on the peeling paint door,</p>



<p>[But it&#8217;s crazy, right?]</p>



<p>I noticed the slight voice from inside.</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;..I think a little&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Thin wavering voice, probably one girl.</p>



<p>Possibly seems to be talking to herself.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t really understand whose voice it was, separated by the sliding door.</p>



<p>But&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s one of the quiet ones, Kashiwagi-san, Kiryu-san, or Nitta-san.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t? If it&#8217;s so then&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s right.]</p>



<p>Seems like she has considerably let down her guard.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure If I enter the class bluntly, the owner of the voice will definitely be surprised.</p>



<p>It might be better to look at the timing and then enter naturally.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I took my hand off the door and peered in through the peephole,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. un?]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes when I saw an unexpected scene behind the glass.</p>



<p>Just as expected,there was only one girl in the class.</p>



<p>A girl sitting in the hallway, her back to me, putting her stuff in her bag.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;She looks like Minase-san.</p>



<p>The seat at the back of the hallway was hers, and the brand-new blazer was definitely of a new transfer students.</p>



<p>More than that, I know it&#8217;s her.</p>



<p>I have watched her figure from backseat the whole day, there&#8217;s no way I could have mistaken her.</p>



<p>However&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>[&#8230;.. Hmmm &#8230;&#8230; I wonder if I should look forward for tomorrow…&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>As before,I could hear her talking to herself alone in the classroom.</p>



<p>But this image of her doesn&#8217;t fit at all with the image of dignified Minase-san.</p>



<p>It feels uncomfortable, like watching a movie with the wrong dubbing.</p>



<p>Is this really her talking?</p>


<p>[Or is there someone else in the classroom &#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>I tried to look around, but I couldn&#8217;t find anyone but Minase-san on the other side of the door.</p>



<p>In the meantime, she picked up her bag and turned around.</p>



<p>And when that face finally turned toward here&#8212;&#8211;,</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-I was astonished.</p>



<p><em>It was a different person.</em></p>



<p>I saw it.</p>



<p>Those facial features and black hair, without doubt, are Minase Akiha-san.</p>



<p>But&#8230;&#8230;.Eyebrows close together as if about to cry.Eyes swaying with anxiety.No matter how many times I look at to confirm, the one who is trying to pick up the bag is a different person.</p>



<p>I could see nothing but someone else in Minase-san appearance and then,</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I was a few seconds late to hide myself.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.e?]</p>



<p>Her gaze turns here.</p>



<p>Through the peephole, our eyes met perfectly.</p>



<p>Oops, at the time I was about to fix up,</p>



		
<p>My heart pulsed a beat harder at the words that I remembered from somewhere.</p>



<p>[Yes&#8230;I mean in reality, I should have been a single person, right? One body, one mind, that&#8217;s the original form, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;.? And yet, having multiple faces and personalities is&#8230;&#8230;.not a good thing, I think&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;yeah.i guess]</p>



<p>[So that I can return to the way I should be, I&#8217;m trying to get as close to her as I can so that I can become one body and one mind again&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[If you play the character of Akiha like that and get closer to her main personality, then will you become one, one day?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..It looks so]</p>



<p>After a while, Haruka nodded, looking as if she just scored a red dot.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s why I must work hard&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[I see&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>As if we both hit well, I sense an empathy budding for Haruka inside me.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Perhaps we resemble each other.</p>



<p>We just wanted to be ourselves rather than using multiple faces.</p>



<p>No matter what time, we just want to be ourselves firmly.</p>



<p>Haruka might be passing her day while thinking about the same things as I do.</p>



<p>When I think about it, I suddenly feel that the Haruka in front of me is rather likable.</p>



<p>[I understand you]</p>



<p>My cheeks naturally lifted up.</p>



<p>[I also tend to use character in front of nice people&#8230;&#8230;..well, of course it&#8217;s not on the same level as a double personality, and I&#8217;m just being myself right now. But if possible, I would like to stop acting like that. So I understand how you feel, Haruka.]</p>



<p>[Oh, I see&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Haruka chuckled.</p>



<p>[Then we are friends, right?]</p>



<p>Friend.</p>



<p>In this school.In this classroom.</p>



<p>Friends, Secretly holding the same wish in their chest.</p>



<p>When I think about it&#8212;My feelings become lighter and lighter.</p>



<p>It was as if an ally had appeared in the battle I had been waging all alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.. I&#8217;m cheering for you.]</p>



<p>Her tone of voice was naturally enthusiastic.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m so cheering for Haruka-chan and Akiha to become one.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Thank you]</p>



<p>Haruka who was laughing relaxed her expression even more.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m very happy to hear you say that. I&#8217;m also rooting for you, Yano-kun.]</p>



<p>And then she smiled and raised her eyebrows in trouble and said,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s why,&#8230;..the thing about Double personality is a secret only between us,ok?]</p>



<p>＊</p>



<p>There are times when I feel like I&#8217;m the only one who looks awfully shabby compared to others.</p>



<p>For example, my hair is too straight. My hair is straight and black, just like my mother and father. If I leave it alone, it just falls straight down from the hairline and can&#8217;t be rolled easily.</p>



<p>If you hear that, you may think, [It&#8217;s nice and easy on rainy days]. In fact, some people around like Sudo, who has soft hair, would say, [What&#8217;s with that hair type? It&#8217;s something that only beautiful girls are allowed to have! You should trade it for my hair!] and starts envying them.</p>



<p>But in reality, it&#8217;s not that good. When it grows out a bit, it becomes flat and looks like a little boy&#8217;s hair from elementary school. When I shorten it, it rises straight up from my scalp and I can&#8217;t control it anymore. Not only on rainy days, but also on sunny and cloudy days, this hair type annoys me. Even then, will people with curly hair really want to have such a type of hair?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;. There are a lot of things which give me an inferior complex like that.</p>



<p>Of these, the one I was most concerned about was my [bad possession]</p>



<p>Whether it was uniforms, sneakers, or writing materials, they all wore out quickly.</p>



<p>Even though I deal with them normally, they wear out at twice the rate of other people&#8217;s things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t it because of your crude way of life], when I was told so by Sudou, I seriously got a shock.</p>



<p>[Good morning]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why When Akiha&#8217;s voice reached me at the entrance.</p>



<p>I was terribly embarrassment when I realised I was holding the worn out school slippers.</p>



<p>[Go, Go, Good morning&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I replied to her, but inwardly I was restless.</p>



<p>After all, She may have noticed the filthy slippers&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or rather, It&#8217;s been a year since I started school, and I don&#8217;t know why my slippers are so broken.</p>



<p>The sole on the bottom is almost gone, and they&#8217;re so lame&#8230;</p>



<p>[I heard the story from Haruka]</p>



<p>While I was impatient, Akiha smoothly changed her shoes.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s already out from day one, isn&#8217;t it? Well i expected it to happen but]</p>



<p>She might have been a little surprised at how easily the topic comes out.</p>



<p>However, Akiha&#8217;s tone was exactly the same as when she was making normal small talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were other students around, but no specific words were mentioned, and no one thought this was about [dual personalities]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry]</p>



<p>I also replied to Akiha in an idle tone consistently.</p>



<p>[I didn&#8217;t mean to probe you like this, but it just happened&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[Um, I know that. I know very well what kind of child Haruka is]</p>



<p>Akiha spoke like an older sister talking about her younger sister.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how much different Their personality is, for her, Haruka may be more like an little sister then another personality.</p>



<p>[I thought it would be difficult from the beginning, that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep it a secret. But I didn&#8217;t think she would fail from day one.]</p>



<p>Saying that, Akiha chuckled.</p>



<p>The look on her face was so unexpected that it made me feel choked up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I think about it, I&#8217;m very lucky to be able to talk to my crush like this in the morning.</p>



<p>And also to be able to have a secret conversation with her that no one else can know about.</p>



<p>And then, as if to push me more into the edge,</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad it was Yano-kun]</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad Yano-kun was the first one to find out.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;Why?]</p>



<p>[Because he wouldn&#8217;t make a big deal out of it. I can trust you that much.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..I see]</p>



<p>When she replied so straightforwardly&#8230;&#8230;.I was ecstatic.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-I&#8217;m glad it was Yano-kun.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-I can trust you.</p>



<p>At the very least, it can be taken as a positive evaluation.</p>



<p>If anything, Akiha may have a favorable impression of me.</p>



<p>Half-heartedly, my cheek area lifts up.</p>



<p>At the very least, My heavy steps towards the classroom become lighter.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, you may have already heard from Haruka but please don&#8217;t leak out this matter]</p>



<p>[Ah, yes.of course I will not]</p>



<p>[Thank you.Im sorry for being selfish but that girl may not want to give up just like that.]</p>



<p>I felt a little discomfort from the words she continued.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8211;That girl may not want to give up just like that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s almost like saying that I also do not want to.</p>



<p>Only Haruka might be the only one who wanted to hide the dual personality&#8212;&#8212;-</p>



<p>Then, I wonder what Akiha thinks?</p>



<p>Does she think it&#8217;s ok to not hide it?</p>



<p>Does she think it&#8217;s okay to have a dual personality as it is?</p>



<p>However before I could ask that,</p>



<p>[Then, I hope you take care of that girl]</p>



<p>We arrived in the front of the 2nd year, 4th classroom.</p>



<p>With another small smile, Akiha went to her seat.</p>



<p>As I watched her retreating figure, I felt the desire to know more about her.</p>



<p>I want to Know more about Akiha.</p>



<p>I want to know what the two of them are thinking&#8212;&#8212;.</p>



<p>＊</p>



<p>However, after the class started, I couldn&#8217;t think of such carefree things anymore.</p>



<p>It was too much to imagine to look at in this way.</p>



<p>According to Haruka, She wants to hide [Dual personality].</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;On the way to the different classroom, she dropped her pencil case and splashed the contents all over the place.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;Suddenly, a classmate speaks to her and&#8230;..[Huh!? What?] And she replied in her natural tone of voice.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-Immediately after switching places, she look around restlessly with a face like, [huh, where am I?].</p>



<p>I can expect that much to a certain extent.</p>



<p>Such a klutz Haruka, her acting would also be definitely full of holes.</p>



<p>But in reality, she is so far below the expectation that even a casual bystander can easily find the difference.</p>



<p>Of course, no one would suspect her of having a [double personality?], I think.</p>



<p>At most, people would think, [Minase-san, you look absent minded] or treat her like a [eccentric character]</p>



<p>And so, At lunch break.</p>



<p>[Then, think about the enrollment club.You don&#8217;t have to force yourself]</p>



<p>To a member of the handicraft club, who invited her to join the club.</p>



<p>[Um, I will consult it with Akiha]</p>



<p>Thinking about the reply, I made up my mind to talk with Akiha.</p>



<p>Just thinking about these things shortening my life span.</p>



<p>I was so scared that my back was sweating.</p>



<p>Rather, best time is now</p>



<p>[Haruka&#8230;.]</p>



<p>After the members of the handicraft club left in a bewilderment, I called out to Haruka.</p>



		
<p>Haruka, disguised as Akiha looked up at me with a blank expression that reeks of acting,</p>



<p>[Wh, what&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[After school, I have something to talk about&#8212;]</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">🌼</p>



<p>[I have taken the liberty to call you in the clubroom&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Umm]</p>



<p>[Before, it was apparently the clubroom of literature club.But it has become a empty classroom now, moreover the spare key was hidden above the lintel, that&#8217;s why when I want be alone I came here once in a while]</p>



<p>[I see&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Haruka was restlessly moving around inside of the cramped room while hitting the reply in between.</p>



<p>Haruka was observing the furniture with great interest and sometimes touching them to feel it.</p>



<p>Perhaps she hasn&#8217;t come to such a place much, I could see her expression being a little nervous.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.but, well it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>



<p>I smiled bitterly at the scene unfolding in my surroundings.</p>



<p>Certainly this room was a little different from the others.</p>



<p>In front of Haruka, the dusty bookshelves are filled with books so old that they would crumble if you touch them.There are who knows how much years old complete literature works, encyclopaedia and literary magazines.Only a single faded gravure magazine was tucked between them which look about 20 years old, perhaps a parting gift from a member from that time.</p>



<p>The three sets of desk and chair were of old design, different from the one in classroom.Carved into the surface are someone&#8217;s initials, obscene figures, and the date H13.10.29.</p>



<p>There are many more things inside the clubroom like Soviet globes, some missing stuffed birds, and a radio-cassette player with a holographic sticker that shows a gray-type alien.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.It was an aspect which shows at best it&#8217;s a good hideout and at worst, it&#8217;s a storage space for unnecessary items.</p>



<p>If you were to be suddenly brought to this place, you would probably be surprised.Perhaps, they would be suspicious of me thinking I had a strange motive.</p>



<p>However if you want to talk about important matters, there is not any other better place than this one in the entire school.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;by the way, what&#8217;s it?]</p>



<p>I asked Haruka as she pulled out a book from the bookshelves and started flipping pages.</p>



<p>Dyed in a honey coloured light passing through the certain, she turns toward me.</p>



<p>[You are still going to be Haruka for a while right?]</p>



<p>[Yeah, that&#8217;s right.hmm&#8230;.until about 16:54 this time,I guess]</p>



<p>She takes out the smartphone from the pocket of her uniform, runs her fingers on the display smoothly and answers.</p>



<p>I see, because of that they share the same timing.</p>



<p>[I see, if there is around that much time then it&#8217;s enough&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;.Umm]</p>



<p>Haruka raised a cornered voice suddenly.</p>



<p>[Wh, why did you suddenly&#8230;&#8230; bring me here?Wha, what did you want to talk about&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[Ah, that&#8217;s right.]</p>



<p>I sat down on the nearby chair and decided to get down to the main point.</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek to hide the embarrassment that was rising in me.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.umm&#8230;&#8230;if it is good&#8230;.that..]</p>



<p>I suggested Haruka, which even I believe was [unlike me].</p>



<p>[Can I help you?]</p>



<p>[Help?]</p>



<p>[Yes.To help so that Haruka&#8217;s double personality doesn&#8217;t leak out&#8230;.]</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-My heartbeat gradually sped up as I said so.</p>



<p>Really, I am even wondering why I am being so impertinent and Sticking out my neck in her private life and wanting to help.</p>



<p>However I thought I couldn&#8217;t just leave her alone.In my eyes, I saw her as someone struggling with a thing called character.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t just stand by and watch Haruka repeat mistake like that.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..haa]</p>



<p>Finally, tension seemed to be released and Haruka took a sigh.</p>



<p>My strength was releasing from the hands holding the [The Complete Works of Kobo Abe, Volume 3] on my chest.</p>



<p>[I, I see.want to help, the ta, the thing you wanted to talk about was this&#8230;&#8230;I surely thought I had made a blund&#8230;..er, ahhhh!!]</p>



<p>Instantly, tension returns back to that body.</p>



<p>[Wh, why? Why do you suddenly&#8230;&#8230;.?I think it&#8217;s just a hassle&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Ahh&#8230;.I don&#8217;t care about.i am just doing it because I wanted to do.see, we talked about it, right? Because we are comrades.Thats why I can&#8217;t leave you just as it is]</p>



<p>Even though I said it myself, I turned bright red at that stinky line.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like a drama saying we are comrades face to face.However, that&#8217;s my true feelings.</p>



<p>I was really happy with the conversation we had yesterday after school.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..Beside, at this rate there will come a day we will be exposed]</p>



<p>I think she was self-aware about it when I added more embarrassment to it.</p>



<p>Putting the book back into the bookshelf, Haruka sat on a nearby chair and took a breath.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. it&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m trying my best but it&#8217;s just not working out]</p>



<p>[Well&#8230;..yeah, that&#8217;s right.]</p>



<p>For example, the character I play is [an overblown part of myself] to the end.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that the light-hearted talk I&#8217;m doing and my attitude toward the teacher are completely new to me. I guess that&#8217;s why I can act naturally and people don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m strange.</p>



<p>However, Haruka and Akiha are the complete opposite of each other.</p>



<p>I think it would be quite difficult to get close to people who have nothing in common.</p>



<p>[Of course I don&#8217;t think there is much I can do. Nevertheless I feel like I can help you from making a fatal mistake or tell you what I think from the sideline.That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230;if it&#8217;s okay with you, I want to help you to the best of my abilities to the extent possible.]</p>



<p>[I see&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Haruka dropped her eyes and started whispering something.</p>



<p>It seems that she can not make up her mind.</p>



<p>[Umm, if it&#8217;s good difficult then it&#8217;s ok for you to refuse, you know?I know I am being a bit pushy]</p>



<p>[Ah, no.It&#8217;s not like that]</p>



<p>She raised her head suddenly and shook her head like a dog does after getting wet.</p>



<p>[I think i had like to ask for a favour.I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you could help me. But&#8230;I feel guilty.I can&#8217;t do anything to repay you&#8230;]</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s okay with just like that.because it&#8217;s my selfishness afterall]</p>



<p>[I can&#8217;t do that. So, Yano-kun, is there anything troubling you? Is there anything I can help you with?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; something Haruka could help with&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Haruka looked at me with a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;.At the looks which looked completely similar to Akiha, a guilty thought appeared in my mind for a moment.</p>



<p>[I want to help], if that&#8217;s said by a girl who looks similar to the girl i like, it&#8217;s inevitable I will think about [that sort of thing].</p>



<p>Delusions run around arbitrarily before I could even fall in self loathing or self control myself.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Ah! Perhaps Yano-kun&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Suddenly Haruka said in a voice as if she just realised something.</p>



<p>And then I was given a scare by her,</p>



<p>[Just now&#8230;&#8230;you were worried about asking me to do something right?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..eh]</p>



<p>[There&#8217;s no way I can trust this unreliable person! That&#8217;s written all over your face.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;haha, was i busted?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;.Humph]</p>



<p>I laughed unintentionally at the misunderstanding of Haruka who became angry.</p>



<p>The unscrupulous thoughts disappeared, and the air in the club room, which was serious, was a little soft.</p>



<p>Thank god, I was saved a little due to her defenselessness this Time.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. but certainly, that&#8217;s the problem here, isn&#8217;t?It seems there is not much you can do&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ah,how about I treat you to meal?but I&#8217;m not carrying money with myself.It&#8217;s impossible to solve your problems when I can&#8217;t even solve your own problems&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>And here suddenly, Haruka made a face as if she thought about something.</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;yes, love advice]</p>



<p>She brightened her face and said that.</p>



<p>[Now Yano-kun, Don&#8217;t you have someone you like?]</p>



<p>[What? Som, someone I like&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[Yes, someone you have unrequited love for. In class or the same grade or someone from the same club? I have read a lot of Love manga so I think I can give you love advice]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but stiffen up.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not the development I had expected.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be asked by the other person I had a crush on who I liked.</p>



<p>[Hey, how?is there someone you like?]</p>



<p>[Th, that&#8217;s&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;th, there&#8217;s but]</p>



<p>[Oh, who? Someone from same class? A person I know?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>At my wit&#8217;s end, I couldn&#8217;t help but panic.</p>



<p>Why is Haruka getting so excited&#8230;..?</p>



<p>Because she&#8217;s happy to return the favour? Or maybe she likes such conversation to begin with&#8230;?</p>



<p>[&#8230;..hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>Saying so, Haruka brings her body closer without hesitation.</p>



<p>My body shivered at the sweet scent coming from her hair which was the same as Akiha.</p>



<p>[Why are you getting so embarrassed?]</p>



<p>[N, no, that&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Are you feeling sick or something&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not like that&#8230;&#8230;but getting too close&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[getting too close&#8230;&#8230;. what?]</p>



		
<p>[Are you feeling sick or something&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Crystal eyes approaching at close range.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-peach coloured lips and collarbones peaking through the nape.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;bulges pushing the front of the blazer and white legs extending from the skirt.</p>



<p>Sharing the body with Akiha&#8212;&#8212;.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-and there.</p>



<p>Haruka&#8217;s movement suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>And then&#8212;&#8211;a face as if it was unbelievable.</p>



<p>With a face with as if she just get a premonition of something outrageous,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Perhaps&#8230;&#8230;.Akiha?]</p>



<p>Slowly, she spoke the name.</p>



<p>[Does Yano-kun like Akiha?]</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;I could no longer create a character or act.</p>



<p>My head stopped thinking and I couldn&#8217;t say any more words to deceive.</p>



<p>My face was getting redder and redder, as I could clearly see.</p>



<p>[What?&#8230; really?&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Haruka looked at me with a flabbergasted face.</p>



<p>[ Do you really like Akiha?]</p>



<p>I wonder what I should do?</p>



<p>If I were to say I like Akiha to this girl, I wonder how it will turn out?</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t she think I&#8217;m creepy?Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay friends with Haruka?</p>



<p>maybe I should try to hide it somehow&#8230;.?</p>



<p>However, there is no way to cheat or lie from here on out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a choice but to prepare myself&#8212;&#8212;.</p>



<p>[&#8230;.. that&#8217;s right.]</p>



<p>I confessed while noticing that my voice was a little faint.</p>



<p>[The one I like is Akiha]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;I see]</p>



<p>Haruka pulled back, entrusting her weight to the chair and muttering something like &#8220;uwaa&#8221;.</p>



<p>[Yano-kun to Akiha&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I wonder what will happen now.</p>



<p>Will she be drawn?</p>



<p>Or Will she reject it?</p>



<p>The next moment when I took a shock-resistant posture in my heart so that I would not be depressed no matter how I was treated.</p>



<p>[Uwaa&#8230;..wow&#8230;.is that so]</p>



<p>Haruka dyed her white cheeks pink and raised a strangely cheerful voice.</p>



<p>[Akiha seems to have been popular for a long time&#8230;&#8230;I see, Yano-kun likes Akiha&#8230;&#8230;.! Waa, it&#8217;s someone more closer then I think]</p>



<p>It was an unexpected reaction.</p>



<p>An innocent reaction, as if she was talking about love with a normal friend&#8212;&#8212;.</p>



<p>Then she pulled her chair over to me and peered at me with a look of delight on her face.</p>



<p>[Hey,hey, when did you start liking her? You haven&#8217;t met each other so many times yet, right&#8230;&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>She started a barrage of questions.</p>



<p>[Umm well&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..on the day of the opening ceremony, it was a chance encounter&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[Then it&#8217;s love at first sight&#8230;&#8230;.what do you like about her?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.do, do I have to tell you that?]</p>



<p>[there is no harm, tell me! Of course i will not say it to Akiha]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;we, well she is a self paced person part?]</p>



<p>[That girl core is too strong, isn&#8217;t it!&#8230;&#8230;.hmmm, speaking of that]</p>



<p>And thereupon Haruka face suddenly turned as if she just realised something,</p>



<p>[Could it be&#8230;&#8230; you are saying to help me out cause your purpose is that girl?]</p>



<p>[No! I can&#8217;t say that&#8217;s not the case but&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I was about to deny it vigorously, but then I toned it down.</p>



<p>It would be a lie to say that I wasn&#8217;t excited there.</p>



<p>[Certainly I had expectations that if I were to help Haruka then the time I spent with Akiha would increase&#8230;..]</p>



<p>When I approached Haruka, I had a slight selfish expectation.</p>



<p>I was hoping that it would be a good opportunity to close the distance between me and Aki.</p>



<p>Maybe I would become a special existence for her in that time.</p>



<p>[But it was true that I thought I couldn&#8217;t leave you alone! That was my number one reason, you can trust me on that]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..umm, that&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>Haruka nodded and smiled mischievously like a kid as if she had successfully pulled a prank.</p>



<p>[I know that in reality, sorry for troubling you, it was my bad]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s it, aren&#8217;t you a little impatient?]</p>



<p>[Really sorry&#8230;&#8230;.but, umm, I will be supporting you, Yano-kun love]</p>



<p>Then, for the first time, she showed some confidence in her expression&#8212;&#8212;-,</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to do better than anyone else.]</p>



<p>[Ah, thank you]</p>



<p>I felt reassured, honestly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Haruka is Akiha herself.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t find a more trustworthy person to talk to about your love life.</p>



<p>[So,I&#8217;m sorry that order was reversed]</p>



<p>And with that preface, Haruka bowed her head.</p>



<p>[Thank you for taking care of me too]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;um, leave it to me]</p>



<p>Just then, there was a knock on the door of the clubroom.</p>



<p>[Yano-kun, are you there?]</p>



<p>The door opened and Chiyoda-sensei peeked out.</p>



<p>Chiyoda Momose-sensei.A petite build sensei whom I have known since last year.</p>



<p>She is twenty seven years old.Her well-groomed face and mature demeanor, combined with her short stature gap, has earned her the devotion of some boys.</p>



<p>Apparently this room management has been entrusted to her and has overlooked my occasional stay here with her administrative authority.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s strange.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unusual for this cautious person to open the door without waiting for an answer after knocking. &#8230;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this time, she did.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.hmm? Ah, Minase-san&#8230;..I&#8217;m sorry, were you busy in the middle of doing something?]</p>



<p>Noticing that it wasn&#8217;t only me but Haruka was also here, she candidly said.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s okay to get along but keep abiding by moderation, okay?]</p>



<p>[No, no, that&#8217;s not it]</p>



<p>Realising that I was misunderstood outrageously, I stood up and hurriedly denied it.</p>



<p>[We were just chatting ideally&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Even if I started explaining like that, I couldn&#8217;t just outright say the truth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/icGxeixpbgt1fOYW5-XZczN66v0mj4ipZc9NbAkaEmPA4rOB4VDgbuipOdPVNuVMgFVyo_WXPfgiHeVTe4Zyi5e8kgB5SU2asnZSLT8nqRnL_E1cAHly6lAJY9TVVTcewj-jtGP6" alt="" /></figure>



<p>In the end, it took me about fifteen minutes of explanation to clear up Chiyoda-sensei&#8217;s misunderstanding.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">✴️</p>



<p>As I walked out of the school building, I noticed that the sun had turned to the west already.</p>



<p>Junior high school students on their way out of school, restaurant clerks shopping, and businessmen on the phone were passing by on the sidewalk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right in front of me, an overweight mixed breed dog is being walked by its owner with a sense of reluctance.</p>



<p>A line had already begun to form in front of a ramen shop that was ranked among the top ramen shops in Japan on the food log.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-the time was past 16 o&#8217;clock.</p>



<p>In this town along the Sobu Line, there is no end to the number of people passing by even at this mid-day hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In less than 30 minutes, Haruka&#8217;s personality will be replaced by that of Akiha.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..fufufu]</p>



<p>Abruptly, Haruka beside me started laughing in low voice.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s with you]</p>



<p>[Ah, you know, when we are going back together like that, it&#8217;s like&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.we are friends]</p>



<p>Saying that, Haruka laughs shyly.</p>



<p>[We had been in an orphanage for a long time before we came here, and we didn&#8217;t have any friends. Even before that, we didn&#8217;t get along with anyone at school. That&#8217;s why this is the first time doing something like this&#8230; I feel like we&#8217;re friends&#8230;]</p>



<p>With those words&#8230; for the first time, I realized what Akiboli and Haruka had been up to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see, because of the aforementioned dual personality, these girls were spending the everyday vastly different from me.</p>



<p>So maybe this is the first &#8220;normal school life&#8221; for them.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; speaking of that, aren&#8217;t we friends?]</p>



<p>I said as I watched the blackboard in front of the coffee shop being replaced with a dinner menu.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;huh?]</p>



<p>[Whether it&#8217;s look like it or not, I thought of Haruka as my friends&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>We have similar feelings of wanting to be one person.</p>



<p>We both even made a promise to help each other.we are definitely friends.</p>



<p>Of course, if it were anyone else, I would never have said this out loud.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But for &#8212;&#8211; Haruka.</p>



<p>I conveyed it directly to her who was walking alongside with me.</p>



<p>And I think I will never forget the change that happened to Haruhi at that moment.</p>



<p>For a moment, Haruka paused as if she were being spoken to in a foreign language, and then,</p>



<p>&#8212;-a smile bloomed on her face.</p>



<p>The soft cheeks lifted. The dark eyes shine brightly.</p>



<p>A happy smile that seems to even increase the brightness of her skin.</p>



<p>[I see&#8230;&#8230;.I see.so we are friends]</p>



<p>[Umm, that&#8217;s right]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m happy&#8230;&#8230;. that&#8217;s first time for me]</p>



<p>[Then I&#8217;m glad]</p>



<p>She scratched his cheek in embarrassment.</p>



<p>In front of my eyes I have turned away, two elementary school kids were chasing each other and rushed into into the park.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right]</p>



<p>Abruptly, she raised a voice as if she just thought of a great idea,</p>



<p>[If it&#8217;s okay with you&#8230;&#8230;. would you like to exchange diaries with each other?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..huh?diary exchange?]</p>



<p>[It was something I saw in the manga and something I longed for, me, Akiha and a good friend exchanging diaries]</p>



<p>[Oh, that&#8217;s right. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who do that today.]</p>



<p>[Umm, no, is it not good?]</p>



<p>With a face like a puppy getting wet in the rain, Haruka tilted her neck.</p>



<p>[Even though I thought it would be fun since Akiha would also write it]</p>



<p>Honestly, it was troublesome.</p>



		
<p>When I was in elementary school, I always wrote my summer vacation diary as homework on the last day of school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have no interest in writing about my day on social networking sites.</p>



<p>Although I like reading articles, I&#8217;m anything but better at writing them.</p>



<p>However&#8230; As Haruka said, the idea of having an exchange diary with Akiha was more than a little fascinating.</p>



<p>To be able to read her writing on a regular basis, I could get to know her thoughts.</p>



<p>Certainly just thinking about it makes my heart throb.</p>



<p>And above anything else,</p>



<p>[What do you think&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>It was hard to say no when my friend gave me that look.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I understand]</p>



<p>I smiled at Haru as I brushed my hair.</p>



<p>[Let&#8217;s do it, Diary exchange]</p>



<p>It was one more look that I would never forget.</p>
