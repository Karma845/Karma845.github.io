<h3 class="p1">Prologue</h3>
<h4 class="p1"><em>—Hypocrite lecteur, —mon semblable,—mon frére!</em></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I read it over and over again as if it was a charm. The dust jacket was worn out, the pages tanned, the cover riddled with small scratches. From page 9 to page 10 from the beginning of the pocket paperback.</p>
<p class="p1">I no longer felt the vividness from those rows of letters anymore.</p>
<p class="p1">The context was decomposed into simple shapes, <em>Gestaltzerfall</em>, the meaning no longer perceivable to me.</p>
<p class="p1">Still, as if I was hanging on for life, I read that paragraph over and over for who-knows-how-many times.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8212;<em>sniff</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">An unconscious sniffle followed by the unfamiliar smell of the wax resin from the floor.</p>
<p class="p1">In the classroom of the to-be homeroom to fourth class of the second year at the seat by the window.</p>
<p class="p1">I somehow woke up early and, with nothing better to do, came here although—</p>
<p class="p1">It was one hour left.</p>
<p class="p1">In one hour, the opening ceremony would begin.</p>
<p class="p1">The copy-pasted opening speech by the principal and the school anthem sung in unison which reminded us of the Shouwa-era and the warnings from the school counselors to the students who couldn’t restrain themselves like those ‘<em>Don’t watch if under 18</em>’-warnings.</p>
<p class="p1">After that was done we would be leaving the gymnasium and move towards the classrooms where our new school life would begin.</p>
<p class="p1">The smell of the classroom, which during the spring break wasn’t ventilated and so smelled old, would in a blink of an eye be exchanged for the smell of everyday during the new school year.</p>
<p class="p1">«—sigh…»</p>
<p class="p1">A sigh escaped me before I noticed.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet again, I will be playing different versions of myself in this classroom.</p>
<p class="p1">The me before friends.</p>
<p class="p1">The me before teachers.</p>
<p class="p1">The me before those I wasn’t familiar with.</p>
<p class="p1">The me before a crowd of people.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not that I think it’s a bad thing, it’s just a necessity in the end. It’s just that my conscience makes me feel I’m deceiving myself.</p>
<p class="p1">I feel like I’m losing myself eventually.</p>
<p class="p1">So before that happens, at least to prevent me from losing myself, I want to experience the things I like, many of them.</p>
<p class="p1">I felt I wanted to fasten, bind myself to the things I admired.</p>
<p class="p1">At that moment—</p>
<p class="p1">«…Is that Ikezawa Natsuki?»</p>
<p class="p1">I voice came from point-blank range.</p>
<p class="p1">I looked up on reflex.</p>
<p class="p1">At some point, a girl was standing there.</p>
<p class="p1">A female student, clad in a school uniform, was peeking at me.</p>
<p class="p1">«I also like that book, ‘<em>Still Lives</em>’.»</p>
<p class="p1">—Before I knew it, I received a little jolt.</p>
<p class="p1">A faint current was running throughout my body before even the thoughts of ‘Who is it? Was I seen? This is bad!’ was formed in my mind.</p>
<p class="p1">A well featured face like glassworks and pupils as deep as the spirals of a galaxy.</p>
<p class="p1">Her short black hair was lightly shining in the morning sun.</p>
<p class="p1">The blazer she wore was new, the finger gripping the bag was as delicate as candles, her mysterious expression made her look somewhat defenceless. On the other hand, her mature face looked so listless—.</p>
<p class="p1">—I had a slight premonition.</p>
<p class="p1">It was the mysterious still before the storm of emotions—.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>—no, now’s not the time for that!</em></p>
<p class="p1">I hurriedly hid the paperback while,</p>
<p class="p1">«Oh well! Ahaha! That surprised me! I didn’t even notice you were there!»</p>
<p class="p1">I forced a smile, my voice raised a bar higher.</p>
<p class="p1">«Oh by the way, when did you come? Maybe you’ve been here for a while already? It would have been fine if you had called me haha!»</p>
<p class="p1">«… I arrived just now. Why are you hiding that book?»</p>
<p class="p1">«Oh, you saw that? What can I say, well, I just reading it since a friend lent it to me, I’m not sure why, it’s sort of embarrassing—»</p>
<p class="p1">«…Why is that embarrassing?»</p>
<p class="p1">«No well, people usually don’t read that sort of stuff right? And I was secretly reading it in this empty classroom by myself…»</p>
<p class="p1">«I’m not sure about that ‘people usually don’t read’ part so I can’t say though.»</p>
<p class="p1">She said by the way of preface before she straightened her back.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, a voice sounding like ringing bells resonated—</p>
<p class="p1">«—What’s important is connecting the mountain ranges, the people, the dye works, the chorus of cicadas and more of the outer world, with the wide world within you, and how they stand one step apart, shoulder to shoulder as they harmonise with each other. Like watching the stars.»</p>
<p class="p1">—I held my breath.</p>
<p class="p1">That line she smoothly recited from memory.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a line found in the beginning of ’Still Lives’. The phrase I read through over and over again.</p>
<p class="p1">She turned straight towards my direction.</p>
<p class="p1">«…It’s a good novel, isn’t it?»</p>
<p class="p1">An intense awkwardness was welling up in me.</p>
<p class="p1">It was an opinion free of all obligations or bonds and without any ulterior thoughts behind.</p>
<p class="p1">What she really thought was as defenceless as a sapling, yet as unyielding as the largest tree.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>What am I… compared to that?</em></p>
<p class="p1">Making characters from superficial schemes, faking my real self with shallow acting, treating the novel I was using to save myself with disdain—.</p>
<p class="p1">The self-hatred was chilling my feet like sneakers taking in water.</p>
<p class="p1">A full ten seconds or more went by in silence before,</p>
<p class="p1">«…I guess. Well, it’s a good book I guess.»</p>
<p class="p1">I admitted as I couldn’t take it any longer.</p>
<p class="p1">And then—,</p>
<p class="p1">«—Or rather, I like it. Among the novels I’ve read ’Still Lives’ is perhaps in my best five list.</p>
<p class="p1">I said before blinking twice.</p>
<p class="p1">«But, well… it doesn’t fit my character that well, reading this I mean. That’s why I don’t want other people to see me reading… should I say, I lose my presence of mind, or…»</p>
