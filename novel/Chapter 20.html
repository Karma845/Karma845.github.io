<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211;Getting Stronger quickly in the Labyrinth’s Underground! ⑩</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the results were–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–It was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gather magical energy into my fist and punch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was all it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was it, and yet–the giant experimental body of the catfish now had a crater in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it was about 7 meters in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant catfish was over 20 meters in size, but there was no way it could survive with such an enormous hole in its body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, there was blood and bits of flesh splattered all around me now. It was that crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…This is getting to be exasperating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith shrugged her shoulders as if to show just how frustrated she was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, even I was exasperated at how powerful it was. It was more than a little off-putting now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having your MP at nearly 20,000 was incredible indeed…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was suddenly attacked by a dizziness and ended up sinking to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A headache accompanied by pain had rushed to my body, and a greasy sweat began to surface from my pores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Magic depletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…The force may be incredible, but it would be very difficult to use it in actual combat… Its usability is pretty much abysmal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said with the best smile I could muster. Lilith looked at me with a worried expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I’m hungry. We should get something to eat soon…and get some sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending the night in the cavern with a water vein running through it, we continued our trek to the final bottom layer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insides of this cave was filled with a somewhat damp atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I pulled Lilith by the hand, I asked her:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With dragon zombies… Don’t they mostly look the same as they did before death?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…After death, the dragonkin use their secret arts to preserve the body from decaying. And then…their souls are fixed to this world… When they are reborn as undead, they reflect their status shortly before death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shortly before death?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They wouldn’t even be able to walk if they were brought back to a state of being sick on the ground, moments before death. You might fix their soul into such a body…but they would hardly function as guardians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that is true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. The true purpose of this trial… You cannot receive the divine blessing of the dragon god… Deceased dragons who go to the afterlife become beings that are only souls. Then they turn into dragon gods. And in that moment of death…they pass on their powers to younger dragons. Through this, they can rise in rank and becomes gods. And so elder dragons had much more power than younger ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“–It’s like a passing of the baton through the generations, huh. So…when dragon zombies become zombies… Does the blessing of the dragon god skill disappear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SKILL: Dragon God’s Blessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an insane skill that adjusted your Physical Strength Boost to x1.5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My current Physical Strength Boost was x2…so with that stacked… If I learned that skill, than my stats would come out as 2 x 1.5 = 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, compared to hero level 100 skills… Dragon God’s Blessing was quite tame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the hero level 100 skill… added an additional x2 increase to your Physical Strength Boost… It added an x2 to my original x2, so it would be an x4. It was just insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s no wonder why they call it the most powerful class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of those reasons, I personally wanted this skill by any means possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My growth rate was quite low compared to heroes as it were, but if they were able to double their stats on top of that…  I would never catch up to Cordelia if that happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Also, there are not many dragons around. You cannot count on a dragon zombie to conveniently appear at the altar every time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But…There is one this time, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith does not answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so I do not question her further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walk through the long, long tunnels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, both I and Lilith had become very quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the path opened before us, and a large hall that a 100 meters radius, spread out before us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this…the altar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was something lined in a 20-meter radius surrounding the dragon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It resembled the Stonehenge from England, with black colored boulders placed an equal distance apart in the shape of a circle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it wasn’t just boulders…it would be more accurate to call them monoliths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, never mind that… Lilith was in shock just as I had predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a golden, gigantic body that was over 10 meters tall in the center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an impressive earthwyrm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even I and Lilith…both, had somehow or rather guessed that this would happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it was the moment that we stepped foot into this labyrinth, that we noticed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or more accurately, we had only purposely…avoided talking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith’s words did not reach the dragon, as it was already dead.</span></p>
