<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; A Small Miracle</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Huff
huff huff......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
gasps for air and keeps running.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
lungs hurt, and her strength has long since reached its limit, but she can't
stop running.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She's
afraid that she will be killed if she's caught by that man.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya's
feet were moved by a sense of responsibility that she could not waste the precious
time her brothers had bought for her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Hurry,
hurry, I have to tell everyone about the "adventurer killer"!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">If I
can report it quickly, maybe Onii-chan can be saved!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
knew in the corner of her mind that it is almost impossible, but she couldn't
help but hope.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
a loud shout of terror echoed, ending her hope.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
two, brother and sister, how dare you all messed up with me?! ... You don't even
know how to behave in front of me, the future hero. This is why I hate
humans!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Im,
impossible..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya's
shocked. She holds her breath and leaks a voice of despair as she sees Kaito is
flying in front of her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
broad sword resembling Grandius is floating in the air, and he is on top of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
swung Grandius into the air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Grandius sword vibrates, making a sound like a musical instrument and creates
multiple swords.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
controls the blades to create a staircase that leads to the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The reason
why he can get ahead of Miya and that he can approach and ambush the veteran
adventurer in the level 3 swamps without being noticed was all because of
Grandius' power.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he swings Grandius with his will, the sword splits.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sword duplicates could be manipulated by the user's will.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
was able to catch up with Miya by flying on top of the broad sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
each of the duplicates contained random attack magic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
number of sword duplicates depends on the skill of the person who holds the Grandius.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other day, Kaito created multiple sword duplicates, threw them in every
direction, and pierced the back of an adventurer who escaped in the
smokescreen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Kaito landed on the ground, he glared at Miya with a cold and frustrated
expression.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
brother &amp; sister have annoyed me, this future hero. Especially your
brother. Not only interrupted me, but he also humiliated me. As his sister, you
must pay for it. I'm going to use you as an entertainment tool. After I've
satisfied torturing you, then I'm going to kill you!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
is so desperate when Kaito catches up with her that she's prepares to face her
own death.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
this world, monsters exist, and humans are discriminated against by other
races. Hence, death is something that is very close to them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
when Miya decided to join her brother to work as an adventurer, she was
prepared to die.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Although
despair and fear still overwhelm her mind, she had already made up her mind
long ago.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
why she won't give up fighting until the end!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Magic
power, manifest and take form as an ice blade, ice sword!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
is using her strongest trump card.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Three
ice blades formed and floated around her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is her trump card in attack magic.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Coincidentally,
Miya and Kaito's sword duplicates flew to one another.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ice
Sword! Strike the enemy!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Until
the very last moment, you continued to struggle in vain ......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
Miya's command, the ice swords attack Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
he didn't move, and Grandius swords flying around him blocked all attacks.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13"><span></span>(Onii-chan and the others sacrificed their
lives to help me escape, and I must not give up until the end and report about
the Adventurer Killer!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Tsk,
humans really are a pain in the ass......? I don't care. I'll just cut off one
of your legs so you can't escape, and you'll calm down."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
come here!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
second ice sword flew through the air, but Kaito was able to block the attack
easily.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(I
must tell him! If I tell him, I'm sure he'll defeat this "adventurer
killer". Even though he is a human and younger than me, he can use
tactical class magic without chanting. I'm sure that Dark-san will defeat this
adventurer killer!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito's
sword blade moves to cut off Miya's leg.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
instinctively moves her last ice sword and luckily manages to deflect the blow,
so her leg is not severed but only slashed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Still,
her leg is bleeding, and she could no longer walk, let alone run.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
had fallen to the ground, but she keeps glaring at Kaito and not giving up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though she had already used her strongest trump card, and there is nothing left
to use.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
was going to cut off your legs, but you were lucky enough to be able to deflect
it with your ice sword. Well, with those legs, you can't escape anymore."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"...You,
you are not a hero."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
took out the knife and held it in both hands, even though she understood that
she can't win.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
was terrified and crying, but she desperately continued to drag her feet.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
future hero is Dark-san, who is younger than me. He is a human who can use
tactical class magic without chanting. You're just a loser who takes pleasure
in bullying the weak. You are definitely not a future hero!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"........"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
was sure that Miya knew that there was nothing she can do to reverse this
desperate situation, and the only thing left for her is to be killed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
she didn't say a single word of begging for her life, even though she had been
cornered. Kaito fell silent for a moment, without saying a word.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
she had been wrong, Kaito would not be so silent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
reason for his silence was that deep down, he knew that he is a loser&mdash;a loser
who had fallen off the elite path.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
result, he became silent when someone pointed out the truth to him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito's
pride was hurt not just once but twice in this short period, not only by Erio
but also by his sister Miya.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Shut!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Shut
up!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Shut
up!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Shut
up!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Shut
up!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">You're
just a human, you're just a human, you're just a human, and you're just a
humaaaan!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
an erupted volcano, Kaito is in rage, holding the treasure sword
"Grandius" with both hands and kicking the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
swung the sword with all his might at a human girl who is only holding a small
knife. Her leg is injured, and she can't move.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Die!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Screw
you, die!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Damn bug!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ugh!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
also prepared herself and shut her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the last moment, she wished strongly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(If
I could tell Dark-san about "Adventurer Killer" to Dark-san, who is a
future hero and human race hope, I'm sure he will defeat this elf. Dark-san!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sword swung down to Miya's head, but the sword never reached her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
small miracle occurs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
"SSR, Prayer Misanga" that Miya wears in her left hand glows
brightly, and her figure instantly disappears from that place.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What!?
Huh, eh?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
who is irritated and very angry at Miya, is confused by the strange incident.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
had lost Miya, who had all the information about him, including his
description, race, and means of attack.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was only natural that Kaito stood there for a few minutes with a confused
expression on his face, unable to understand the situation.</span></p>
