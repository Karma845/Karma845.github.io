<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; The Next Revenge</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Currently
I'm temporarily returned to my office in Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
had informed Miya and Elly that I would return to hear the information they had
obtained from Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
instruction I gave them was to obtain the information by any means necessary. That
is why they are already waiting in my office.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
greet me when they see me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you for making time in your busy day to talk with us. It is an honor to spend
time with you, my Lord. I have no regrets for my maid's way."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I've
been looking forward to meeting you too, God Raito! So much that I want to
celebrate this special day!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
were so excited because they hadn't seen me for a few days.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
smiling, I take off my mask, put it on my desk, and sit on my chair.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ahahaha,
I'm glad to see you two after a while too. So how are things going with Kaito?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Of
course, everything is fine! I have used my forbidden magic to examine every
part of his brain, even his forgotten memories!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
also confirmed the truth with magic and interrogation to see if there are any
differences with Elly's extracted information. This is the report."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly
proudly puffs out her breasts and brag about her magic skill.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
Mei carefully prepares the report. She arranges them on my desk with her
beautiful fingertips.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
was planning to ask them about the interrogation's progress. Still, they have
extracted all the information in such a short time.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I thank
them both and pick up the report.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
contents were written neatly and easy to understand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As I
read the document, my eyebrows furrowed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Is this true?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes.
This report was compiled after using Elly's forbidden magic and truth
confirmation magic."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
forbidden magic isn't as good as Infinite Gacha card, God Raito's greatest blessing.
But I am sure that this report is accurate."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Mei
and Elly are in charge of Naraku's internal affairs and tactical operations. If
they are sure of this, then this report must be correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However--.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sub-master
are descendants of the Master. They have a strong body, high magical power, and
can easily level up. These are as expected."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
whole world is searching for the Master.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">And
his descendant (the Sub-master) won’t be an ordinary person.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That
is why Kaito believes he can't be stuck at level 1,500. He keeps boasting that
he will become a hero, leaving his country and killing people.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"But
the next one, is the reason why nations are wary of the Master. If left alone,
the world would be destroyed...... That doesn't make any sense. I can
understand if a country would be destroyed, but to say that the whole world
would be destroyed is a little..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't doubt Mei and Elly, but it's hard to believe this story.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
guess that because the Master is so powerful, all nations are looking for him
to increase their military forces. But I didn’t expect to hear the world’s end if
the Master is left alone.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
can understand if the Master wants to overthrow the government and create his
own kingdom, but does he need to wipe out all races?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Perhaps
they are simply exaggerating?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
can't help but wonder about it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No
matter how strong the Master is, he is still only one person. Is it possible
for one person to destroy the world? Is it possible for one person to wipe out
all living things?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That
may be possible if there are many people with level 9999 like us, but...</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Conquering
the world is still possible, but is it possible to destroy it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
second son from a poor farmer family like me can't come up with an answer, so I
talk to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Mei,
Elly, what do you think about this information?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"When
Elly used the forbidden technique to read his memory, even Kaito had forgotten
about it. It was a statement spoken by the leader of the White Knights, the
Highest Knight Order in the Elf Queen Nation. At this point, we don't have
enough information to make a judgment."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It
is frustrating to admit, but I agree with Mei-san that we don't have enough
information. I have tried to reexamine Kaito's memories, but I couldn't find
any other useful information."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
Elly couldn't find anything after repeatedly reading his memories with her
forbidden magic, further investigation would be fruitless.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
put the report on the desk and leaned back against my chair.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Where's Kaito now?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly
snaps her fingers, and a view of the cell appears in the air.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
you can see, he's in the basement cell."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is lying on the cold floor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is still alive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is also conscious.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
his eyes are blank because he has been tortured by the forbidden magic and
healed repeatedly. His mouth is muttering something.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
look at him and nod my head, then I give an order to Elly and Mei.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
have got the information we need, and we couldn't get anything more from him.
Then - I have to stick to my words. He must pay for his crime of attacking Erio
and Miya and killing many humans, including Gimra and Wardy. Take Kaito's life
right now."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Understood.
In the name of my maid of way."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Certainly!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is a very annoying person, but we got some very useful information from Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
has suffered enough and I don't need him anymore.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly
snaps her fingers, and the view disappears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Thus
Kaito's life is ended.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Now, there's a lot of other information we got. I'll have to check them
too."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Not
only about the Master, but we also got other pieces of information from Kaito.
There are pieces of information regarding the Elf Queen Nation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I am about to look through the report, Elly steps forward. She smiles like an
older sister who spoils her little brother.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"God
Raito, speaking of other information... I have good news."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Good
news?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Tell
me about it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
preparation for the revenge plan against Sasha the elf has been completed!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly,
are you serious?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">God Raito
just needs to say the word, and we can start immediately!"</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xqqCZt2/000005.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
laughs wickedly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sasha's
fiancée is the vice-commander of the White Knights. The knights are a group of
Sub-masters who have the Master's blood flowing in their veins. To make up for
the lack of information, we will capture and get information from them as part
of our revenge plan."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Aah! As expected of Elly! That's a good idea. Then I want you to execute the plan
immediately."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Certainly,
God Raito."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My
mood had been a bit down a while ago, but when I hear that I can take revenge
on Sasha the elf, it instantly cheers me up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I give Elly the command with high excitement, she picks up one side of her
skirt and bows gracefully.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
seems calm at first glance, but her whole body is actually trembling with joy
after receiving my command.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is as if she has received blessings from the God she worshipped.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
chuckle a little at her attitude and then laugh out loud wholeheartedly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"After
Garou, I can take revenge on my second target. Sasha... Aah, I wonder what kind
of desperate expression she will show as she kneels down and begs for her life.
I'm really looking forward to seeing that."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
imagine about the future.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
this, Kaito's case is over. Now I am ready to move on to the next stage of my
revenge.</span></p>
