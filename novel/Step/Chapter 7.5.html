<h2>Chapter 7.5: August 21st (Saturday)</h2>

<p>Yesterday, Mom and I went together to pick up my school uniform and stopped by a lingerie store on the way back.</p>

<p>The school uniform is really cute! I was worried if it would look good on me, but when Aniki shyly said, &quot;It looks good,&quot; it gave me confidence.</p>

<p>Later, Mom taught me how to wear a bra. It's been a while, and it feels uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Being a girl is really troublesome.</p>

<p>To have to wear something so uncomfortable when going out, it feels like it would make me feel thinner...</p>

<p>Aniki seems like he doesn't mind much, but what does he really think?</p>

<p>Has he started seeing me as a girl to some extent?</p>

<p>Compared to Mom, I'm still very small, but I have already grown since junior high.</p>

<p>I hope Aniki will show a little more interest in me.</p>

<p>Is it really about wanting to catch Aniki's attention...</p>
