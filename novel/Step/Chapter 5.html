<h2>Chapter 5: Actually, My &quot;StepBrother&quot; and I Were Going to Take a Bath Together...</h2>

<p>Later, this incident happened after living together with Akira for three weeks:</p>

<p>Akira and I spent that day lazily and casually together.</p>

<p>Akira seemed to be obsessed with a recently purchased RPG game and even bought a strategy guide to earnestly progress through it.</p>

<p>By the way, Akira is the type who frequently saves the game and progresses cautiously. His number of save files keeps increasing, unlike me, who constantly overwrites the same file. This clearly shows our personality differences.</p>

<p>As for me, while Akira was playing video games, I read through a stack of manga and light novels that had piled up.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I'm tired of playing. Switch with me.&quot;</p>

<p>During Akira's break, I was in charge of the most boring tasks of leveling up and collecting items.</p>

<p>Rather than saying I was helping, I felt more like I was being bossed around by Akira, but even so, I didn't think there was anything wrong with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you two, do you have any problem with your summer homework?&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Miyuki probably couldn't stand how lazy we were, and this was her first time nagging at us.</p>

<p>&quot;I naturally have a slow start, so no problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm doing a little bit at a time, no problem. If I can't finish, I'll ask my Aniki to help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, when did I ever say I would help you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you say it before? You said you would teach me how to study.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That, that was when you were transferring schools, right? Even if I'm capable, I don't have time to help with homework!&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Miyuki smiled wryly as she watched us bickering back and forth.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, Akira passed his school transfer exam smoothly, so starting from the second semester, he will be attending the same school as me, J&#333;y&#363; Academy. When I told him that we could go to school together from now on, he looked very happy.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses, Akira and I were already able to interact in the most natural way.</p>

<p>I don't know how Akira feels, but I feel that the distance between us has already shortened.</p>

<p>And this incident happened after I had such thoughts.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;I have to go out to work now, you two behave and work on your summer homework. I'll rely on you to take care of the house.&quot;</p>

<p>Afternoon came, and Aunt Miyuki finished preparing to go out. She came to the living room to give us instructions while we were still idly playing. It seemed that a TV drama would be shooting in the evening, so she had to go out to work.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful on the road.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly after Aunt Miyuki left, Dad called.</p>

<p>&quot;Ry&#333;ta, I just spoke to Miyuki. It seems I won't be able to come back tonight either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. Your work is really tough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's become a common occurrence. The sponsors are interfering, and the director is going crazy. So we have to start from scratch with the background.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, being an adult is tough too, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's how things are. I'm counting on you to take care of things at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, leave it to me. Akira and I will take care of everything.&quot;</p>

<p>After hanging up the phone, Akira asked, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dad said he's staying overnight there again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle's job is tough too, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he seems to enjoy it, so it's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because the TV drama will be filming until late at night, Mom will probably come back late too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder where labor reform has gone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mom is also a workaholic, so it doesn't matter, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True, but what should the two of us do when we're left at home?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I said that, Akira smiled and raised the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you asking the obvious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you're right. Hehehe...&quot;</p>

<p>We both had sinister smiles on our faces.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's order pizza for dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds good. Ah, as long as it's tomato sauce-based, I can eat anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, I unconditionally choose the one with extra cheese&mdash;okay, let's decide.&quot;</p>

<p>And so, the two of us made plans and continued to be lazy later.</p>

<p>As for my summer homework, how was I doing?</p>

<p>That kind of thing should be left until the latter half of summer when the deadline is approaching, and then I'll unleash my full potential. I'm the type who is strict with myself.</p>

<p>So tonight, let's enjoy ourselves with my dear little brother.</p>

<p>However, the majority of events that happen in a family occur when the parents are absent and only the children are alone.</p>

<p>As high school students, it was only natural for us.</p>

<p>Or should I say, it was something I unilaterally decided to do...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>In the evening, we ate pizza and focused on playing games.</p>

<p>However, there was something that had been bothering me since earlier.</p>

<p>Tomato sauce was smeared on the corner of Akira's mouth. And it wasn't just a little bit, but rather a wide spread across his face; to be exaggerated, it looked like a clown in a circus.</p>

<p>I didn't know if he hadn't noticed or didn't care, as he continued to watch the game screen without any intention of wiping it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Akira. You have tomato sauce on your mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't pinpoint where exactly, it's all over your mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Are you kidding? Is it true?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira picked up a tissue and wiped, but the tomato sauce unexpectedly clung stubbornly. He wiped it off, but it spread to the side.</p>

<p>&quot;Turn this way for a moment... There, now it's gone.&quot;</p>

<p>I wiped it off with a wet tissue for him, but his face turned red to the roots of his ears, and he quickly turned away.</p>

<p>Was it because we were in high school and he felt embarrassed for making such a cute and childish mistake, as if he was losing face?</p>

<p>&quot;Th-thank you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, you were too focused on playing video games, weren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Although I had a smile on my face, seeing his shy expression made me feel embarrassed as well.</p>

<p>Looking at him like this, I realized that Akira was really good-looking.</p>

<p>Not only good-looking, but I could also see the changes in his expressions, which made me feel happy.</p>

<p>Although he used to be unsmiling and not very likable, now he could smile, show disdain, get sulky, get angry, and even become shy like he did just now. His expressions became much more expressive.</p>

<p>From a positive perspective, he had let down his guard against me. As his older brother, seeing him without defenses made me very happy. So...</p>

<p>&quot;...Akira, I'm glad to have you as my sibling.&quot;</p>

<p>I blurted out my current feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;W-why are you suddenly saying that...&quot;</p>

<p>Rather than being shocked, he seemed more embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;That's how I truly feel. Without you, my summer vacation would just be me wasting time alone.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, since Akira and Aunt Miyuki came to this house, the atmosphere had become much brighter than before.</p>

<p>Recently, we were able to naturally get along with each other instead of seeking a balance.</p>

<p>The new life that initially made me anxious had now revealed its true nature, and it only made people laugh and say, &quot;Oh, so that's how it is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;E-even if you don't play with me, you can find someone else, right? Don't you have friends? You've been with me for the whole summer vacation, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I do have some, but not many.&quot;</p>

<p>I accidentally let my vanity get the better of me and said &quot;not many.&quot; When it came to friends, I only thought of Koukei.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, if it weren't for him, I might have been left alone at school.</p>

<p>&quot;But you seem like you should have many friends...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're overestimating me. Rather than making a lot of friends, it's better to have a few close ones...&quot;</p>

<p>--That's what we call the theory of being a loner. Simply put, I'm not good at interacting with a large number of people, but it's easier for me to be with a select few.</p>

<p>In that sense, it was much easier to hang out with Koukei, who I've been acquainted with since junior high.</p>

<p>As for Y&#333;ko... I still felt a little awkward.</p>

<p>&quot;Be-because you're my brother, right? Ahahaha...&quot;</p>

<p>Since we've opened up about this topic, I've finally made up my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright! How about we take a bath together, Akira?&quot;</p>

<p>I thought that the only way to bridge the distance between us was to suggest doing something I had decided to do before.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh... ehhhhhhhhh?!&quot;</p>

<p>Akira suddenly Akirated, blushi ng furiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you so surprised? I've always wanted to try washing each other's backs. It's like being completely open with each other, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-open... completely open!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be shy. It's just washing each other's backs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not the point... Is this really serious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Don't you like it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not about liking or not liking. This is just not possible! We'll see each other... completely naked! It's way beyond being casual!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would mind!&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed to lack confidence in his own body, but I felt the same way. The idle summer vacation this year seems to have caused a slight increase in my weight.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're shy, we can use towels to cover up, and we'll only see each other's backs. That's not a big deal, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It really will only be washing each other's backs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what else would it be? Ah, I can wash my hair by myself, so don't worry about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not the issue! I mean...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You still don't want to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're already high school students, this is... and besides, we're siblings!&quot;</p>

<p>Precisely because we're siblings. Occasionally, I go to the public bathhouse with our father and help him wash his back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that's... because... you're father and son, because you're uncle...&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly. Akira, when you went on school trips in elementary and middle school, how did you take baths?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-what do you mean by 'how did I take baths'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did everyone go to the public bathhouse together?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No... we bathed in the hotel rooms, filled the bathtub with water, and took turns washing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever been to a hot spring or sauna?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't...&quot;</p>

<p>I knew it.</p>

<p>Akira probably wasn't accustomed to seeing other people's bodies.</p>

<p>Closing the distance between Akira and me is certainly important, but I'm also concerned about this aspect.</p>

<p>&quot;In the future, our whole family might go on a hot spring trip, and there will also be school trips in high school. We won't always be able to take baths in our own rooms. If you don't accumulate the experience of bathing with others now, it might become troublesome later on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May... maybe that's true... but, to do it with Aniki...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As your older brother, I'm worried about your future. Maybe I'm meddling too much, but I've decided to lend you a hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... I still can't! If Uncle or Mom finds out...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are we bringing Dad and Mom into this? It's just a small matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is this considered a small matter?!&quot;</p>

<p>Even if they were to find out, I could imagine their reaction.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess Dad and Aunt Miyuki would just think that our bond has become stronger, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no, no, I'm telling you, it's not that simple... If they find out, it won't be good...&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed that Akira was quite particular about this.</p>

<p>But since it wouldn't be good if we got caught, let's just not get caught then.</p>

<p>&quot;Then let's treat it as our (sibling) secret and not let them know. Anyway, Dad won't be coming home today, and Aunt Miyuki will be back very late. It's not a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our (sibling) secret...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. If you really don't want them to know, let's go with that.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira continued to rub his left elbow with his right hand, his face flushed, and finally, he raised his gaze to look at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki... do you like me...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Yeah... of course, I like you.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt that my mood had become strange, but I still answered that way.</p>

<p>Of course, what I meant was &quot;liking you as a family,&quot; without any deeper meaning. But for Akira, it seemed to be important.</p>

<p>&quot;If we get caught... will you take responsibility?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps my way of inviting him was a bit forceful.</p>

<p>But I won't force him. If he doesn't like it, I'll give up...</p>

<p>&quot;Then, alright. If it's just washing each other's backs...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira reluctantly agreed... or rather, he couldn't resist.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I undressed and waited for Akira in the bathroom.</p>

<p>In the literal sense, I'm feeling a bit nervous right now.</p>

<p>My intention, of course, is not only to get closer to Akira, but also to think about his future.</p>

<p>In the past, Akira would run away at the sight of my naked body. If he could develop some immunity through this opportunity, I would be glad.</p>

<p>I covered the front with a towel and sat on the chair in the bathroom with my back towards the entrance. At that moment...</p>

<p>&quot;Um... sorry to disturb...&quot;</p>

<p>The bathroom door opened, and Akira finally entered.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey. We'll start quickly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood....&quot;</p>

<p>Why does he sound so formal? At first, I thought that, but then I realized that Akira must be nervous too.</p>

<img src="http://pic.wenku8.com/pictures/3/3160/131264/170198.jpg">

<p>But as long as everything goes smoothly this time, perhaps we can go to the public bath together in the future or occasionally wash each other's backs at home.</p>

<p>Once humans compromise once, it becomes a habit after the second or third time, and they start thinking, &quot;If it's just this, then it's okay.&quot;</p>

<p>So next time, Akira shouldn't resist like he did today.</p>

<p>While I was thinking about these things, Akira slowly squatted behind me.</p>

<p>The mirror in front of me had already fogged up, so the view behind me was blurry.</p>

<p>But I could easily imagine the expression on Akira's face.</p>

<p>I guess he must be enduring his embarrassment. I'll try to ease his nervousness a bit.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Akira. Have you ever helped someone wash their back before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe when I was little, I helped Dad wash his back...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember how to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't really remember...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then start by scooping water from the bathtub and pouring it over my back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-okay, then...?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira did as I said, holding a basin and slowly pouring water over my back.</p>

<p>&quot;You can pour it all at once, like this, splash&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm, okay...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira continued to do so.</p>

<p>When the hot water rushed over my back all at once...</p>

<p>&quot;Mm... feels so good~!&quot;</p>

<p>My inner thoughts slipped out unintentionally.</p>

<p>&quot;Please! Don't make weird sounds, Aniki!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it feels really good... Don't mind me, just keep pouring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I guess...&quot;</p>

<p>He poured the water a second and third time, and the hot water spread from my back to my whole body.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, now please wash my back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>

<p>I handed Akira the shower gel I usually use.</p>

<p>Then I heard the sound of squeezing the shower gel from behind, followed by the sound of lathering.</p>

<p>&#9472;Is it finally happening?</p>

<p>The long-awaited moment of enjoyment is about to begin&#9472;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, one more time... Ugh ah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Huh? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-hey, Akira, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Did I do something wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After you got the shower gel, you just 'directly used your hands to wash my back'!&quot;</p>

<p>This is not just a minor mistake.</p>

<p>When Akira's hands, soft and full of foam from the shower gel, slid across my spine, all the hairs on my body couldn't help but stand up.</p>

<p>&quot;Because... because I usually wash with my hands...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Sorry, I shouldn't have asked at you... Occasionally, I also wash with my hands, but in these situations, it's usually better to use a washcloth to scrub the back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see... That's right! It did feel a bit weird!&quot;</p>

<p>If that's the case, you should have used the washcloth from the beginning...</p>

<p>&quot;Using your hands to wash? Oh, there's a blue washcloth over there, right? Use that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, okay...&quot;</p>

<p>With the washcloth lathered in shower gel, Akira placed it on my back.</p>

<p>&quot;So, should I start scrubbing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, go ahead!&quot;</p>

<p>As for the strength... it was incredibly gentle.</p>

<p>It felt like he was caressing my back, no different from when he used his hands to wash.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, my back is not that fragile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Can I apply more pressure? This washcloth is as stiff as a scrub brush. Aren't you in pain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I would only feel pain if it were scrubbed until my skin turns red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure it's okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's fine. So, put in some more strength and scrub in one go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, I got it...&quot;</p>

<p>With my back at the center, Akira placed the washcloth below my neck.</p>

<p>And then, using his arm strength&mdash;or rather, putting some of his weight on my back&mdash;he proceeded to...</p>

<p>&quot;Yikes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh wow!&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed that in the moment he exerted force, his hand or foot slipped, and Akira's weight ended up directly on my back.</p>

<p>I tried to support my body from falling forward, barely managing to hold Akira up, but...</p>

<p>...what is this sensation?</p>

<p>I felt something soft collide with my shoulder blades.</p>

<p>That soft thing, along with Akira's weight, pressed against my back, causing the area of contact to expand. However, at the same time, it retained its elasticity. I could feel it resisting, trying to regain its original shape.</p>

<p>In the next moment, as that thing made contact with my back, it separated into two.</p>

<p>When my back registered this series of movements, an indescribable palpitation surged within me.</p>

<p>I couldn't bear that palpitation, and my body leaned forward.</p>

<p>But that only made the situation worse.</p>

<p>&quot;Yikes!&quot;</p>

<p>As I leaned forward, Akira's body pressed even closer to me than before.</p>

<p>And the soft sensation on my back expanded along with it.</p>

<p>At that moment, a revelation... or rather, an overwhelming epiphany...</p>

<p>Knowledge, experience, instinct, imagination, science, mystery... all these things converged in an instant, transforming that indefinite soft object into a clear answer in my mind.</p>

<p>And now, I understood it clearly.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, that thing was none other than a &quot;breast.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira moved away from me, and a brief silence filled the space between us.</p>

<p>It was only when a droplet fell from the ceiling into the bathtub that I snapped back to reality.</p>

<p>&quot;...Um, Akira-sama? May I ask you something...?&quot;</p>

<p>I was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;What, what is it? And why are you speaking so respectfully...?&quot;</p>

<p>Embarrassment and confusion.</p>

<p>I didn't know which came first, but these feelings spread through me like a toxin from the top of my head to the rest of my body. My senses were numbed, and my heartbeat reached its limit.</p>

<p>I struggled to calm myself down first.</p>

<p>After regaining my composure, a question that needed clarification emerged.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry to ask this, but may I inquire... Akira-sama, aren't you not my younger brother, but my younger sister?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as the words left my mouth, everything that had happened from the moment I encountered Akira up until today flashed before my eyes like a revolving lantern.</p>

<p>Looking back, despite finding it incredible, why did I believe that Akira was my younger brother?</p>

<p>When I heard that I would be his &quot;Aniki,&quot; I simply accepted it without hesitation. Even though that was the beginning of my misunderstanding, I wholeheartedly believed it.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I had plenty of opportunities to.</p>

<p>However, I ignored all those clues and only saw the truth I wanted to see, completely believing that Akira was my younger brother.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, because you're so dense,&quot; I suddenly remembered what Dad had said.</p>

<p>No, no, this is not a situation that can be solved by just being dense...</p>

<p>But the answer hasn't appeared yet.</p>

<p>Maybe he's a brother with a developed chest... it's possible.</p>

<p>If only I could hear Akira say, &quot;No way.&quot; But...</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, why are you still asking that now? Why are you being so polite?&quot;</p>

<p>Reality is just too cruel.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm really sorry for all this time!&quot;</p>

<p>I deliberately avoided looking at Akira, cleaned myself in the shower, dried my body in the changing room, and then went out into the corridor.</p>

<p>My heart is still pounding, as if it's going to jump out in the next second.</p>

<p>Later, it seems that Akira also came out of the bathroom, and I heard her dressing up through the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, are you still there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes... I'm still here... I really misunderstood you as my younger brother! I'm so sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>I kept apologizing with my head lowered from behind the changing room door.</p>

<p>There's no room for defense, and I'm so embarrassed that I can't face her.</p>

<p>Talking through the door is already the limit.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... so, you always thought I was your younger brother...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, since I always got the wrong impression anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Got the wrong impression?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's... it's nothing! Anyway, what happened today must not be mentioned to anyone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>

<p>Despite her words, I think Akira must have been greatly hurt.</p>

<p>I feel so ashamed of myself, I went straight to my room and dived into my bed.</p>

<p>Go to sleep...</p>

<p>But I can't sleep when I think back on everything that has happened so far.</p>

<p>How am I going to face Akira from tomorrow onwards...</p>
