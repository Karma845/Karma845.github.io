<h2>Chapter 6: Actually, There was a Huge Misunderstanding, But Now I Know...</h2>

<p>Sometimes, even a massive misunderstanding can go down in history.</p>

<p>For example, in 1492, Columbus discovered the New World.</p>

<p>He initially set out on a western route to India but ended up discovering the New World instead.</p>

<p>However, when he saw the local natives, he not only mistakenly believed he had reached India but also spent his entire life considering the Americas as part of Asia until his death.</p>

<p>The reason why the &quot;West Indies&quot; exist on the Florida Peninsula in the United States, far away from Asia, is because of this.</p>

<p>Or take the year 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell.</p>

<p>East German official Schabowski announced during a press conference, &quot;East German citizens are allowed to legally travel abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>When a reporter asked him, &quot;When will this take effect?&quot; he replied, &quot;Immediately!&quot;</p>

<p>But in reality, he hadn't even attended the meeting that decided on this matter and accidentally disclosed information about lifting the ban before it was officially announced, making statements that differed from government policy.</p>

<p>As a result, people who saw the news flocked to the checkpoints.</p>

<p>The &quot;Wall of Shame,&quot; which had been built overnight, collapsed instantly due to one man's misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This incident is also known as the &quot;most beautiful misunderstanding in history.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the misunderstanding that will remain in my own history... it's the &quot;sibling misunderstanding&quot; that I realized yesterday.</p>

<p>From the moment I first met Akira until yesterday, I mistakenly thought she was my younger brother.</p>

<p>I can't face her now.</p>

<p>If only I had known this fact earlier, more quickly, and correctly!</p>

<p>The next morning, I told Dad and Aunt Miyuki about this in the living room.</p>

<p>&quot;To be honest, I'm not good at history and don't understand much. When I was in middle school, my social studies grade was like a 2...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not good at history either. Mr. Columbus has 'torn cloth' in his name, and I feel sorry for him. And does Mr. Schabowski like summer? Or does he like flying? (Note: This is a pun in Japanese.)&quot;</p>

<p>They couldn't understand what I was saying, to the point of being pitiful. In the end, I shouldn't have mentioned history while explaining.</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn't matter! What's important is Akira, it's Akira! Why didn't you clearly tell me that she's my sister? And also, his name is not Schabonski, it's Schabowski!&quot;</p>

<p>I know I'm just venting my anger. But I can't control the subsequent rage and regret that came rushing in without an outlet.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, I always thought Akira was my younger brother, and that's why I treated her that way...&quot;</p>

<p>It's too late for regrets now, but up until today, I've done many foolish things relying on the belief that she was my younger brother.</p>

<p>No, now I'm not important. Akira is important--</p>

<p>&quot;--Akira, you're not my younger brother but my younger sister, right...?&quot;</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, who in their right mind would ask such a question three weeks later?</p>

<p>When someone is mistaken for their gender, a girl is bound to be deeply hurt.</p>

<p>Although Akira no longer pursues the matter, she must be feeling upset.</p>

<p>Ah, why did I misunderstand? Why did I blurt out those words so casually...</p>

<p>&quot;I was just worried if I had hurt her... I asked her if she was my sister...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, dear, I thought Taiichi had already told you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ryota, you really are clueless...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're the last person who should be saying that! And don't look at me with those pitiful eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ara~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, Ryota... How did you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Ryota, tell us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ryota-kun, tell us.&quot;</p>

<p>Under the relentless questioning of the two adults with cunning smiles, my head was already overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I did indeed do a lot of good things recently, but do I have a way to describe in detail what happened yesterday on the spot?</p>

<p>If one day I were to reveal that I took a bath with Akira and discovered that Akira had breasts, I would definitely be immediately expelled from my home... Even if my mouth were torn apart, I wouldn't be able to say it.</p>

<p>Just when I couldn't find a good excuse to dodge the situation...</p>

<p>&quot;...What are you three talking about, huddled together?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira poked her head out from the living room.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We... um... Ryota was telling us about historical events, um...&quot;</p>

<p>Dad, thanks for backing me up...</p>

<p>&quot;Right, right, so-called 'dark history'?&quot;</p>

<p>...Aunt Miyuki!</p>

<p>&quot;I-I only mentioned Columbus discovering the New World and the fall of the Berlin Wall!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Uhh... I don't quite understand, anyway... Aniki, can you come here for a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>After Akira finished speaking, she grabbed my hand, but even this small gesture made me tremble. I never used to care about it before.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to talk to you upstairs... about something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Ah... um...&quot;</p>

<p>So I followed Akira and left the living room.</p>

<p>As we left, I locked eyes with my parents. Aunt Miyuki secretly sent a message of &quot;good luck,&quot; while Dad looked at me with an expression that said, &quot;You idiot&quot;... Dad, remember this.</p>

<p>Anyway, Akira calling me away at this particular time must be about yesterday's incident...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Akira and I went to the second floor and walked straight into my room.</p>

<p>Akira sat on my bed, and I sat on the chair in front of the desk.</p>

<p>This was the first time we met after taking a bath last night, and even though we were in my own room, it felt very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, what do you want to say? Is it about...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you tell them about what happened during our bath yesterday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you tell them?&quot;</p>

<p>Akira's cheeks turned red as she looked at me suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't mention the bath... I said I only found out recently that you're my sister...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And... I said I might hurt you, so I asked them what to do.&quot;</p>

<p>After a short silence, Akira let out a big sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;That's good...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, I told you yesterday, you must never mention the bath incident! Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And about the thing you were worried about, I actually don't mind that much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? But I've been misunderstanding you as my little brother all this time, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean... no, it's because of my way of speaking and dressing, which doesn't resemble that of a girl at all, that you misunderstood. And also, I agreed to the bath incident, so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You, you're not wrong! I've been living with you for three weeks and didn't notice. It's strange of me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true. Instead of saying it's weird, you could say it's unusual for me, Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Akira smiled helplessly, her words didn't carry any sarcasm.</p>

<p>That made me feel relieved.</p>

<p>I let out a sigh of relief, feeling the fog that had been hanging over my mind gradually dissipating.</p>

<p>&quot;But I still feel sorry, Akira... I don't think the things that happened during this time can be completely erased. But if there's anything I can do, I hope you'll tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...In that case, can I ask you to remain as you are?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'remain as you are'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like playing video games together, borrowing manga from each other, going shopping... just like how you would treat a little brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course. If that makes it easier for you to accept...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I hope you don't become distant with me just because I'm a girl. I liked it how it was before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like how it was before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just like now, Aniki deliberately keeps a distance from me, right? Normally, you would sit closer to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't find the right words to say.</p>

<p>Even if this era doesn't pay much attention to gender, it doesn't negate the fact that the way we treat others can differ depending on whether we're aware of their gender or not.</p>

<p>Some people believe that taking things for granted is a subconscious bias, but I couldn't meet Akira's expectations. In the future, I will unconsciously treat her as a female.</p>

<p>Simply put, I will have concerns. I must have concerns.</p>

<p>For example, I will maintain a certain distance and not suddenly play around with her. That's probably how it feels.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's difficult to go back to how it was before. Even if you're my sister, you're still a girl, and I can't help but be aware of that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then...&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, with a slightly flushed face, Akira grinned and said:</p>

<p>&quot;...As long as the distance between us is closer than it is now, you won't be conscious of my gender, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The distance now...? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The distance right now is neither far nor close, so that's why you see me as a girl and keep your distance, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but even so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, didn't you say it yesterday&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;'I want to continue shortening the distance between us...'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was that a lie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um...&quot;</p>

<p>I could only make a groaning sound.</p>

<p>I never expected that statement to come back like a boomerang at this moment...</p>

<p>&quot;...No, it was not lie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You also said that I can be more casual, but is that only limited to a little brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, even if I'm your sister, you don't have to be so guarded against me, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... that's right...&quot;</p>

<p>I can't do this anymore. All the words I said before are now backfiring on me.</p>

<p>How big of a boomerang did I throw out before...</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, you better treat me well as your little sister. Even though I might look like a little brother.&quot;</p>

<p>As Akira said that, she mischievously smiled.</p>

<p>And to my surprise, my face turned red, and my heart</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm...? Why is your face all red, Aniki?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's nothing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Could it be that you're shy because you think of me as a girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me a break me already...&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing my helpless expression, Akira couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, I'll make you even more accustomed to having me as your little sister!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Accustomed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, come here.&quot;</p>

<p>Akira patted the bed, signaling for me to sit beside her.</p>

<p>Hesitant, I stood up from the chair and followed her instructions, sitting on her left side. The bed creaked under the weight, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. I wondered what she had in mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Akira...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Watch this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woah! Wait!&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, she pushed me down.</p>

<p>Akira swiftly straddled my stomach. The bed made intense creaking sounds under the force.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehehe~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, what are you doing, Akira?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aniki, how does it feel? Are you shy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You, you're just teasing me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not teasing you. This is training.&quot;</p>

<p>I started to worry if our parents on the first floor could hear the creaking of the bed. If they saw us in this situation, it would be embarrassing. Fortunately, I didn't hear them coming upstairs.</p>

<p>Feeling shy, I turned my face toward the wall, but I couldn't ignore the weight on my belly. As Akira's body heat gently reached me, an indescribable sense of embarrassment swept over me.</p>

<p>&quot;...Akira, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, it's training. I want to make you get used to it so you won't be shy even when we do something like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of training...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heave-ho~&quot;</p>

<p>Then Akira started to take off her usual loose clothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you undressing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shh... If you speak so loudly, Mom and Dad downstairs will hear us.&quot;</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of Akira's abdomen.</p>

<p>It was far from the image I had in my mind, with its excess flesh. Instead, it was a fair and slender waistline.</p>

<p>After taking off her top, Akira gently placed it on the floor, looking down at me with a cute appearance wearing only a bra.</p>

<p>From the front, I could see the feminine body features between her delicate shoulders, confirming that Akira was indeed a woman.</p>

<p>When I saw that pair of breasts that could be held in one hand, the sensation I felt in the bathroom yesterday resurfaced on my back.</p>

<p>This is not right. It really isn't...</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Why are you undressing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? It's hot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday, we only had one towel. Compared to that, isn't this much better?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not the issue!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you treated me like this before, Aniki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you referring to the first time we played 'End of the Warrior 2'?&quot;</p>

<p>No, I didn't forcefully push someone down like that. And I didn't undress either.</p>

<p>&quot;That was really an irresistible situation...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you said it with such ill intentions...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>You look really good.</em> You said that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough...&quot;</p>

<p>I remembered that incident once again makes me want to run away.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you remember? And then you went on doing it as if nothing happened, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bro, close your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Akira, you wouldn't...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, stop talking and hurry up...&quot;</p>

<p>Akira reached out with both hands and held my cheeks. I gave up struggling and closed my eyes. And then...</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmph!&quot;</p>

<p>Akira's hands clasped my cheeks.</p>

<p>This revenge was just as I had imagined. My face was sandwiched between Akira's hands, like a cream-filled cookie, just like what I had done at that time.</p>

<p>Akira stared at my strange face without looking away.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... It's not quite what I expected.&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p>Even if a weird face becomes even weirder, the effect wouldn't double because of it.</p>

<p>In that sense, I felt a bit regretful, but at the same time, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>After all, until now, I had been imagining that she would make a more different move.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... Akira, let go of me.&quot;</p>

<p>After Akira released my face, she quietly moved away from my body and sat cross-legged on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;So, how is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you ask like that... I just feel very complicated.&quot;</p>

<p>As I stood up, I answered like that.</p>

<p>Is this what they call being completely clueless? So many things have happened that I'm already used to strange occurrences.</p>

<p>At this moment, Akira looked up at me from below.</p>

<p>&quot;...I thought you were going to kiss me back then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gulp--! Why are you bringing that up now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because that was the situation back then, right? You complimented my appearance and told me to close my eyes. Could it be that Aniki is actually a super macho man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh--! Even though I said those things, I didn't have that intention!&quot;</p>

<p>That's right, from the beginning, I never had that intention. I just wanted to tease her.</p>

<p>Because I misunderstood her as my little brother, that's why I was able to do something like that&mdash;strange, isn't it?</p>

<p>Wait a moment.</p>

<p>Akira probably didn't expect me to do something like that back then.</p>

<p>So why did she close her eyes at that time?</p>

<p>Why didn't she continue resisting?</p>

<p>Why did she raise her lips...</p>

<p>Could it be... No, I must be overthinking...</p>

<p>&quot;Bro, do you think I'm pretty in your eyes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Well, even if it's not just me, anyone would think you're pretty...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what about you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I already said, it's just...&quot;</p>

<p>Our eyes met.</p>

<p>I thought she would have that mischievous expression from earlier, but I didn't expect her to look at me with moist eyes.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were rosy, and at the same time, there was a hint of sadness in her expression, just like a girl. No, she was indeed a girl.</p>

<p>Is this what they call a &quot;subjective impression&quot;?</p>

<p>Ever since I found out that Akira is a girl, I could only see her as a girl. Everything in the past seemed like a painting created using an optical illusion.</p>

<p>Akira was still waiting for me to speak. Even if I wanted to play it cool, her earnest eyes compelled me to speak the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;...Very... beautiful...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What did you just say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said you're very pretty...&quot;</p>

<p>I said it with my back turned to Akira, and she responded contentedly with a &quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, didn't you say that even if I complimented you, you wouldn't be happy...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not true. I'm really happy. I was actually very happy back then...&quot;</p>

<p>This is no good. It's really not good.</p>

<p>The conversation is heading in a very awkward direction.</p>

<p>No matter how good the relationship between siblings is, it shouldn't create this kind of atmosphere&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's how things are, heave-ho!&quot;</p>

<p>This time, she hugged me from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh wow! Akira, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bro, carry me~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's training, I'm telling you. As long as we stick together like this, we'll get used to it quickly, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But this kind of thing should be done gradually and step by step&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were the one who rushed the steps yourself. Why are you saying that now?&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;Afterward, I was really troubled, but luckily, Aunt Miyuki's voice came, saying, &quot;Lunch is ready,&quot; and I was saved.</p>

<p>Compared to our previously hostile relationship, the current situation is much better, but in terms of circumstances, it's really terrible.</p>

<p>New problems have indeed arisen between us.</p>

<p>From now on, I will treat Akira as my little sister.</p>

<p>But I don't know if I can withstand Akira's &quot;training&quot;...</p>

<p>In the past, I constantly threw oversized boomerangs, and now they have all come back to me. If I were to retaliate all at once... Before I develop the habit, there's no guarantee that my rationality won't collapse.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhh...&quot;</p>

<p>That night, I buried myself under the blanket and tossed and turned.</p>

<p>Just the thought that Akira is sleeping in the next room, I'll probably have trouble falling asleep tonight...</p>
