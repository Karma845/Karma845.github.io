<h2>Chapter 8.5: August 25th (Wednesday)</h2>

<p>Today is the opening ceremony for the second semester. I was so nervous that I woke up early.</p>

<p>When I saw students wearing the same school uniform as me on the station platform, I suddenly felt really nervous.</p>

<p>It seemed like Aniki noticed too, but he just walked silently beside me.</p>

<p>After leaving the station, we ran into Aniki's friends.</p>

<p>The older brother Ueda Hikari, a second-year senior, and his sister Ueda Hinata. Hikari was tall and handsome, but his blond hair and earrings made me a little scared. I found it strange, wondering how he became friends with Aniki.</p>

<p>Hinata had a cheerful personality, and she was cute, giving off a girlish vibe. She gave me the impression of being a very astute younger sister.</p>

<p>We exchanged contact information right away and became friends. And to my surprise, we were in the same class!</p>

<p>Practicing self-introductions with Aniki finally paid off, barely passing!</p>

<p>During lunch break, when I was eating lunch with Hinata, people started crowding around us.</p>

<p>I felt really uncomfortable, like a panda at the zoo.</p>

<p>Everyone bombarded us with questions, and I had no idea how to respond.</p>

<p>Just when I didn't know what to do, Aniki came to my rescue.</p>

<p>After school as well, when the scary third-year seniors tried to approach us,</p>

<p>Aniki wasn't afraid at all and directly called them out.</p>

<p>That was the first time I saw such a scary expression on Aniki's face.</p>

<p>It was completely different from his usual demeanor, and it was really terrifying...</p>

<p>But after the third-year students walked away, he gently stroked my head. Aniki was indeed very gentle.</p>

<p>His touch was warm and comforting, making me want to stay by his side.</p>

<p>But is Aniki only gentle to me because I'm his sister? Or is it because I'm a girl?</p>

<p>How does Aniki really see me?</p>
