<h2>Chapter 5.5: August 11th (Wednesday)</h2>

<p>It has been three weeks since I came to this family.</p>

<p>Today, Uncle is not home because of work, and Mom won't be back until late at night.</p>

<p>I had pizza and played video games with Aniki. He said he's happy to be siblings with me.</p>

<p>At first, I thought it would be difficult for me to get along with a boy other than Dad, but when I started to think about it, I realized that it was me who actively approached him.</p>

<p>It feels like a remarkable change.</p>

<p>Aniki said he wants to get closer.</p>

<p>Seeing that Aniki really values me like this, I feel happy and embarrassed at the same time.</p>

<p>But even if we're close, taking a bath together is just weird...</p>

<p>Even though he said it's just washing each other's backs, we're already high school students.</p>

<p>Do normal siblings take a bath together? And we're not blood related...</p>

<p>I found it strange, but now I understand...</p>

<p>I never thought Aniki actually believed I was his younger brother...</p>

<p>Is that even possible? We've been living together for three weeks, is this kind of misunderstanding reasonable?</p>

<p>But even before, I thought Aniki was strange, and now I know for sure that he's just a bit slow.</p>

<p>He's just like Uncle, a person who makes you feel a little sorry. How should I face him with what expression from tomorrow onwards?</p>

<p>Is Aniki disappointed after knowing I'm his younger sister?</p>

<p>Will he be more cautious around me starting from tomorrow?</p>

<p>I don't want that. I want to maintain the current relationship with him...</p>

<p>No, I want to continue to get closer to him...</p>
