<h2>Intermission: Going back a little time, the Story of the Encounter Between Haruto and Iris</h2>

<p>Being embarrassed, she drops her gaze unintentionally.</p>
<p>In there, she realized that she had been holding Haruto&#8217;s hand all this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;——Hiya!?&#8221;</p>

<p>When she hurriedly let go, she put her hand behind her back and hid it.</p>
<p>Haruto, who calmly looks around, seeing Iris changing her facial expression,</p>

<p><em>——This is dangerous, she’s too cute.</em></p>

<p>Thought so.</p>
<p>It was certainly love at first sight.</p>

<p>But until now, he was just being <em>dokidoki* </em>by her appearance. Therefore, in the end, he was able to scoff her as an Absolute, a princess above all. <em>(TN: Heart throbbing, I presume?)</em></p>
<p>But even so——,</p>
<p>When Iris cleared her throat, she had a serious look as if she’s smoothing over it. However, her cheeks are still red.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, I have the responsibility as the Princess of Absolute. Whether you have status, or not, it doesn&#8217;t matter. Well, on you praising me, I&#8217;m glad &#8230;&#8230;. I,it doesn&#8217;t feel bad, but &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Realizing that she was about to derail, Iris panicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Dah</em> no! Let’s see&#8230;&#8230; My mission is to create a country where each and every citizen can live in good health with a smile. My strength as a head magician is not to protect the country, but to protect the people…… wait! What am I meowing about!?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she repeatedly talks, Haruto comprehended Iris’ inner heart, and his desire for Iris grew stronger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been a princess since you were born. You can’t imagine yourself not being like that now, can you.”</p>
<p>“……Not really.”</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris had little distant eyes.</p>

<p>“If, I didn&#8217;t have the status of a princess, or the name of Shylveene &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto is reflected in Iris&#8217; eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The person I like, being able to say that I like him without anyone&#8217;s care&#8230;&#8230;. If I could live like that&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto also, stared at Iris&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p>Before he knows it, his face approaches hers.</p>
<p>They were drawn in.</p>
<p>As if to hold her back, Haruto touches Iris’ upper arm.</p>
<p>Iris puts her palm on Haruto&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>However, they did not push back the other party’s body. The two brought their bodies together.</p>
<p>It felt like they were committing a serious indiscretion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>Don&#8217;t do this.</em></p>
<p><em>If we were discovered, it’ll be a great incident.</em></p>
<p>When such a warning resounds in her head, it vanishes.</p>
<p><em>I knew that this shouldn’t happen within reason.</em></p>
<p><em>However, this impulse cannot be suppressed by reason.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, with this person,</em></p>
<p><em>Based on the ideal of this school, it may be possible to form a friendship bond between Absolute and Blaze.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, perhaps one day, I might be able to walk with this person.</em></p>
<p><em>The day when I can say that I like him, may come.</em></p>
<p>At that time, Hart was also——,</p>
<p>thinking the same thing as Iris.</p>
<p><em>Even if I can’t do it right now, the day will come when I’ll be able to hold hands with Iris.</em></p>
<p><em>It might become possible for us to talk with the exception of using abusive language in public.</em></p>
<p><em>Such a dream, it was about time I could feel that it could happen in reality.</em></p>
<p>But the next moment,</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>Deep inside Haruto&#8217;s body, he had a feeling that something was opening.</p>
<p>Something is hiding behind it, and his magic power overflows.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered when he was a kid.</p>
<p>When his parents were killed—— when he fulfilled his revenge for that.</p>
<p><em>I heard it at the time when flames erupted from this body, that voice,</em></p>
<p><em>That lurks within me,</em></p>
<p>——<em>It’s like the Demon King&#8217;s half body is about to appear.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>No way.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Iris Sylveene &#8230;&#8230; maybe, you too——”</p>

<p>At that time, the grumbling of ground approached.</p>

<p>“——!?”</p>

<p>Faster than they can get ready, the cave begins to collapse from the back.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“Wha!?”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the collapse stopped in front of them. Beyond the pile of rocks, a huge space was emerging.</p>
<p>While the clouds of sand enveloped them, a faint shadow rose from the surface faintly.</p>
<p>It was a figure wrapped in flames, that’s neither a bird nor a beast.</p>
<p>It has bat-like wings and a fierce beast-like body. However, it’s upper body have evolved like that of a human being; it was a bipedal monster with thick, strong arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is &#8230;&#8230; a Balrog*!?&#8221; <em>(TN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog)</em></p>

<p>Level 11 Northern Demon (Tempest)——Balrog.</p>
<p>With a huge weapon which flaunts its strength, its small eyes burning in flames, can overwhelm anyone who sees it. When it spread its wings of flames on its back, the surroundings flared up, and when its tail that looks like a whip flashed, the nearby stalactite became two.</p>
<p>The two pulled out their swords.</p>

<p>&#8220;This dungeon should be for beginners, right? Why is it in a place like this!?&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Balrog is not a monster, that can be defeated by one or two people. At the very least, only a party of five or six skilled magicians can deal with it. Nevertheless, they won’t necessarily always win.</p>
<p>In the past, many heroes who challenged the dungeon have became prey to Balrog.</p>
<p>And although Balrog usually lurks inside the dungeon, once it attacks a town, the town must be prepared for annihilation.</p>
<p>Its flames burn everything down, and all the traces that it passed through would become burnt fields.</p>
<p>Balrog opens its big mouth, and fires a roar that makes their bodies tremble.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrifying murderous advance notice. Spreading its wings, it attacked the two people.</p>
<p>It was the first time for both of them, to face such a strong enemy.</p>
<p>If they want to defeat it, they’ll need to use a high level of magic.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s a super-difficult magic, and it takes time to prepare. No matter how easy it is for the two head magicians to activate it.</p>
<p>But, the Balrog in front of them won&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Haruto held out his sword in his right hand.</p>
<p><em>In a place like this, will I be eaten? </em></p>
<p><em>I went up to becoming a leading magician, and finally, I’m here.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, I will die in a place like this huh.</em></p>
<p><em>I will defeat the empire.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><em>For that reason, I have lived until now.</em></p>
<p><em>However…… right now, more than that——,</em></p>
<p>Haruto stared at Iris who was holding a sword next to him.</p>
<p><em>If I&#8217;m going to be eaten, she&#8217;ll be eaten next.</em></p>
<p>…….</p>
<p><em>I won&#8217;t let it.</em></p>
<p><em>Only that, can never be done!!</em></p>
<p>When Haruto came out in front of Iris, he puts his hand on his own sword, and assembles a magic formula.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’ll buy time! In that gap, you should escape!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;……I understand&#8221;</p>

<p>When a straightforward answer came back to him, Haruto glares at Balrog.</p>

<p>&#8220;About this, don’t mind m——&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Her presence didn’t disappear from behind Haruto. On the contrary——,</p>
<p>Looking back, Iris was holding her sword, and like Haruto, she was preparing for a magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing! Get out quickly!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy me some time to assemble a high-level magic formula, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,you …&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do it? Blaze&#8217;s Leading Wizard&#8221;</p>

<p>She said that, with a broad smile.</p>
<p>It was —— the first time, he saw Iris&#8217; smile.</p>
<p>Haruto clicked his tongue, and turned to Balrog.</p>
<p>Then, he prepares his sword,</p>

<p>&#8220;Child’s play!!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Flames erupted from Haruto&#8217;s whole body.</p>
<p>Sparks flew, and red light illuminated the cave.</p>
<p>The red light of magical power runs around his whole body, and a magic circle emerges at the tip of his sword.</p>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>

<p>As Haruto swings his sword, a trail of flames flies towards Balrog.</p>
<p>The bullet of fire hit its forehead. Balrog raised a scream of agony, and bent its upper body backwards.</p>
<p>The medium-level magic 『Vulcan』, enables long-distance attacks. If he made the same thing and swing his sword with it, he can shoot out a strong flame. It’s possible to fire it just by pointing his sword, but the power of its single shot is low. Instead, it can be fired continuously.</p>
<p>Haruto, using its rapid-fire function, ran through a wide cavity within the cave.</p>
<p>The series of fire bullets, hit the sides of Balrog&#8217;s body one after another. And then, he deliberately hits the rock in front of it to attract its attention, splashing debris with flashy sounds, and smoke.</p>
<p>Like that, he forcibly removed Balrog&#8217;s consciousness from Iris.</p>
<p>Balrog turned its back on Iris, as Haruto aimed.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“!!”</p>

<p>The next moment, Balrog was right in front of him. Waving its strong arms, it tries to rip off Haruto.</p>
<p>He dodged the attack, but this time its tail comes around from behind and attacks him. He turns around and parries it with his sword. And then, he leaps back to gain some distance.</p>
<p>With his sword, he knocked back Balrog’s arms and tail which were quickly chasing after him.</p>

<p>“『Flame』!”</p>

<p>He unleashed a low-level magic, but at that extent, it only deal light damage.</p>
<p>In addition to having high defense and durability, Balrog is a demon(mazoku) of fire. It’s resistant to fire magic. It&#8217;s not compatible with Haruto.</p>
<p>However——,</p>
<p>His flame works on Balrog better than he expected.</p>
<p>He thought that it would attack without even thinking about it, but it displayed a faltering appearance.</p>
<p><em>The power of my magic —— isn’t it higher than usual?</em></p>
<p><em>Then &#8230;&#8230;</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Inside Haruto, the conjecture turns into conviction.</p>
<p>At that moment, white cold air swirled.</p>
<p>The moisture in the empty air freezes, and glittering brilliance swoops down.</p>

<p>“——Snow spirit, queen of freeze, respond to my sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>A spell which is chanted in a beautiful voice was heard.</p>

<p>“——Contain in an innocent and cruel white, pure and gruesome blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; magic power increases.</p>
<p>That sign, was also noticed by Balrog.</p>
<p>Who does it really have to be vigilant about.</p>
<p>Raising a terrifying roar, Balrog turns its head towards Iris.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s too late.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>Under Balrog&#8217;s feet, a blue magic circle floated.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217; eyes glow blue, and her beautiful voice declares the signal of its execution.</p>

<p>“『Ice Explosion』!!”</p>

<p>Balrog&#8217;s body exploded.</p>
<p>A tremendous sound of explosion roared, and shock waves spread inside the cave.</p>
<p>However, there was no fire at all.</p>
<p>Ice instead of flames, white cold air instead of black smoke, and ice crystals instead of sparks, were scattered.</p>
<p>It was, an ice explosion, so to speak.</p>
<p>The ice that spread from Balrog’s inside, turned its body into fine fragments, leaving behind ice which looked like fumes and flames. They were like, ice works of art.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris looked at each other.</p>
<p>The two’s facial expression, was more in surprised and bewildered, than the joy of overcoming the crisis.</p>
<p>Cold sweat flows on Iris&#8217; cheeks.</p>
<p><em>It was too fast for an activation of a high-level magic. </em></p>
<p><em>Moreover, its destructive power, is incomparable to the previous one. </em></p>
<p><em>In addition, when I came in contact with Haruto, that feeling.</em></p>
<p><em>The door at the depths of my body opens, and something other than myself, was trying to crawl out with an enormous amount of magic power. </em></p>
<p>In front of her eyes, Haruto also has a surprise and a serious feeling etched between his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I thought&#8230;&#8230; Iris, you &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>——As I expected.</em></p>
<p>The reality, was more savage than she imagined.</p>
<p><em>For the first time, I had a partner with Blaze who seemed that we could understand each other. </em></p>
<p><em>For the first time, there was a partner where I throbbed.</em></p>
<p><em>It was my first love.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s, why——</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8230;&#8230; the other 『Demon King&#8217;s Half Body (Juliet) 』 , Haruto…… it was you?”</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>Being embarrassed, she drops her gaze unintentionally.</p>
<p>In there, she realized that she had been holding Haruto&#8217;s hand all this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;——Hiya!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Balrog is not a monster, that can be defeated by one or two people. At the very least, only a party of five or six skilled magicians can deal with it. Nevertheless, they won’t necessarily always win.</p>
<p>In the past, many heroes who challenged the dungeon have became prey to Balrog.</p>
<p>And although Balrog usually lurks inside the dungeon, once it attacks a town, the town must be prepared for annihilation.</p>
<p>Its flames burn everything down, and all the traces that it passed through would become burnt fields.</p>
<p>Balrog opens its big mouth, and fires a roar that makes their bodies tremble.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrifying murderous advance notice. Spreading its wings, it attacked the two people.</p>
<p>It was the first time for both of them, to face such a strong enemy.</p>
<p>If they want to defeat it, they’ll need to use a high level of magic.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s a super-difficult magic, and it takes time to prepare. No matter how easy it is for the two head magicians to activate it.</p>
<p>But, the Balrog in front of them won&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Haruto held out his sword in his right hand.</p>
<p><em>In a place like this, will I be eaten? </em></p>
<p><em>I went up to becoming a leading magician, and finally, I’m here.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, I will die in a place like this huh.</em></p>
<p><em>I will defeat the empire.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>For that reason, I have lived until now.</em></p>
<p><em>However…… right now, more than that——,</em></p>
<p>Haruto stared at Iris who was holding a sword next to him.</p>
<p><em>If I&#8217;m going to be eaten, she&#8217;ll be eaten next.</em></p>
<p>…….</p>
<p><em>I won&#8217;t let it.</em></p>
<p><em>Only that, can never be done!!</em></p>
<p>When Haruto came out in front of Iris, he puts his hand on his own sword, and assembles a magic formula.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’ll buy time! In that gap, you should escape!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;……I understand&#8221;</p>

<p>When a straightforward answer came back to him, Haruto glares at Balrog.</p>

<p>&#8220;About this, don’t mind m——&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Her presence didn’t disappear from behind Haruto. On the contrary——,</p>
<p>Looking back, Iris was holding her sword, and like Haruto, she was preparing for a magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing! Get out quickly!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy me some time to assemble a high-level magic formula, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,you …&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do it? Blaze&#8217;s Leading Wizard&#8221;</p>

<p>She said that, with a broad smile.</p>
<p>It was —— the first time, he saw Iris&#8217; smile.</p>
<p>Haruto clicked his tongue, and turned to Balrog.</p>
<p>Then, he prepares his sword,</p>

<p>&#8220;Child’s play!!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Flames erupted from Haruto&#8217;s whole body.</p>
<p>Sparks flew, and red light illuminated the cave.</p>
<p>The red light of magical power runs around his whole body, and a magic circle emerges at the tip of his sword.</p>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>

<p>As Haruto swings his sword, a trail of flames flies towards Balrog.</p>
<p>The bullet of fire hit its forehead. Balrog raised a scream of agony, and bent its upper body backwards.</p>
<p>The medium-level magic 『Vulcan』, enables long-distance attacks. If he made the same thing and swing his sword with it, he can shoot out a strong flame. It’s possible to fire it just by pointing his sword, but the power of its single shot is low. Instead, it can be fired continuously.</p>
<p>Haruto, using its rapid-fire function, ran through a wide cavity within the cave.</p>
<p>The series of fire bullets, hit the sides of Balrog&#8217;s body one after another. And then, he deliberately hits the rock in front of it to attract its attention, splashing debris with flashy sounds, and smoke.</p>
<p>Like that, he forcibly removed Balrog&#8217;s consciousness from Iris.</p>
<p>Balrog turned its back on Iris, as Haruto aimed.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“!!”</p>

<p>The next moment, Balrog was right in front of him. Waving its strong arms, it tries to rip off Haruto.</p>
<p>He dodged the attack, but this time its tail comes around from behind and attacks him. He turns around and parries it with his sword. And then, he leaps back to gain some distance.</p>
<p>With his sword, he knocked back Balrog’s arms and tail which were quickly chasing after him.</p>

<p>“『Flame』!”</p>

<p>He unleashed a low-level magic, but at that extent, it only deal light damage.</p>
<p>In addition to having high defense and durability, Balrog is a demon(mazoku) of fire. It’s resistant to fire magic. It&#8217;s not compatible with Haruto.</p>
<p>However——,</p>
<p>His flame works on Balrog better than he expected.</p>
<p>He thought that it would attack without even thinking about it, but it displayed a faltering appearance.</p>
<p><em>The power of my magic —— isn’t it higher than usual?</em></p>
<p><em>Then &#8230;&#8230;</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Inside Haruto, the conjecture turns into conviction.</p>
<p>At that moment, white cold air swirled.</p>
<p>The moisture in the empty air freezes, and glittering brilliance swoops down.</p>

<p>“——Snow spirit, queen of freeze, respond to my sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>A spell which is chanted in a beautiful voice was heard.</p>

<p>“——Contain in an innocent and cruel white, pure and gruesome blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; magic power increases.</p>
<p>That sign, was also noticed by Balrog.</p>
<p>Who does it really have to be vigilant about.</p>
<p>Raising a terrifying roar, Balrog turns its head towards Iris.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s too late.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Under Balrog&#8217;s feet, a blue magic circle floated.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217; eyes glow blue, and her beautiful voice declares the signal of its execution.</p>

<p>“『Ice Explosion』!!”</p>

<p>Balrog&#8217;s body exploded.</p>
<p>A tremendous sound of explosion roared, and shock waves spread inside the cave.</p>
<p>However, there was no fire at all.</p>
<p>Ice instead of flames, white cold air instead of black smoke, and ice crystals instead of sparks, were scattered.</p>
<p>It was, an ice explosion, so to speak.</p>
<p>The ice that spread from Balrog’s inside, turned its body into fine fragments, leaving behind ice which looked like fumes and flames. They were like, ice works of art.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris looked at each other.</p>
<p>The two’s facial expression, was more in surprised and bewildered, than the joy of overcoming the crisis.</p>
<p>Cold sweat flows on Iris&#8217; cheeks.</p>
<p><em>It was too fast for an activation of a high-level magic. </em></p>
<p><em>Moreover, its destructive power, is incomparable to the previous one. </em></p>
<p><em>In addition, when I came in contact with Haruto, that feeling.</em></p>
<p><em>The door at the depths of my body opens, and something other than myself, was trying to crawl out with an enormous amount of magic power. </em></p>
<p>In front of her eyes, Haruto also has a surprise and a serious feeling etched between his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I thought&#8230;&#8230; Iris, you &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>——As I expected.</em></p>
<p>The reality, was more savage than she imagined.</p>
<p><em>For the first time, I had a partner with Blaze who seemed that we could understand each other. </em></p>
<p><em>For the first time, there was a partner where I throbbed.</em></p>
<p><em>It was my first love.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s, why——</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8230;&#8230; the other 『Demon King&#8217;s Half Body (Juliet) 』 , Haruto…… it was you?”</p>
