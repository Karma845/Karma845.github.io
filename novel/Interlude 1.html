<h3>Interlude &#8211; My Daily Routine</h3>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, Akari, Welcome home. It seems that your brother would be late today, so let’s finish this meal first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I got home, my mom, who was preparing dinner, told me so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The lights in the bathroom were on. I thought that Onii-chan had come back and he’s in the bath. But… It was my father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Fuh, I don’t care.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I responded with no interest. Actually, I’m somewhat interested in these affairs, but I have to act indifferent in front of mom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have to put up with it for the success of that said plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“As usual. I thought you used to be so close.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I remembered those old days when I was in elementary school. Certainly, at that time, I was always following Onii-chan without hiding my all-time love for him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">……. But.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Mom! It was used to be and this is now. It will be weird if we always stay close.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&ndash; it’s not normal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I added the latter part of the sentence I had said with a disgusted look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yes, it’s not normal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s not normal for siblings to stay close with each other and love their brother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m sure my mom is most probably worried because we’re not really that friendly with each other. She must be wondering why can’t we just get along.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But that’s exactly my plan, and it’s going well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have to act “normally” to carry out the plan. That’s it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After finishing the meal, I returned to my room and opened the drawer to write today’s “Onii-chan Note”. An important notebook that has been indispensable for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…… That’s right, mom said that Onii-chan would be late today, so let’s reread the plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">An important plan that will determine our future. Failure is not an option.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I took out the ‘PLAN’ notebook, which I usually hide at a different place, and decided to reread it several times this time now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wait a little more….. Onii-chan …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I imagine the future of the successful plan, and I feel relieved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So far, everything is going well. After this, I would just have to wait for graduation…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I was fantasizing about the future, I heard someone climbing upstairs and the next room opening a door. It would seem that my brother is back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then, I put the notebook on the desk and hurriedly turned on the laptop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I clicked on the video application software.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Of course, the video is streaming from Onii-chan’s room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Also, I clicked on the audio application. I had to buy a new microphone because the sound quality was poor with a hidden camera.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm … I’m tired today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I can hear his voice through the headphones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yeah, to be honest, it was financially difficult for me. But I’m glad that I bought it. His voice makes my heart flutter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">……. I’m so innocent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii-chan, today also you’re wonderful….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Usually, at school, I have no chance to see my brother. At least we can eat together at home. And now, I can look at him as much I want. But only through the laptop screen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That’s why this moment is a blessing. After this, I decided to do “another daily routine” while observing Onii-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hn~…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I move my body to the bed and put my right hand further down the lower abdomen &ndash; a secret place that no one has seen yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This sensitive area is so wet that I could see through the cloth. The aching of my lower body doesn’t stop. It’s feeling so hot that It won’t cool down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And with the other hand, I gently fondle with my chest. Because I know doing so will make me feel good.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Un~.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have to keep it down so that he won’t hear it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My face is hot. And even without looking in the mirror, I can sense that my ears are flushed red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I can’t show this to Onii-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii~… chan~ …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Without any knowledge, Onii-chan is using his cell phone as usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">For some reason, such a figure feels sexually adorable. I want more pleasure with my fingertips.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Kuchi~yu….. and with a small sound, the fluid splurts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It is flowing and making my fingers wet, and then I can feel it’s stickiness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“~~Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s like an electric current running all over my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I keep rubbing and rolling my fingers around it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wish these were my Onii-chan’s hands. While imagining about that,</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I dream of being attacked by him. This feeling gradually pushed something out of my body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“……Ah~n………..”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My body trembles in response to the pleasure that reached its maximum. I can’t keep my voice suppressed, and it leaked out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hah~~ Hah~~.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">On the screen, Onii-chan didn’t seem to care about this room. I made a small sound, but he didn’t notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After this, I lay on my bed and looked at Onii-chan so that I could rest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari, are you awake?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I heard my mother’s voice from the other side of the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">……… is that mom?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I wonder if you’ve already fallen asleep …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This is bad. If mom comes in right now, I am screwed!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It will worsen if she sees my current state, and much worse if she saw what was on my laptop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I’m awake!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I replied in a hurry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have to prevent her from entering the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, you’re awake. I am done with the bath. Akari, you should hurry up as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And, after this, my mother went downstairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…… Haa! It was a bath!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My excitement cools down completely, and my body regains its posture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, let’s take a bath and go to bed …</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I turned off the laptop and left the room.</span></p>
