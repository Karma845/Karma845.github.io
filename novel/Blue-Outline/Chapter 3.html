<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Art Emanates From Pain and Sadness</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A few day have passed since my last contact with Utako.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The graduation ceremony for the third year was two weeks away, but I was still too devastated to feel anything about it. Going to school was a chore, everything was a chore.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Heartbreak was a common occurrence in this world, and yet, I never knew it would leave such a hole in my heart. Why was it so strange that other classmates could go about their daily lives like nothing had changed?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My unreasonable anger towards the class increased. Couldn’t stand being there no longer, I malingered for the first time.</span></p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was laying sideways, spacing out, doing nothing when I heard Yuri’s voice. Probably a hallucination. Just how insane could I be, thinking about her even while doing nothing. I was just imagining things, I convinced myself as I plugged my ears with my earphones.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I mean, Komiya wasn’t feeling well so he left early, didn’t he? Let’s just hand him the printouts and go home, barging in seems rude…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That’s why we’re going to use the word ‘visit’. He can’t just chase his concerned friends away, can he?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Could you stop using the word “visit” as an excuse for trespassing? And why was I hearing Seino’s voice too? I pursed my mouth into a line. No, I wasn’t hearing things, I became sure the moment I heard the thudding of their ill-mannered footsteps.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I realized it too late.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hey! Sousuke! I’m here to visit!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri happily intruded with a vehemence that I couldn’t believe she was visiting an ill person. They were both in school uniforms, so they must have come straight from school.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;“How is this a ‘visit’? Any consideration for the sick?” I asked.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Aren’t you feigning it anyway? Even when you are really sick, no matter how much you look like a corpse, you won’t go home until someone tells you to. How good it is, to be such a serious guy. No one suspects a thing&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri sat down on the bed without even asking, her mouth quirked. I ignored her and offered Seino a cushion for her to sit on the floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What’s there to be cheerful about? Yuri, now with Utako gone, don’t you feel anything?” I growled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ha? That was quite a shock. But yeah, being all depressed isn’t the only way to express loneliness, right? I think she would prefer it better if I’m doing fine. Why would she want us to be gloomy?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her argument was reasonable, a rare thing from Yuri. While I was regretting how I tried to force Yuri to share my despair, Seino pulled out a DVD from her bag.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I recorded that Fishermen episode. Yuri suggested we watch it together so I burned it on DVD,” she explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Umm, what year is this? And wouldn’t TV shows like this recorded on Youtube??]</b></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Why do you have to burn it? Wouldn’t it be easier if we go to your house instead?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Marina’s house is far from school, right?” interrupted Yuri, “How lucky, Sousuke. Chew on this blissful experience of having two highschool girls coming to your room, will you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She smirked as she reached for my shoulder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Whatever with Seino, but you’re not a girl, Yuri.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I shook off her hand and went to the living room. There, Gram was watching TV while sipping a cup of water.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Gram, what did I say about letting Yuri in?” I demanded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I didn’t let her in myself. Yu-chan said she’s here by your promise.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Although we had known each other for a long time, letting a rascal like her in without a shred of doubt was one of my grandmother’s bad habits. I worried about her being too nice and letting a real robber in someday, but didn’t have the energy to talk back. I quietly poured three cups of coca and some snacks, put it on a tray, and went back to my room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To them, my room was like a shared property, so they were familiar with operating the devices in the room.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Feeding the DVD Seino burned to the player, the Fishermen’s lively introductory talk appeared on the TV screen.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m skipping here&ndash;” Seino fidged the remote control to fast-forward and pressed the play button.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She then stopped when the Fishermen’s procession reached the snow sculpture area. Seeing the sculptures again made me reminisce about the hard work and the sense of accomplishment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Look, Sousuke! We’re on screen!” screamed Yuri.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m watching, I’m watching,” I sighed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Just like how I remembered it, Yuri babbled on, then I did a follow up. I didn’t really care about being on screen, the concerning part was&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Utako&ndash;! How are you doing? I know you’re quite busy, so good luck in Tokyo&ndash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My heart skipped a beat. Then I remembered her last words before hanging up.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Only if we hadn’t been caught on camera at that moment, she might still be here. Her mother wouldn’t care about us, the promise would still be there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Unending torrent of “only ifs” gnawed at my thoughts. I couldn’t stand it anymore and looked away.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri then spoke to me, as carefree as ever, “Damn&ndash;, I’m a national celebrity! Hey, Marina, burn them for us later, will you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">This was my fault too, so holding a grudge against them was wrong. Yet… how do I suppress this foul emotion?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sorry. But can’t you two go home today?” I cut out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ha? What are you talking about?” In contrast to Yuri who tilted her head, puzzled, Seino started to clean up as if she had figured something out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Let’s leave. There’s a saying that men tend to hold onto things. He must be devastated, let’s leave him alone. And Komiya, that DVD is yours. Cheer up, yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her guess was near the mark, not too far nor too close. Since the conversation came this way, I bid my thanks and leave it at that.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ehhh? I thought being with us would sweep any worries away&ndash;” Prodded by Seino, Yuri left the room reluctantly with a pout. But when Seino disappeared down the corridor, she turned back to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Say, Sousuke. What are you going to do from now on? If you’re not picky, I have tons of options for you. The best one being to track Utako down, break in, and abduct her. How’s it?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri wasn’t someone who reads the air nor someone who knows how to console. It was easy for someone who knew nothing of her circumstances like her to say that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Like we could do that in the first place.” I ought to quip something witty, but I wasn’t in the mood to.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m joking&ndash;. But I’ll help if you want to.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“When it’s from your lips, I just couldn’t take it as a joke.” I sighed exasperatedly, then scratched my cheek. “Yuri, what would you do in times like this&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I found myself unconsciously asking her for advice, hastily, I shut my mouth.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Seino was right, I was holding onto a lot of things, but how could I ask Yuri of all people for advice? I won’t admit this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What’s it? Say it to the end, will you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Nothing, just go, will you?” I shooed her away with my hand. But she came to me and landed a body blow before leaving. I crumpled to the ground, arms cradling my stomach. Still groggy from the relentless blow, I ran my thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I needed to move on. Being all depressed, glooming, I was sure that the current me wasn’t who Utako fell in love with. She wanted us to forget her, to return to our normal lives.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“A great artist would turn heartbreak into a work of art…” I remembered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was going to be a painter. If that was my dream, then I need to turn this harrowing experience into an art.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I rose, put the DVD into a case, and tucked it away in a half-concealed cabinet that I use for storing obscure DVDs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"><br class="calibre8" />
</span><span class="calibre6">Spring, the time of the year that everyone starts changing and adapting to a new environment. Hokkaido too, despite the unforgiving cold, signs of spring began to appear.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Sugawara-senpai and other third year students had graduated, and when April came, I would become a third year.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But no matter how much time passed, I couldn’t bring myself to draw again.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had never missed a single club activity, I even stayed until the very end of every day, so it was natural for the advisor, Hiiragi-sensei, to notice that something was off. After a week of absence, I was summoned by Sensei.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Why have you stopped coming? With that hollow gaze and dismay on your face, you’re not drawing at home too, right?… A slump?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">At the room next to the art club, the art preparation room that Hiiragi-sensei occupied as his private room without any permission. The room waffled with the pungent aroma of curry that made it obvious that he had it for lunch. With his arms crossed, he stared at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Isn’t it too much for someone ordinary like me to use the word ‘slump’? But yes, I can’t bring myself to draw. Heartbreak’s the reason.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t care what he thought of me, he could think of me as someone who had given up to despair as much as he wanted, but that one word at the end made me wince.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t know what he thought of my action, but he let out a short sigh.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“It would be unthoughtful of me to intrude, if it involves your romantic affairs, but if you don’t feel like drawing, why don’t you trace your own step, rediscover the joy when you first draw. Remember drawing doodles with crayon as a kid, it was supposed to be fun, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Sensei looked at me with the same stern piercing gaze that Yuri sometimes used. That gaze was as rattling as ever, unconsciously, I cowered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I galled at how he talked philosophy yet understanding nothing of what I have been through. I hated it when those people with the title of “genius” sympathized with ordinary people with a knowing look on their faces.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You yourself know that I don’t draw just for fun, you said that yourself. And besides me there’s Yuri… There’s a genius next to me. No matter what I do, I’ll always be jealous of her, no matter how much time passes, I’ll still be her inferior.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I regretted it as soon as it left my mouth, but Hiiragi-sensei just lifted the corners of his mouth as if he could see through me. “I haven’t talked about Kashiwazaki even once. Isn’t the one who’s always overly conscious of her you?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I bit my lips. Why was I always like this? Getting too conscious of her and ending up losing myself, embarrassment made me turn my face away guiltily. Hiiragi-sensei patted my head lightly, but his reply was unusually stern.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“If you stop drawing, then you will be an even more ordinary person. If Kashiwazaki is really a genius, then a day would come when she returns to drawing again, no matter what the reason is. If you want to surpass her… Then this is not the time to stop.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A lone Japanese man in the middle of Paris, painting for a living. Just how many hardships he came across, I couldn’t even imagine it. When I looked up, he had already resumed his usual aloof grin. I wonder how much struggle he had seen, how much pressure he had been carrying with that slender body of his.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The same for Yuri, even with the world roaring her praise, she might have her own struggles. Maybe it was time to stop the prejudice and start looking at her properly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But whether I could draw or not, that was another matter, though.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After being beaten by Hiiragi-sensei’s logic, I exhausted myself by swinging my head around, getting my brain to work. But I arrived at a conclusion that I need to talk about this with her head-on, no matter how overwhelmingly tiresome she might be.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Whether Senpai or Yuri, I’m not quite sure who this “her” and “she” is too]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The reason for this is quite clear. Sugawara-senpai was the model for my painting for the Kouji</span><span class="calibre6"> Exhibition Competition, so to speak, she was the person most concerned. I’m accountable for not being able to paint anymore.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I thought going to her instead of calling her was the least I could do as a courtesy, so I went to Sapporo and waited for her shooting to finish. Afterwards, we went to a nearby café. With a table in between, we faced each other.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m sorry for barging in so suddenly. I had something I needed to break it to you, thank you for your time,” I opened.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“The last time I saw your face was at the ceremony, hmm&ndash; Well, that was a blur, and I’ve been busy with work since then, so I don’t have the time. But I’m happy to hear from you that you wanted to see me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Maiei High graduation ceremony took place on March 1th. At that time, Senpai was flocked by her fans, hardly a place to talk. According to a kouhai, her personal belongings were stripped, not even a single ballpoint pen left behind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Maybe it’s because you’ve graduated, or maybe it’s my first time seeing you photo shooting… You’re extra mature today, Senpai,” I complimented.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Fufu, really? Until now, I’ve lots of things I want to talk to you about. But… I’m sure you’re not here just to chat with me, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The fists on my lap clenched.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes…Actually…” I muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">About how I couldn’t paint her portrait, not even a single sketch now, about how I don’t feel like drawing and it’s cause, my parting with the girl I loved&mdash; Utako, I told her the whole story.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">While she may be wearing her makeup since she came here right after work, she wore plain clothing as a disguise, yet she couldn’t hide the shimmering aura of hers. Against her, my explanation seemed like an excuse. I felt ashamed at how evident my pettiness was.</span></p>

<p>After listening to the whole thing silently, Senpai took a sip of her caffe latte.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“But the competition you’re aiming for is due at the end of this month, right? Will you finish in time?” asked Senpai, concerned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I looked away. The deadline was three weeks away, only the rough sketch was finished. If this continued, then I would be disqualified.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What will you do? The competition, you’re giving up? Didn’t you say that you would repay me with the results, that you would do your best?” demanded Senpai.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">While her words sounded harsh, her tone was gentle. I could tell that she was worried about me and was&nbsp; trying to reinvigorate me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I don’t want to give up… But I have never been like this before. I don’t know what I should do.” I professed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t want Senpai to worry about me any more. I wanted to smile and say “I’m fine”, but distraught overwhelmed me, I couldn’t keep my composure any longer. All I could come up with was a stupid excuse. Ashamed, I looked away.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hey, Sousuke. Look at me properly.” She cupped my cheeks and forced me to look at her, her eyes a fiery fervor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The blinding brilliance distinct to the “geniuses” of hers made me feel dizzy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Originally, I was going to use you to make Yuri draw me. But that’s not the case anymore. From the bottom of my heart, I genuinely want you to paint me.” Her eyes still burned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Why? I was given the best of appreciation by someone who had it all like her, yet can’t bring myself to paint. I could only clench my fists harder as vexation and shame assailed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Objectively… It’s just a normal heartbreak, every day, someone experiences it. Yet… I’m going to be a painter, so I need to meld even the worst of heartache into my art. Yet… I can’t draw… I’m disillusioned. I now realize my worthlessness.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The difference in skill between me and Yuri made me despair. Even though it was hard, even though I wanted to cry, I kept on drawing day after day like an idiot.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yet now, I just couldn’t bring myself to paint. Now that Utako, my sole consolation was gone, my motivation, ambition, and hope vanished with her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Being that loyal to someone you love, doing everything with determination, Sousuke, you’re not worthless. But… Your promise to Utako-chan is more important than to me?” she asked.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was at loss at the unanticipated question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No… It’s not something to compare in the first place,” I stalled for time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll change the question then. To you, Utako is more important than anything, right? That’s why you lose the will to draw when you lost her, you’re suffering because you can’t forget her? Am I wrong?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">No. That was right. When she put it into words, happy memories, painful goodbyes flooded me at once. Floundering about in the crashing waves of memories, my silence continued.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But Senpai did not look at my good-for-nothing me with disappointment, nor judging eyes, nor cursed at me, just gently removed her hands from my cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“If that’s the case, then I’ll help you get on your feet. I’ll become the woman you need, I’ll be someone indispensable.” Her eyes glinted gallantly as hers held mine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No, you don’t have to go that far, there’s no need for you to. I’ll find a way myself, that’s why&ndash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“A need to? This is what I want to do. If you look happy, then I do too. I told you before, didn’t I? But if this continues, you won’t be happy ever again. You were serious about drawing, there might be some hardships along the way, but your face was livelier than ever… I want to see that Sousuke again.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I hurriedly averted my eyes away as Senpai tried to hide her moist eyes behind the gaudy glasses. But the skirt covering her long legs rustled as she rose. Before I could call out to her, she left the store, leaving bills enough to cover for two people.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Compared to Senpai who was already earning money on her own, I couldn’t help but feel miserable.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I already knew that I couldn’t leave things like this even before being told by Hiiragi-sensei and Senpai.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I took a deep breath and flipped my sketchbook open. I wasn’t showing this to anyone, so there’s no need to put in much effort. Just a doodle as a breather, I told myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Draw. Just draw. I grabbed the pencil.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I tried to draw animals and people at random, but I couldn’t get the lines right. I tried to replicate the beds and desks in my room, but the pain at the back of my eyes made my hand freeze.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The fact that I couldn’t draw drove me to an edge. I lost the sense of time and stared at the sketchbook until dawn. The frustration made me start hating drawing itself. There were times when I thought painting was painful, but never something like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Aah, yeah. Yuri told me this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Um, Sousuke, why are you usually drawing with a frown?” was it?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even I, just another highschool student who fancied drawing, became this miserable when I realized I couldn’t draw as I envisioned. How would those major artists or geniuses even feel when they have an art block?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">No, geniuses like Yuri won’t get into that situation in the first place. Wasn’t that precisely why they were called geniuses, because they weren’t bothered by something like this?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As I began to formulate my own speculations like that, I scratched my head and let out a sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Ah, there I go again. Yuri’s words, her face. No matter how I struggled, I would always be bound by a chain called Yuri. I was desperately trying to break free, but it just restrained me more and more as the years passed.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">How long did I have to keep chasing after her?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Was it from the stress of being unable to draw? Or was it my body breaking down from lack of sleep? My thoughts deteriorated. I looked outside, the still dark sky swallowed the morning star, just like how life took Utako from me.&nbsp;</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The next night, my hand froze momentarily when an unexpected call suddenly came in. After a deep breath, I press the answer button.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">[TN: sorry for the interruption, but it seems that my chapters are stolen again. To support me, please read on Travis Translation.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hello?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Ah, Sousuke? I’m going to walk the runway at the Kanto Girls Collection on March 17, and I want you to watch me. I’d love to have you come to the show, but it’s on short notice and the tickets are sold out, so you’ll have to watch the online streaming. I’m going to send you the ticket, enter the serial number written there into the link I’m going to send, okay?” Her explanation gave me no time to refuse.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Unprepared against the torrent of instructions, my brain slowly processed. The unfamiliar terms were just simply too much.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“W-wait a minute please,” I spluttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“I thought about it a lot, about what I should do so my words could reach you, about how to convey this. But I’m on the ‘talented’ side, I can’t truly understand your struggles. That’s why… But I want you to watch me, I want you to see my cheer of encouragement to you, Sousuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And even before I could reply, Senpai hung up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was astounded at how I had only been able to say four words during the entire conversation as the ticket appeared on my screen.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had assured Senpai that I could get back on my feet on my own, but had ended up like this. If the problem was so ingrained that I couldn’t handle it on my own, then should I stop being stubborn and just accept the given kindness?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The Utako in my memory urged me on. For a little while, I felt optimistic.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The Kanto Girls Collection was streamed in real time, from 12:00 to 18:30. Ten minutes before the start, I waited in front of the computer. I felt that watching the show without proper knowledge would be disrespectful to Senpai, so I had been researching a lot about fashion events.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To put it simply, it was an event where models wear fashionable casual clothing on stage to pique the audiences’ interest and offer the very same clothes both online and onsite. The event was very popular among young girls since the models were popular models from magazines and celebrities. The event also featured famous artists doing live performances during intermission too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In the meantime, a flashy intro clip played and the show finally began. Models walked the runway as the audience cheered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Wow, it’s the actress Sakira Irie! And there’s Aki from Marunouchi 35!” The excitement of seeing famous actresses and idols appearing one after another made me hollered. Across the screen, I could see them walking confidently on the stage in their gorgeous dresses.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Then I realized that Senpai must compete with these people, despite it being none of my concern, I began to worry about Senpai. Even though she was said to be the most beautiful girl in Maimori and had considerable experience as a model, the industry was still easy on her because she was just a highschool student. Now, in the wider world, would she be alright?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was concerned about such things when she appeared. My eyes widened the moment I focused on her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her black one-piece dress, belonging to a certain brand’s new item, was encrusted with sparkling embedments. There was no particular explanation, but from the way Senpai walked and the expression on her face, I immediately recognized it as a space-themed dress.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre5">[TN: The same scene as in the character introduction illust]</strong></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Seeing her walk down the runway with such charm and charisma while being hailed by countless spectators made me ascertain that this was not the time for an ordinary person like me to stand still.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&mdash;If you want to come to this side, then move fast.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was as if Senpai had said that. She wasn’t just telling me to cheer up or to work hard, those words could never reach me. Instead, amid the eyes of the world, on such a stage, she sent me a silent encouragement…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;Fierce, determined… She was the coolest woman I had ever known.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Amongst a crowd of distinguished women, her presence was preeminent. Seeing how she shined, I became certain.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My petty grievances were nothing but rude to her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She was definitely going to become one of those accomplished people.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The excitement and gratitude was so overwhelming that I can’t help but want to talk to Senpai immediately.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But the Senpai at Tokyo was probably busy with the afterparties and such. So I stared at my phone, hesitant. As if she could read my mind, she called me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hello, Senpai? I watched the stream! You were really cool!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">There were so many things to say, yet I just said what a typical fan might say. At the realization, I blushed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She giggled and said, &ndash;“Thank you…I’m going to say something a little embarrassing, but please listen.” She took a breath. &ndash;“I like you, Sousuke. Let’s go out.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The word rang in my ears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wasn’t that insensitive guy, so I had a suspicion that she might have feelings for me. But I couldn’t be sure about it, not until now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My heart thrummed. A woman that beautiful fell for an ordinary untalented guy like me, there was no way I wasn’t grateful. Besides, I was sure that if I went out with her, there would be tons of fun and exciting things in store for us. We might fall out sometimes, might encounter some trouble along the way, but she would surely take me to a world far away from this despair.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In contrast to her bold confession, slight trepidation tinted her voice. For the first time, I felt apprehension from Senpai who was always overflowing with confidence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was sincerely grateful for how she inspired me, how she gave me the courage to face this problem. Her confidence, her maturity and her kindness befitting a senpai. That was why I admired her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Having someone as beautiful, kind, and popular as Senpai as my girlfriend would surely make everyone jealous. Perhaps she would even unbind me from the sense of inferiority I had been harboring toward Yuri.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But still, the answer was already decided.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I took a deep breath and squeezed out my own feelings. “The answer you’re looking for, I can’t give you that. I still love Utako.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Senpai was charming. That was exactly why I needed to be sincere to her. Even though her mother forced us to cut ties, there was no way I could forget about her right away. And no matter how bad things were, I didn’t want to choose the easy way out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A clear refusal against her direct affection.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">How much of a shock that must be for Senpai, how much I had hurted her feelings, I couldn’t possibly know.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I neglected Utako’s situation, and I would repeat the same mistake again if I didn’t change. I was too focused on drawing and Yuri. Did I even have the qualifications to like someone, or was I good enough for someone to like me?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But still, I chose Utako. I chose to continue liking her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“If I am the girl who said, ‘Okay, I get it.’ here, then I wouldn’t have come this far.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Contrary to my expectectation, Senpai sounded the same as that time when I first turned down her offer to be my model.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The image of Senpai proclaiming that she hates losing was so impressive I still remember to this day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">&mdash;Really? That’s fine for now. But keep in mind that I hate losing. I’ll definitely win you over sooner or later.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If she was meaning the same thing as then, then…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;”Sousuke, are you listening?” Her voice pulled me back to reality.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ha! yes! I’m listening!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was glad this was a phone call. Had this been in person, I would have provided her another topic for her to tease me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“My fans are not just young girls, I have about three hundred thousand followers on SNS. By my manager’s estimation, that number would double within a year… That’s how much fans I have, and will have in the future. But from the countless people who like and choose to support me, only you are special to me. That’s why… Sousuke, have confidence in yourself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Encouraging words that made me happy like this surely wouldn’t come around often.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The sensation ran through me, coursing through my veins just like oxygen as my heart pounded at the joy of being acknowledged. The realization hits me that this feeling is one of the greatest forms of happiness. All of my instincts screamed and commanded me, ‘It’s not too late. Keep her by your side and ask for her support.’</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The hand gripping the phone tensed as there was something I needed to tell Senpai, even if the earth were to end in a minute, I must say this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thank you, Senpai, for the whole runway thing. I now realized that it’s not the time for an untalented average guy like me to stand still. Even though you are talented, you aim high and spare no effort in accomplishing it. Seeing you using your talent to the fullest, I can’t help but admire you… You’re hella cool.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After being encouraged by such an amazing woman, how could I not try to change things? That was why I needed to tell her, despite being unable to answer her romantic feelings, I felt a heartfelt respect for her.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Among the things I have heard, this one made me happy the most. Thank you, Sousuke!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her voice was so bright I could imagine her smile.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After watching Senpai’s show, it was as if my heart was lit on fire, I was sure that I could draw now. But it wasn’t enough. To break out of my shell, there were problems that I could no longer avoid.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">First was Utako. Losing her was like losing my backbone, I needed to do something about it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">There was no other way but to reexamine how much I cared about her and how much she had supported me, and to rebuild myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And the other&mdash;my nemesis, Yuri.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But to purge myself of accumulated jealousy and sense of inferiority, it took a lot of courage and determination, and there was also a sense of resistance.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But outside the window, the stars shone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even though we had drifted apart, as long as the stars shine in the night sky, Utako would never fade from my memory. Even if I lose sight of myself, I could continue fighting with all my might, knowing that I have a place to return to.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wished nothing from the stars. I just want them to watch over me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Looking up at the clear, starry sky of Maimori that Utako had praised, I decided.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Tomorrow, I will face those blue eyes head-on.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It seemed that I was an unlucky guy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Really? Why heavy snowfall today…”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The next morning, as I was about to go to school, I was appalled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was a complete mess outside. Snowstorms weren’t an unusual sight in Hokkaido, but to me who wanted to go to school and talk to Yuri as soon as possible, this was the worst timing.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I finally reached the classroom, it was quieter than usual. There were two reasons, the first first was that most of the students were not here yet, and second was that the boisterous lass wasn’t around.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm, Yuri’s absent today?”&nbsp; I called out to Seino, she was sitting alone, swiping her phone.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I got a message from her. She’s too lazy to come in this storm. Thankfully, I can finally spend a morning in peace,” she answered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“…Are you kidding me? She’s annoyingly loud every morning and when I want to talk to her she just skips school…” I muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As I began to sulk, I felt that it didn’t hold water.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yes, coming to school today was a pain, and for her to think about skipping school was natural. No, it was nature’s providence for her to think like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">However, her mother was the exact opposite of her, someone who was strict with herself and others. That said, she was oftentimes pushed around by Yuri, but she did her best to raise Yuri into a decent human being. That was why Yuri malingering made no sense, her mother would never let her do that. It was also impossible for her to pretend to go to school and sneak back home, since her mother had already quitted work and became a housewife.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Then again, there was my house, which was close to hers. To make matters worse, the only person there was my easy to fool grandmother. This was a simple deduction that one didn’t have to be a great detective to figure it out.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I have an errand to do, I’ll skip today.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hm, got it. You’re always so uptight, yet sometimes you do something incredibly stupid, huh? I kinda like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah. I also like how you never abandon your friends no matter how stupid they are.” I turned to the door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That was a conversation that could only be done between us, friends who harbor no romantic feelings for each other. Friendship between male and female, Seino made me believe it was possible.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I must have seemed crazy, turning around and heading back into the storm again like this. But my eagerness to talk with Yuri won over. To me, the storm hardly seemed to bother.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had already malingered twice already this year. And now I was going to get the title of hardworking honor student stripped as I accelerated into a mad charge down the hallway.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I walked silently against the headwind. I wanted to walk faster, but the wind hindered my progress, buffing my every step like minions of the Demon King.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Isekai anime reference, I guess?]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I finally arrived at my house, I brushed the snow off my body in the windbreak and opened the front door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m home!” I announced.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Confirming the presence of the familiar pair of boots, I stopped at the living room before going to my room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Gram! What did I say about letting Yuri in? Don’t just let Yuri in!” I chided</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, it’s so cold outside. I can’t leave her like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Was it unreasonable to trust her in guarding the house? She didn’t even say anything about me returning home at this time. Maybe I should stop complaining and move on to pressing matters.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">At least for today, good job, Gram.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri’s in my room, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I set off for the stairs as she nodded. Before I could catch my breath, I threw the door open.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“…Oh my, how rude. Knock properly when you’re entering a room, knock.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Shut up, trespasser. And that’s my line.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri sat on the bed possessively as she glared at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Your room doesn’t smell like oil paint,” she sniffed, “It was hard to believe the rumors, but it appears to be true. The one who tells me to draw quits drawing instead. What do I call this? Frisbee?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Boomerang…” I corrected, “ You already know that, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Stop whining about your broken heart and draw. What’s left if you stop drawing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">You’re saying that? That was the last thing I wanted her to say.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Against the inciting manner, I simply let my anger flare. It was as if my blood was boiling.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Stop whining? You know how much I love her, don’t you? You know how important she is to me, don’t you? What’s with you,” I snarled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I know. And that’s why I’m saying this. If she’s important to you, then draw. Facing your dream and drawing like an idiot, that’s you who she fell in love with.” Her scowl deepened. That piercing gaze again…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t expect her to hand me the trigger to get down to business this easily. The confrontation I ran away from. The confrontation I’m going to face. I caught my breath silently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“</span><span class="calibre6">For an untalented bunch like me, working hard is the only way. Everyone knows that. But that doesn’t mean geniuses like you don’t have to do anything.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her deep blue eyes met mine. The word “Last boss” crossed my mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her skill always discouraged me, but she also gave me the reason for me to go on. It was always her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Therefore, I must face the “Genius” Kashiwazaki Yuri in all sincerity without shying away. If not, then I wouldn’t be able to move forward, ahead, up, or anywhere else.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“If you want me to draw, then you draw too. That’s what negotiations are about, right?” I offered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I would do anything for her to paint. This was the provocation I needed, the one that would make her furious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But she just let out a sight and shrugged.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Who the hell do you think you are? Why do I have to listen to you? I do what I want, I hate it when people try to dictate me. Don’t you know that the best? Or you lost your intellectuality with that heartbreak.”</span><span class="calibre6"><br class="calibre8" />
</span><span class="calibre6"><br class="calibre8" />
</span><span class="calibre6">I gritted my teeth. “Stop that ‘heartbreak’, will you? Just so you know, I’m not giving up on Utako, I’ll keep that promise. That’s why I’ll get you drawing again.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Promise this, promise that, isn’t it weighty, Sousuke? When I draw, I want to or not, it’s fun or not, that’s the only thing that matters.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“So your feelings only matter to you? Utako was forced to move away by her mother, but she cared about us more than you do!” I roared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Anger won over me as I pushed her down. But she just stared at me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You talk about how Utako feels, but what about </span><i class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">mine</span></i><span class="calibre6">? Do you really think I felt nothing when I heard that she can’t contact us anymore? Do you really think I don’t think anything of it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I knew. She never let it show, but she must have felt lonely too. But what she said was completely wrong. I felt something snap inside of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You don’t need to! You’re a genius! Whatever your wish is, a path will open for you on its own!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That moment, her eyes flashed angrily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Yea, I hate cliffhangers too, but I can’t find a better place to end the part]</b></p>

<hr class="calibre2" />

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri, who was pinned below, kicked me hard in the stomach. I groveled and coughed. She sprang up and seized my collar.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“So you want to talk about that!? Ha! How easy! Just adding the status of genius makes the need to work hard disappear?! Getting riled up, expecting great things from me, then making drawing obligatory for me, laying down a straight rail for other people’s future, I hate people like that! Separating me from other fellow artists with this title, have you for a second thought about my feelings?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m thinking! How could I catch up with someone as talented as you! How can I draw better! I’m thinking about it all the time! …But! There’s no answer for me! In the end, I’m just another ordinary person!” I screamed, my voice hoarse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The back of my eyes boiled. My tears began to moist my eyes the moment I relaxed. Crying in front of her would be a lifetime embarrassment. I desperately hold it in, our eyes engaging in an intense stare all the while. Then I grabbed her wrist and pressed her down again. Desperate I said in half demand half plea.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That’s why, please! Keep drawing for me! You’re my number one! In this world, I only admire one person, you, Yuri! I want to see more of your drawings!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">At the word “admire”, the tears won over. It collected in my eyes before falling onto her forehead below. The awkwardness, and then the fear of tears overflowing if I dared speak more made me close my mouth. Silence fell as Yuri also stared at me silently, her mouth unmoving.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In the quiet space where only my ragged breath and the heater’s ticking could be heard, we shared the moment of uncanny silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">How much time has passed? It felt like an eternity had passed in a split second. The silence was broken when Yuri effused a voice of exasperation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You’re always so lame… But this is the first time you’re pathetic. That’s definitely the worst I have ever seen.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“S-shut up! I already know! Damn… What am I doing…” I sobbed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Wiping the tears at the corners of my eyes as an excuse, I find a reason to look away. Yuri cupped my cheeks and smiled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She’s going to make a fool out of me. No, words abuse? I braced myself for her gibe&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Really, Sousuke…You know, because you are willing to become lame for the girl you like, you look cool instead,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“…Heh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Taken by the unexpected words, I let out a muffled sound. Yuri rose up deliberately, a smile on her lips, then quickly combed her disheveled hair with her fingers as she got out of bed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With that, she turned to leave, her back facing me. But suddenly stopped, then looked back at me..</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What is it?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll also be participating in the Kouji Exhibition Competition.” She said it casually like it didn’t matter, and so soft it was almost lost in the tickling of the heater.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A bolt out of the blue, a declaration that made my mind go blank then followed by confusion and excitement like a sonic boom.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I gulped “R-really?! You mean this year’s?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yup. The deadline is at the end of the month, no? If it’s then, then I can make it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Normally, I would have pegged her nonchalant attitude. But to get her to draw&ndash; to keep her from changing her mind, I could be a guarantor for her debt without hesitation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I-I’m sooo happy… But, is it because of me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She blinked “What? Dissatisfied?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m not complaining! But… I’m legit curious. Until now, no matter who asked you to, you never listened. Then why…?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Why? Simple. Because I now know that I’m the one in your eyes. Well, maybe I could pitch in and help.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Haah? What’s that? Don’t get carried away&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You admire me, don’t you.” She smirked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I felt my own face becoming hot in an instant. Telling her now was too soon after all. If she was to repeat that, then I would have to carry a shovel with me all the time, so that when there’s no hole for me to hide in, I could dig one myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Looking at me clutching my head, Yuri broke into laughter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Just so you know…I do care about Utako. I don’t want to see her sad. I hate being tied down, but I can’t go around breaking promises. That’s why I’m entering this competition. I’m going to draw for you two.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">What? You agreed to draw just to please us? Just how superior do you think you are? The world doesn’t revolve around you, you know?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The urge to quip was tantalizing, if it wasn’t now, I would have been furious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I wasn’t aggravated in the slightest, moved even.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her declaration to paint.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And hearing how much she cared for Utako.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">These feelings choked out words from my chest. “Thank you… Yuri, you’re really caring, after all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She chose to do what was best for Utako, and for me. I couldn’t find any better words to thank her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I care about you two a lot. But…” She began.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri looked into my eyes. Deep blue eyes, in there,&nbsp; a shadow of desire resided.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I know that you have someone you love passionately. But still, I want to be your number one. That feeling has always been inside me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“How much more do you want… Even though you have everything I want in your hands…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The insufferable, greedy genius who had everything laughed haughtily.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ah! Almost forgot. The painting for the Kouji Exhibit, paint it for the one you want to convey your feelings to the most.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hah? What’s with that airy order? Although I’m far from finish, I’m drawing Sugawara-senpai&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m going to paint Utako. The model for my painting after a long while will be her. Chic and sweet, don’t you think?” She laughed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Oi, Yuri! Wait!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Before I could ask her what she meant by that, Yuri said, “See you,” and this time she left for real. At her strange order, I tilted my head, but still didn’t go after her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Paint it for the one you want to convey your feelings to the most…” My voice echoed in the room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My feelings to… Then, I felt a rush of energy as her outline popped up in my mind, an exhilaration I had never known.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To face off with Yuri who decided to draw Utako, nothing could be more exciting than this. While struggling to contain the urge to draw right away, I whisper a message I could no longer send to Utako.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“The Yuri we admire is going to draw you. Really, I’m jealous. But I’m not planning to lose either. Anyway, look over me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That night, I was finally able to digest what Yuri had said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even geniuses like her experience excruciating pain unfathomable to ordinary people. But that has nothing to do with me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Genius had their own battles, ordinary people had their own struggle, our battlefields were different.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A concept I took three hundred hours to refine, she could come up with a better one in sixty seconds.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Paintings I paint with my heart and soul were no more than a pastime sketch for her.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even though my body told me she was unbeatable, I will face her again and again. I will cling to drawing. I will catch up with her and surpass her. I won’t use talent as an excuse to give up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If we continue to paint, our paths will surely cross at some point. I want to be the one who can stand tall when we face each other at that intersection. That was what I thought.</span></p>
