<h2>Chapter 3: Seeing What Shouldn’t Be Seen</h2>

<p class="calibre5">『Wow~, The hydrangea festival~』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『We used to go there a lot as a family. They have a lot of delicious stuff at the stalls.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">My two sisters say cheerfully, sharing memories across the tablet screen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The advancement of technology is a blessing because I can easily converse face-to-face with my sisters who are overseas.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(I wonder how people used to communicate it in the past?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">『But who would’ve thought Amane Onee-chan would casually go on a date to the Raihara family’s favorite outing spot with a guy.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not a date.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I say, denying Kanon’s words with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite being a high school senior, I still don’t understand romantic feelings between men and women as well as my sister Kanon does.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s only in her first year of middle school but is way ahead of me emotionally… What does that say about me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san and I are not in that kind of relationship. He’s just accompanying me as I work on overcoming my weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『He seems like a good person. Very mature, too.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Says Shion, the more laid-back of the twins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While Kanon is lively, Shion is calm and collected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Their faces may look alike, but their personalities are polar opposites.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, Chifuji-san is a very nice person, and he’s so calm and collected that it’s hard to believe we’re in the same grade.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s been working part-time for a long time, so maybe that’s why he’s so mature.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He seems like he can handle anything that comes his way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wonder if all boys my age are like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hear stories about boyfriends from my classmates, and most of them seem a bit more mischievous. ‘They act so childishly,’ some even complain like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『No, no, most boys of the same age are more childish than girls!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon retorts a bit heatedly. Maybe she has her own experience with it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『For him to accept Onee-chan’s foolish and bizarre antics this time, that is stalking in your ‘Jirai-kei’ (Landmine-type) attire, and by the way, someone who has such a suspicious smile, is really something unusual. Normally, that would be impossible.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I know…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t deny it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been told my smile can be rather mysterious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not really aware of it, but apparently, when I’m annoyed, my face turns pretty evil.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『So, Onee-chan had his help but didn’t make any progress?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『But you know, Kanon, that’s just how Amane Onee-chan is. Instead of saying she’s ‘tired,’ she’d rather take care of someone else to regain her energy』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『That’s true, but, Shion, we know very well, so it ends with ‘Well, that is simply the way she is.’, but to others, she might seem like a weird creature. How does that even energize her?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I know right~』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Once again, I can’t even argue.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Considering Onee-chan has spoiled us for so long, it might be strange for us to say this, but maybe you should try changing that part of Onee-chan’s personality.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon suggests hesitantly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I will change. Onee-chan has decided to change”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I declare to Shion. Hearing that, Kanon speaks, averting her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Well, we’ll support you, at least.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon, being my sister, knows.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She probably doesn’t think I can do it… but who’s to blame for giving her that impression?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t even complain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『But you know, that Chifuji-san? He says some amazing things, doesn’t he?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean by ‘amazing’?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I ask her, Shion replies in her usual relaxed tone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Eh~? Saying ‘I’m tired’ when you’re tired is being spoiled, isn’t that quite something~?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Huh? Shion, were you listening to what Onee-chan said? You know, Onee-chan can’t handle it unless it’s brought down that low to that level of being spoiled~ It’s because Onee-chan who’s no good…Wait, what were we talking about?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s about me being at fault…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I see~.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon nods in agreement. Sorry for being such a failure of an Onee-chan…</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Eh~? No, that’s not it. We were talking about how saying ‘I’m tired’ is being spoiled, and that’s amazing… what are you talking about, Kanon〜. Regardless of whether our Onee-chan is no good or anything like that, it’s a word that doesn’t come out unless you really feel that ‘being tired is spoiled’, so that’s pretty amazing〜.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">……That being said, it might be so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was thinking just like what Kanon said, but there seems to be a way to perceive it like Shion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I still don’t fully understand what kind of person Chifuji-san is.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Because of the guilt of stalking, I have been very afraid to say anything that would make him think I was probing into his life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, Chifuji-san didn’t seem to be the type to actively reveal various things about himself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only new information I got today was that it was his first time having a bento in a tiered box.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I do not know him very well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Umm~….Hmm~~~~~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Take your time, it’s alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A week from the day we went out to the Hydrangea Festival, another Sunday has arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….What…What I want to see, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. It’s what you, Raihara-san, think of as ‘I want to see’ by considering only yourself.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The place we came to is a cinema in the city center.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she had failed in both ‘dragging me along for shopping’ and saying ‘I’m tired’ when tired, this time, we chose something that could be decided immediately on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Going to the cinema together and choosing the movie she wants to watch, that’s the plan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When we were shopping, Raihara-san said, ‘I can’t think of any place I want to go for myself.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why, this task might not be easy either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Back then she also said, ‘Especially when I think about ‘dragging someone to a place I want to go to,’ it makes it even worse!’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Compared to that, she should feel less selfish this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, unlike the challenge of saying ‘I’m tired’, the physical condition is not related, so it’s easy to try.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While pondering such things, next to me, Raihara-san continues to worry in front of the cinema’s wall, where today’s screening list is posted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….What I want to see, what I want to see, what I want to see, saying what I want to see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve heard she likes movies, so it’s not that she’s not interested.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, asserting her own liking in such situations seems to be her weakness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It might be better to wait patiently rather than speak rashly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I aimlessly observe the situation inside the cinema to pass the time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A cinema, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">In fact, I have hardly ever been here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe since my uncle took me here a long time ago.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There are faces that are looking forward to the fun that is about to start and faces immersed in the lingering impact of the movie they watched.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, so this is the kind of atmosphere a cinema has.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It must be a good place to enjoy holidays for the majority of families.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…No, I got lost in my thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, today we’ll see whether or not ‘the third time’s the charm’ is true&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Chifuji-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That moment came surprisingly easily.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I want to watch this!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright, let’s watch it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san points to a movie title, and I nod.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be tactless to explicitly commend or praise her for this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, I should accept her suggestion as if it was nothing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…But, it might not be to Chifuji-san’s taste… it might bore you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all. I also want to see what Raihara-san wanted to watch. …Let’s see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Confirming the title Raihara-san was pointing to, it was unexpectedly a hardcore action film.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a blockbuster from Hollywood that’s just been released.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, do you dislike such things?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, no way. Rather…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The title of this movie is so masculine that it’s easy to think that she picked it because of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe perceiving such thoughts of mine, Raihara-san shakes her head vigorously.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I want to watch it, really-… actually, I’ve watched all the works of this director, even the old ones… I also have them on Blu-ray.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! I usually go to watch them with my sisters, but my mother and friends don’t like these, and watching alone feels lonely…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Got it, let’s watch this movie.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What becomes clear is, the time spent just now was not about her being undecided about what movie she wanted to see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If the newly released film is by her favorite director, then for Raihara-san, the decision on what to watch is already made.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The struggle was whether to say it or not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m glad. …this feels surreal… is this really okay…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. Now, let’s go buy the tickets. The time is… is it displayed on that monitor? …Hmm, what’s that display?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The upcoming show has a note saying [4DX]… What’s that?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, it’s 4DX. The seat moves according to the content of the movie, there are winds, splashes of water, and even mist with fragrance, and so on.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, that sounds interesting.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, there is such a thing…</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, come to think of it, I remember hearing about something like that from a friend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I tried it with my sisters before, it’s like an attraction…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sounds good, let’s go with that one.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As the next show was about to start soon, we bought tickets and drinks and entered the theater.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think I realize I’m at the movie theater not when I enter the building but when I’m watching commercials before the main feature in the dim theater.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a thrilling time, but there is a different thrill in my chest today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;I said it! I said what seemed like my selfish desire!</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was an amazing feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can sense the machinery made of many gears within me making a grinding noise in surprise, as if something strange has been caught in it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel nervous, and my heart is racing… No.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be perfectly honest… it doesn’t sit well with me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, I think I shouldn’t ignore this feeling. I must face it and change.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have to seal and bury the me who only thinks about doing favors for others and doesn’t act selfishly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I must do it, I surely can. Surely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I think these thoughts, the pre-show commercials changed to a new one, and sweet words from the commercial softly melted into the air in the theater</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems like a youth romance movie.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…as expected, even for me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Being in a dim, classic dating spot with a boy of the same age doesn’t mean I feel nothing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The thrill before the movie screening, the thrill of having done something seemingly selfish, and the thrill of this situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All are different kinds of excitement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Amane will eventually come here on a date with someone she likes’&mdash;&mdash;that’s what my mother said on the way home from the movie theater before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wondered about it back then.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san asks in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s because I was intently staring at his profile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“N-no, it’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While also speaking softly, I shake my head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">… A date, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">A date refers to an outing between lovers; it shouldn’t refer to just a man and a woman going out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, this is different, right?</p>

<p class="calibre5">No-no, even thinking such a thing is very rude to Chifuji-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s accompanying me to help me overcome my weaknesses, and here I am, frivolously thinking it’s a date.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I think Chifuji-san is a wonderful person. Rather, I think he might be too kind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was stalking him, but he still listened to my story and cooperated with me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking he is a nice person, and feeling very grateful. These two things are certain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then…as a man?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since yesterday, I have talked a bit about such things with my sisters, and even if it’s rude and unacceptable, I inadvertently still think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But honestly, I don’t know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To begin with, I don’t know if it’s something that I can understand or recognize.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Well, even if I were to like him, whether Chifuji-san would consider me… including being a stalker, I’ve exposed so much disgrace…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Look, we barely made it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No buts!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Oh my.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so lost in my thoughts that I did not even know that the commercials were over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was brought back to reality by voices from beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After a quick glance and to my left (Chifuji-san is on my right), a parent and child had arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A mother and a boy who seemed to be in lower elementary school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As they hurriedly took their seats, the main feature of the movie started right in time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The opening scene was a flashy action sequence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A flood of sound unique to movie theaters rolls in.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The air vibrates intensely, and the seats shake back and forth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, this is the impact of 4DX.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Peeking to my right, Chifuji-san also seemed impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems like the corners of his mouth are slightly raised.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Noticing my gaze, he told me, ‘This is amazing,’ with only the shape of his mouth without making a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m glad, he seems to be enjoying the movie.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, come on! What are you doing…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh my…</p>

<p class="calibre5">The boy in the seat to my left had spilled a bit of the juice he was holding.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps it’s because of the shaking of the seat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I try to take out a handkerchief to wipe it, but then I realize that I should not be doing such a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Right, his mother is here after all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">An outsider shouldn’t just abruptly barge in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Besides, my current fashion is Jirai-kei (Landmine type).</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really like this outfit, but it might be a bit intimidating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Speaking to them out of the blue might surprise them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While I’m thinking about these things and trying to suppress my impulse, the mother had already wiped up the spilled juice properly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Hmm, I’m glad I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I shouldn’t snatch away her opportunity to take care of people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That kind of happiness…how nice~~ No, wait! I must suppress these feelings!</p>
<p class="calibre5">But even after that, the boy spilled his juice and snacks several times and said he wanted to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Patience…patience, patience, patience!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I somehow suppress my overwhelming desire to care, stimulated by the boy’s clamor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No-no, form is emptiness and emptiness is form…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I told you, why are you&mdash;excuse me, miss, I’m so sorry for making a lot of noise and bothering me since a while ago…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh no, no problem.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m perfectly fine, it’s not a trouble at all and if you don’t mind could I help with looking after him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh look, there’s something on his mouth. Let me get that for you… such words seem like they would slip out of my mouth if I let my guard down for a moment!</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow enduring everything, I shake my head with a small smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The mother was apologizing to the person sitting on the other side too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems tough.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wish she could just relax during the movie and I could be the one that&mdash;no-no, it’s not allowed to do that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the boy spills juice again because of the shaking of the seat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The boy’s behavior shakes my resolve again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The movie screening time impeccably turned into a place for my spiritual training.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I-it was fun, wasn’t it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. …By the way, are you okay? You seem to be very exhausted…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, no, I’m not tired at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I endured. I really endured a lot…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I may not have absorbed much of the movie content, but I realize my own immaturity.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Talking about such things, Chifuji-san and I exit the cinema and return to the movie hall entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The lights are brighter, and I realize, oh, the movie time has ended.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Was 4DX okay for you, Chifuji-san… oh? You look a bit pale…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Do I?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it just my imagination? But, he seems a bit pale…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom told you, right? Be careful because the seat shakes!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s enough! We are never coming to the movies again!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I turned around at the sound of the yelling, it was the parent and child who were next to us earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm, it seemed tough for the mother too, but it’s inevitable for a child of that age to make little mistakes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why are you always so whiny!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh my…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, they are here, the typical ‘exploding’ mom and child.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s totally a common thing at spots where people bring their kids. Seriously, I used to get told stuff like that all the time too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hear such a conversation from a couple nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Certainly, it’s a common sight in shopping malls and supermarkets.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Hmm, going to say, ‘It wasn’t a bother, it’s okay. So, you don’t need to worry about that…’ would be inappropriate.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, with an ‘Enough! Let’s go home!’ the mother headed towards the exit with big strides, and the boy trudged along after her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s difficult, isn’t it… I was about to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san, excuse me. I will go to the restroom for a bit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, okay. I’ll be waiting.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying ‘Excuse me’ to me again, Chifuji-san headed to the restroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…There was a lack of energy in his voice, and his awkward movements were a bit concerning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, shortly after, a message to my smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『It seems I feel sick from the seat’s shaking. Sorry, but could you wait a bit?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if he’s okay!? So that’s why his complexion was off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I reply, telling him to take his time and to contact me immediately if he feels any pain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then a stamp of a polite dog saying thank you came back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I worry while waiting for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry, and thank you for waiting. I don’t know, it’s shameful.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san who returned, is indeed somewhat pale.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No-no! I’m the one who should be sorry; I should have chosen a regular screening…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I mean, I also said I really wanted to see it. Haha, honestly, it was really fun, but it seems my body didn’t agree.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Let’s rest a bit. The coffee at that shop is delicious. …Ah, maybe not as much as the shop where Chifuji-san works.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s good. It would be hopeless if they surpassed us in taste when they are already winning in location.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san says, jokingly. His tone seems to lack its usual vigor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let’s take a break slowly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We enter a shop attached to the movie theater and sit down with our drinks ‘I’ll buy them, so please rest at the seat,’ I said, but ‘It’s against today’s purpose,’ he insisted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, I wonder what should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was worried that I don’t remember much of the movie because I was constantly distracted by the parent and child next to us…</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Chifuji-san, with a laugh, said he couldn’t concentrate much either due to the shaking of the seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s embarrassing…but I have always been prone to getting sick. When I was little, I used to get fevers all the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I feel I have become much more stronger now, but sometimes I still get unwell during the changing of the seasons.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…It’s exactly this time, isn’t it? Please be careful with colds; it seems it will get much colder at night from today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I didn’t know that. It has been quite warm recently. Thank you, I will be careful.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because the image of a mature, reliable man is stronger than that of a boy of the same age, I arbitrarily thought that he must be physically strong too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if that’s not the case, I am worried.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That means he’s a hard worker and likely to overexert himself, and that’s…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It might be odd for me to say this, but please rely on those around you if something happens…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I will.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san nods and smiles gently.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji, sorry, is it still hurt…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On Tuesday, during lunch break in the classroom, one of my friends who was eating with me said this, putting his hands together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah? No…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But you’ve been so quiet, and you didn’t answer when pointed out during the class… sorry, my ball hit you quite hard…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Our first class in the morning was physical education, and the subject was softball.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This friend of mine threw a ball that apparently slipped while playing catch and hit me in the side of the head as I was practicing nearby.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s alright, it doesn’t hurt or anything now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? But I caught a glimpse when you were changing, didn’t it look like a bruise?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….Is that so. No, it probably didn’t. You saw it wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s nothing wrong where the ball hit and there’s no pain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, this is not a lie. Then, another friend speaks up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, isn’t Chifuji acting strange today? The reason you got hit by the ball during PE is because you seemed spaced out and didn’t notice it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so… was I spaced out? I was feeling a bit sluggish and couldn’t move quickly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why I couldn’t avoid it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, even now, my body feels strangely tired.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did physical education class do this to me…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, sorry, I’ve been wondering, isn’t Chifuji-kun’s face red?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kusakabe-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, Kusakabe-san (a girl who’s on the gardening committee with me), who was spreading out her lunch with a group of girls nearby, turns around to join the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really? I can’t tell.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Girls notice people’s complexion really well. …Hmm? Now that she mentions it, maybe?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My two male friends, taking Kusakabe-san’s words, intently peer into my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s red! Excuse me a bit!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san, having stood up from her seat, comes over and puts her hand on my forehead.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“..It’s hot! You have a fever!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s true I feel a little light-headed, and just as Kusakabe-san said, it was indeed above normal when measured in the infirmary.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, it wasn’t too high, and since there was no one to pick me up, I decided to leave early for now and go home by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That would have been fine, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…This is bad; my fever got worse.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t feel noticeably ill when I left the house this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even when everyone at school pointed it out, I only thought, ‘Maybe I was a bit feverish?’ But, it’s getting worse while I am on my way home alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even so, I have to do something about it myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With shaky steps, I stop by a drugstore on my way home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s especially large around here and has a good selection of products… well, is there any reason why it has to be a good-selection store?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know, I just feel like a bigger store is better.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I should buy antipyretics and, also, uh, sports drinks and jelly drinks…and what else?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Ah, I can tell my thoughts are becoming duller.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I shake my head two-three times and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite this, the foggy feeling doesn’t clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At first, I thought I was hearing things.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What a coincidence. Are you shopping?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara, san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. This place is great, it’s big and has a selection of cleaning supplies… Oh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In her basket, there are products for mold cleaning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess it’s that time of year, the rainy season.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, your complexion…and also, why at this time on a weekday?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mold cleaning…I need to do it soon too… I even have the tools Raihara-san recommended…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? Ah, sorry….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What was I saying now?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like whatever came to my mind just came out of my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What was I asked by Raihara-san? This is not good, not good.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I am a bit spaced out…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Excuse me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Swiftly, Raihara-san places her hand on my forehead; then her face shows concern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You have a fever… I see; you left early, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Embarrassingly, I am feeling a bit sick.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, I feel like I had such a conversation with her the day before yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She even told me to be careful as it gets cold at night, but I completely failed to heed the warning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, I need to buy antipyretics and sports drinks…Oh, why is Raihara-san here on a weekday…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Today is the foundation anniversary. (TN: Maybe referring to school.) No, more importantly, how about you, Chifuji-san? …how about your family?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? Ah…no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hastily close my overly relaxed mouth before it can say anything unnecessary due to the fever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m alone today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s face shows concern.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her expression seems to be vividly saying she can’t help but worry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could already imagine what she was going to say to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“With the state you are in, it might be dangerous to go home alone… Moreover, when you are sick, you need to eat nutritious food…Chifuji-san, I will accompany you to your home!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I appreciate your concern, but you shouldn’t…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Bringing a woman who seemed like a stalker into your home must be very uncomfortable, I know! But I won’t do anything strange, I swear!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, ever since Raihara-san managed to speak your mind last time, I’m not worried about that at all… anyway, having you take care of me here would be meaningless… To make Raihara-san take care of me…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My thoughts are becoming foggy again, but I muster up everything and manage to squeeze out a few words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You know, it’s like ruining the beginning of a successful diet by eating a cake…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is this the right expression?</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I think she understands what I am trying to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mmm… When you say it like that… but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seemingly understanding, Raihara-san thinks hard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to undermine her efforts and success… I think it’s better to leave now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…thank you for your concern. In any case, I’ll be fine… It would be bad if I infected you with my cold… So, then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, I turn my body and leave the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m happy with Raihara-san’s feelings, but I don’t want to trouble her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Some fever reducers and several jelly drinks will do…and some sports drinks. That should be enough.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Holding the basket containing those, I go to the cashier, pay, and leave the store&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Cheat Day!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, a voice calls out to me, and my arm is grasped firmly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a cheat day!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Cheat day?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s that? I think I’ve heard that before.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">…Cheat day?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s that? I think I’ve heard that before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Cheat day is; when you restrict your diet, continuously restraining it can lead to a drop in basic metabolism, making it harder to lose weight, so you designate a day where you can eat whatever you want!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, right, something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, who has been taking care of athletic younger sisters, must be knowledgeable about this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“And It’s the same thing! How about considering today a cheat day? Today, you can be spoiled to your heart’s content!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, but that’s…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought it was a bit of a forceful analogy, but I guess I was the one who brought up the diet analogy first.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…However, to be spoiled would be…uh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is bad; I feel like my fever is genuinely starting to rise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel dizzy, and my body sways.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…No arguments! I won’t leave you alone!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ra-Raihara-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She, supporting my body, wraps her arm around my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s go… uh, I, um, know where Chifuji-san’s house is…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah right, she probably found out where I live during her period of observing me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s embarrassing, really.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And unavoidably, I become conscious of her, because her body is warm and soft&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her support provides an amazing sense of stability, and with this body feeling dizzy from the fever, it seems impossible to shake her off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Of course, I won’t do that)</p>

<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t engage in sports or anything, and yet her physical talent is apparent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s good to have talent…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, it’s nothing…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s bad; I really can’t control myself due to the fever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m blurting out whatever I’m thinking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having talent is good, I’m envious… No, that’s not it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hope I don’t say any more strange things…</p>
<p class="calibre5">And although it’s late, I guess it’s a given that she’s going to take care of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… I’m sorry for the trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, Chifuji-san should know very well that I don’t find this sort of thing troublesome.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When she says that, indeed, I have nothing to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">An old public housing complex on the fifth floor, that’s where I live.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are several occupancy conditions, but the rent is unbelievably cheap for a 2LDK layout.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Have you had lunch?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Now that you mention it, not yet…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With my vision getting blurry, I’m now on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My body feels so heavy doing anything, and while talking to Raihara-san, even just keeping my upper body raised is reaching its limits, so I completely lie down flat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My head was hot, and I was shivering… then Raihara-san put a blanket over me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I dimly watch her gently patting the blanket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I dug around in my head for a memory of someone doing this to me, but I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Before you take your medicine, it’s better to have something in your stomach. Can I use the kitchen and the ingredients?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry… I will definitely thank you later…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I have already received a lot from you, Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a voice that seems to embody the very concept of gentleness, Raihara-san says so and leaves my bedroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Soon, sounds can be heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Someone is cooking for me while I’m lying down; I can’t remember the last time I was in such a situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Pull yourself together. Don’t slack off just because you have a fever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I must be proper…get it together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I, who lack any talent, must at least be proper and reliable at any given time, or else I can’t survive.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve kept you waiting~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Entering Chifuji-san’s bedroom with the simple egg porridge I made, he slowly raises his upper body.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His tone was much softer than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No-no. Please take your time and try to eat…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Given he hardly had any lunch and considering he has to take medicine, I want him to have something in his stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes… of course… I wouldn’t let it go to waste after you’ve gone to the trouble…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Please, don’t worry about such things.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">These are words typical of him, but I wish he wouldn’t be so uptight at times like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">… I’ve been accompanying him to practice being ‘spoiled’, but what about him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if Chifuji-san would become spoiled with his family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s not living alone, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering the layout, he must be living with his family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, here you go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I scoop some with a spoon and offer it to feed him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san stares at it blankly for a few seconds before shaking his head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I really can’t ask you to do that much for me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? Oh…I… I’m sorry, it was instinctive…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…right, it’s not good for a member of the opposite sex of the same age, who is not a lover, to do this!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never questioned it as it was something I always did when taking care of my family…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No… your consideration is… very…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a soft tone, while accepting the bowl and spoon from me, Chifuji-san begins to eat slowly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How embarrassing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? That’s a relief you can eat it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, very much…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying this, the movement of Chifuji-san’s hands manipulating the utensils is somewhat precarious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His body seems lethargic too…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah…why am I just blankly watching him look so pained?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t understand, what are these hands attached for?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to feed him, I want to feed him, I want to feed him, I want to feed him, I want to feed him!</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Is it really such a bad thing? Doing the ‘aaah.’?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Compared to letting a sick and suffering person eat by themselves, is it really such a terrible thing?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Where does justice lie? Hmm…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, the spoon falls from Chifuji-san’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I swiftly catch it midair with my right hand as it whirls around.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry… and thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Today is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…a cheat day, so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t return the spoon to his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I snatch the bowl as well, scoop the porridge, and assume the ‘aaah.’ posture.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ra-Raihara-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uhm…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san opens and closes his mouth several times, but eventually, perhaps yielding to my silent pressure, he bites the spoon I offer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I scoop the porridge and offer it&mdash;&mdash;and he eats it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Time passes in silence like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Every time he puts his mouth to the spoon, his bangs sway slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Along with his eyes, blurred from the fever, it makes him appear somewhat innocent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This contrasts with his usual composed self, reminding me of the flip side of a card.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Slowly, I can feel sweat forming on my back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I bring the porridge to his mouth, and he chews and swallows it, over and over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, this is…</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels like I am seeing something I shouldn’t be seeing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels like I am doing something I shouldn’t be doing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was at that moment when I subconsciously swallowed my own saliva.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, uh…, well, does..does it hurt somewhere? Or is there something wrong…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..ah?”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000006.png">

<p class="calibre5">For the first time in my life, I see&mdash;a man, not a child, crying before my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …? “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san himself has a bewildered face, but from his eyes, tears are steadily falling. They won’t stop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He hasn’t realized that he is crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s really mismatched.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s unbearably painful to watch, and it feels too precious to look away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? …this”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A tear lands drop by drop onto his hand, and then he finally seems to notice the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What…? Why…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san, who hadn’t realized he was crying until now seemed to not understand why he was crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His face doesn’t show pain, and his voice doesn’t quiver with sorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, the tears just continuously fall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…haha, maybe the fever messed up my tear ducts…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san, blinking several times, wipes around his eyes with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What am I doing…I need to be proper.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words murmured softly were chillingly cold that it gave me the creeps.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not a logical thought in my head, but it’s an intuition coming from deep within my belly that tells me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san is very mature, responsible, and hardworking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But, could this person actually be…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Actually be…</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Once again, my throat gulped.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s precisely what people say, ‘exposing disgraceful behavior.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I truly owe you a lot. Thank you so much for your help.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s nothing!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Going out on Sunday with Raihara-san have practically become a regular thing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I’ve already thanked her several times, but still…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Didn’t you get infected, Raihara-san…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all. Hehe, I have never caught a cold since I was born!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Strong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think she is exaggerating to reassure me, but a part of me feel like it might really be true.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you feeling better now, Chifuji-san…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thanks to you, I’m completely fine. I can go to school and to my part-time job. And as you see, to the game center too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, hehe. I’m glad.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today, the two of us came to a game center located in the bustling city area.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The spacious store is lively with a diverse range of customers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s nostalgic, I haven’t been here since elementary school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, is that so? I often come because my younger sister particularly likes it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? What kind of games do you play?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mostly competitive ones.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see, you seem like the athletic type who would enjoy competition.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Since we’re here, let’s do that afterward. But, what we came here for today is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This one!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What is lined up in the area we came to are&mdash;&mdash;crane games, one of the kings of the arcade world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today’s mission for Raihara-san is to ‘beg for prizes.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…However, I feel like there are way more crane games than before… Were there this many machines before?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, now that you mention it, it might have increased… I don’t remember the crane game area being this big.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s popular, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The row of machines is clearly more than I remember.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We wander around looking at what kind of prizes are available.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“B-but…is it okay? You see, it costs money…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“As I said before we came. I received such a lavish bento from you, and above all, you took care of me last time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But that is…. no… I have to be spoiled, yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san clenches her fist and gets pumped up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She eventually stops in front of one machine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Inside are lined up stuffed rabbits.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a character characterized by moist eyes and bandages wound around it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I’ve seen this. I think a girl in the class had one.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ac, actually, I have a few too…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, you like it, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it’s cute, isn’t it, Usabyan (バャ).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, this is the first time I heard its name, and it was the first time I heard such a pronunciation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Usa…what?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, it’s called Usabyan, Usabyan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Usabian? (ビャ)”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Close, it’s ‘byan’.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It seems I need more practice with my pronunciation.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seemed like a difficult name at my level.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, it does match the current look of Raihara-san, the Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s cute, but it also has a slightly dark taste, which seems to be a common point.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right, it’s a standard item and I…um, so.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the glass case, dance the words, ‘Limited Time Only Prize Exclusive Design!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it’s only available now, and only obtainable through crane games, it doesn’t seem like she already has the same one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That one..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wait patiently for her to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The approach that worked at the movie theater, I decided to employ it again this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san shifts her gaze between the crane game and me, back and forth several times.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, well, …um, you see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She finally, while looking down a bit and looking up timidly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I want…that one, …I want it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’d be really happy if you could get it for me, …no, um, I want to get it for me, please!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was speaking awkwardly but looking straight into my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, please wait a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Strictly speaking, the objective for today is already achieved at this point, but it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I simply want to get it for her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Especially since she tried so hard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really appreciate my uncle at moments like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『There are two things worth practicing for a man. Unhooking a bra without looking and winning prizes in a crane game.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">My uncle used to say so… I’ll refrain from commenting on the first one, but the second one might be true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At least, the training he instilled in me during my elementary school days seems likely to pay off right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The claw of the arm is… Is it angled right? The others are…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Picking the machine largely determines success or failure in this game, but from what I can see from this machine, including the positioning of the prizes, the conditions don’t seem too bad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I put in a hundred yen and started on the first try.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The crane, moving to the target while playing characteristic music… managed to hook but didn’t lift it up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, so close…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…The arm, it’s not very strong, is it. I see…then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, the stuffed animal I was aiming for toppled over, face down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I was aiming for the product tag attached to its rear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Second try, third, fourth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, amazing!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems doable…Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The crane’s claw finally entered the tag as intended.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it lifts it up as it is, the stuffed animal will surely rise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, while holding it up, the claw moves toward the prize retrieval slot.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I somehow managed to get it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s been quite a while, and I thought the specifications might be different from back then, but it seems I was overthinking it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I bend down and pick up the stuffed animal that fell, feeling relieved.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here you go. It’s Raihara-san’s.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Um, …thank you very much.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Accepting the stuffed animal I offered&mdash;she hugged it and smiled radiantly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wow, incredible, it’s like a commercial.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the arms of Raihara-san, dressed in Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion, and the Usa…byan(?) is being held, with a face that seems like it found its predestined place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s as if the creators truly wanted a girl like this to hold it this way and with this expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Sorry for troubling you, …ehehe, well, I’m happy! Having you it fetched for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san says, fluttering her hands on her face. I’m glad I could make her happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad. …No, but I also really wanted to thank you for taking care of me. I’m rather worried that it won’t be enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s…after all, it was something I wanted to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But that day, I was really grateful. If Raihara-san hadn’t taken care of me like that, it might have gotten worse, and besides…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There are many parts I don’t remember in detail because I was feverish, but…the warmth from her at that time, the feeling of being saved by it…still remains.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I might not be like Raihara-san, but I’m also not the type who is good at relying on people. In other words, if I hadn’t been taken care of by Raihara-san, I would have never experienced something like that in my life.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to convey that there is at least one exception, even though she probably has a strong feeling of ‘Taking care of people is a burden to others’ due to memories from her middle school days.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Because Raihara-san was being Raihara-san, I was truly saved that day. I wanted to convey that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just remember that there is at least one person who was saved because Raihara-san was being Raihara-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My body has been feeling strange the entire time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not because of the words he gave me, not because of the stuffed animal, it’s been since before that. And, even though it’s been since before, receiving the words and the stuffed animal made it even stranger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, I feel wobbly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mind can’t get organized, and my feet are restless.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I replied to him, being careful not to let my voice sound strangely high-pitched.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today has been like that since the initial greetings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hope I seem to be speaking normally…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, there are others in that series, right? I’ve seen the character with an intimidating face and the one with a smiling face.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, there are, Usaboyan(ボャ) and Usabeyan(ベャ).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No good, my tongue isn’t skilled enough to say that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While exchanging seemingly trivial conversations, my heart keeps beating fast.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s been like this since today when I saw his face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s making noises as if trying to convey something to me…</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, um…, it’s like that, maybe?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, but I don’t know. It’s not clear. It’s not something that I can understand!</p>

<p class="calibre5">The only thing I understand right now is that my shaky feet are really restless.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sneak a peek at Chifuji-san’s profile beside me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I’m sorry…haha, maybe the fever messed up my tear ducts…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….uh.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, the image of him from that time flashes back in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My throat makes a swallowing sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Usabayan, Usabiyan,… no good, Usabayan, Usaban… Usabiyan… hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san is practicing pronunciation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The way he tilts his head, his gestures seem mature and reliable… I find it… cute.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unconsciously, I squeeze the stuffed animal in my arms tightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t we play other games as well since we are here? What kind of competitive one were you playing with your sister?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, her favorite is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I brought him to the corner with a distinctive fighting game atmosphere.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, a fighting game!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s possible to do online battles, but she says, ‘I want to feel like I’m playing against a human,’ and prefers to battle against me or her sister, hehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My younger sister Kanon is not interested in competing with others, so playing against Shion has mostly been my role.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d like to see it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not very good, so it’s a bit embarrassing…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying that, I sit in the chair and insert a hundred yen into the slot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san kindly holds Usabyan for me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then I choose a familiar character and select the single-player story mode.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Fortunately, my hand on the lever is not too awkward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, it’s a nice gap; seeing someone in Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion playing this kind of game is picturesque.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, maybe so. Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The display shows that an opponent has appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the beginning of a player-versus-player battle.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh? Do your best!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even so, I’m really not familiar with these kinds of games.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I don’t really understand things like combos…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Raihara-san’s attacks, they land very well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all, I’m only doing simple things. Just watching the opponent’s movements and pressing the attack button when it seems it will land.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The guard is the same.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I see the opponent’s attack and think it can be done in time, I just pull the lever back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…? You watch the opponent’s movements and then press the button in time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Surprisingly, I can make it in time. Well, it won’t when it won’t… oh, I won the first round!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a kick from my character, the opponent is blown backward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, this kick comes out quickly, so if the opponent’s attack is a bit slow, my attack will reach the opponent first.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I particularly like this kick.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The second round has started.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“See, you can easily see the beginning of the opponent’s punch now, right? If you press the button at this time, the kick will land.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No…hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“See, this. Ah, again.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I have no idea…what, you can see it? That one just now?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s somewhat, just somewhat.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While doing this, the opponent’s health bar has again reduced to zero.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since I got two rounds, this is my win.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I think skilled players don’t fight haphazardly like this. They precisely read, ‘this character will do this at this time,’ and fight accordingly, but I don’t understand anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, rather… winning without doing that… could it be, your reflexes are incredibly good, Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know… ah, my sister says it’s like the way wild beasts fight.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a great expression, you seem strong.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah, should…should I have not said that?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because it’s not cute, right…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is regretting like this, because I want to be thought of as cute?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Do I, want to be thought of as cute?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seriously, I do not understand how my mind works today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The next opponent seems a bit strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-yeah, I guess so!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sorry… Honestly, there might not be much difference with the person I battled earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s because the agitation from the previous conversation is affecting me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No-no, focus, focus.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While thinking this, I wonder how I appear, and I inadvertently glance his way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The distance was closer than I thought&mdash;&mdash;the lever slips in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“..Ah, …well, I lost, haha.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No need to worry, it was a good match. You’ll surely win the next round.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san is just earnestly watching the game, so he is leaning a bit forward toward the screen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a result, he is just too close to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The one feeling unnecessary tension is me, it’s my problem.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, um, …w-well… um, um.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The next round is also hopeless. I can’t concentrate at all!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not trying to act cute by intentionally losing but… ah, would that leave a good impression on men?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know, I don’t know anything about the ABCs of relationships between men and women.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Am I, perhaps, regretting that now?</p>
<p class="calibre5">With my mind in disarray, I ended up losing the match in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is game over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was a close game. It’s amazing if you can do this without any practice, wouldn’t you become quite strong if you delved into it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all, …haha, I do think it’s a fun game, but I’m not so into competing with people over winning and losing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the decisive difference between Shion, who likes this, and me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While nodding, Chifuji-san hands me the plush Usabyan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …… “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As soon as I receive it, I fall silent, and Chifuji-san looks at me with a puzzled face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh, ah, thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying thanks and masking it with a smile, deep in my chest, my heart is raising its beat a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, no, …it’s just my imagination.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To think that I can feel something like warmth from the plush toy that was in his arms just moments ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, is that why my annoyance burning hot?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, as for my legs… they’re shaky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My head feels feverish, and I can’t settle my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I’ve never felt this way before, I’m convinced this isn’t just a cold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Wobbly, wobbly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My feet are constantly swaying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, that was how it was the entire time I was with Chifuji-san that day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, Raihara-san, this is it, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, y-yes! It seems like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s no good, it doesn’t get better.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even after a week, the same symptoms appear the moment I see him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah, it’s the right one. The collab T-shirt Shion wanted. Here it is, yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your sister really likes it, huh? The one with the fighting squid.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it’s almost next to skating. Hehe, she has been sending me messages since yesterday, saying ‘It’s going on sale tomorrow! Make sure to buy it!’ She might call any moment now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Considering it’s afternoon here, and your sisters are in Canada… it’s midnight? Or rather, early morning? I mean, that’s some passionate big fan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We are at the same shopping mall we visited for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The movie theater and the game center&mdash;it went well, so we decided to try here again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“About fighting games, she is a calm girl, but she likes to compete. She gets the most heated among the three sisters, including me. The youngest sister, on the other hand, can say clearly what she wants to say to people, but she’s not very interested in winning or losing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You sisters have different personalities.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think we can have a normal conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is to say, behind the normal conversation, my head remains feverish, and my feet are restless.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This past week, I’ve been wondering if this is what’s called ‘that’… but it still isn’t clear to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it because I’m too ignorant about love matters?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is my emotional development insufficient…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Both of them say, ‘Onee-chan is the most peculiar one,’ and even our parents nod!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha,, but they might not say that anymore in the future. Look, it went well today too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, actually, today’s challenge is already going well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unlike before, I somehow managed to take people to places I wanted to go.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yes, that’s true… I hope you can overlook the part where I’m buying a gift for my sister, not something for myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s still a big step, and I think it’s amazing… huh, Raihara-san, how about that one? That hoodie also looks like a collab item.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, you’re right. Thank you, …the size too… yes, there’s one that fits.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since I’ve gathered the items my sister asked for, I head to the cashier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh? This is self-checkout, you don’t even need to scan barcodes…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san observes the cashier machine with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I find myself thinking, he’s cute.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My hand is trembling, causing me to mis-touch the panel.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Calm down, calm down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, doesn’t buying presents only for 1 of your sisters lead to trouble? I don’t have any siblings, so I don’t know what it’s like.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There are disputes~. There are things I want to buy and send to the younger sister too, so, … i-if you don’t mind, maybe after this…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see, of course, I’ll accompany you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having people accompany me for my convenience is something my body is still not quite used to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, thanks to step-by-step practice, I’ve managed to do it, albeit with trepidation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san was very grateful for the care I provided last time, but considering the favor I’ve received, such a thing doesn’t even count as repayment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Rather, for me to take care of him is just a reward, so it’s not even a burden).</p>

<p class="calibre5">As we left the store and walked through the shopping mall passage, we passed by a shop selling items that matched the taste of the clothes Chifuji-san was wearing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why not look for clothes for Chifuji-san as well since we’re here? How about this store?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah… “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He hesitated, then eventually answered with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Actually…I’m embarrassed to say it, but I have hardly any experience buying clothes for myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh, is that so? But you always wear things that suit you well.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today is the same.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He is dressed in mature attire, centered around a shirt with a clean design.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s what people call neat fashion, and it suits him well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“They are all hand-me-downs from my uncle. …Ah, I mean, the store manager.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, is that so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My reply has a double meaning. About the clothes, and… so, he is not just a manager at a part-time job but a relative.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I still don’t know much about this person after all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…This phrase has a double meaning too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Literally, and that’s why I want to know more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, I’m feeling shaky again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m also unsure about my outfits.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not true, you look great.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My footing is shaking and unstable, making me restless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? I am relieved to hear you say that, but I really have no sense of fashion.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san, standing next to me, looks down at his own clothing and says this with a groan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have to be proper, so I hope I at least appear somewhat like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Be proper, he says.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I remember hearing those words before.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『What am I doing…I need to be proper.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">While shedding tears on the bed, he said that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um… Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why do you have to be proper?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The question naturally escapes my lips, and my premonitions come too late.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though they warn me that once something’s done, there’s no turning back, they only come after the words have left my tongue.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san smiles very naturally.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not a big reason. It’s just that if I am proper, if I continue to be so, maybe someday, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He continued.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;might feel that it was good that I was born, haha, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;It was as if he was answering a question about a show he watched yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those words were uttered in a tone as light as if he was answering a question about today’s menu or responding to a query about tomorrow’s weather.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In truth, he had an expression that made it seem as if he was completely unaware that he was saying something special.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a thud,</p>
<p class="calibre5">The ground beneath my wobbly feet crumbled, and I fell</p>
<p class="calibre5">My body, my heart, and my soul can distinctly feel it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Falling, continuously falling&mdash;&mdash;I am falling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sweat trickled down my back, the deafening noise of my heartbeat, and an itching, frustrating sensation rose deep within my stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah…</p>
<p class="calibre5">The room for uncertainty, for things being unclear, that existed just a moment ago, now, not even an inch the size of a pinky toe remains.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I, who am falling, open my mouth while enveloped in this floating sensation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ring- ring- ring-</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…S-sorry. …It might be from my sister.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, please go ahead and answer.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I barely came to my senses to the ringing of my smartphone, which started ringing at an incredible timing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: Here, “falling” is used figuratively, probably means falling emotionally.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, then just a moment…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I will be looking around the shop, so take your time.”</p>


<p class="calibre5">I think to myself as I quickly move away from the front of the shop, leaving Chifuji-san behind… what was I about to say just now?</p>

<p class="calibre5">While taking a deep breath at the end of the aisle, I somehow manage to answer the call with a feverish head,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Hello, Onee-chan? Did you buy it? How is it? How is the real thing?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m at the shop buying it right now. A T-shirt and a hoodie, right? They’re cute, I think they’ll suit Shion.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Really~~?! I’m excited!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">While smirking at the voice, which is more excited than usual,… somehow, calmness returns to my brain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I suddenly realize it as the surrounding colors start to become visible again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shion, thank you…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…? Why? Why is Onee-chan saying thank you?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah… no, sorry, haha, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…? That’s weird.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I cut off the conversation, saying that it was probably late at night there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Phewwww.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Exhaling deeply, deeply. Just thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What should I do~!</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, what should I do!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What should one do in such situations, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know…!</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not that I don’t understand my own feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They are perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I, to him, to Chifuji-san….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah… haaaa… haaah…haa.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just by recalling his name, face, voice, and words, my heart jumps, and there’s a throbbing pain inside my body.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I did wonder, maybe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That day when he caught a cold and his figure spilling tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s very mature, composed, hardworking… but maybe, inside of him, there’s a place that’s like a small, small child, very fragile and foolishly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And he hadn’t realized it, so I couldn’t comfort him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Words like ‘maybe someday I might feel that it was good that I was born’ said with such an expression, after all, such a thing…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…haa… haaah…haah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s no use, it’s not about logic in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite still having so much to learn about him, the center of my heart is holding onto its own convictions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And it’s becoming unbearable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Once again, I mutter his name.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I want. I, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…N-no, no, no, no, no!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And, just as my thoughts seem to be slipping and falling deeper, I regain a little composure.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ………. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">But as soon as that happened, suddenly, my mood deeply sank.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because…this, actually.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s definitely…impossible for us…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I am shocked by my words, my body leans and my head bangs against the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It hurts. It hurts, but that’s not important.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering what I have done to him so far, the figure I have shown, I am nothing but a troublesome and amusingly eccentric girl!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was stalking him for a whole month in the first place!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahhhhhhhhhh…”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000002.png">

<p class="calibre5">I often hear that first love is unrequited, and I thought carelessly that it might be an exaggeration, but actually, being caught in the whirlpool and drowning is so painful.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Is it not possible to start over from when we first met?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Sigh.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is bad, I am too disheartened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At this rate, I feel like the wall of this shopping mall will become my permanent residence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mustering all of my spirit, I somehow manage to move my body and start walking dejectedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">The situation is so miserable that I’m beginning to think, ‘Let’s think of something good.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Something good, something good…if there is, it is…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I, have fallen in love.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe that’s the only thing I can think of and say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I live with a complex about my abnormalities, and I want to be normal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Therefore, there’s an admiration for ‘Things normal people do, but I can’t.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Love was one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So being able to do something normal like this, I feel like I’ve become a little more upright. …Yes-yes-yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I do think about whether I can start over from when I met Chifuji-san, but with that being said, everything feels like a good direction.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I’ve become able to rely on people, even if it’s just a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a path leading to becoming a normal person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unable to control the feeling of wanting to take care of people, I troubled a total of six club activities during junior high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even now, unrepentantly, I just want to take care of people, I want too much to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know such a thing is abnormal, so I want to be normal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, I don’t think I can become a super spoiled girl like a Jirai-kei (Landmine type), but learning to rely on others a little, and balancing with the too-strong desire to take care of people&mdash;&mdash;that plan is going well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am still abnormal, but I am on the path to becoming better.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That was the relief that is here now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Um, Chifuji-san is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I enter the store and wander around looking for him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This one is also recommended~. It’s very popular now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found him quickly, but it seemed he was talking with the store clerk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was a young woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps her age doesn’t differ much from ours; that’s why there’s a sense of closeness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her approach, with a friendly, bright smile, and her position were close enough for shoulders to touch.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Customer, it will suit your style perfectly~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, that’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it necessary, I wonder. Such a close distance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it necessary, I wonder. Such a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it necessary. Such a…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, hehe, excuse me, customer, your collar.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just by having that female store clerk direct her smile at him, just by being next to him, a dark and heavy mud feeling was welling up inside me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Barely, it was something that could still be concealed inside,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Was it when you tried on the jacket earlier? Excuse me for a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">When she reached out her hand to Chifuji-san’s collar and straightened it while standing, my emotion overflowed, manifesting in a voice deeper than I’ve ever voiced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What? Eh? Why?</p>
<p class="calibre5">But why?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why do you have to do that to him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre5">While my thoughts were spinning in my head, I wasn’t a calm enough person to keep my body still.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, Raihara-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san turns towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At his voice and words, my heart leaps in my chest, and at the sight of the woman next to him, the mud inside my stomach increases.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for keeping you waiting. …Um, who is this person?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s a store clerk in this place, and she’s been helping me out with a few things.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha, I’m sorry, is she your girlfriend? I didn’t mean to interrupt…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The female shop assistant, looking at my face, quickly stiffens her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank God, she gets the message.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Women certainly have a certain hostility towards women.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I take a step closer and say, looking into her eyes,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m sorry for the trouble I’ve caused you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My head almost splits open in anger and frustration at what I have said to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why, huh, why am I taking care of this person?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hear a small gasp from in front of me, and the female store clerk immediately averts her face from me and leaves after saying, “Please, take your time!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry, Chifuji-san. It seems she misunderstood and thought I was your girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, well, I guess that’s what people would think if a man and a woman come shopping together on a holiday.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san smiles refreshingly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that there seems to be no hidden meaning in those words is, unilaterally, very bitter for me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Was it your sister on the phone?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. It was just as I expected.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While answering, I notice what he is holding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, that jacket.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I thought I would buy it since I’m here. It’s the one the shop assistant recommended.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s lightweight and well-made, seems like it can be casually worn in the upcoming season, and I think it suits him well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But… that, chosen by another woman, not me…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…ah… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm, you seem a bit pale.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, that’s…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not feeling unwell; it’s just that the arbitrary anger and irritation from earlier have made me go pale.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“S-sorry, I just feel a little dizzy…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s not good, let’s take a rest.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san believed the lie I spat out, a lie that I, who have never experienced dizziness in my life, had concocted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There are chairs for resting in the aisle; let’s go there. …Can you walk?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..It just came and went suddenly, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a relief. But, let’s rest just in case.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He took me outside the store&mdash;of course, returning the jacket he had in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I knew he would do so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good, it’s available.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chairs are placed beside the aisles, a characteristic of large shopping malls.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After making me sit there, he looks at me with concern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I-I’m really fine, it was just for a moment. …Ahaha, maybe my body is showing a rejection response because I did something I’m not used to.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see, haha, that might be very like you, Raihara-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps to cheer me up, Chifuji-san responds brightly to my words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s a kind person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To such a person, what have I done…doing something like this…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Huh? Something like this?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right, how about something to drink… Raihara-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh, no,… I…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, look at that Jirai-kei (Landmine type)”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously. And it’s kind of weird, isn’t it? It’s so true to my imagination that it’s funny.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;It’s no coincidence that my ears picked up such a voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I heard it because I had to hear it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I reflect on my own actions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Knowing that he would respond kindly, I lied, claiming I felt unwell, just to get the attention of the person I liked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a way of communicating, such a way of seeking affection…</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just like… just like, how should I put it…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…ah?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ra, Raihara-san, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess it’s true what they say about landmines.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You don’t know they’re there until you step on them&mdash;&mdash;</p>
