<h2>Chapter 3: Our Place</h2>


<p>Monday morning, the start of a new week.</p>



<p>As the final bell rang, signaling the end of our homeroom, my classmates promptly began putting away their chairs. It seemed like the preparations for the cultural festival’s play were in full swing.</p>



<p>I approached Nazuna, who was at the center of all the commotion, and gently tapped her shoulder.</p>



<p>“Sorry to bother you while you’re busy. Is there anything I can help with?”</p>



<p>Since we had practiced intensely over the weekend, we decided to give the cheering squad a break. Yua, Asu-nee, and Kenta, in particular, looked quite fatigued, but we had reached a point I thought would take us at least a week. So, taking a day off wouldn’t pose any problem.</p>



<p>Nazuna looked apologetic as she clasped her hands together. “I’m stuck with the script a bit. We can’t start rehearsing yet.”</p>



<p>“No worries,” I shook my head lightly. “Thanks to your suggestion, we’ve made good progress with the cheer squad, and it’s been a real help.”</p>



<p>Nazuna’s face softened with relief. “That’s good to hear. Oh, hey, can you move those props over to the stage, please?”</p>



<p>A girl who was called out responded cheerfully. “Roger that!”</p>



<p>In the midst of giving instructions, Nazuna looked back at me. “Sorry, sorry, it’s a bit chaotic.”</p>



<p>I smiled and replied. “You’re doing a great job.”</p>



<p>In truth, it seemed like Nazuna had taken the lead in organizing the class quite skillfully. I was worried that it might become too burdensome for her, but she seemed to have a knack for it.</p>



<p>Nazuna gave me a mischievous grin. “Surprised, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>Playing along, I replied with a teasing tone. “Well, you do give off the vibe of someone who would say, <em>‘Isn’t the cultural festival boring?</em>‘ or something like that.”</p>



<p>“Seriously?! That’s awful!”</p>



<p>“And then, you’d end up causing conflicts in the class, bursting out in anger and tearing up your costume in the heat of the moment, shouting, ‘<em>Why do you always take things like this so seriously!</em>‘ and storming out of the classroom. But eventually, you’d come back, reflecting on your actions, and take on the role of the dependable cultural festival promise-keeper, right?”</p>



<p>“Why are you suddenly telling such a story?! And I’m not that kind of person!”</p>



<p>We exchanged glances and burst into laughter together.</p>



<p>After a good laugh, Nazuna continued. “When there are other capable people around, I just don’t feel the need to stand out. Besides, I’m looking forward to the cultural festival, and leaving everything to Chitose-kun and the others would leave a bad aftertaste.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but let out a soft smile. “Thanks, Nazuna.”</p>



<p>She tilted her head and playfully looked up at me. “Oh, did that just make your heart skip a beat?”</p>



<p>I smirked in response. “Yeah, I almost fell for you there.”</p>



<p>“Heh, I’m not as serious as Yuuko or Yuzuki,” Nazuna chuckled.</p>



<p>“They’ll get mad if they hear you say that.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s more like I struck a chord with them.”</p>



<p>“So you already told them.”</p>



<p>We looked at each other again and shared a little chuckle.</p>



<p>“Joking aside,” Nazuna spoke up. “Speaking of the script, when we actually started working on it, I realized that adapting Snow White is more challenging than I thought.”</p>



<p>I pondered for a moment before responding. “Well, if you think about it, the heroine sleeps through most of the story.”</p>



<p>“Exactly! But we can’t just omit the part with the poisoned apple, can we?”</p>



<p>“Snow White is all about the magic mirror and the poisoned apple, after all.”</p>



<p>Nazuna shrugged, looking troubled. “That’s the thing. So, for now, just focus on the cheering team. If any of you come up with any great ideas, please let me know. It could be a big help.”</p>



<p>“Understood. I’ll inform Nanase and the others too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll send a message to the group LINE as well.”</p>



<p>I looked around the vibrant and lively classroom and suggested, “Do you need help with carrying materials or any heavy lifting?”</p>



<p>Nazuna sighed with an exasperated expression. “No need, that’s something Atomu and the others can handle. Since Chitose-kun and the others are taking on the main roles, make sure to rest when you can.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Well, I’ll at least drop by and say something before heading home.”</p>



<p>“Okay then, see you tomorrow, Chitose-kun!”</p>



<p>As I lightly raised my hand in response to Nazuna’s words, Atomu entered the classroom, carrying a large plank on his shoulders.</p>



<p>“Hey, looks like you’re really working hard,” I greeted as I approached him, but he shot me an irritated look.</p>



<p>“Tch, she won’t stop talking.”</p>



<p>Following Atomu’s gaze, I saw that he was looking at Nazuna.</p>



<p>I chuckled wryly and spoke. “You know, you seem surprisingly whipped by her.”</p>



<p>“I’m gonna kill you!!!!”</p>



<p>Atomu couldn’t move because of the plank he was carrying, so I took the opportunity to continue teasing.</p>



<p>“I’ll tell Nazuna-chan if you keep using foul language.”</p>



<p>“Shut up! Just die already!”</p>



<p>“Careful, you almost got me there!”</p>



<p>Seriously, he shouldn’t be swinging that board around here. And to think he slyly checked the surroundings first and then aimed only at me.</p>



<p>I quickly changed the topic and asked, “Do you need any help?”</p>



<p>“Like hell I’d ask for your help.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so tsun-tsun.”</p>



<p>“If you’re free, just go home and swing a bat or something.”</p>



<p>“Don’t show kindness all of a sudden. You’re making my heart flutter.”</p>



<p>“I’m more tired dealing with you!!”</p>



<p>Well, if that’s what he said, then I suppose it’s okay.</p>



<p>“Fine, fine. I won’t bother you.”</p>



<p>Just as I was about to leave, Atomu called out to me. “Oi!”</p>



<p>He stopped me in my tracks. “How’s the cheering squad doing?”</p>



<p>His unexpected question made me smile. “Just wait and see. We’ll put on the most amazing performance you’ve ever seen.”</p>



<p>Atomu snorted. “If you’re doing it, make sure not to make it boring.”</p>



<p>“Hey, do you need to end everything with a ‘dere’ moment to be satisfied?”</p>



<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>



<p>Without warning, the plank swung toward me, but I deftly dodged it and quickly made my way out of the classroom.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>As I walked toward the school’s entrance, the whole campus was buzzing with excitement. Everyone seemed to be in a festive mood, with some leaving a couple of buttons undone on their shirts, others wearing slightly shorter skirts, or adorning their hair with colorful accessories. Some had already proudly shown off the class T-shirts they had completed early.</p>



<p>Everywhere, the air was tinged with a sense of celebration.</p>



<p>Half-finished signs and paint cans could be seen here and there, and the sweet aroma of pancakes drifted from a classroom. A group of five students was practicing acapella in the hallway.</p>



<p>Looking down from the window, it was evident that the construction of props in the parking lot was progressing smoothly.</p>



<p>The sound of the brass band playing, quite different from their usual classical pieces, filled the air with familiar hit songs. I wondered if Yua was playing the saxophone properly now. Judging by her appearance today, I had my doubts that she could raise her hands.</p>



<p>Suddenly, memories of my middle school days flooded back, when the brass band had cheered us on during the baseball tournaments. They played theme songs for each player, and during my turn, it was Whiteberry’s “Natsu Matsuri” (Summer Festival). It felt like a scene from the high school tournaments or professional games seen on TV, and it made me so happy.</p>



<p>Lost in nostalgic thoughts, I changed my shoes at the entrance. I realized that somehow, I could now recall baseball memories without any bitterness.</p>



<p>Last year, the preparation period for the school festival felt bland and tasteless. But now, it felt vibrant and alive.</p>



<p>An extraordinary blend of the past, present, and future – The prelude to a long yet short festival. Planning a trip was said to be the most enjoyable part, but the same held for the school festival.</p>



<p>Off-campus festival, sports festival, culture festival – we spent nearly two months working tirelessly for just three days of festivities. When the day finally arrived, it would pass by in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>──That’s why, in the end, when we looked back ten years from now, it would be these days that we cherished the most.</p>



<p>The memories of the off-campus festival, sports festival, and cultural festival would fade away, leaving behind only the moments we shared with our friends.</p>



<p>Not the triumphant performances on the actual day, the excitement of the spectators, or the high scores we received.</p>



<p>Instead, it would be the memories of our training camp at Yuuko’s house, the delicious meals Yua prepared, the dark nights at the park, and everyone’s pajamas. And how on the next day, Kureha and I just couldn’t get out of bed, and my arms were sore from the muscle pain.</p>



<p>Oh, what was the song playing at that time?</p>



<p>Well, it didn’t matter.</p>



<p><em>Tap, tap. </em>I tapped the ground with the tip of my Stan Smith shoes and lifted my head.</p>



<p>I would treasure every moment. I wanted to capture even those fleeting moments I might otherwise overlook, like taking a photo and keeping it stored.</p>



<p>With those thoughts in mind, I stepped out of the entrance…</p>



<p>“Senpai!”</p>



<p>Only to be greeted by Kureha, who had been leaning against a pillar and hurriedly rushed over.</p>



<p>I was slightly surprised and asked, “Is the track and field club on break?”</p>



<p>She energetically replied while adjusting her backpack straps. “Yes!”</p>



<p>It didn’t seem like she just happened to run into me.</p>



<p>“Could it be… were you waiting for me?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>I chuckled at her short and direct responses, then asked, “Um, why…?”</p>



<p>Kureha answered without embarrassment. “I was hoping we could practice our pair dance one more time before the whole team rehearsal.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see…”</p>



<p>Finally, I understood.</p>



<p>Although everyone else had learned the choreography, we were essentially the ones demonstrating the pair dance. Kureha’s dancing was nearly flawless, but it seemed she still felt uneasy.</p>



<p>“Well then, shall we stop by a nearby park on the way home?”</p>



<p>“Yes, please!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>We strolled side by side along the usual riverside path. Today, the cheering squad had a day off, so neither of us had our bicycles. It’s worth mentioning that our houses were in the same direction too.</p>



<p>As we approached the sluice gate, Kureha suddenly suggested, “Senpai, why don’t we practice over there?”</p>



<p>She pointed to the spot where I often talked with Asu-nee when we met. </p>



<p>Before I could respond, Kureha continued excitedly. “You and Asuka-san occasionally chat there. It looks so picturesque and lovely; I’ve always admired it.”</p>



<p>Now that Kureha mentioned it, if she took this route to school, it wouldn’t be surprising if she had spotted us before.</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek, feeling a bit perplexed. “But, you know, it’s quite cramped there. If we accidentally slip and fall into the river, it won’t be funny.”</p>



<p>Maybe I was overthinking it, but when I reminisced about the days I spent with Asu-nee, I couldn’t help but hesitate. Except for the exception of the evening when Yua chased after me, I had never sat in that place with anyone else but Asu-nee.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing my thoughts from my expression, Kureha’s voice softened. “Ah, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>She held onto her shirt’s sleeve, looking apologetic as she continued. “I thought if we waited here, we might run into Asuka-san too.”</p>



<p>She looked up at me, trying her best to appear cheerful. “Let’s go find a park, senpai!”</p>



<p>I felt guilty for making my kouhai in an awkward position. Moreover, Kureha had a point in what she said. If we practiced here, we might indeed run into Asu-nee. And the fact that I was waiting for her made it easier for me to accept the idea.</p>



<p>I was also a bit worried she might have hurt herself with the sudden unfamiliar movements during practice.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s practice while waiting for Asu-nee here.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s face instantly lit up, and she happily narrowed her eyes. “Yes!”</p>



<p>We descended to the middle section of the embankment.</p>



<p>Though it was too early to call it dusk, the sun had begun its descent, casting a gentle glow over the water’s surface. The breeze that rustled the water’s edge now carried a refreshing chill, subtly heralding the arrival of autumn.</p>



<p>Arranging our backpacks along the edge, Kureha started playing music on her smartphone’s speaker.</p>



<p><em>──Splash.</em></p>



<p>A distant sound of water echoed, and suddenly, the surroundings fell into silence. Cars, people, cats, crows—the entire flow of life momentarily paused, creating a blank space akin to a gap in the season.</p>



<p>“Hey, Senpai?”</p>



<p>Kureha gracefully extended her hand, smiling with a mature expression that sent shivers down my spine.</p>



<p>“Let’s start from here.”</p>



<p>For a moment, I held my breath, captivated by her gesture. Then, as if checking the flow of time once more, I shifted my gaze towards the other students walking along the riverbank.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit embarrassing with so many people around,” I joked, attempting to lighten the mood.</p>



<p>Unperturbed by my comment, Kureha spontaneously held my hand, her eyes glistening, and her voice tenderly caressed my ear.</p>



<p>“Why not show them?”</p>



<p>Then, almost like an invitation, she took a step closer, leaning in with perfect grace.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>I, Nishino Asuka, stood before the shoe locker with a buoyant spirit despite the heaviness that burdened my body.</p>



<p>When was the last time I had such obvious muscle soreness?</p>



<p>Upon waking up, even sitting up felt difficult, and seeing myself like that was so absurd that I couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p>



<p>Today was a day off, and I felt a twinge of loneliness. Surely, they must have been considerate of Yua-san, Yamazaki- kun, and me, but I could have joined in on the practice too.</p>



<p>While pondering over such thoughts, I casually reached out to my shoe locker, positioned at the highest spot.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>A muffled scream escaped me.</p>



<p>…Um, sorry, that was a lie just now.</p>



<p>Gently, I rubbed my right arm. It was hurting quite a bit. With this condition, there’s no way I could have had a proper practice. </p>



<p>Did <em>you</em> swing the bat again after you went home?</p>



<p>Sports clubs members were something else, I chuckled wryly.</p>



<p>This time, carefully and slowly, I took out my shoes and wore them before leaving the school.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I was with everyone, but today I was all alone. But starting tomorrow, I could be back within that circle again.</p>



<p><em>Hehe</em>, I chuckled as I touched the corner of my mouth.</p>



<p>Thinking back on those short yet long two days of the training camp, my cheeks involuntarily loosened. Being able to be with you, of course, was wonderful. But what was even more precious was the time we all shared together—with Aomi-san, Yua-san, and everyone else.</p>



<p>Finally, I found my name listed in your story.</p>



<p>And then, I gazed at the sky. I now understood why Saku-kun couldn’t easily make up his feelings.</p>



<p>Each one of you cared for each other and cherished your own place as well as someone else’s.</p>



<p>While talking with Yua-san, I realized something. She should have been using that riverside path as her route to school, but not even once in this past year, while <em>you</em> and I were talking, did she try to approach us.</p>



<p>Of course, there could have been a simple reason, like it being difficult to initiate a conversation. But when I actually talked to Yua-san, I understood.</p>



<p>That kind girl must be respecting our place, our time.</p>



<p>An idea that once crossed my mind now resurfaced with a slightly different form.</p>



<p>The more I got close to all of you, the more I found myself wishing.</p>



<p><em>Could we remain like this forever?</em></p>



<p><em>Did we really have to label ourselves as boys and girls, bound by definitive answers?</em></p>



<p>I understood well that it might be a temporary postponement or an indulgence born out of fear of getting hurt. No matter how painful it was, the day of decision would come eventually. In my case, I had to make some sort of choice within the next six months.</p>



<p>But for now, just a little longer, at least until this school festival was over. I wish I could still be myself, as one of you.</p>



<p>Lost in these thoughts, I found myself at our usual riverside spot.</p>



<p>Maybe, just maybe…</p>



<p>──Today, I might get to see you.</p>



<p>It’s just like Saku-nii, who always took care of everyone. He must be concerned about me, who wasn’t very good at sports.</p>



<p>But because he’s also someone who didn’t express himself easily, he might tease me with remarks like, “Did you manage to change into your uniform properly?” or “Are you having trouble getting through the ticket gate?”</p>



<p>I could get annoyed at him like always, but what if…</p>



<p>For a change, like in those innocent days of summer, I would try relying on you, and you might ask me…</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>To join you… for some pair dancing practice…</p>



<p><em>Thunk! </em>My bag fell to the ground.</p>



<p>As if my feet had suddenly given way, I leaned against the bridge’s guardrail, feeling unsteady.</p>



<p>No way, why?</p>



<p>I blinked my eyes repeatedly, unable to easily accept the scene before me.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>My mind felt strangely awake, yet my heartbeat wouldn’t calm down. My breathing grew shallow, and the more I noticed, the louder my heart pounded.</p>



<p>Because, why there? </p>



<p>In our place, why were you dancing with Nozomi-san?</p>



<p>Entwined like shadows of two moons, connecting and embracing each other────</p>



<p>Were you trampling upon our place?</p>



<p>Who was that woman over there? My heart clenched.</p>



<p>From here, I couldn’t see your face. But the person holding your hand was not the innocent kouhai girl I knew.</p>



<p>That expression, those eyes, that figure…</p>



<p>──A woman exuding intoxicating allure.</p>



<p>In that moment, I found myself silently pleading, “Don’t take him away.” I felt as if she was luring you to a place where neither of us knew, without us even realizing it.</p>



<p>Saku-kun and Nozomi-san.</p>



<p>While watching the two gracefully dancing, a sudden ache pierced my chest.</p>



<p>Like the waxing and waning of the moon. Every moment we spent together, every word we exchanged, even the tears we shed, they all came together and swelled up.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Nozomi-san noticed me and stopped dancing, waving her hands enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Asuka-saaan!”</p>



<p>The bewitching aura dissipated like an illusion, revealing the innocent face of the underclassman who spent these two days with me.</p>



<p>That’s right; I must have been overthinking things. It was too early for this ominous feeling. Maybe fatigue hadn’t completely left me yet.</p>



<p>I picked up my bag and walked down to where they were, waving my hand slightly.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Nozomi-san smiled happily. “We’ve been waiting for you, Asuka-san!”</p>



<p>Yeah, that’s probably it.</p>



<p>Why was I being so worked up?</p>



<p>Saku-kun seemed a bit embarrassed. “Kureha wanted to practice the pair dance a bit more. We were hoping we’d get to see you if we practiced here.”</p>



<p>Yeah, I had a feeling I would see you today too. If you were thinking the same, I was happy.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump────</em></p>



<p>Nozomi-san spoke with excitement. “This place has such a fantastic atmosphere!”</p>



<p>Crunching the gravel beneath her feet, she innocently approached me.</p>



<p>“Hey, Asuka-san? Can I join you from now on too?”</p>



<p>“..it.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t tell whose voice slipped out, but before I could grasp the situation fully…</p>



<p>“St-stop it!!!!!!”</p>



<p>I found myself shouting in a voice that was almost trembling, clutching my fist tightly.</p>



<p>“”Eh…?””</p>



<p>Both Saku-kun and Nozomi-san looked puzzled.</p>



<p>“Uh…?”</p>



<p>I, what on earth…</p>



<p>The expressions of Saku-kun and Nozomi-san sank rapidly.</p>



<p>No, wait, I didn’t mean to say that…</p>



<p>Saku-kun bit his lip, looking like a scolded child. “Sorry, Asu-nee. It’s just, well…”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san cut in, bowing her head, her tone polite as if trying to suppress her agitation.</p>



<p>“Asuka-san, I sincerely apologize for getting carried away. I knew this place was special for both of you.”</p>



<p>Please, don’t apologize like that. It was my…</p>



<p>Still bowing, Nozomi-san continued. “But Senpai did nothing wrong. I forced my request upon him, so he just reluctantly went along. So, if anyone should be blamed, it should be me alone.”</p>



<p>It was hard to breathe, my heart won’t calm down.</p>



<p>How did I usually breathe?</p>



<p>Now was the time when I should speak up. Apologize for my mistake, maybe lighten the mood with a joke like Saku-kun would, and then…</p>



<p>Saku-kun’s voice was on the verge of tears. “No, it’s not like I wasn’t considering you, Asu-nee…”</p>



<p>Unable to bear your sad expression, I interrupted. “I’m sorry!”</p>



<p>I cut off his words midway.</p>



<p>“Tomorrow, I’ll apologize to both of you. If possible, please forget about today!”</p>



<p>I lowered my head abruptly and ran away.</p>



<p>“Asu-nee!”</p>



<p>“Asuka-san!”</p>



<p>Ah, how wretched I was.</p>



<p>As their voices lingered behind me, I ponder.</p>



<p>I naively believed that there was no need to define ourselves as boys and girls, seeking definitive answers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/168080.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>I had been indulging in the thought of staying like this for a while longer.</p>



<p>Unable to stop the tears streaming down, I ran as if trying to shake them off.</p>



<p>Was I not just a hopeless girl in love too?</p>



<p>I was ashamed of how I jealousy lashed out at the innocent kouhai, hurting her — unworthy of being a senpai.</p>



<p>That place wasn’t a special spot for you and me. It was just an ordinary riverside where anyone could sit and relax.</p>



<p>What on earth did I misunderstand?</p>



<p>There was nothing certain, no exclusive seat reserved for me.</p>



<p>Coughing and wheezing, I sought oxygen.</p>



<p>It was painful, heartbreaking, sad, and infuriating — I wish I could vanish like a fleeting dream.</p>



<p>I’ve always, surely, and forever,</p>



<p>──wanted to be your Asu-nee.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>On Monday night, I, Nanase Yuzuki, called Chitose on the phone. I wanted to discuss some details of the cheering squad’s upcoming group practice.</p>



<p>The dial tone was longer than usual before he picked up.</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p><em>“…Yeah, what’s up</em>?”</p>



<p>With just those words, I sensed something was off. His response was slower than usual, and his voice sounded heavy.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>After a brief silence, Chitose finally spoke, sounding hesitant.</p>



<p><em>“…No, it’s nothing, forget it.”</em></p>



<p>“Just spit it out.”</p>



<p>Another short silence followed my words. Chitose hesitated and then mumbled softly.</p>



<p><em>“I was thoughtless.”</em></p>



<p>“Well, being thoughtless is nothing new for you.”</p>



<p>Only then did our usual banter resume, and a smile-like sigh escaped him. Seeming to resign himself, Chitose confessed;</p>



<p><em>“I managed to upset Asu-nee.”</em></p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>His words caught me completely off guard. Judging from Chitose’s demeanor, it seemed more than just a minor quarrel.</p>



<p>It was hard to imagine the calm and composed Nishino-senpai showing her emotions so openly, but…</p>



<p>“Chitose, uh, just to make sure, did you start with a soft kiss?”</p>



<p><em>“Why are you suddenly sounding so serious?”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Chitose seemed to relax a bit.</p>



<p><em>“Thanks, Nanase. Talking to you distracted me a little.”</em></p>



<p>“Turning serious matters into silly jokes is something I learned from someone.”</p>



<p><em>“I see, I’ll make sure to thank that person later.”</em></p>



<p>With that, I continued. “So, what happened?”</p>



<p><em>“It’s kind of embarrassing to talk about…”</em></p>



<p>Chitose slowly recounted what happened after school today. I could understand both sides, but it was a bit disheartening.</p>



<p>Both Kureha and Chitose were thinking about Nishino-senpai, but somehow, their perspectives didn’t align perfectly…</p>



<p>After listening to everything, I finally spoke up.</p>



<p>“To be honest, it’s just a misunderstanding with no one at fault.”</p>



<p>I could understand Nishino-senpai’s frustration that must have felt like losing her place when she saw Chitose and Kureha dancing together, just like when I saw them.</p>



<p>Even though Kureha was just an innocent underclassman, or rather, precisely because she was an innocent underclassman──</p>



<p>For a brief moment, Nishino-senpai must have felt anxious, afraid that Kureha’s innocent charm might disrupt our harmony, afraid that an unwary step would disrupt our brief moment of peace.</p>



<p>I let out a sigh, exasperated at how easily I found myself empathizing with her.</p>



<p>“I bet Nishino-senpai is cooling down now and feeling sorry.”</p>



<p><em>“It’s me who should be sorry…”</em></p>



<p>True, Kureha was quite fond of Chitose, but her attitude was the same towards all of us. In fact, she seemed more nervous when talking to Mizushino.</p>



<p>After being exposed to such attention countless times, I became quite sensitive to romantic undertones. Even from my perspective, Kureha’s behavior towards Chitose, though not entirely without motives, still seemed to be within the boundaries of an affectionate kouhai.</p>



<p><em>Furthermore</em>, I inwardly sighed.</p>



<p>A guy like him, who resembled me so much, could never be that oblivious. Even when I proposed being fake lovers, he built layer upon layer of precautions against any romantic implications. If she had shown any signs of flirtation, he would have drawn a clear line himself.</p>



<p>That’s probably why Chitose couldn’t be too dismissive of Kureha.</p>



<p>“Tomorrow, Nishino-senpai will probably apologize first. Then you and Kureha can apologize, and everything will be resolved. Don’t take it too seriously.”</p>



<p><em>“I was actually thinking to reach out and apologize first…”</em></p>



<p>“No, that would just corner her even more. It’s better to hold off.”</p>



<p>If I were in her shoes, I’d feel even worse if I made someone apologize when I was in the wrong.</p>



<p><em>“…Is that so?”</em></p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>After that, we briefly discussed the plan for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Finally, Chitose said with a slightly relieved tone. <em>“Thanks, Nanase.”</em></p>



<p>“Good night, Chitose.”</p>



<p>It’s okay, our September isn’t over yet.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>The following day after school, all club activities were suspended for the school festival preparations.</p>



<p>I, Chitose Saku, along with the rest of the cheering squad from the Blue Team, gathered at the second gymnasium. It was the first time since the briefing that all students, from first-years to third-years, were assembled together.</p>



<p>I was a little nervous about meeting Asu-nee, but as Nanase had assured me, everything went well. As soon as Asu-nee entered the gymnasium, she rushed over to me and Kureha.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry about yesterday! I don’t know what got into me,” she said, bowing her head apologetically.</p>



<p>Kureha and I quickly offered our apologies, and the three of us formed a little circle, bowing and apologizing repeatedly. All in all, we managed to avoid an awkward situation.</p>



<p>Though it wasn’t like a sudden rain shower, seeing Asu-nee happily talking with Kureha put my mind at ease.</p>



<p>Then, we, the second-year students, Asu-nee, Kureha, and I, performed a continuous dance routine as a demonstration. When we finished the paired dance, there was a cheer from the first and third-year students.</p>



<p>“Wow, that was so cool!”</p>



<p>“Our senpais are way too good!”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it a bit unfair for Kureha to be paired up with Chitose-senpai?”</p>



<p>“It seems hard to learn, but once we master it, we’ll definitely win!”</p>



<p>I exchanged glances with Nanase, and a smile spread across our faces. It seemed like everyone was impressed with our performance.</p>



<p>After that, we explained the key points of the choreography to the entire group and divided into smaller teams for individual practice. Having the second-year students, Asu-nee, and Kureha leading the instructions, it made things much smoother and easier. I thought to myself that the training camp was indeed a great idea.</p>



<p>With this progress, I was confident that all of us would be well-prepared by the time of the event.</p>



<p>We continued practicing until just before dusk and decided to call it a day a bit early.</p>



<p>As everyone scattered out of the gym, Haru approached and suggested, “Hey, Chitose, wanna swing by Higashi Park?”</p>



<p>“Sure, what’s up?”</p>



<p>“Let’s play catch for a while. It’s been ages.”</p>



<p>“Ah, true. We’ve been coaching all day,” I said, realizing that without club activities, Haru must be itching to move around.</p>



<p>Haru glanced at Nanase, her partner. “Yuzuki, you coming too? We can grab some katsudon afterward.”</p>



<p>Nanase readily agreed. “Okay.”</p>



<p>Then, Haru turned to Kureha, who had been eagerly listening nearby. “If you’re up for it, Kureha, join us too.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s face lit up. “Really!?”</p>



<p>Haru puffed her chest confidently, “Of course, Haru-chan will teach you the secrets of playing catch, rookie.”</p>



<p>“Aren’t you still a rookie yourself?” I couldn’t help but interject, but her statement brought a small smile to my face.</p>



<p>Despite my worries after the incident with Asu-nee, it seemed like everyone was accepting Kureha as their kouhai without any issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>In this moment, I, Aomi Haru, found myself content with the current state of our relationship.</p>



<p>A partner, a kouhai, and then there’s you, my beloved – we all rode our bikes together along the twilight road.</p>



<p>Just like Yuzuki had her own special place, as well as Nishino-senpai and everyone else, I also had a summer that we reached together.</p>



<p>Even if the seasons had passed, the passion still remained within my heart.</p>



<p>Though Chitose had settled matters with baseball for now, I still occasionally invited him to play catch, and that was because I wanted to be reassured.</p>



<p>This place, where I belonged, and the unique bond we shared together, I wanted to confirm that it was something only I had.</p>



<p>After riding for a while, we arrived at Higashi Park, and suddenly, I remembered something and turned to my partner.</p>



<p>“Hey, Nana, Mai will be coming to practice the day after tomorrow, by the way.”</p>



<p>Yuzuki furrowed her brow with a puzzled look. “What for?”</p>



<p>“Uhm… just to hang out, I guess?”</p>



<p>“And what do you two think our home-court is?”</p>



<p>I laughed off her comment and put on my glove. It was funny how the glove, once so rigid, had become much softer and more pliable lately.</p>



<p>It was almost as if it was become similar to the two of us – The thought made me smile absentmindedly.</p>



<p>Yuzuki and Kureha took a seat on a nearby bench. Observing them, I thought that this was how it should be.</p>



<p>Though there had been similar opportunities before, Yuzuki had never once joined us in playing catch. She was naturally talented in sports, even more agile and adept than me, so I was sure sure she would excel once she started.</p>



<p>Just watching would undoubtedly become dull, and above all, there was no way she wouldn’t want to experience Chitose’s world at least once.</p>



<p><em>Nevertheless</em>, I held the ball in my hand.</p>



<p>Yuzuki never crossed that line. Perhaps she thought it was my territory. </p>



<p>Just like I knew that Yuzuki frequented Chitose’s home, I refrained from following suit, almost as if we were dutifully maintaining our roles.</p>



<p>Between love and friendship, everyone seemed to strike a delicate balance.</p>



<p>“Let’s go!”</p>



<p>With those words, I threw the ball. Though it still had a slight curve, my control had improved considerably.</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>The ball landed safely in Chitose’s glove.</p>



<p>“Nice pitch,” he complimented, swiftly throwing it back.</p>



<p>Lately, his pitches had gained a bit more speed, and I was delighted to be praised for my progress.</p>



<p>With determination, I extended my glove, but in my haste, I accidentally hit it with my thumb, making it bounce away.</p>



<p>Kureha quickly retrieved the rolling ball, “Here you go, Haru-san.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Chitose glanced our way. “You’re still trying to catch the ball. It should be about positioning yourself on the trajectory and waiting for it to come to you.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh, snap.</em></p>



<p><em>─Swoosh, snap.</em></p>



<p>The catch between the two of us, meant to encourage Chitose, had unexpectedly become a precious moment for me as well.</p>



<p>Back on the day of the opening ceremony, I felt a pang of jealousy by Yuzuki’s secret talk with him, but it didn’t matter now.</p>



<p>This was something only he and I could share, something neither Uchi, Yuuko, nor Nishino-senpai could have.</p>



<p>It was our special secret.</p>



<p>When Chitose was in a good mood, he threw curveballs and high flies with confidence. When he was upset, his pitches felt a bit erratic. And when he looked at me, a warm ball landed gently in my chest.</p>



<p>This was a secret that no other girl knew, and it belonged to me alone. Right now, that’s enough to fill my heart.</p>



<p>As we continued our catch for a while, I suddenly remembered the presence of our kouhai.</p>



<p>Oops, I unintentionally neglected her along with Yuzuki.</p>



<p>I waved and called out, “Kureha!”</p>



<p>“Yes!” Kureha happily rushed over.</p>



<p>I took off my glove and suggested, “If you’re up for it, wanna give it a try?”</p>



<p>“Really!?”</p>



<p>Normally, I wouldn’t let an average girl do something like this, as it could be risky. But after observing her during the training camp, I knew she’s as talented and agile as Yuzuki. Chitose would adjust his throws accordingly, so there shouldn’t be any problem.</p>



<p>Kureha’s face lit up with excitement as she put on the glove. She placed the ball on her palm and rolled it around, seemingly fascinated by it.</p>



<p>As memories of my past self flooded in, I began to speak. “Listen, Kureha-kun. It’s a common pattern among girls, but unlike shot-put, you don’t push the ball out. Instead, twist your body and pull the opposite hand when you throw!”</p>



<p>Kureha raised her face and smiled, eager to try. “Got it! I understand!”</p>



<p>Chitose, standing at a distance, interjected with an exasperated tone. “Sounds like something I’ve heard before.”</p>



<p>The three of us burst into laughter, and Kureha took her stance.</p>



<p>Wait, she’s taking her stance…?</p>



<p>It was as if she transformed into a pitcher, she swung her arm back, lifted her leg high, expanded her body like a fan, bended her arm like a bow, and released the ball like an arrow.</p>



<p><em>─Whish.</em></p>



<p><em>─Thwack.</em></p>



<p>Chitose’s glove made a dry, crisp sound as the ball landed in it.</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>Unable to process the scene unfolding before my eyes, I involuntarily let out a dumbfounded voice. Chitose seemed equally stunned, staring at the ball nestled in his glove.</p>



<p>Kureha’s form and the pitch she threw might not be on par with the serious baseball player, but they certainly exuded a sense of expertise akin to a casual catch.</p>



<p><em>─Thump.</em></p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Suddenly, my left chest throbbed.</p>



<p>Playing with the ball in his hand, Chitose spoke. “What’s this, Kureha? Are you experienced in baseball?”</p>



<p>Kureha frantically shook both hands, denying. “No way! My big brother used to play Little League, and he often made me be his catch partner or batting pitcher.”</p>



<p>…What? That’s unfair.</p>



<p>“Really? You’re pretty good without any proper coaching.”</p>



<p>Don’t compliment her like that. Please don’t.</p>



<p>“My brother likes to teach, and I loved sports so I picked things up quickly.”</p>



<p>Yeah, she learned dance routines faster than me too.</p>



<p>Chitose seemed to be in high spirits as he said. “So, is this your first time with a hardball?”</p>



<p>Kureha hesitated slightly before nodding. “Yes… It’s even harder than I expected, and it’s a bit scary. You’re amazing, Haru-san.”</p>



<p>I didn’t need your pity. Who was I to give advice like I was some know-it-all? I must looked ridiculous.</p>



<p>Chitose smirked and said, “Then let’s start with something lighter.”</p>



<p>He threw the ball back to Kureha.</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>He said lighter, but why…</p>



<p><em>─Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Why did he throw a ball almost the same speed as before when he was throwing to me?</p>



<p><em>─Snap.</em></p>



<p>Kureha smoothly caught it and said, “This is still totally fine!”</p>



<p><em>Totally fine?</em> I bit my lip.</p>



<p>Without making a big deal out of it, Kureha quickly and gracefully returned the ball. It smoothly landed in Chitose’s glove, and he gave her a mischievous grin.</p>



<p>“Can I go a little harder?”</p>



<p>“Yes! Bring it on!”</p>



<p>As Chitose threw a faster ball to test her,</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh, thwack.</em></p>



<p>Kureha caught it effortlessly and sent it back with ease.</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh, thwack.</em></p>



<p>Chitose’s mouth curled into a smirk. “Looks like you can handle more.”</p>



<p>“Let’s keep going until we can’t!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe this.</p>



<p><em>─Swoosh, snap.</em></p>



<p><em>─Swish, thwack.</em></p>



<p>Chitose sounded delighted with every throw. “How about this?”</p>



<p>“I’m ready!”</p>



<p><em>─Whoosh, thwack.</em></p>



<p>“Your control is impressive, Kureha.”</p>



<p>“I won’t bore you, senpai.”</p>



<p>This was no ordinary child’s secret play. Kureha caught Chitose’s throws with ease, returning them as fluidly as a gentle stream.</p>



<p><em>─Swoooosh.</em></p>



<p>Perhaps getting caught up in the moment, Kureha’s throw veered off wildly. Somewhere in the distance, a version of myself watched with dispassionate eyes, smirking wickedly.</p>



<p>Chitose leaped sideways, trying to catch the ball mid-air. He nimbly caught the ball with his glove, gracefully rolled over, and returned the throw while still kneeling.</p>



<p>This time, Chitose’s throw went awry, and Kureha jumped.</p>



<p>──This felt like an elegant dance between just the two of them.</p>



<p>Kureha’s skirt fluttered, revealing her alluring thighs. Suddenly, I couldn’t help but see my kouhai as a girl.</p>



<p>Her soft lips, gently swaying chest, slim waist, curvaceous hips, and long, slender legs. Under the fading evening sky, facing Chitose, she looked so beautiful that it made me want to cry.</p>



<p>It’s not fair.</p>



<p>Unconsciously, my fists clenched so tightly that my nails dug into my palm.</p>



<p>Please, don’t take away my only strength.</p>



<p>Chitose smirked, resembling a playful baseball boy. “I think you could really play as a batting-pitcher.”</p>



<p>Please, don’t show that face to other girls.</p>



<p>“If you wish, Senpai, I’ll be your pitching partner anytime!”</p>



<p>If you wish for it, then wish for me.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s fine. Atomu is such a pain anyway.”</p>



<p>Hey, I’m right here.</p>



<p>“Then, I’ll be your partner!”</p>



<p>I was supposed to be your partner, not────</p>



<p>The summer we arrived at together was now being dyed by autumn. The trees gradually burst into colors, and soon they would wither away.</p>



<p>Our season was drifting apart.</p>



<p>Don’t go, don’t leave me behind, look at me.</p>



<p>“…back.”</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I was closing in on Kureha.</p>



<p>“Give it back, NOW!!!”</p>



<p>I snatched the glove from those delicate hands.</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>Both of our breaths hung in the air, and I suddenly snapped back to reality.</p>



<p>Wait, what did I just…?</p>



<p>Kureha looked at me with frightened eyes. It must have hurt when I forcibly yanked the glove from her hand. She discreetly rubbed her left hand, trying not to draw attention to the pain.</p>



<p>Her concern for me pierced my heart with regret and overwhelming remorse, making me want to run away.</p>



<p><em>─Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>With a sorrowful gaze, she spoke in a feeble voice that seemed like that of a different person.</p>



<p>“Um, Haru-san, did I handle your glove too roughly?”</p>



<p>No, that’s not it. You didn’t do anything wrong, so please, don’t make that face.</p>



<p><em>─Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>My heart wouldn’t calm down, and my chest tightened. I need to apologize quickly, maybe turn it into a joke. But the more I tried to think of something to say, the words wouldn’t come out.</p>



<p>As if trying to ease this atmosphere somehow, Chitose opened his mouth with a forced, cheerful tone.</p>



<p>“What’s with you, Haru? Jealous because Kureha is good?”</p>



<p>I could tell exactly what he thought. He was trying to brush it off, right? I should just go along with it, laugh it off, and retort as I usually did.</p>



<p>But I’m sorry, that’s…</p>



<p>“Enough already!!!”</p>



<p>That’s just the<em> truth</em>.</p>



<p>I held the glove tightly and dashed away, escaping from it all.</p>



<p>“Haru!”</p>



<p>“Haru-san!”</p>



<p>Chitose, I’m sorry.</p>



<p>Kureha, I’m sorry.</p>



<p>If I could go back to being myself, I would definitely apologize later.</p>



<p>At the corner of my vision, I caught a glimpse of Yuzuki, who looked like she wanted to say something.</p>



<p>I knew, even without looking at her, I already knew.</p>



<p>Gripping my enamel bag, I stuffed the glove inside as if to hide it and hopped on my bicycle. I pedaled, trying to leave behind the blurred sight.</p>



<p>What am I doing?</p>



<p>I was the one who invited Kureha while thinking that I was the only one suitable for Chitose and underestimated other girls.</p>



<p>Then getting upset if she turned out to be better, how pathetic was that?</p>



<p>But, but… I just couldn’t bear to give up this place.</p>



<p>Huffing and panting, it finally dawned on me.</p>



<p>There’s no such thing as an unchanging relationship. A love that only continued to yearn for someone was impossible.</p>



<p>A summer that we arrived together? Stop spouting sugary words, it was all just a coincidence.</p>



<p>Back then, in that July, it was just a coincidence that I was by Chitose’s side. If Kureha was in the same grade, in the same class…</p>



<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!”</p>



<p>──I wanted to be your one and only partner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/168081.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>


<p><em>Ugh, that idiot.</em></p>



<p>I, Nanase Yuzuki, unintentionally clicked my tongue and stood up. Then I rushed to Kureha’s side almost at the same time as Chitose.</p>



<p>Placing my hand on her trembling shoulder, I reassured her. “Don’t worry, it’s not your fault.”</p>



<p>Kureha looked at me with anxious eyes, “Yuzuki-san, I…”</p>



<p>“It’s okay, she’ll cool down soon. I’ll give her a scolding then.”</p>



<p>As I comforted the kouhai who had lowered her eyes, my thoughts turned to my partner.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s not it.</p>



<p>I understood feeling uneasy. It was natural that she got shaken up a bit. But the bond she and Chitose had built over time wasn’t so fragile that it crumbled over a good catch.</p>



<p><em>Still</em>, I thought with a small shrug of my shoulders.</p>



<p>Even after August passed, we all thought we had returned to a calm stagnation, but we now realized that our relationship was built on a precarious balance.</p>



<p>Yesterday with Nishino-senpai, and now, with the innocent presence of a kouhai we hadn’t known for long, it seemed that balance was being exposed.</p>



<p>I let out a short sigh and opened my mouth. “Chitose.”</p>



<p>When I called his name, he looked at me with an awkward expression.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry too much about it.”</p>



<p>Chitose said hesitantly, “Maybe I got too carried away…”</p>



<p>“No,” I shook my head slowly and replied. “Neither you nor Kureha did anything wrong. I’m sure she knows that too.”</p>



<p>“That’s why,” I continued. “She’ll probably apologize later, so don’t take it too seriously and just forgive her. Sorry to ask this, but can I count on you for this, Kureha?”</p>



<p>The two of them looked at each other and nodded.</p>



<p>“…I understand.”</p>



<p>“…Yes.”</p>



<p><em>This is so troublesome</em>, I thought as I furrowed my eyebrows.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>After school the next day, I, Chitose Saku, walked alongside Yua towards the school entrance.</p>



<p>By the way, Haru had been profusely apologizing since early in the morning. Following Nanase’s advice, I didn’t take it too seriously and replied playfully, <em>“Looks like you need intense training not to be outdone by Kureha.” </em>Haru responded with an enthusiastic <em>“Absolutely!”</em></p>



<p>We left it at that, keeping the exchange light-hearted.</p>



<p>At lunchtime, Haru quickly finished her <em>bento</em> and made a beeline for Kureha’s classroom, swiping my baseball glove on her way.</p>



<p>I was concerned, so I decided to follow, only to find Haru dragging along a flustered kouhai, where she once again apologized sincerely.</p>



<p>It must have been her way of making up.</p>



<p>Afterward, the two of them spent the entire lunch break playing catch together. It was reassuring to see them both had a straightforward, sporty nature. But the way Haru approached Kureha might have been an audacious way to treat a kouhai she was scolding.</p>



<p>“Saku-kun, are you troubled by something?” Yua, who was walking beside me, asked.</p>



<p>I shook my head briefly and replied. “No, it was already resolved.”</p>



<p>Today, Yua didn’t have club activities or cheering practice, so we had made plans to go grocery shopping as usual.</p>



<p>We changed into our regular shoes and as we stepped out of the school entrance, we stumbled upon Nanase and Kureha conversing in their practice uniforms. Perhaps the former was making sure everything was alright after yesterday’s incident.</p>



<p>Since it didn’t feel like the right atmosphere for the three of us to happily eat katsudon together, we decided to part ways at Higashi Park yesterday. I ended up walking Kureha home, as Nanase had asked, but Kureha seemed quite down due to the continued issue with Asu-nee, so I was worried.</p>



<p>When Kureha noticed us, she called out happily. “Senpai, Yua-san!”</p>



<p>As we were approaching the two of them, she continued with a beaming smile. “Are you two going somewhere together?”</p>



<p>Yua was the one to answer. “Yeah, we’re going to buy daily necessities and groceries, then I’ll prepare some dishes that can be stored at Saku-kun’s place.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see! Uh, well…” Kureha started to say something but hesitated, falling silent awkwardly.</p>



<p>She then forced a bright smile and waved her hands, “Never mind, it’s nothing!”</p>



<p>Perhaps she was about to ask if she could join us as well, but she held back, probably thinking about Asu-nee’s situation and Haru’s. Though I wanted to invite her, as she had mentioned wanting to visit my place before, I found it a bit difficult to bring up the subject.</p>



<p>While contemplating this, Yua, who was beside me, spoke up. “If you’d like, Kureha-chan, you can come too.”</p>



<p>Kureha hesitated and asked back. “Um, are you sure it’s okay…?”</p>



<p>Yua glanced at me as if it was no big deal and said, “It’s fine, right, Saku-kun?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but loosen my cheeks and nodded. “I don’t mind at all.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes sparkled with joy. “I’ll head there right after club activities end! Senpai, please send me your address!”</p>



<p>Yua nodded with a gentle smile. “We’ll wait until you arrive to start preparing dinner.”</p>



<p>Nanase, who had been silently observing the exchange, raised her hand. “Can I come too?”</p>



<p>I looked at Yua, and we both replied simultaneously. “Of course.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>After finishing our shopping, I, Uchida Yua, entered Saku-kun’s house and carefully aligned my shoes by the entrance.</p>



<p>I quietly murmured, “I’m home,” inside my heart.</p>



<p>Carrying the eco-bags in both hands, I made my way to the kitchen. When I saw my chair neatly placed there, I couldn’t help but let a smile grace my face. It had been a while since that day, but it was still there – the space Saku-kun had prepared, just for me.</p>



<p>Even though I hadn’t put away the groceries yet, I couldn’t wait any longer and gently sat down. The seat was neither exceptionally comfortable nor entirely familiar, but my heart somehow was warm.</p>



<p>What should I cook today? And what about for tomorrow? Or the day after?</p>



<p>I enjoyed this time spent in this room, contemplating the menu, it was like writing my plans into Saku-kun’s calendar.</p>



<p>Even if he went on a date with Yuuko-chan, hung out at the café with Yuzuki-chan, practiced with Haru-chan, or chatted with Asuka-senpai, when he came back here to eat, he’d surely think of me a little.</p>



<p>I didn’t want to be someone special, and I didn’t want to let go of this ordinary. If everyone cherished this September in the same way, then all the more reason to do so.</p>



<p>Until the day I must face the “someday”, just a little longer.</p>



<p><em>──This is enough, this is what I want.</em></p>



<p>Saku-kun chuckled when he saw me not immediately starting to tidy up or prepare as usual.</p>



<p>“Want some barley tea?” he asked.</p>



<p>I suddenly felt embarrassed and stood up quickly. “No, it’s fine, I’ll do it myself,” I replied while looking up at him.</p>



<p>“Alright. I’ll be reading then. Call me if you need any help.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun played music on the Tivoli Audio and headed towards the sofa. The speakers began to fill the room with Hanaregumi’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93zsGUiPb8">Kazoku no Fukei</a>“.</p>



<p>It was a scene I had grown so accustomed to, and for some reason, it brought a comforting feeling as I started organizing the groceries – what to use today, what to freeze later, and what to share between my home and this house. It was a routine I always handled efficiently.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Saku-kun spoke up. “Yua, can I ask you something?”</p>



<p>“Sure.”</p>



<p>“What do you think of Kureha?”</p>



<p>I tilted my head curiously. It was rare for him to seek advice on personal relationships from me. He was someone who made decisions about the people he wanted to be with or couldn’t be with on his own.</p>



<p>After pondering for a moment, I replied. “Um, she’s a straightforward and adorable kouhai, I think…”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Saku-kun agreed. “Sorry, that was a weird question.”</p>



<p>I wondered if he had something on his mind. Now that he mentioned it, under normal circumstances, Saku-kun would have instantly invited Kureha-chan, regardless of my opinion. Instead, it was me who asked, and it felt a bit unnatural.</p>



<p>Was he still hesitant about being kind to girls? If that were the case, he didn’t need to be so guarded with Kureha-chan.</p>



<p>Either way, I chuckled at the thought. It was part of who Saku-kun was, including these little quirks.</p>



<p><em>──Chop, chop, chop.</em></p>



<p>As I sliced the cucumbers diagonally for pickling, I opened my mouth. “Sorry to ask so suddenly. Saku-kun, could you roll up my sleeves, please?”</p>



<p>It was a recurring event that I always forgot, or perhaps subconsciously trying to forget.</p>



<p>“Sure thing,” he replied without showing any signs of annoyance, rolling up my shirt sleeves from behind.</p>



<p>Suddenly, his scent brushed against my nostrils. It tickled, and my shoulders trembled slightly in response.</p>



<p>Saku-kun casually whispered near my ear, “Yua, a bite of cucumber?”</p>



<p>My body tensed slightly, and I responded as nonchalantly as possible. “It’s not flavored yet, though.”</p>



<p>“Just lightly add some mayonnaise and shichimi spice, and a drop of soy sauce.”</p>



<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>



<p>I spread mayo and shichimi on the cucumber slice and added a drop of soy sauce. “Here you go.”</p>



<p>I picked up the cucumber with my right hand, holding it out around my left ear without turning back.</p>



<p><em>—Chomp.</em></p>



<p>As Saku-kun took a bite, his moist lips lightly brushed against my fingertips.</p>



<p><em>—Crunch, crunch.</em></p>



<p>Completely oblivious to my now familiar fluster, he nonchalantly munched on the cucumber, the sound of his chewing slowly fading away.</p>



<p>You’re truly something else.</p>



<p>I lowered the corner of my eye discreetly and gripped the knife again.</p>



<p>And so, after a bit of this and that, I spent around two hours finishing the preparations. Normally, by this time, Saku-kun would sense that it was almost over and came to help with the dishes…</p>



<p>However, when I glanced at the sofa, you’re there, with your fingers still marking its spot in a half-read paperback, sleeping sideways.</p>



<p>The warm evening sunlight filtered through the window draped over him like a blanket.</p>



<p>Approaching the sofa, I quietly crouched down and gazed at your sleeping face. I gently pushed aside a strand of hair that was fallen across your eyes.</p>



<p>“Mmm…”</p>



<p>He mumbled softly, his lips moving as if tickled. Despite being a boy, his long eyelashes fluttered down, casting a faint shadow.</p>



<p>This is one of those moments, I think.</p>



<p>The times when your guarded facade slipped, and you unexpectedly showed vulnerability.</p>



<p>No matter where, who, or how you spent your time, Saku-kun…</p>



<p>I hope at least these moments where you could nap soundly, accompanied by the sounds of knives and pots, could remain as a something special, something granted only to me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>After passing seven o’clock by a while, Yuzuki-chan and Kureha-chan arrived. Apparently, they had arranged to come together after their club activities.</p>



<p>Yuzuki-chan raised her hand to her face and apologized. “Sorry, I came empty-handed.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun, seated on the sofa, replied. “We’ve got the ingredients for the meal and there are drinks too, so don’t worry.”</p>



<p>Kureha-chan surveyed the room with evident curiosity. “So, this is Senpai’s place! I’m a little impressed.”</p>



<p>Yuzuki-chan, looking at ease, set down her enamel bag and took a seat on the sofa.</p>



<p>Saku-kun turned to Kureha-chan. “Just find a spot and relax. If you’re thirsty, help yourself to anything in the fridge.”</p>



<p>“Sure! Thank you!”</p>



<p>As I watched the two of them, a faint smile tugged at my lips.</p>



<p>“Well then, I’ll start preparing dinner,” I said as I reached for the apron I had taken off earlier.</p>



<p>“Um, about that…”</p>



<p>Kureha-chan, who had put down her backpack, hesitated before speaking shyly.</p>



<p>“Yua-san, you’ve been cooking this whole time, aren’t you tired?”</p>



<p>I tilted my head, perplexed by her words. “It’s what I always do, so it’s fine.”</p>



<p>Kureha-chan shifted her fingers nervously, intertwining them in front of her stomach as she continued.</p>



<p>“Um, it’s not like a return favor since you cooked for us a lot during the sleepover, but…”</p>



<p>She gathered her courage, lifting her gaze and saying, “Would it be alright if I cook dinner for everyone tonight?”</p>



<p>She looked directly into my eyes.</p>



<p>I finally understood her slightly uneasy demeanor. Whether during the training camp or today, it was only natural for me to take on the cooking, and Saku-kun and Yuzuki-chan probably thought the same, which was why Kureha-chan might have found it difficult to broach the subject.</p>



<p>I smiled softly and inquired. “Kureha-chan, do you often cook?”</p>



<p>Kureha-chan scratched her cheek with a bashful expression. “Not to the extent where I can boast in front of you, Yua-san, but I cook occasionally.”</p>



<p>“Well, since I promised to treat you to a more elaborate pasta dish the other day, I bought ingredients to make Pasta Pescatore today, but…”</p>



<p>“As long as I follow the recipe, I think I can manage!”</p>



<p>I narrowed my eyes in understanding. “I see.”</p>



<p>It was a bit of a demanding dish among pasta recipes, but she might have quite a fondness for cooking. If she had wanted to cook something during the training camp and I inadvertently hindered her, I felt apologetic now.</p>



<p>It was not a bad idea to occasionally put myself in the position of waiting for dinner. And if she encountered any difficulties along the way, I could always lend a hand.</p>



<p>Looking towards the sofa, Saku-kun shrugged his shoulders slightly, seemingly leaving the decision up to me, while Yuzuki-chan gazed at Kureha-chan with a slightly contemplative expression.</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement. “If you want, you can use my apron.”</p>



<p>“Yes! Thank you!”</p>



<p>When I handed her the apron, Kureha-chan quickly put it on with practiced ease. She naturally took out a hairband and tied her hair back.</p>



<p>“Senpai, Yua-san, is it okay if I use some of the leftover vegetables?”</p>



<p>We both responded in unison.</p>



<p>“Sure thing.”</p>



<p>“It’s all good.”</p>



<p>Watching Kureha-chan immediately pulled out the cabbage, I couldn’t help but think.</p>



<p>It was an odd sensation not to be in the kitchen here. Should I just sit on the sofa or at the dining table? Should I stay close by in case I could help? I couldn’t seem to settle down, a restlessness coursing through me.</p>



<p>Upon reflection, since my mother left, I might never have had the opportunity to wait for someone else’s homemade cooking when I wasn’t in the kitchen myself.</p>



<p>As if offering a customary spectacle, Saku-kun approached, playfully teasing the kouhai.</p>



<p>“Oh? I’m quite a stickler for shredded cabbage.”</p>



<p>I rolled my eyes and give his back a light pat. “Come on, don’t tease Kureha-chan like that.”</p>



<p>In the end, I couldn’t help but mock myself, realizing that even though I said those words, I was not much different. It must felt awkward when you’re being observed from behind by two senpais.</p>



<p>However, Kureha-chan responded without a hint of unease. “Yes! I understand!”</p>



<p>She deftly cut away the quarter of cabbage’s core that remained and neatly divided it in two with a satisfying snap.</p>



<p><em>Wait a minute.</em></p>



<p>Just like my initial days, when I tried to shred a quarter-sized cabbage, its height was a bit too much to handle. Splitting it in two was clearly the gesture of someone experienced.</p>



<p>Without hesitation, Kureha-chan readied the knife.</p>



<p><em>──chop, chop, chop, chop.</em></p>



<p>A crisp, rhythmic sound filled the air. The slender shreds of cabbage spread out, much like fluffy cotton candy.</p>



<p>“”Huh…?””</p>



<p>Unintentionally, both Saku-kun and I let out surprised exclamations.</p>



<p>With a mischievous tone, Kureha-chan opened her mouth. “Senpai, I guess you find this unexpected, huh!?”</p>



<p>Without waiting for our answers, she continued. “My parents have always worked late, so I’ve often been in charge of making dinner since I was little.”</p>



<p>Having finished shredding the cabbage, Kureha-chan turned around. With a sweet, adorable smile, she spoke;</p>



<p>“Senpai, how would you rate this?”</p>



<p>Saku-kun responded without needing to ponder. “Got me there, it’s a flawless hundred.”</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>For some reason, that seemingly minor statement pierced deeply into my heart.</p>



<p>How many times had it been that I received Saku-kun’s approval?</p>



<p>Drawing such comparisons was meaningless, I knew that.</p>



<p>Yuzuki-chan, for instance, took much longer and convinced Saku-kun on her second attempt, yet I felt nothing then. Maybe Kureha-chan simply had a family that loved shredded cabbage.</p>



<p>Still, the kouhai who satisfied Saku-kun on her first try, and then me, who took longer. Even though it was pointless to compete over such matters, but…</p>



<p><em>──Thump.</em></p>



<p>Suddenly, an inexplicable fear surged within me.</p>



<p>Up until now, I had never encountered a girl my age who was more familiar in cooking than I was. Saku-kun could cook for himself, and it was clear that Yuzuki-chan knew her way around the kitchen too.</p>



<p>However, purely in terms of experience, I had been cooking almost every day since elementary school, so I was familiar with a wide range of ingredients and dishes. Things that could be quickly prepared when busy, tricks to reduce cleanup, creative uses for leftover ingredients…</p>



<p>I believed that as a high school girl who had woven these kinds of cooking into her daily life, there probably weren’t many like me.</p>



<p>Before me, Kureha-chan was rinsing the cabbage and started boiling water in a pot.</p>



<p>Yet, I had never been particularly boastful about in comparison to someone close. I mainly learned out of necessity; if my mother were here, I probably wouldn’t have cooked this much.</p>



<p>It was only natural that I could cook better than kids who were simply leading normal school lives. And while everyone praised me, I had never once thought of myself as exceptionally skilled in cooking.</p>



<p>At best, it’s simple; at worst, plain. It was more like ordinary home-cooked meals. So, it’s not about being great, it was about being accustomed to it. That’s the one point where I could take pride in myself.</p>



<p>Because precisely through these kinds of dishes, I could naturally nestle into your life, unpretentious, supporting you.</p>



<p>──But what if it wasn’t just me?</p>



<p>It seemed Kureha-chan was whipping up a consommé soup with the available vegetables. As for the pasta, she’s probably focusing on boiling it first since it takes two burners.</p>



<p>Without asking me or glancing at the recipe, she took out shrimp, squid, pre-soaked clams, and mussels from the refrigerator and began preparing them. Removing the vein, detaching the leg thread, washing with a scrub…</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kureha-chan stopped and asked. “Senpai, I’m sorry. Could you roll up my sleeves a bit?”</p>



<p>Huh…?</p>



<p>Wait, hold on.</p>



<p>No, stop. Let me do it.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, my heart was nearly sobbing in silence. Because that’s…</p>



<p>Saku-kun, who’s usually asked by me, stood behind Kureha-chan without hesitation. “Sure thing.”</p>



<p>With practiced movements, he deftly rolled up her sleeves, one arm at a time.</p>



<p>“Thank you!”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>



<p>Kureha-chan continued with the prep, seemingly unfazed by his action.</p>



<p>Right now, did that kouhai catch a whiff of Saku-kun’s scent? Had she sensed his warmth against her back? Did she feel his breath tickle her ear?</p>



<p>Would she eventually find herself recalling these moments vividly?</p>



<p><em>If only I were by your side,</em> I found myself thinking repeatedly.</p>



<p>What if there were other girls skilled in cooking besides me?</p>



<p>Having finished her prepping, Kureha-chan washed her hands and then counted the shrimp. She nodded with satisfaction and placed an iron frying pan on the stove. As it heated up, she started to shell and remove the heads of the four shrimp.</p>



<p>In a small bowl, she combined olive oil, garlic from a tube, wine, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Adding the shrimp, she stirred them until they were well-coated.</p>



<p>Once the frying pan started emitting white smoke, she poured the bowl of olive oil and swirled it lightly. Arranging the four shrimp, an enticing aroma filled the air. She left them be for a moment before flipping them over to cook the other side.</p>



<p>Once the shrimp were thoroughly cooked, Kureha-chan lightly sprinkled dried parsley as a finishing touch and spoke up. “Since we had a bit more shrimp, this is my makeshift version of garlic shrimp! It would’ve been tastier if they were marinated a bit longer, though.”</p>



<p>She picked up one of the cooked shrimp and beckoned playfully. “Senpai, please have one.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun obediently stepped forward as he’s told. Kureha-chan blew on the shrimp to cool it down before holding it out. “Aaahh.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun furrowed his brows, looking somewhat troubled. “It’s okay, I’ll grab one for myself, you can have it, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Somewhere within, I felt relieved at his answer. Earlier, he didn’t hesitate to take a cucumber I offered, yet he was different with Kureha-chan.</p>



<p>I was starting to dislike the part of me that felt comforted by that.</p>



<p>Unperturbed, Kureha-chan persisted. “No, please, ahh.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun scratched his head in a somewhat exasperated gesture. Whether he gave in or accepted Kureha-chan’s request, he took a bite of the shrimp.</p>



<p>After chewing thoughtfully for a moment, he muttered, “Yeah, it’s really good.”</p>



<p><em>Did she…</em></p>



<p>──<em>Did her lips brush against his just now?</em></p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>In the midst of a body that wouldn’t budge, only my heart was making an uproar.</p>



<p>There was Kureha-chan in the kitchen. Cooking up a comforting, delicious home-cooked meal for Saku-kun.</p>



<p>The unfamiliar scenery of this house stretched out before me.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan placed the remaining shrimps onto a small plate and approached me. Picking one up, she offered it to me, just like she did with Saku-kun.</p>



<p>“Here, Yua-san, aahh.”</p>



<p>Not knowing if I was managing to smile convincingly, I ate the shrimp. Chewing slowly, with each bite, my heart grew heavier.</p>



<p>It’s not something that took much effort. With ingredients and seasonings that she had on hand, she whipped up a simple, comforting home-cooked meal.</p>



<p>Right, I was not alone in this anymore.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s really delicious.”</p>



<p>To be able to cook such a meal for you, it’s not just me…</p>



<p>Kureha-chan moved on to Yuzuki-chan, and after eating her own portion, she quickly washed the frying pan.</p>



<p>Saku-kun casually spoke up. “You’re quite good. I used to be terrible until Yua taught me.”</p>



<p>Please, stop. Don’t say things like that. Even if it was unintentional, it sounded like you were saying someone else could easily replace me.</p>



<p>But whether I acknowledged it or not, it was just a fact that I couldn’t ignore.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan placed the pasta pot in the sink and turned on the tap.</p>



<p>And then, as if washing away the past, a sound resonated;</p>



<p>“When Yua-san is busy, should I cook for you?”</p>



<p>Finally, the words I dreaded the most escaped her lips.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump──</em></p>



<p>“Like I’d ever ask a kouhai for something so pathetic. Despite my appearance, I can cook for myself, you know.”</p>



<p>It’s okay, Saku-kun was firmly refusing.</p>



<p>“Well, what a shame.”</p>



<p>It’s okay, Kureha-chan let it slide without a fuss.</p>



<p>It’s okay, everything is fine.</p>



<p><em>But still</em>, my heart raced.</p>



<p>Because that wasn’t a promise. It was just a brief exchange that came and went in an instant, something that could be forgotten or broken without anyone complaining.</p>



<p>Would this be the first and last time Kureha-chan cooked here?</p>



<p>Would that innocent kouhai, the girl who had taken a liking to Saku-kun, come over freely like she did today?</p>



<p>If I was around, they might defer. But what if it was just the two of them? Kureha-chan might completely forget today’s conversation, enthusiastically buy ingredients for dinner, and then Saku-kun would probably find it hard to refuse.</p>



<p>No, I was deceiving myself again.</p>



<p>It wasn’t about him finding it hard to refuse, but there was no reason to refuse.</p>



<p>He usually ate my cooking, had tried Yuzuki-chan’s dishes, so why did I selfishly want him to avoid Kureha-chan’s cooking? After all, that earlier exchange was just him declining the idea of her coming over regularly to cook. Occasionally shouldn’t be a problem.</p>



<p>And like that, bit by bit────</p>



<p>Would you gradually learn the taste of home beyond what I offered?</p>



<p>I gripped my chest tightly as I watched Kureha-chan set the pasta pot on the stove.</p>



<p>Would he grow accustomed to sounds of knives other than mine, to their rhythm?</p>



<p>Would he remember her cooking when he ate my foods?</p>



<p>Would that eventually become part of your everyday scene?</p>



<p>Would it lead to moments when you slept peacefully?</p>



<p>Would Kureha-chan notice you like that, approach you, crouch down, gently brush back your hair, and smile at your sleeping face?</p>



<p>No, I bit my lip almost hard enough to draw blood.</p>



<p>──Because that was supposed to be my special kind of ordinary, meant only for me.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan, who was checking the soup, tilted her head slightly. Perhaps the vegetables weren’t fully cooked yet; it seemed she’s going to simmer them a bit longer.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, all the other preparations were done. The stove had two burners, occupied by the soup and the pasta pot.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan’s gaze darted around, and then she fixed her eyes on a single spot. At the end of her gaze was the chair Saku-kun gave me.</p>



<p>It was just the right spot to wait for the soup to finish.</p>



<p>With a light patter, Kureha-chan innocently walked over.</p>



<p>──<em>Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>My heart raced wildly, irregularly.</p>



<p>“…No,” I let out a nearly inaudible whisper.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan placed her hand on the chair, pulling it closer.</p>



<p>In my hazy field of vision, I saw Saku-kun started to say something, his mouth opening in haste, but before he could speak—</p>



<p>“DON’T SIT THERE!!!”</p>



<p>I mustered every ounce of my voice.</p>



<p>A soft pang of sorrow rang through the air. Slowly, a tear spilled from Kureha-chan’s eyes.</p>



<p>Time halted.</p>



<p>I couldn’t immediately accept what I had done. Saku-kun hung his head in remorse. Yuzuki-chan on the couch remained silent.</p>



<p>Only Kureha-chan, alone…</p>



<p>“Um, the onions I put in the soup are stinging my eyes now,” she tried to play it off with a cute smile.</p>



<p>In that fleeting moment────</p>



<p>An indescribable guilt engulfed me.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan wiped her tears subtly, yet her voice remained bright.</p>



<p>“Could it be that it’s your chair, Yua-san? If so, I apologize for my impoliteness!”</p>



<p>Saku-kun, looking startled, literally interjected between us. “Sorry, it’s my fault! I just assumed Yua would naturally cook today…”</p>



<p>Their desperate words of concern drove me further into a corner. </p>



<p>Warmth creeped up at the corners of my eyes. My vision blurred, they faded from view, couldn’t see my chair.</p>



<p><em>Still</em>, I tightly closed my eyes. I absolutely couldn’t let my tears fall here.</p>



<p>Turning my back to Saku-kun and Kureha-chan, I rubbed my eyes roughly. I grabbed my bag, sprinting for the front door.</p>



<p>“Yua!”</p>



<p>“Yua-san!”</p>



<p>Don’t call me, don’t stop me; it was only me who got hurt, of my own accord.</p>



<p>I put on my shoes, bowing my head deeply, avoiding everyone’s gaze.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I’m leaving for today. Kureha-chan, please take care of Saku-kun’s dinner.”</p>



<p>While disguising it as an apology, I let the words roll out with a touch of bitterness, and finally, I escaped the house that should have felt like home.</p>



<p>I bolted down the stairs like a floundering mess while furiously rubbed away the cascading tears as if trying to sand them down.</p>



<p>Why, how come────</p>



<p><em>Thud, thud, thud, thud</em>, the unrecognizable sound of my own rough footsteps echoed, like trampling the stairs in retaliation.</p>



<p>A filthy me.</p>



<p>An ugly me.</p>



<p>Surely, this must be punishment.</p>



<p>Just two steps from the bottom, my loafer’s toe hooked onto something, and I stumbled clumsily. My knees on the gravel, palms skimming across the rough surface.</p>



<p>A searing pain ignited, coursing through. It throbbed.</p>



<p>When did I start being so conceited?</p>



<p>For someone who could merely cook a regular meal, I had foolishly believed that I was the only one capable of making dinner for Saku-kun, mistaking this as my place.</p>



<p>Yet all it took was Kureha-chan’s presence to easily shatter that illusion.</p>



<p>“Ugh, ah…”</p>



<p>I sobbed repeatedly, seeking out air that kept slipping out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/168082.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>While hugging myself with trembling arms, a thought came to my mind.</p>



<p>In the end, I was still clinging to the word <em>ordinary</em>. As long as this tranquil routine continued, I wouldn’t be hurt and I wouldn’t hurt others.</p>



<p>Too scared to confront love, unable to become like my best friend.</p>



<p>I lacked the courage to step forward or the resolve to lose, yet conveniently accepted only kindness, merely lingering there.</p>



<p>──The ordinary I desired was something I couldn’t attain without becoming your special.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>And so, the afternoon of the following day arrived.</p>



<p>I, Nanase Yuzuki, adorned in my uniform, was making my way to the entrance.</p>



<p>Yesterday, after <em>that</em>, I had completed the pasta in place of the shaken kouhai. All three of us ate it in silence, and then I accompanied Kureha home.</p>



<p>In the middle of the night, a long apology text arrived from Uchi. She must have composed an even longer message for Chitose and Kureha, perhaps the former called her back on the phone.</p>



<p>In the morning classroom, not quite acting as if nothing had happened, Chitose, me, and Uchi interacted just like usual.</p>



<p>Then, almost as a mark of her apology, she offered me a handmade bento, saying that if I hadn’t brought lunch myself, I could eaten it after club activities. One for Chitose, one for me, and one for Kureha. I believed she must have woken up really early, or maybe she couldn’t sleep at all. At lunchtime, it seemed like she went all the way to the first-year classroom to deliver it.</p>



<p>I was surprised to see Uchi, always so calm and kind, showed her emotions yesterday. She must have cherished that house and that place so deeply.</p>



<p>Understanding those feelings all too well, it was painful, heart-wrenching, and frustrating.</p>



<p><em>Still</em>, I think. Because I wasn’t her partner, it was hard to say this face-to-face, but it was still Uchi’s fault yesterday.</p>



<p>After all, it was with Uchi’s consent that Kureha started cooking, and Chitose had entrusted the decision to her.</p>



<p><em>Tap, tap, tap,</em> the entrance was drawing near.</p>



<p>Recently, something among us had not been aligning. We were all entangled in a daydream, disjointed and out of sync.</p>



<p>Perhaps, September was beckoning.</p>



<p>Pausing everyone between summer and autumn, like urging us to face our love who wanted to take it slowly.</p>



<p>Leaning against the shoe lockers, just as I had expected, I caught sight of a familiar figure.</p>



<p>A smile tugged at my lips.</p>



<p>And in our September, as always,</p>



<p>“Oh, Yuzuki-san!”</p>



<p>There was a beautiful kouhai girl.</p>



<p>When Kureha, with an innocent face, rushed over, I opened my mouth;</p>



<p>“Chitose has already gone home, and we won’t be heading to the café near the station.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>Last night, while walking Kureha home, I told a small lie. I mentioned that I’d have a cheering meeting with Chitose at the café in front of the station today.</p>



<p>Because I had a feeling this girl would appear if I said that.</p>



<p>Of course, I hadn’t actually made such an arrangement. I had been informed that Tōdō would be coming by, and even though I told Haru that I might be a little late, I would head to the club activities after this.</p>



<p>As for Chitose, I had given him some errands and promptly sent him out of school.</p>



<p>Kureha’s face lightened up with an innocent smile. “What a shame, I was actually thinking of intruding too.”</p>



<p><em>This is it</em>, I think. Chitose, everyone, surely───</p>



<p>“Kureha, can we talk for a moment?”</p>



<p>“Yes! Of course!”</p>



<p>And so, the two of us exchanged smiles and ascended the stairs of the school building.</p>


<p>I stepped out onto the rooftop using the key I had borrowed from Chitose in advance.</p>



<p>The sky around was clear and vivid, much like a summer day, yet in the western direction, heavy clouds loomed ominously. Perhaps a sudden evening shower was on its way.</p>



<p>Rain that shifted the seasons. Gradually and surely, we were heading towards autumn.</p>



<p><em>But before that</em>, with determination in my gaze, I narrowed my eyes.</p>



<p>──We need to bring this September to a close.</p>



<p>Kureha, who was taking in the scenery leisurely while holding onto the railing, opened her mouth;</p>



<p>“So, you can actually get to the rooftop.”</p>



<p>“Chitose has a spare key,” I answered as I stood beside her. Facing opposite directions, I leaned my back against the railing.</p>



<p>“Do you guys often come up here?”</p>



<p>“Once in a while. Chitose and Nishino-senpai seem to be regulars though.”</p>



<p>“I see! I’d love to eat here too.”</p>



<p>“If you ask Chitose, he’ll probably lend you the key.”</p>



<p>“No, that’s not what I meant! I want to eat here with everyone.”</p>



<p>We engaged in an unassuming conversation without meeting each other’s gaze.</p>



<p>It was a scene of tranquil after-school hours that extended endlessly. If you captured only this moment, it would be a small, secret time between a senpai and a kouhai. A page from our youth, to be remembered someday.</p>



<p><em>Even so</em>, I cut through the air with words like a slashing sword.</p>



<p>“──Is it my turn now?”</p>



<p>Kureha looked at me, her head tilting with confusion. “What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>Though it was a sudden question, her expression and tone remained calm. Perhaps she already steeled herself long before.</p>



<p>I pressed on, probing for her response. “Unfortunately, just taking you to the café that is filled with memories wouldn’t hurt me.”</p>



<p>On the riverside, there was Nishino-senpai, while in the Higashi Park, there was Haru.</p>



<p>At first, I assumed it was just an unfortunate coincidence. But when I saw Kureha arranging to visit his house right before my eyes, a faint suspicion crept in. Somewhere in my mind, a small warning bell rang, and that’s when I offered to accompany them.</p>



<p>And as I expected, the outcome was predictable. Even Uchi ended up getting hurt because of this girl. With these continuous incidents, it was natural to grow a bit skeptical.</p>



<p>But to be honest, right up until the last moment, I couldn’t be certain.</p>



<p>Despite feeling sorry for both Chitose and Uchi, I didn’t intervene to smooth things over. Instead, I remained a spectator, calmly observing the situation unfold.</p>



<p>Still, even with all my intuition as Nanase Yuzuki, I couldn’t decipher Kureha’s true intentions.</p>



<p>Even considering the fact that she had slipped away with Chitose during the training camp’s early morning hours, the picture was still gray and uncertain.</p>



<p>Was she truly just an innocent kouhai, or did she harbor some ulterior motive?</p>



<p>That’s why I planted a small lie. I had resolved that if she took the bait, her intentions would be revealed.</p>



<p>And thus, I locked my gaze onto Kureha standing before me, as though scrutinizing her.</p>



<p>The answers had been tallied. This girl was intentionally trampling upon our space.</p>



<p>Taking a step forward, I opened my mouth to confront her.</p>



<p>“──What do you want with us?”</p>



<p>For a brief moment, Kureha’s eyes betrayed a hint of hesitation before she replied.</p>



<p>“With us?”</p>



<p>In a voice that was uncannily mature, almost chilling, she lifted the corner of her mouth as if unable to contain herself.</p>



<p>She took a step back, adjusting her stance to face me more directly.</p>



<p>“The fact that you can’t even say it’s about Chitose speaks volumes about the distance between you and Yuuko-san right now.”</p>



<p>She provocatively narrowed her eyes, exuding a sensuousness.</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>For some reason, that single sentence felt like it had sliced a thin layer of my resolve.</p>



<p>I had prepared myself to face her head-on, but it had been easily undermined. I was struck by the first blow.</p>



<p>Without trying to gauge my reaction, Kureha intertwined her fingers behind her head.</p>



<p>“Well, well, so Yuzuki-san is the first to catch on, after all,” She wore a subtle smile and looked at me. “But, it’s shallower than I thought.”</p>



<p>“Oh really?” I responded, collecting myself. “So, is this your true nature then?”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes widened in surprise, and then she chuckled, her shoulders shaking mirthfully.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t come at me and then say mean things. I’m part of the sports club too. If a fight’s handed to me, I’ll gladly accept it.”</p>



<p>Well, that’s a valid point. I did start this, after all. There was no reason to pounce just because she had fired back.</p>



<p>“Let me ask you again,” Kureha looked straight at me. “What exactly is this about?”</p>



<p>I was about to say ‘us’ but stopped myself mid-sentence.</p>



<p><em>…What is this conversation about, anyway?</em></p>



<p>Sensing the lack of response, Kureha continued. “If all your questions were that, then I’ll answer. I don’t really have any desire to do anything to you guys.”</p>



<p>What I wanted to know was whether she had ulterior motives, and the answer was already given. At the very least, it was clear she wasn’t just an innocent kouhai.</p>



<p>So then, what words had I been planning to weave beyond that?</p>



<p>Kureha spoke with a touch of boredom. “If it’s about not getting any closer to Chitose, I get it. Whether I accept it or not is a different story. But Yuzuki-san, do you really have the right to meddle?”</p>



<p>…No, I don’t.</p>



<p>I was neither Chitose’s family, and certainly not his lover. That had been obvious from the start. I didn’t need a kouhai to point that out.</p>



<p><em>However</em>, I pressed my brows together. When Nishino-senpai, Haru, and Uchi get hurt, it hurts <em>him</em> too. I couldn’t just let that slide.</p>



<p>I returned Kureha’s stare and spoke firmly. “If you’re trying to take advantage of his kindness, remember that I won’t stay silent.”</p>



<p>“And you’re saying that, Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>She casually brushed off my words.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki-san, you asked Senpai to pretend to be your boyfriend because you were being harassed by someone troublesome, right? You must’ve known he wouldn’t refuse once asked. Frankly, it’s dangerous. I don’t know if it qualifies as stalking, but won’t that resentment and hatred eventually be directed at Senpai?”</p>



<p>Kureha let out an exasperated sigh, sounding almost disappointed.</p>



<p>“Isn’t what you’ve done much worse?”</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>It felt like I’d been slashed straight across the chest. It was an undeniable hit, something I couldn’t escape.</p>



<p>More than anyone else, it was me who had taken advantage of his kindness.</p>



<p>As if to drive the point home, she went on;</p>



<p>“Asuka-san, Haru-san, and Yua-san are the same too. Is there any of them who haven’t taken advantage of Senpai’s kindness?” She asked, her smile melting like honey, enticing and perplexing. “Don’t just leave me out, okay?”</p>



<p>What she said was undeniably true.</p>



<p>Whether Kureha knew the extent of it or not, Chitose who accompanied Nishino-senpai to Tokyo, Chitose who supported Haru when she wasn’t getting along with her teammates, and Uchi—it was clear that they had all been saved in some way in the past.</p>



<p>Of course, just like myself, there were likely many more hidden moments that occurred behind the scenes.</p>



<p>All of us had leaned on Chitose’s kindness.</p>



<p>I bit my lip lightly and locked eyes with Kureha. “Why are you getting close to Chitose?”</p>



<p>Without hesitation, Kureha responded. “Well, obviously, because I like Senpai.”</p>



<p>She grinned playfully.</p>



<p><em>As expected</em>. My eyebrows slightly furrowing. I had a faint inkling of this.</p>



<p>Like marking my answer sheet with a bold circle, I continued. “Even before joining the cheer squad, right?”</p>



<p>“Huh?” Kureha finally displayed a genuinely surprised expression. “Why do you think that?”</p>



<p>I stated nonchalantly, “There was always something off. You refer to all of us with ‘-san,’ but with Chitose, it’s always ‘Senpai.’ There’s no way someone like that wouldn’t be special.”</p>



<p>Pausing for a moment, I exhaled a short breath.</p>



<p>“And there are similar examples close by.”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed to catch on right away and clapped her hands together.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re talking about Asuka-san…!” Her giggles echoed playfully, as if she was being tickled. “I knew it was pretty obvious, but I just couldn’t let that go.”</p>



<p>“Because,” Kureha mused, her fingertips brushing against her cheek. “Being able to call him ‘senpai’ is one of the special perks of being a kouhai, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>With her gaze, both enchanting and beguiling, she managed to hold me captive even though we were of the same gender.</p>



<p>Why didn’t I notice earlier?</p>



<p>The person standing in front of me wasn’t just an innocent underclassman. She was wrapped in an alluring air that sent a shiver down my spine – a woman deeply in love.</p>



<p>I gathered my resolve and inquired, “Can I ask you something?”</p>



<p>Kureha responded with an innocent smile. “Yes, absolutely!”</p>



<p>“Why do you like Chitose?”</p>



<p>Perhaps it was a simple matter of curiosity.</p>



<p>If, by any chance, that kind-hearted Chitose Saku had been playing a hero again without us knowing, I thought maybe I could begin to understand a fraction of Kureha’s emotions.</p>



<p>Yet, the kouhai smirked mischievously, her tongue grazing her lips…</p>



<p>“──Just a straightforward case of love at first sight. Why, is there a problem with that?”</p>



<p>For the third time, she brushed aside the question bluntly. Her unflinching gaze almost overwhelmed me, leaving me momentarily disarmed.</p>



<p><em>She’s strong</em>, I thought, a sharp pang hitting me unexpectedly in the chest.</p>



<p>There was a time when I, too, had feelings I could proudly cherish. But how did that fervor gradually transform into a gentle warmth over time?</p>



<p>Still, I couldn’t back down. I continued. “Then why such a convoluted approach?”</p>



<p>It was so cunningly disguised that neither Chitose nor I had realized it. Kureha had consistently acted as a kouhai all along.</p>



<p>Yet, no matter how much she wore that mask, it wouldn’t cause the man she loved to see her as a woman who yearned for him.</p>



<p>“Although you’re well aware, Yuzuki-san, you’re surprisingly a bit sly, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>Kureha began a leisurely stroll along the rooftop’s railing, her fingers tracing its edge.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san, Yua-san, Yuzuki-san, and Haru-san, along with Asuka-san. You can practically see that there’s no room for any other girls in Senpai’s heart.”</p>



<p>Her gaze turned toward me, a smile playing at the corners of her lips. “So, that’s why I initially had to appear as an innocent underclassman. I believed if I did that, Senpai would eventually welcome me into his world.”</p>



<p>I mulled over her words, I bit my lip in realization of her point.</p>



<p>“Please don’t be angry with Senpai. Currently, he only sees me as his junior. That’s why he couldn’t draw the line he typically would with other girls.”</p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate him; he’s not oblivious.”</p>



<p>Chitose was already quite the complex character. It might seem strange coming from me, but it was accurate that anyone else attempting to approach him would likely be pushed away. However, if it were the innocent fondness of a kouhai who saw him neither as a man nor a lover, Chitose Saku would easily welcome it.</p>



<p>From that perspective, Kureha’s method might be the closest thing to the right answer if she intended to get closer to him.</p>



<p>I stole a glance at the side of her face, looking one step ahead of us. Despite the urge to click my tongue in frustration, I couldn’t remain silent.</p>



<p>Softly, I infused my words with the cold anger brewing within me. “So, this was your approach? Disguised as naive, you deliberately trampled upon our place?”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed taken aback, her response sounding so typically kouhai-like. “Hey! Don’t portray me like some sort of villain!” She halted her steps, her eyes meeting mine with earnestness. “Yuzuki-san, have I done something deceitful?”</p>



<p>“That’s… well…” Caught off guard, I stumbled over my words.</p>



<p>“Staking a claim as Senpai’s partner, practicing pair dances by the riverside, having fun playing catch in the park, cooking meals at his house…” Kureha’s voice reached me again, likely eyeing my reactions. “Have I done anything deceitful?”</p>



<p>…No, she hadn’t. That’s why I’d been grappling with her intentions.</p>



<p>Even though she approached under the guise of an innocent underclassman, it wasn’t wrong. After all, there were no established rules that dictated she couldn’t conceal her affections.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yuzuki-san?” Kureha’s voice resonated as if it could see through the depths of my soul. “Everyone, aren’t they genuinely kind and close?”</p>



<p>A soft chuckle escaped her lips, laced with a touch of derision.</p>



<p>“If you had wished to dance with Senpai, you only needed to voice it. If you had wanted to sit by that riverside, you could have done just that. Playing catch or preparing meals are the same. However…” Her narrowed eyes bore into me, cutting like a verdict, “None of you would consider it, would you? Because of your kindness, because of your closeness.”</p>



<p>──<em>Thump.</em></p>



<p>In an instant, my heart surged within my chest, as though struck directly, and my throat tightened in response.</p>



<p>I responded with a voice that struggled to mask my emotions. “Are you implying that our relationship is shallow?”</p>



<p>Kureha shook her head calmly.</p>



<p>“No, I genuinely believe they’re wonderful relationships. It gleams, radiates a gentle warmth, and shines with brilliance. You might find it hard to believe, but my admiration for all of you is sincere. I’ve always looked on from the outside with envy. I never meant to cause pain to Asuka-san, Haru-san, Yua-san, or anyone else. Those tears were real. Ah, I recognized that I had inadvertently trampled upon the places they hold dear. It was painful, and a deep sorrow gripped me.”</p>



<p>Strangely, her words seemed devoid of ulterior motive, carrying a genuineness that was hard to deny. Even if it was too late to feign indifference, Kureha’s expression, a blend of longing and anguish, portrayed her feelings honestly.</p>



<p>“However,” she poised her weapon anew, her words cutting through. “Aren’t these assumptions something you all reached on your own?”</p>



<p>As I feared, those words…</p>



<p>“──To lay claim to those places even though you’re not his lover.”</p>



<p>They felt like a blade thrusting into my chest.</p>



<p><em>──Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>The pounding of my heart became a clamor in my ears.</p>



<p><em>Calm down, steady yourself, be still.</em></p>



<p>As I repeated these breaths to soothe my racing heart, the words flowed forth;</p>



<p>“When it comes to you, Yuzuki-san, it’s even more vague.”</p>



<p>Ah, Kureha was about to say something decisive.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san is a fitting presence beside Senpai, Yua-san cooks meals for him every day, Haru-san bonds with him through sports, and Asuka-san is undoubtedly someone he looks up to.”</p>



<p>It was as if she was exposing the vulnerabilities I had been feigning ignorance of.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki-san, where is your place?”</p>



<p>──<em>Thud</em>!</p>



<p>“Apart from being saved by Senpai, what other connections do you have?”</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>I could no longer restrain the turmoil surging within me. She had penetrated my facade. Effortlessly, even by a junior I had barely known.</p>



<p><em>“──I, who have been saved unconditionally, have nothing to offer Chitose in return.”</em></p>



<p>The truth was, I had been aware of it from the start. Masking it with phrases like ‘birds of a feather,’ my heart had screamed in silent protest, questioning, “What does it matter?” </p>



<p>Even if that interpretation was accurate, was there a purpose in deliberately selecting a mirror image of oneself?</p>



<p>Calling it a special bond loophole, a means to be around without any specific reason, was a flimsy excuse at best.</p>



<p>Amongst us, I was the only one nurturing this unilateral, hollow yearning.</p>



<p>Kureha’s discourse flowed on, seemingly uninterested in a senpai who couldn’t counter any of it.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s alright,” She dismissed the agonizing deliberations that had plagued my mind time. “I’ll say it once more, though: you all are close, and kind. You accommodate each other, and you avoid intruding upon each other’s precious places.”</p>



<p>Her words resonated as a distressing echo.</p>



<p>I hadn’t sat by that riverside, I hadn’t joined in Haru and Chitose’s throws, and I wouldn’t even contemplate entering his kitchen unless compelled by unusual circumstances.</p>



<p>Because I refused to become Nanase Yuzuki of that sort.</p>



<p>Envy, audacious intrusion, desecrating cherished memories — those actions contradicted my principles.</p>



<p>“However,” Kureha’s verdict didn’t waver, “Everyone just continues on without moving forward or wanting to step back.”</p>



<p>Wait a moment.</p>



<p>No, not there.</p>



<p>You didn’t know the April, May, June, July, and that August leading up to this point. Our stage of concealed calmness. A newcomer shouldn’t barge in with their dirty shoes.</p>



<p>Kureha inched closer, as if declaring warfare or aiming for a decisive blow. With an apparent disregard for polite decorum, she said,</p>



<p>“──Holding hands, forming a circle, content in your <strong>stagnation</strong>.”</p>



<p>She drove a blade directly into my core.</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>The weight of the word “stagnation” lingered, its gravity pressing against my lips. I clenched my fist against my chest in an attempt to quell the wild beating of my heart.</p>



<p>That concise word held the very essence of our current situation.</p>



<p><em>“Yuuko’s confession and its aftermath will inevitably thrust us into a momentary stagnation, for better or worse.”</em></p>



<p>September unfolded just as we had expected. We exchanged congratulatory pats on the back, uttered phrases like ‘well done’ and ‘thank you for your hard work.’ We celebrated each other’s efforts, relishing in a fleeting sense of accomplishment.</p>



<p>Nanase Yuzuki displayed the consideration not to disturb these moments.</p>



<p>“However,” Kureha persisted as if that wasn’t enough. “Because I’m not content, I’ve always held a wish.”</p>



<p>With a touch of sorrow, she casted her gaze downward, embodying the innocence of a child.</p>



<p>“If there were other girls in Senpai’s heart, I wouldn’t want that. I want to paint everything in my own colors,” she whispered her heartfelt desire. “After all, isn’t it a kouhai’s duty to rely on their senpai?”</p>



<p><em>Beautiful</em>, her words strangely ensnared my attention. This junior of mine was so earnest that she would willingly cast everything aside for the one she loved.</p>



<p>──She was simply engrossed by a single-minded, ardent love.</p>



<p>I spun my words as if tracing a worn-out cut. “I understand your sentiments, Kureha.”</p>



<p>“Yes! I’m happy!”</p>



<p>“But if Chitose were to discover everything, he might end up hurt.”</p>



<p>“That’s possible.”</p>



<p>“Using tactics akin to deception, it wouldn’t be strange for him to resent you.”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind,” with the charm of a child, Kureha interjected resolutely. “It’s not love if you aren’t prepared to hurt.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t about being hurt; it was about hurting. Her direct gaze overwhelmed in its own right.</p>



<p>While I believed any girl in love was prepared for the prospect of being hurt, how many were genuinely prepared to hurt the one they loved?</p>



<p><em>…I’m scared.</em></p>



<p>I could endure being hurt, but I didn’t want to be the cause of his pain.</p>



<p>“Furthermore,” Kureha pressed on. “I’d rather be despised than left in indifference.”</p>



<p>Her eyes held a quivering, yet stunning determination.</p>



<p>“If that compassionate Senpai notices me to such an extent, wouldn’t that be happiness in itself?” She grinned with an impish innocence.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but feel pierced through. My own weaknesses, inadequacies, wretchedness, and lamentable state.</p>



<p>──<em>Thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>“But I don’t want to lie. When Yuuko-san proposed becoming friends, when Senpai declared I was a part of the group, I didn’t nod. I want to be included, yet I cannot befriend and I won’t join your circle. The moment when my wish comes true is when I cause you all pain.”</p>



<p>Kureha murmured, her gaze focused on her own palm. “Holding hands would lead to stagnation.”</p>



<p>“That’s why,” she lifted her face. “If you’re yearning for this kind of time to continue indefinitely…”</p>



<p>She proclaimed, her words directed like a pointed arrow;</p>



<p>“──then I believe that kind of love is a fake.”</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>The western sky rumbled, a deep, rolling sound. The expanse of blue gradually gave way to shades of black.</p>



<p>“Why…?” In a fragile, breathy voice, I managed to speak, “Why are you…”</p>



<p><em>So strong? </em>The unspoken words hung in the air.</p>



<p>Kureha leaned against the railing, her gaze fixed on the approaching storm clouds as she spoke.</p>



<p>“Have you ever wondered, if the sequence of our encounters had been different?”</p>



<p>Taken aback, I observed her somewhat fragile profile.</p>



<p>“For instance, if we had been in the same class from the beginning, if we had been childhood friends…” She continued in a slightly solitary tone. “Imagine if, when you fell in love, the person’s heart was already occupied by someone else, and you thought, ‘<em>What if I had met him before the other girl did?</em>‘”</p>



<p>It would be a lie to say I had never entertained such musings. If I had the time that Yuuko, Uchi, and Nishino-senpai had spent with him, maybe we could have grown closer.</p>



<p>Kureha turned her gentle gaze toward me. Her voice resonated without pretense, as if she were simply stating undeniable facts.</p>



<p>“I’m beautiful enough not to pale in comparison to you, Yuzuki-san. I can cook like Yua-san, and I’m not inferior to Haru-san in sports either. If I set my mind to it, I could even offer advice like Asuka-san.”</p>



<p><em>Drip, drip, drop.</em></p>



<p>The tears of rain began to fall, moistening our cheeks.</p>



<p>“But to be excluded just because I happened to meet everyone a little late? I can’t accept such a reason. I’ve been nothing but myself all along, so why should I be overshadowed by a mere twist of fate? That’s why…”</p>



<p>Thunder rumbled like a growl.</p>



<p>Carrying the threshold between sunshine and rain, Kureha spoke;</p>



<p>“I want to rewind spring.”</p>



<p>A flash of lightning streaked across the sky.</p>



<p>“I won’t lose to a woman who can’t even commit herself wholeheartedly, Nana-san.”</p>



<p>Sweeping aside her damp hair, her eyes bore a captivating hue that sent a shiver down my spine.</p>



<p>“──I’m going to prove that I can pierce through Senpai’s melancholy.”</p>



<p>The junior girl erupted into a vibrant, carefree smile.</p>



<p>A teardrop traced its way down my cheek.</p>



<p><em>…It’s futile.</em></p>



<p>As the current Nanase Yuzuki, I couldn’t reach her, couldn’t compete. One day, Kureha would inevitably lead Chitose far away. Effortlessly, she would envelop our shared time, snatching away our places.</p>



<p>And with that shrewd desire transformed into a bullet,</p>



<p>──She would shoot through the serene moon.</p>
