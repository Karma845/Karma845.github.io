<h2>Chapter 3: The Story Created by Me and the Princess</h2>

<p class="calibre5">The Golden Week holiday will be over the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Normally, I would be panicking or clasping my hands together, wishing upon a star that tomorrow never comes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But now is not the time for such foolishness.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yes, as each day passes, the time limit for Touka-san to stay in this timeline draws nearer, whether I like it or not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">During these seven days, Touka-san has been frequently visiting her sister Natsumi-san’s hospital room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From Touka-san’s perspective, this is a reunion with a sister she thought she would never see again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There must be a mountain of things she wants to say, more than can be easily put into words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, as a result, the number engraved on her chest became ‘2.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Presumably, the number decreased as a penalty for telling Natsumi-san about events from the future.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, according to the rules, that number will never increase.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, no matter what happens, this miraculous time will come to an end tomorrow night.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She probably understands that better than anyone.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Perhaps that’s why today’s meal was so extravagant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I never thought I would get to eat sukiyaki on a day that wasn’t a celebration.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Moreover, this beef… it’s Matsusaka beef.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m embarrassed to admit it, but this is the first time I’ve seen meat that came in a wooden box.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know that meat could be packaged in anything other than a food tray…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san briskly prepares everything needed for the sukiyaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, nothing. You seems used to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I am a young wife, you know.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Who would believe that the person who had those disastrous cooking skills would reach a professional level in just six years?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Probably only my parents.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s only recently that I’ve been able to cook something for people to eat.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that so…”</p>



<p class="calibre5">That means during our student days, I’ll have to continue eating her culinary disasters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ugh, just thinking about it makes my stomach hurt.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, by the way, where did this meat come from?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s a gift from Nee-san.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I see. I’ll have to thank Natsumi-san tomorrow.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then, she sets up a portable stove on the table, placing a pot for the sukiyaki on top of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She drops some beef fat into the pot. Then a tantalizing sizzle emanates from the pot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe it’s just my imagination, but the aroma seems fifty percent more appealing than usual.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Now, let’s add the beef&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait! Before you put it in, let me save it on my smartphone!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">After all, this meat costs 70,000 yen for 500 grams.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sadly, I’ll probably never taste it again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that thought in mind, I feel the need to capture this moment in a photo. So, I started snapping pictures of the red beef.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, while you’re at it, take a picture of this sunflower too.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Touka-san says this as she points to a single sunflower arranged in a vase at the edge of the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, she acquired this sunflower today from somewhere.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But sunflowers are rare at this time of year.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sunflowers usually don’t start appearing in flower shops until June.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it an imported product, or perhaps a flower grown in a greenhouse?</p>



<p class="calibre5">“My parents would be so envious if they found out.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">After all, the price range of this beef is on an entirely different scale from what we usually eat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really had no idea that there was beef in this world that cost 70,000 yen.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“You’re exaggerating. You could eat this once a year from now on.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Touka-san gazes at me with an incredulous expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe I’ll brag about this to Kanako later.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, she begins to cook the meat and adds the broth.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, what’s this smell? It’s seriously amazing!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, I’m glad you like it.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Touka-san adds vegetables, grilled tofu, and shirataki noodles to the pot in that order.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“It’ll be ready soon.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She says this and hands me a white egg.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I crack the egg into a small bowl and stir it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“In the end, it was a stay of less than a month, huh?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">With a melancholy look, she mutters this while glancing at the calendar.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Did Touka-san achieve her purpose for coming to this world?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just by looking at her face, it’s hard to tell whether she’s fulfilled her objective.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she probably wouldn’t tell me even if I asked.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So I decided not to ask. I choose to believe that everything worked out well.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Here, Ha-kun, eat the meat.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Saying this, she picks up some beef from the pot and places it in my small bowl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I promptly pop the meat into my mouth.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Words were unnecessary. It was simply delicious.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“This is the first time I’ve ever eaten meat this tender.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re exaggerating…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m not exaggerating! It really is the first time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, keep eating.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Perhaps pleased by my enthusiasm, she puts more of the cooked beef into my small bowl.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“This is what I’m really after…”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Saying this, Touka-san brings out a beer from the refrigerator.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“You’re drinking alcohol…”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I had completely forgotten, but the person in front of me was an adult over twenty years old.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, there’s nothing illegal about her drinking alcohol.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I don’t drink every day.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Indeed, she has not been drinking since I came to this house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Only a few times a year, you see.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">For some reason, she winks at me. Apparently, she’s delighted to be able to drink.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, she opens the can of beer, pours it into a glass, and takes generous gulps.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Quite a hearty way to drink.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Ahh! It really tastes nice…”</p>



<p class="calibre5">In my family, my dad doesn’t drink, and my mom rarely does.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, seeing someone drink alcohol in this house was a novel experience.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I promise never to drink when Ha-kun isn’t around, but it’s fine now since you are here.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Touka-san talks cheerfully about her promise with my future self.</p>



<p class="calibre5">” ….. ”</p>



<p class="calibre5">What is this? My sixth sense is telling me ‘danger’…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">After finishing dinner, Touka-san and I cleared the table and we played the card game ‘Millionaire’ in the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s been a while since I used playing cards for something other than magic tricks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I am purely enjoying playing Millionaire (Daifugō) right now&mdash;&mdash;I’m sorry, that’s a lie! I’m in big trouble right now! Someone, please help me!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right, I’m currently being bullied by Touka-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha! I win! Ha-kun, take off your clothes quickly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s the situation. Incidentally, she still has a few cards left in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, she hasn’t even run out of cards. She just abruptly declared victory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh, what about those cards in your hand?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Trembling, I point to the cards Touka-san is holding.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She then glares at me sharply.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Do you have a problem?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“N-No!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then hurry up and take it off!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san bangs on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From beginning to end, Touka-san has been doing whatever she pleases.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I resisted at first, but… well, there’s no way someone like me could stand up against this tyrant, so I ended up submitting completely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’re running out of alcohol…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her face is flushed bright red…</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s clearly drunk, no matter how I look at it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anybody who sees Touka-san now would definitely identify her as intoxicated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Having no choice, I took off my right sock.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, there was no rule at the beginning where the loser had to strip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This drunkard just arbitrarily added that rule at some point.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was filled with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why didn’t I insist she stop after the first can? I regretted it from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Phew! Alright, onto the next round!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By now, Touka-san is no longer pouring the beer into a glass; she’s just gulping it down directly from the can.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are already six empty beer cans lined up on the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve never drunk alcohol since I was underage, so I don’t know much about it, but isn’t this a considerable amount to be drinking?</p>
<p class="calibre5">In any case, I can’t let this drunkard have any more alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Gathering my courage, I decided to caution her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, that’s enough drinking! Please don’t have any more!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I know. I know…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, she opens a new can of beer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can see why the future me made her promise not to drink in front of anyone else. &mdash; She has a terrible drinking habit!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, Ha-kun, shuffle the cards.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can I put my clothes back on?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, if she takes off my pants, underwear, and left sock, I’ll be completely naked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And, in stark contrast to me, she’s still wearing her navy-blue knit sweater and blue jeans.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, she hasn’t taken off a single piece of clothing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been alive for sixteen years, and never before have I been subjected to such an unfair game.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, shuffle the cards already~~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I’m a little annoyed by this situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So this time, I’m going to win.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And with that in mind, I cheated to make my hand advantageous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll make a run for it right from the start, and I won’t let her lay down a single card!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, it’s okay if the loser starts first, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There’s no helping it. I’ll give you the first turn.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I win. Now, let’s go to sleep.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because I cheated, of course I utterly won this game.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought Touka-san would complain, but she was surprisingly mature about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, my expectation was short-lived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see. So, I lost… Ha-kun, take off your clothes!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why!? Come on, stand up, let’s go to the room!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If we continue playing this game like this, it seems like it will become an endless battle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Realizing this, I stood up from the chair to take her to the bedroom, grabbing Touka-san’s arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just do it, take them off!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seriously resisted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Hey, wait! Don’t pull my pants!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Quiet! I really want to see Ha-kun naked right now!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While shouting like that, she ripped off my pants and socks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Aaaaah! You pervert! You lewd woman!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Finally, I was left in just my underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Really, what is this development…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, whether I win or lose, it seems like it’s settled that I will undress.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehe… It’s Ha-kun’s naked body after a month! Huh? What? Ha-kun, did you shrink in height?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Leave me alone!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Speaking of which, isn’t Touka-san mistaken me for the future Hakuba Ouji because she is drunk?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s it for the game.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No! No&mdash;&mdash;! I still want to play!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She begins to whine like a child in the terrible twos.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She really has a bad drinking habit</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: “terrible twos” is a term commonly used to describe a developmental stage that typically occurs when a child is two years old.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh… Then, this is the last time. Whether you win or lose, this is the last one…okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, it’s only because it’s me that I can put up with your whims.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We decided to have a fair game without any cheating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We distributed the cards alternately and then began the match.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’ll start… Um, the Ace of Hearts.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san placed the Ace of Hearts on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She started off with a strong card…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Pass.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though I had two Jokers in my hand, which could beat the Ace of Hearts, I thought it wasn’t the right situation to use them, so I passed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I play an 8 cut…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the Millionaire game, the ‘8 cut’ means when the 8 card is played, the current round forcibly ends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s right, it can be done with a card number 8.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Uh, wait a second? Touka-san… Isn’t the 8 cut supposed to be played with an 8? This is a 5.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indeed, the card she placed was the 5 of Clubs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter how you look at it, it’s not an 8, it’s a 5.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When I play a card, they all become an 8 cut!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unexpectedly, she made up her own rule, and it’s quite baffling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Speaking of which, even in the early Yu-Gi-Oh!, there weren’t rules as arbitrary as this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she suddenly stands up…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Bathroom.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s extremely rude to ask a woman this, but… Are you going to throw up?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I timidly inquired. If it’s vomiting, that would be a problem…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, as always, you have no sense of delicacy…I have to pee.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hearing those words, I was relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m glad it wasn’t vomiting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So, are you going to the bathroom or not?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, Touka-san doesn’t rush to the bathroom and doesn’t attempt to move from the spot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Take me there…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Take me to the bathroom!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What is she saying? Is she asking me to accompany her to the bathroom???</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, carry me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No! Come on, you’re an adult, go to the bathroom by yourself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;No~~! Hold me! Hold me&mdash;&mdash;! Ha-kun is going to princess-carry me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is she acting spoiled towards me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">If so, it should be a situation where I have to be happy… but I’m not happy at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh&mdash;&mdash; Here, I’ll lend you my shoulder, let’s go to the bathroom…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I was embarrassed to be dressed like this, so I put on only my pants.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I approach Touka-san and offer my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eeeeeh&mdash;&mdash; You won’t princess-carry me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I won’t. Besides, you might wet yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“U, uuu… Fine, then lend me your shoulder.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, she’s such a high-maintenance wife…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, I lend my shoulder to Touka-san and guide her to the bathroom.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-wait! C-can you not touch my nipple?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, Touka-san is poking my left nipple.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eeeeeh~?. You like being touched here~~!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not! Anyway, it’s ticklish so stop it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You say that, but in the end, you always enjoy it! I’m the one who made you that way!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Was the future Hakuba Ouji trained by this person?</p>
<p class="calibre5">If so, it’s a bit complicated… Anyway, let’s pretend I didn’t hear what she said now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, yes. Forgetting is the best…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, once you’re done with the toilet, go straight to bed, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ideally, she should take a bath and brush her teeth, but that can wait until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, getting this drunkard to sleep is the priority.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hit the light switch, open the door, and Touka-san enters the toilet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When you’re done, let me know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No! Stay here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you leave… I’ll cry. I’ll keep crying…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what she said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I imagine Touka-san wailing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Rather than annoying&mdash;&mdash;it’s simply unpleasant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m still a gentleman, so I plug my ears with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But what a mess of a day today has been.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, even with my ears plugged, I can faintly hear the sound of water running.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The toilet doorknob turns, and she comes out&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Huh? Wha? Huh!? What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unbelievably, the Touka-san who emerges is&mdash;&mdash;in her underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it’s white with floral patterns, it’s a sexy adult lingerie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I blink my eyes rapidly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why is she in her underwear? Why did she take off her clothes???</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t get it!</p>
<p class="calibre5">If anyone can make sense of this situation, please explain!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Please put your clothes on.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I remind myself to stay calm and speak composedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s annoying. So I’ll just sleep like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no point in arguing here; it’s better to just take her to her room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Resigned to the situation, I decided to lead Touka-san to her bedroom.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did you, uh, wash your hands?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I washed them properly. So pat my head…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… Let’s just get to your room before you catch a cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I ignore her request and head upstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once we reach the bedroom, I open the door and say,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… I’ll actually sleep, so hug me tightly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it because she’s drunk?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka-san is exceptionally clingy today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or perhaps she’s sad about parting with me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, maybe I should have been a little kinder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh… Just go to sleep, please…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that thought, my trembling hands tightly embrace her body.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She smells slightly of alcohol, but Touka-san still smells good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite the pleasant scent, I feel no excitement…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, good night.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I let go of Touka-san, and she dives onto the bed in her room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After I confirm that she’s gone to sleep, I close the door behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">I put away the empty beer cans, collected the clothes that Touka-san had thrown away, took a shower, dried my hair, and was about to fall asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I had gotten into bed and was trying to fall asleep, but I couldn’t sleep at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There are three reasons why I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre5">First, it’s because I ate too much sukiyaki, and my stomach was full.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Second, it’s because the earlier scene won’t leave my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I pretended to be tough earlier and convinced myself that I was not excited&mdash;&mdash;but that was a lie!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was extremely excited.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I mean, hugging a girl who is the same person as the person you love is a turn-on, of course!</p>
<p class="calibre5">And she was in very suggestive underwear!</p>
<p class="calibre5">If there is someone who wouldn’t get excited by this, I would surely like to see them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I don’t know, Touka-san, you’re so soft.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, well the biggest reason is…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The third and last one is&mdash;because I will be parting with her tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking about that, I just couldn’t manage to sleep.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can’t sleep:…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Probably, my eyes are undoubtedly bloodshot right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was troubled by such things, a faint light penetrated the dark room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This light is from the corridor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, someone has opened the door of my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My parents are returning the day after tomorrow in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, the one who would open this door would be either Touka-san or a thief.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the process of elimination, it would be Touka-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, I pretended to be asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I slightly opened my eyes to confirm who the perpetrator who opened the door was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, Touka-san was standing in front of the door.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;She was not in her underwear as before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was not in her underwear&mdash;it was a thin black negligee that revealed a generous amount of her chest. She had a narrow waist and two rounded bulges.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whether it was because of the attire, the arms stretching smoothly from the shoulders looked more enchanting than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The number ‘1’ was engraved near the right chest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, the date had changed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ha-kun, are you awake?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying so, Touka-san closes the door and moves into my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As Touka-san approaches, a sweet and good fragrance drifts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Damn it! She smelled like alcohol until a while ago, why does she smell good now… I swallowed hard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Touka-san lowers her waist and looks intently at my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her breath grazes my nose, and it’s a bit ticklish.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… I love this face.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, Touka-san gently climbed into my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even my childhood friend Kanako has never slept in my bed, yet this person effortlessly invaded it. We end up facing each other.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The space between my face and Touka-san’s is about the width of a fist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If we moved a little closer… we could kiss.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, my heart starts pounding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why did Touka-san climb into my bed?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Regardless, I decided to pretend to be asleep and ride the situation out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought it would be bad if she knew I was awake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000010.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you so much… really…for helping our family…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;Huh? Family? What is she talking about?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait, is she sleep-talking?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I hear soft snores coming from her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It appears she has fallen asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can’t really tell her to go back to her room now…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having no other option, I decided to sleep as we were.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But, of course, there was no way I could actually sleep, and my eyes remainedwould sharpntil the morning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I openedSlowly, my eyes that were shut.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sleeping next to me is a woman with the same face as the one I love…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I kind of understand why the Prince in Snow White would kiss a stranger like Snow White upon meeting her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He probably felt the same way I do now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, there’s no way I’m getting any sleep tonight…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, the sleepless nights continued.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then morning came.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If the clock on the wall is accurate, it’s just past six.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems I was wrong, I managed to get about two hours of sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I get out of bed, Touka-san is no longer there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It appears she got up and left the room while I was sleeping.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I proceed to leave the room and head for the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I entered the living room, Touka-san was busily preparing breakfast.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Good morning, Ha-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san’s face was flushed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Was it because she was shy? Or was it because she felt embarrassed about her behavior last night?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, I had to make something clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wh-what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Please don’t drink in public by mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, her shoulders slumped and she looked utterly dejected.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s a promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll engrave it in my heart…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And how’s the hangover?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There’s no problem. So please don’t glare at me. I-I’m sorry. I’m reflecting on it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her voice, fragile as though it might disappear at any moment, conveyed her apology.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, she seems to be remorseful, so I’ll forgive her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good to hear you’re not hungover. There’s something important I need you to do today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, there’s an important role for Touka-san today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t send her back to the future before she fulfills it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Touka-san, let’s get married today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, by early afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san and I were waiting outside the hospital room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why are we sitting on a bench in the corridor?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s because we’re about to have a small wedding ceremony in Natsumi-san’s hospital room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, right now, the room is being used by Touka-san to change into her wedding dress.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One of the reasons Touka-san came to this time was to report her marriage to Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think she probably planned to show Natsumi-san the video of the wedding ceremony that I witnessed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, there was an unexpected problem.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For some unknown reason, Touka-san’s red smartphone broke, and we couldn’t show her the video of the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tried various things to fix the smartphone, but unfortunately, there was nothing I could do with my limited knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Instead, we decided to hold the wedding ceremony in front of Natsumi-san today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, the ceremony will likely consist only of taking photos of Touka-san in her wedding dress…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow~~! Hakuba-kun, you’re such a thoughtful guy! Thanks a bunch for setting up a wedding ceremony just for me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san was thrilled at the prospect of seeing Touka-san in her wedding dress.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, light words flowed freely from her mouth, but her complexion was visibly worse than before, and she had grown thinner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She can still walk normally, but her condition is unlikely to improve.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As much as I hate to think about it, how much longer does Natsumi-san have to live?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? What’s with that serious face?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m wondering if you’re really happy about this…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I spoke my thoughts frankly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I think it could make some people feel complicated, talking about what will happen after they’re gone. At least for me, I would feel a bit conflicted.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If it were a story about hundreds of years in the future, I wouldn’t care.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, discussing a future just a few years away in which I’m not there feels a little lonely, even if it’s something to be celebrated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering this, is what we’re doing today truly for Natsumi-san’s benefit?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hakuba-kun, despite your appearance, you’re a considerate bo…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that even a compliment?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m just speaking my honest opinion. …Well, I’d be lying if I said I’m not a bit lonely. If possible, I would’ve wanted to see Touka-chan’s wedding ceremony with my own eyes and directly tell her, ‘Congratulations on your wedding!’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Am I perhaps being incredibly cruel to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Being considerate has its downsides too. It’s great to be thoughtful, but you’ll end up with a hole in your stomach if you keep it up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’d rather avoid that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then find someone who will take care of you. It’s better to have someone who will kindly embrace you even when you show your weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You should.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, right. Thank you for the meat. It was incredibly delicious!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: It doesn’t literally mean that there will be a hole in one’s stomach, but rather, it means that he could be stressed or worried to the point that it could have a negative impact on his health.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bowed my head slightly to Natsumi-san and expressed my gratitude.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No problem-no problem. It’s a farewell gift for Touka-chan, who’s going back to the future. More than that, I will miss you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t miss Touka-san too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Still, she has a place to return to. That’s great…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why I want to send her off with a smile in the end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, for me, I’ll finally be free from all the lovey-dovey stories.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha… Was it all just lovey-dovey stories?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, mostly her bragging about her husband. Well, there were other things too…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, Natsumi-san stared intently at my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why are you thanking me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She tightly gripped my hand with both of hers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, thank you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As we were having such a conversation, a small child appeared in front of us, making light footsteps.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was the little girl who had previously shown up in the hospital room with a picture book.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The little girl showed us something with a beaming smile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi Onee-chan! I finished the puzzle!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What the little girl showed us was a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it was a puzzle of a certain famous character that you can find anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The girl is happy that she’s completed it, but looking closely, one piece is missing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s a piece missing, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hesitated whether to say it or not, but I pointed out to the girl that it wasn’t complete.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the girl said to me with a smile,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I lost it, so it’s complete like this! Ah, Onii-chan, can you perform magic and produce the missing piece?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I’m not a wizard, so I can’t produce the missing piece, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. Onee-chan, thanks for always reading me picture books. This is in return for the sunflower you gave me yesterday!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The girl gives the puzzle to Natsumi-san as a gift.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps satisfied with seeing the smile of her beloved Natsumi-san, the girl scampered back to where she came from.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san was looking at the incomplete jigsaw puzzle with an affectionate face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yesterday, I had a trivial conversation on the phone with my grandmother, who was bedridden with back pain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Over the smartphone, the voice of the grandmother was always cheerful.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She seemed extremely happy with the good news about the newborn grandchildren.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, the grandmother muttered, ‘I wish I could have shown the newborn grandchildren to Grandpa as well.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those words made me feel lonely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If my grandfather were alive, he’d probably be moved to tears at the birth of a new family member.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If he were alive, he’d be overjoyed to see how much I’ve grown.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If he were alive, would he make a big fuss watching my magic tricks?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such impossibilities crossed my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Surely, Touka-san must have felt something similar.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The person you most want to celebrate with you is not by your side.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a way, it might be a curse…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“About the answer earlier…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The question about whether knowing the future after you’ve died is complicated or not…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The little girl from earlier, she’s going to have a difficult surgery in a few months. Yes, a surgery that she could potentially die from.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the time the results are known, I think I won’t be in this world anymore. All I could do was worry. That’s when Touka from the future came. According to Touka, it seems the surgery is successful. Yes, six years later, she’s still doing fine and attending elementary school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Saying it’s not complicated would be a lie… but my angel brought me good news from the future. That alone is enough for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s an amazing person; a truly extraordinary individual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even in times like this, she prioritizes other people’s problems over her own worries.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that in mind, I felt even more respect for this great person.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onee-san, you’re too considerate of others. You’ll give yourself a hole in your stomach at this rate.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… I’ll have to be careful then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The conversation I had with her today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her lovely profile as she stands beside me, wearing a contented smile…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But still, I have many regrets. I wanted to become a children’s book author and have little angels read my stories.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Was that your dream, to become a children’s book author?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, believe it or not, I had the highest grades in art at school!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I would have liked to read them, too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t say, ‘Let’s make a picture book now.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san herself must understand her own physical condition well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And above all, she’d realize there’s no time left for creating art.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m ready.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From the hospital room, I heard Touka-san’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it my imagination? Her voice sounded slightly shaky.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! I must see my angel in all her glory with my own eyes! Come on, Hakuba-kun&mdash;follow me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, we opened the door to Natsumi-san’s hospital room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Here she iss! Our goddess has descendedd&mdash;&mdash;!!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi-san, be quiet!” “Nee-san, shut up!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We warned Natsumi-san, who was overly excited and raised her voice too loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If she gets too excited, she’ll start coughing again, so we wish she’d tone it down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I can’t blame Natsumi-san for getting excited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka-san in a wedding dress really is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh, umm… You two are surprisingly in sync. But more importantly… Wowza! Wowza! It’s really a wedding dress!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing her, I felt a sense of nostalgia.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I saw Touka-san in a wedding dress in our living room at home, I was so surprised that my legs gave way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, that Touka-san was fidgeting and unusually bashful.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps showing her grand appearance in front of her sister was something special and embarrassing for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, are you staying in that hoodie, Hakuba-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, inside this top hat, I have a tuxedo.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying this, I show the inside of the top hat to Natsumi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s nothing in there?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, I pull out a tuxedo from the top hat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Whoa! Magic, it’s magic!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san is surprised as a tuxedo emerges from the top hat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I then head toward the curtain by the window without bringing my tuxedo.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hakuba-kun, you forgot your tuxedo?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, my bad. …Come here, Tuxedo-kun!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I command the tuxedo to come to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Eh? Wha? What?… The tuxedo is floating in the air!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as Natsumi-san said, the tuxedo defied gravity and floated in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I beckoned to the floating tuxedo.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow! Wohoo! Hakuba-kun, you have the ability to manipulate clothes!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’m known as the floating student at school, so making things float is something I excel at.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: 浮いている. A wordplay. It can figuratively mean not fitting in with a group, and it can literally mean the action of floating, as in an object floating. )</p>

<p class="calibre5">I catch the approaching tuxedo and hide behind the curtain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ta-daa!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow! More magic! In just a few seconds, he’s changed into a tuxedo!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san claps her hands in applause.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was my first attempt to do such magic, but seeing her so pleased made me feel it was the right decision to take the challenge.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… Nee-san, isn’t my husband amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Indeed, it was a cool magic trick.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My magic ends here. Today’s stars are Touka-san and Natsumi-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying this, I take a white smartphone out of my pocket.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, both of you line up, let’s take a picture.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, Touka-san hesitantly moves to stand next to Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Somehow, today’s Touka-san reminds me of Himegi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe she reverts to her old self when she’s with her sister…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m taking the picture now. Say cheese!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sound of the camera shutter rings out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, your face looks tense. Let’s squat down a bit this time and take it at the same eye level.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“U-uh yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Following my directions, Touka-san squats down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Great, now both of you smile… Cheese!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This snapshot is truly miraculous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Two sisters living in different times are carving a new memory as they transcend those bounds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I genuinely felt it was a good decision to bring Touka-san today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hakuba-kun, Touka-chan, thank you… Onē-chan is really happy right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Natsumi-neesan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the way, I haven’t seen the kiss of vow yet?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” “Huh?” “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course, you are going to kiss, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san’s face was that of a mischievous child.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-wait a minute, Nee-san! That’s a bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What!? A wedding isn’t complete without a vow sealed with a kiss! Onē-chan wants to see you two kiss! If I don’t see it, my spirit will wander this world forever!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I planned this just as a photo shoot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t expect Natsumi-san to push things this far…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, let me take a picture of both of you this time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Natsumi-san snatches the smartphone from me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Both of you, step away from me a bit.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The atmosphere suggests there’s no refusing her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I guess it can’t be helped. Ha-kun, kiss me on the cheek…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hurry up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So it goes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although I feel like I’m being swept away by the mood, a kiss on the cheek shouldn’t be an issue, I hope.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With trembling hands, I grasp Touka-san’s delicate shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her shoulders, her prominently outlined collarbones, they’re just like Himegi-san’s.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This isn’t cheating, is it? It’s just a cheek, so it’s barely safe, right???</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I bring my trembling lips close to her right cheek and softly kiss her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Incredibly soft…</p>
<p class="calibre5">So this is what Touka Himegi’s cheek feels like…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her face turns a deep shade of red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the first time I’ve seen Touka-san blush like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, how about Touka-chan gives Hakuba-kun a kiss this time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you want to turn Onē-chan into a wandering spirit?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san grins mischievously, threatening us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I should just comply with Natsumi-san’s request quietly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After hesitating for a few seconds, I make up my mind and offer my left cheek to Touka-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“O-okay…”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000007.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san, though slightly bewildered, softly kisses my left cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the soft sensation leaves my cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I look at her flushed face, gone is the composed Touka-san; all that’s left is an innocent young girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve kissed Ha-kun countless times, but this feels… surprisingly new.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To cool her flushed face? Or perhaps to hide her embarrassment?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because Touka-san fans her face with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I’m sure my face must be as red as hers right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess humans are strange creatures; a simple kiss on the cheek can make one’s face so hot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… I got some interesting photos.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a mischievous grin, Natsumi-san hands me back the smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The screen shows a photo of Touka-san and me, our faces so red I thought we were red balloons.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems my face is as red as Touka-san’s; also, my face feels incredibly hot right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll head home first… take your time together.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, thank you. I’ll come home later, so wait for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay. Touka-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had thought this might be a farewell between Touka-san and me, but it seems she will be coming back home after all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel bad for Natsumi-san, but I’m honestly happy that she’s spending her last moments with me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wish you have no regrets, Touka-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…okay, thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I change clothes, exchange farewells with Natsumi-san, and leave the hospital room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“He’s a good boy, isn’t he?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, he’s my pride and joy.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. Take good care of him, Touka.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Over these six years, I’ve come to understand the weight of responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I’ve become an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love him, and I have to take responsibility for that love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry. I’ve made up my mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’ve grown stronger.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, well, I am a married woman after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m going to miss you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll really, truly miss you too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because even if I go back to my original timeline, you’ll be the only one who won’t be in our world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nee-san, want to watch a movie?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pull a DVD case out of the bag I brought.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi-neesan should open this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? I should open it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, Nee-san has to open it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nee-san makes a puzzled face, but she follows my directions and opens the DVD case.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Ah! Is this the sequel to the movie that Touka-chan and I watched recently???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The DVD contains the sequel to a movie I watched with my sister six years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it’s the sequel to the last movie Natsumi-neesan, and I watched six years ago.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You said you wanted to see the sequel. Come on, let’s sit on the sofa, I’ll lend you my shoulder.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Did I say that?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You did.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it wasn’t you, but the version of you who lived in my timeline definitely said it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…There’s definitely going to be a sequel for this movie…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">During the end credits of the movie, Nee-san mumbled those words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought I’d made a mistake, choosing the wrong movie to watch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I’d previewed it in advance and decided it had a neat ending with no sequels…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, my sister instinctively knew there was more to the story.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right, Nee-san’s foresight was right, and years later, a sequel to that movie was released.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But you thought there would be a sequel, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, I guess my prediction was spot-on.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then I insert the disc into the player, and our eyes are glued to the TV.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It really is a miracle. Have you seen this, Touka-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I haven’t seen it… I was too frustrated… I’ve never thought about watching it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so…You didn’t have to be so strict about it, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Things that Nee-san couldn’t watch, I couldn’t watch either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I’ve always avoided it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I told myself that such a thing does not exist in my world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then the images start flowing on the TV screen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never thought the day would come when we’d sit shoulder-to-shoulder to watch a movie again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the screen, the characters we once saw are moving around joyfully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Characters that never age. They live a life where they can always go back in time and return to the same scene.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I found myself envying them just a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For a moment, I considered how nice it would be to stay in a closed world forever just like them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t concentrate on the movie’s plot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I have something much more important than watching a movie.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s nothing…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nee-san’s hand has gotten so thin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nee-san’s shoulders have shrunk so much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nee-san’s face never used to look so frail. Even her hair too…</p>
<p class="calibre5">She used to have beautifully black hair that I was envious of… but now…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, the sparkle in her eyes as she focuses on the screen has never changed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, my favorite smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That smile has always saved me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She and I were opposites as sisters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wanted to be like you, Natsumi-neesan. I wanted to be a cheerful girl like you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to become someone who could make others smile, someone who could easily smile herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to be the sun like you, illuminating others and making them happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">You told me about the beauty of dreams and taught me hatred.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You taught me to love and fear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You gave me bonds and birthed an unending pain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You bestowed blessings and left me sins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You left me with a gentle smile&mdash;and in the end, you returned to the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just like that, two hours passed by, and the end credits were rolling on the TV screen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, this sequel is mediocre. Yeah, the first part was definitely more interesting.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… You should lie and say it was wonderful, at least.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry-sorry~. I aimed to be a creator, so I’m the type who won’t compromise when it comes to works of art.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. That’s just like you, Natsumi-neesan…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Still, I’m glad I got to watch this movie. Yeah, I truly am…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m glad too that I got to watch it with Nee-san in the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Touka, what’s the world like six years from now?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It’s a wonderful world. It’s a really wonderful world. I wish I could show it to Nee-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, the world six years from now is a world where everyone is smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A world where everyone is happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah, I wish I could take her with me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I could take her just as she is&mdash;how happy would that make me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely, it would be even happier and more beautiful than now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I also want to see it… but unfortunately, I can’t go there.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Sorry…I’m sorry… I can’t take Natsumi-neesan with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t cry, Touka. Onee-chan doesn’t like to see you cry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Gently, I am embraced, and I know these thin arms well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I was suffering, when I was crying, the one who always hugged me was&mdash;this sister.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really, even though you’ve become older than me… you’re still such a crybaby and spoiled.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, uuuu… Nee-san! Don’t die, please don’t die!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, Touka. I’m really sorry… I wanted to live longer with you, but I can’t…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uuu… I have something I need to apologize to Nee-san for.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it? I’ll forgive anything now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I was scared and couldn’t go. I was so afraid, so terrified to see Nee-san turned into bones, that I ran away from the funeral!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t want to admit it. I couldn’t admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because Nee-san could only live for twenty years.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had a dream of becoming a picture book author.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She even had someone she loved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She could hardly attend college.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She must have had so many things I wanted to do…</p>

<p class="calibre5">The world took all of that from us, without our permission.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought this injustice should not be allowed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hated that it was discrimination. I cursed that it was unfair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I didn’t attend my sister’s funeral for some absurd reason.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I was wrong. I convinced myself with silly logic and ran from reality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was utterly foolish. Hopelessly foolish.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the time I realized, it was all too late. I was in a place from which there was no return.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000009.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see-I see, you’ve been suffering all this time… Onē-chan won’t hate or resent you just because you didn’t attend the funeral.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, uuu… I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you’re going to regret it, you should have just gone. Really, you’ve even made Onē-chan cry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry. Nee-san, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister gently stroked my head, and I felt nostalgia in that gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a warmth that I thought I could no longer feel on my skin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, wipe your nose.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sniff… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How many times are you going to apologize…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as there’s no rain that doesn’t stop, humans can’t keep crying forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s sad, but it seems like a few hours is the limit for a human to keep crying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s the longest ever. At least as far as I know.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-neesan looks at the clock with an amazed face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It appears that I’d been crying for nearly two hours.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“On the day Natsumi-neesan died, I cried for five hours…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-is that so? I’m starting to feel bad for dying…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah! No more self-pity from here on out! Instead, Touka-chan, could you grab the puzzle on the table?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Got it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pick up the jigsaw puzzle and hand it to Nee-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka, this puzzle is missing a piece, you see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you think this puzzle has no value, Touka?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I think it has value. After all, life is like this puzzle. If you’re alive, you’re bound to lose something. Once you lose it, you usually end up with an incomplete puzzle, just like this one. But this puzzle, my comrade-in-arms in this hospital worked hard to make it for me. I think there’s value in that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your life is the same as this puzzle, Touka. Even if you lose a piece like me, you have to earnestly and honestly keep looking forward. I want you all to do your best.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Nee-san holds out her pinky finger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, pinky promise.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I entwined my pinky with my sister’s.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pinky promise!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you lie…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll curse Touka’s husband!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pinky promise!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, wait, stop it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No! Next time I appear before you, I’ll become an evil spirit and curse Hakuba-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…As expected, Nee-san…I hate it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… Come on, Cinderella, you have to go to him before the midnight magic wears off.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right. I haven’t really thanked the present him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then… Goodbye, Natsumi-neesan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Touka, we won’t meet again, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nee-san lightly taps my chest with a frail gesture.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;I’ll always be here, in your heart, even if I’m dead.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, we exchange smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s hard to say goodbye, but my time with Nee-san ends here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I get up from the sofa and change from my wedding dress into the casual clothes inside my bag.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Congratulations on your marriage. You looked the most beautiful I’ve ever seen you in that wedding dress.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister smiles warmly again, and I smile back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That smile was precisely the sun I had loved.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t fight too much, okay? After all, you’re stubborn, Touka.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll take care of it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Bye-bye, Touka.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Goodbye, Nee-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m glad I was born your sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, I turn my back on my sister.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Knowing that it’s a farewell for eternity…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka came home a little past 8 PM.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, she had changed from her wedding dress to casual clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it was a mouse-gray knit dress she’d bought at a shopping mall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Somehow, it feels nostalgic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although it’s not even a month old, it feels like a very long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes are red and slightly swollen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was clear that she’d been crying hard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, her expression seemed to be more determined.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems like she was able to do what she needed to do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to believe that her wounds were fully healed by her sister.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then we took our baths in the usual order and had dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For our last meal, we decided to eat curry rice, which I had made.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a small way of repaying her for taking care of us for almost a month, I looked up a recipe on my smartphone and cooked for the first time after we got back home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka was delighted to see the curry rice I made and ate it heartily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, we finished our last supper together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the time we finished eating and doing the dishes, it was past 10 PM.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In less than two hours, she would disappear from this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be a big lie to say I won’t miss her, but she has her own path, and I have mine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why our paths will diverge after today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We chose to spend our last moments together in my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She said she was free from her penalty, so we could talk about anything regarding the future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I politely declined her offer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a tempting proposition, but I think I wanted to gradually experience the future with the important people living in this timeline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, the future I’m going to walk, and the future she has already walked could be different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The me in this timeline had an interaction with a Natsumi I was never supposed to meet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I think that Touka’s world would become different for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, it’s a world of “what ifs” that’s similar yet different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, instead of talking about hypothetical futures, we decided to talk about the events of this past month and dreams of a near future that neither Touka nor I know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s been an intense month.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, it’s hard not to be surprised when you come home and find a woman in a wedding dress sitting in my living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, this woman from the future is the person I love and claimed to be my future wife.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“For me, it was half nostalgia, half novelty.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whew, there’s so much to do when I get back!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. First, I have to give thanks for the wedding and write thank-you notes. Then there’s the annual cherry blossom viewing and Harune’s birthday party. We have to move to our new house, buy furniture and appliances, and we’ll need a car. Once all that’s done, we have to go on a honeymoon during Golden Week…and after that… well, there’s a lot more. Ah, it’s going to be so hectic, really hectic!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although she complained verbally, her face looked incredibly happy as she counted on her fingers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It sounds tough, but it also seems like a lot of fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Sorry to Ha-kun, but right now, I really want to see everyone’s faces.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It made me realize again that there’s a place where she should return to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I want to believe that it is worth it for her to come to this timeline.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, please take care of Natsumi-neesan and our family in this world. I want you to stay with them until the end.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t perfunctorily nod and say “yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was such a serious request.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It might sound lame, but that’s the best answer I can give right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad I came to this world, Ha-kun. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Me too. Thank you for coming to this world…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We both expressed our gratitude.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just a single, short phrase, but it meant a lot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, I’m going to change.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, she went into the next room to prepare for her departure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I walked towards the balcony at the back of my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unusually, countless lights were shining in the night sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After a while, Touka appeared in her wedding dress and stood beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I glanced at the clock hanging on the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Only ten minutes remain until the date changes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Have you forgotten anything? After all, this isn’t a place you can easily return to if you forget something. Especially, don’t forget the pocket watch.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m fine. I have it on me at all times.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, she took the pocket watch out from between her breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What a place to hide it…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…That being said, that outfit is really something.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The current Touka was inconsistent, to put it in one word.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, she’s in a wedding dress that embodies the ideal for women around the world, but what she’s holding in both hands are paper bags from a clothing store.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve come to realize… paper bags aren’t really something a bride should be carrying.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey! To say something like that at the last minute! …Don’t laugh!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, sorry. But that look really isn’t right…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Gosh, you’re so rude…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You could just go back with the brand-name bag you brought.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I promised to give that to my mother-in-law.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, you don’t have to go to those lengths.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay, when I get back, I’ll have my husband buy me the same thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I, Is that so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what she said…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Future me, I know it’s a lot of work, but you’ll have to work hard to earn the money for the bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, we both looked up at the night sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never dreamed a day would come when I’d look at the starry sky from this balcony with someone other than family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">She said, still looking at the starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her voice sounded gentle but also deeply serious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I just heard you say that earlier.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…At first, I really hated you. After my sister had died, I had closed off my heart, but you kept coming near me, inviting me to observe the club activities every day. I found it incredibly annoying. I really despised you for not leaving me alone.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve never invited Himegi-san to watch the club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess this is a story about a version of me that isn’t me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Right, I wanted to be alone, but you wouldn’t let me be. I thought you were an incredibly irritating guy. I assumed you had ulterior motives for getting close to me. That’s why I completely avoided you, even ignored you. Yet, you never gave up. That’s borderline stalking! Any normal girl would absolutely hate you for being that persistent!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s a good thing the person I fell in love with isn’t a ‘normal girl’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think Himegi-san is a normal girl, but it seems she doesn’t think of herself that way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh, please save any complaints for your husband when you get back! Also, what on earth made you like a guy like that???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s strange for me to say this, but after hearing her talk, I don’t see a single reason why she should like me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you talking about!? My husband is the coolest, kindest, and strongest man in the world!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, she turned her face toward me, staring intently with a gaze full of conviction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Look, the man I fell in love with saved my sister! He made a girl who had hated touching the violin remember the joy of playing it again!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Even when my parents were on the brink of divorce, he grabbed my father by the collar and got angry at him for me! The only one in the world who would dare confront my father, whom even grown-ups fear, is my husband!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I see. After losing Natsumi-san, she’s been through a lot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s interesting the Hakuba Ouji who isn’t me never ran away from those issues and confronted them head-on with the Himegi family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, to stand beside this person, I have to resolve various problems and shoulder a heavy responsibility.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I really, really… I’m truly grateful to you. You restored a broken family and reintroduced me to friends I had drifted away from.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Um, maybe you should be saying those words of gratitude to your husband.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way! If I say that, he’ll definitely get carried away.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Truly, the wife of Hakuba Ouji.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She understands me very well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The person I love is arrogant, foolish, careless with money, materialistic, perverted, mischievous, and always risky…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …… “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He’s flawed, immature, and makes mistakes often… but he is also a strong person who takes responsibility. He use his abilities not for himself, but to bring smiles to others; he’s a sincere person.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san came from the future, and I realized I had been complacent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter what, I was somewhere complacent that I would end up with Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s not the case. Standing beside Touka Himegi requires more than casual resolve.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve come to realize that I’m not qualified to stand beside her if my love is self-centered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you for saving our hearts. Because of you, we can live happy days again.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Right now, maybe I’m being tested to see whether I have the resolve to keep loving Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The me who isn’t me has chosen to walk a difficult path with this woman, shouldering that responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s something that can’t be done without immense conviction and courage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, I’m sorry. Because I came to this time, Hakuba Ouji and Touka Himegi may not end up together. Still, I wanted to bring you and Natsumi-neesan together…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll do my best to make sure that doesn’t happen…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll try my best not to let the present Touka Himegi feel sad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When Kanako asked me what I liked about Touka Himegi, I dodged the question with some vague words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, even now, I can’t put into words what drew me to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I do know for sure that I like her, and I’m glad that I’m attracted to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because she is such a wonderful person.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m really glad I fell in love with Hakuba Ouji.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Me too. I’m glad I fell for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Please say those words to the me in this world as well…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes. I will definitely confess my love to her again. I promise”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My words right now probably won’t reach her heart, but someday… definitely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">The night wind blows, stirring her beautiful hair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our eyes meet once more, locked in a straightforward gaze.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000003.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Goodbye, Ouji-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. Goodbye, Himegi-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those were the last words we exchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, she vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As if she had never been in this world to begin with…</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t surprised. I was prepared for it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, I can’t help but feel a little lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps that’s my weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Goodbyes really are over in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s still so much more I want to talk about, but that will have to wait for another opportunity.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really, she made such a dramatic entrance, but in the end she left so quietly, without leaving even a trace…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Holding onto what I’ve lost and what remains, I continued to gaze at the night sky, thinking how I’d like to share this beautiful sky with her again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wished to share this night sky not just with the Touka Himegi that I love but with the Touka Himegi who loved us all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;As a single shooting star fell across the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;I wished for something quite ordinary upon its brilliance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;’May everyone in the ‘future’ always be smiling,’ I wished upon the star…</p>


<h2>Touka Himegi: Reminiscence 4</h2>

<p class="calibre5">I was furious when I returned to my family home. Livid. Absolutely pissed off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It all started with one single remark from that man.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, in my fourth year of college, I ended up living with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Up until that point, I had been commuting from this mansion to the university, but suddenly my father said, ‘Live with that young man,’ and I was kicked out of the mansion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Truly, my father’s words that day were a bolt from the blue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Who would have thought that my father, who had always disliked Ha-kun, would suggest such a thing?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even God couldn’t have imagined it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So we rented an apartment within walking distance from both our family homes and started our life together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I had always been a bit enamored with the idea of living together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d always wanted to try living in a small room, away from this mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I was excited, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t elated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, this year marks our fourth year of dating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think it’s only natural to start thinking about the next step.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Marriage! (結婚)</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have to openly confess. Lately, these two characters have been on my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although I’m still a college student and it might be a bit early to think about marriage, some of my classmates have gotten married.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why… recently, I find myself contemplating a future with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Will we end up getting married, or…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to think our relationship is progressing smoothly, but I’m also a bit anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since becoming a college student, I’ve heard a lot more messy love stories about breakups and affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In reality, long-lasting couples are quite rare among my peers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone is breaking up for one reason or another.</p>

<p class="calibre5">People may envy our relationship, but every time I hear about someone breaking up, I get a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I started to worry that we might end up the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I had been hoping that this cohabitation would bring me closer&mdash;closer to that idiot!</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Ah, just thinking about it makes my blood boil!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-nee, you seem…Furious, looking anxious, then furious again; you’re emotionally unstable.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Be quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And you’re also being sarcastic.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Right now, we’re in the mansion’s kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why am I in a place like this, you ask? It’s to practice cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I brought my sister here from her room to have her try the finished dish.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, this idiot looked at the food I made and exclaimed, ‘It’s dangerous enough when it looks normal, but this appearance is completely out! Harune doesn’t want to die yet!’ and resolutely refused to eat it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But Touka-nee… this is, um, a remarkable sense of style of cooking, it can be called a talent. Harune couldn’t create this even if I tried. &mdash;So? Who are you planning to annihilate with this weapon?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You’ve become a bit cheeky since high school, haven’t you?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;It’s food, okay? Food! Where do you see a weapon in this? And I wouldn’t recommend making jokes when I’m holding a frying pan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, this child has only been influenced by Ha-kun in the weirdest ways…</p>
<p class="calibre5">She must be called something like a ‘disappointing princess (Himegi is the surname)’ at school, no doubt.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“St-Stop! Please put down the frying pan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, what do you call this weapon?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“For the last time, it’s not a weapon… it’s… a rice ball.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A rice ball? You mean the rice ball you wrap in seaweed and eat? I thought it was a chimera made by fusing a crow and a bat&mdash;so-sorry! Just kidding! Don’t try to swing the frying pan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There won’t be a next time…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Di-Did you serve this to Onī-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister says that and timidly pokes the rice ball with a fork.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not the exploding type!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such a disrespectful sister…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I only manage to make explosive dishes about one in ten times…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did Onī-san say he’d ‘die’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll really hit you… That idiot said it’s ‘not something any living creature should put in their mouth.’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah&mdash;just remembering it makes me furious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">How dare he say he ‘doesn’t want to eat’ the food that someone worked hard to make!</p>
<p class="calibre5">If he said it was inedible for humans, I’d reluctantly accept that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But ‘not something any living creature should put in their mouth’? What does that even mean!</p>
<p class="calibre5">So you’re saying neither dogs, nor cats, nor bugs can eat the food I made?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s frustrating. So frustrating. Annoyingly frustrating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if he apologizes, I’ll never forgive him!</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today, we’re not taking a bath together!</p>
<p class="calibre5">No s*x for a week! And kisses… only one… per day!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see. It’s an eloquent expression&mdash;wait, don’t hold that frying pan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to cook something that’ll make you gasp!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, what is Onī-san up to?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He and Takashi went to watch wrestling.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Those two really get along well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, they do. But I don’t think it’s okay for him to drag the newly-wed Takashi around.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s true, Takashi-kun will be a father soon; he lacks self-awareness.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako and Takashi, who recently got married, are classmates from school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And within Kanako’s womb, a new life is residing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I never dreamed the two of them would have a shotgun wedding. It was completely out of the blue.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Harune, don’t you ever say ‘shotgun wedding’ in front of them. Say ‘blessed wedding,’ or you’ll get glared at by Kanako.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And Touka-nee, you are getting impatient! She never thought her childhood friend Takashi and his spouse would beat her to the altar! She thought they would get married first!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh, mind your own business!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was so happy when Kanako reported the news that I jumped for joy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I truly wished the two of them the best. But watching the lovey-dovey couple makes me feel anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Does Ha-kun have any intention of marrying me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Returning to this mansion after living together for a few days&mdash;our future is fraught with challenges! If I can’t even cook properly, then marriage is but a distant dream!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“U, uuu…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If this keeps up, I’ll stay single for the rest of my life!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…you don’t even have a boyfriend, so I don’t want to hear it from you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… Touka-nee is ignorant. She has no understanding of how popular Harune is at school!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh, with those modest assets, I can’t believe you’re popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Grrr… Harune is average size! It’s just that Touka-nee is too big.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, yeah. Let’s just say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Rather than worrying about Harune, it’s about you, Touka-nee. If you can’t cook properly, you won’t be able to get married&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Twitch! (TN: Angry sfx)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Contrary to what Touka-nee might think, Onī-san is quite popular! Even among Harune’s classmates, there are many fans of Onī-san! His cute face is a big hit!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Twitch Twitch!</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Harune is actually better at cooking! Harune should be able to make Onī-san happier than Touka-nee, who produces weapons of mass destruction!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… Tell your little friends this: if they lay a hand on Ha-kun, they’d better be prepared for the consequences. By the way, that includes you too (smiles).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-w-wait, okay! I get it&mdash;put down that knife! Holding a knife while smiling is cheating!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Good grief…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, Harune is cheering for Touka-nee as well. That’s why today, I invited an expert to this kitchen to help improve Touka-nee’s cooking skills!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The kitchen door opens, and who appears before us are a pregnant Kanako and Chris-chan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You idiot, Harune! Don’t bother pregnant Kanako with such matters! Wait, Kanako, are you sure you should be up and move around?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Actually, it’s the opposite. The doctor told me I should get some moderate exercise.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Kanako pats her round belly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. So, we thought we’d take a walk and come see your face. Right, Chris-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yes. Believe it or not, I’m good at cooking.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was sincerely happy that the two of them came all this way for me during such a busy time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was truly touched.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’m not a master chef or anything, but I can at least teach you the basics.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’ll whip you into shape.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako and Chris-chan said this, smiling and flashing peace signs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, as expected, Kanako and Chris-chan are my best friends.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, where are Takashi and Hakuba?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Why are you bringing them up???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Both of them said they would be helping around the mansion, didn’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Didn’t they go to watch a wrestling match?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There shouldn’t be any wrestling events held nearby at this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I saw them heading towards the station.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. The reason they’ve been acting strangely since this morning is because they had something to hide.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had assumed they were acting weird because they were afraid of my anger…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It seems like…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That seems to be the case…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those idiots must be hiding something from us…</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, when they returned with smiles, we interrogated those fools with smiles as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a result, it turned out that they had not gone to watch wrestling but had instead gone to see a live performance by an idol named ‘Shiramori Yuki.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course, what followed goes without saying: Kanako and I applied forty-eight wrestling moves to those fools as punishment.</p>
