<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 3: The Autumn When Love Begins </h2>

<p>It has been a week since summer vacation ended and university classes resumed.</p>
<p>I, as usual, lead a life of study and part-time work, far from the rose-colored university life I had initially hoped for—though it turned out a little different than the solitary and comfortable life I wanted.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of rice left, so eat up!”</p>
<p>Nanase, sitting next to me, said that.</p>
<p>With autumn here, her azuki bean-colored high school tracksuit has made a comeback.</p>
<p>Lately, whenever our schedules align, Nanase and I have been eating dinner together.</p>
<p>It was supposed to start as a way to save on electricity by eating in an air-conditioned room together, but we’ve continued the habit into the cooler weather somewhat naturally.</p>
<p>Feeling guilty about receiving her one-sided generosity, I started giving her money for food expenses.</p>
<p>Today, Nanase made ginger pork for us. The shredded cabbage was finely and beautifully cut, reminding me of my recent failed attempt at cutting green onions, which made me feel a bit pathetic.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should also practice cooking a bit.</p>
<p>“By the way, the cultural festival is coming up soon.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” as Nanase mentioned it.</p>
<p>Our university’s cultural festival takes place at the beginning of November and lasts for three days.</p>
<p>It’s quite a grand event that attracts many people from outside the school. Those who belong to cultural clubs and circles seem to be especially gearing up for the festival with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Our seminar is going to have a booth. We’re selling yakitori for 300 yen/stick.”</p>
<p>“Huh. That’s a rip-off…”</p>
<p>“I’m not in any clubs or circles, so I’m happy I can participate in the festival! I’m looking forward to it!”</p>
<p>Nanase clasped her hands in front of her chest, her eyes shining with anticipation. For her, aiming for a rose-colored university life, it must be an unparalleled event.</p>
<p>Well, it’s none of my business. I have no intention of getting overly involved in a non-profit event. If I’m going to work, I’d rather do it at my part-time job where it’s meaningful.</p>
<p>“Besides, 300 yen/stick… Will they even sell? What kind of pricing is that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a festival, isn’t it normal? Candy apples were up to 500 yen too…”</p>
<p>They’re probably just going to grill frozen yakitori bought from a wholesale supermarket and slather it with sauce. The thought of the cost price gives me chills. I definitely wouldn’t buy it.</p>
<p>“There was also talk about the girls dressing up as saleswomen in yukata… but that got scrapped because it’d be too cold in November. I kind of wanted to wear one.”</p>
<p>Oh. So, no yukata.</p>
<p>I was, internally, a little, fairly, reasonably disappointed. Yakitori sold by Nanase in a yukata might be worth 300 yen. I found myself seriously contemplating such a ridiculous idea.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow at noon, we’re meeting in the lab for the festival planning. You should come too, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>“Huh, sounds like a hassle…”</p>
<p>I let my true feelings slip. Nanase stared at me intently, not pleased with my reluctance.</p>
<p>“I’d be happy if you came, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>…But, well, indeed. It would probably earn me some scorn from others if I, who am in no circle or club, didn’t offer any help.</p>
<p>Our seminar often involves group work, and it would be difficult to proceed if I lowered my standing with everyone.</p>
<p>My part-time job starts in the evening, so maybe it’d be better to show my face.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll go.”</p>
<p>“Really!? Yay!”</p>
<p>Nanase cheered and hummed a clumsy tune. Listening to her, it seemed to be the theme song of the local supermarket. What a choice, I thought, and chuckled to myself.</p>
<p>The next day, about seven of us, including Nanase and me, gathered in the lab for the cultural festival meeting. I didn’t see Houjo or Sudo; they must have gone to their respective circles.</p>
<p>I watched the discussion at the center of the research lab from a distance. Reluctantly, I agreed when Nanase asked me to be a salesperson on the day of the event.</p>
<p>“Hey, let’s take a break, break time. We’ve pretty much decided everything, right? It’s fine.”</p>
<p>After about two hours, Kinami threw his pen down and suggested a break.</p>
<p>Somebody spread out snack foods on the table, and the chatter grew lively as people snacked.</p>
<p>Nanase came over with a red box and sat next to me.</p>
<p>“Here, have some too, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>I thanked her and took a chocolate-covered pretzel, crunching into it. It tasted better than I remembered.</p>
<p>“By the way, the beauty pageant entries are starting soon, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, right, I saw the posters. Wonder if anyone we know will enter.”</p>
<p>During the casual conversation, someone brought that up.</p>
<p>Our university also has a beauty pageant, like many others. However, it’s not that extravagant; it’s part of the school festival’s events, almost like a game.</p>
<p>The preliminary round is voted on online, and those who pass can participate in the finals on the festival day.</p>
<p>“Hey, Nanase, why don’t you enter?”</p>
<p>The moment Kinami said that, Nanase nearly spit out her tea.</p>
<p>“W-what!? No way, Ah… absolutely impossible!”</p>
<p>Nanase refuses with a desperate look on her face, but Kinami, not giving up easily, pressed on.</p>
<p>“Come on, Nanase is cute. I bet she could make it far!”</p>
<p>“You can apply online, right? Just need to take a photo and write a profile.”</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the others were also getting excited. I kept silent, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>Then, Nanase, with a troubled look, tugged on the hem of my parka under the table. I was startled and looked at her; she was giving me a pleading look.</p>
<p>“What should I do, Sagara-kun…”</p>
<p>She whispered in a tiny voice. I responded, “What’s wrong?” while trying to be discreet. Nanase leaned in closer, and I couldn’t help but feel a embrassed.</p>
<p>“I… I can’t do a beauty pageant. It’s ridiculous to think of me entering.”</p>
<p>“What’s so ridiculous about it?”</p>
<p>“Because… you know, Sagara-kun… my, my true face.”</p>
<p>Nanase said it with an apologetic tone. So that’s what she was worried about.</p>
<p>“It’s not ridiculous at all. Why not give it a try?”</p>
<p>No matter what her bare face looks like, Nanase with makeup is undeniably beautiful, so there’s no problem with her entering a beauty pageant.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s ridiculous at all. If she’s aiming for a rose-colored university life, participating in a beauty pageant could be an interesting experience.</p>
<p>“It’s not… ridiculous?”</p>
<p>Nanase looked surprised, her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Just then, Kinami approached with his smartphone. Perhaps noticing how close we were, his expression turned slightly suspicious.</p>
<p>“What’s up? Having a private conversation?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. Here, Nanase, I’ll take your picture! Look this way!”</p>
<p>Kinami aimed the camera, and Nanase, as if resigning herself to fate, managed a strained smile.</p>
<p>Kinami pressed the shutter repeatedly, then tilted his head as he looked at the screen.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of off. Nanase, your photo isn’t coming out great. Can you smile more naturally?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t know how to smile any more naturally than this…”</p>


<p>Nanase stiffened her expression. In situations like this, she couldn’t fully become one of those sparkling girls. Maybe she’s actually the type who struggles with standing out.</p>
<p>“Hmm, maybe it’s the lighting. Sagara, could you try taking it from over there?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Oh, sure.”</p>
<p>Suddenly tasked, I reluctantly launched the camera on my smartphone and aimed it at Nanase. Turning towards me, Nanase blushed with embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun is taking the photo…? Um, can I go fix my makeup first?”</p>
<p>“No need. Just smile as you are.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Nanase offered a shy smile. I pressed the shutter button just like that.</p>
<p>“Ah, wait, wait a second! I definitely made a weird face just now!”</p>
<p>Nanase raised a panicked voice, but it wasn’t a weird face at all. Rather, I think it turned out quite well.</p>
<p>Kinami, peeking over my shoulder from behind, exclaimed, “Nice! She’s smiling so naturally! Good job, Sagara!”</p>
<p>I was praised, unusually. All I did was press the shutter without thinking much.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s submit this one!”</p>
<p>“Uh, but…”</p>
<p>While Nanase was flustered, Kinami snatched my smartphone and quickly completed the submission. “Thanks,” he said, tossing the phone back to me. Hey, that’s dangerous.</p>
<p>I caught it in a hurry.</p>
<p>Displayed on the smartphone’s screen was the photo of an undeniable beauty smiling naturally… Yeah, I have to admit, it turned out well.</p>
<p>By the time the meeting ended, the sun had completely set.</p>
<p>“…Sigh. I ended up being entered in the beauty pageant.”</p>
<p>Walking beside me, Nanase’s shoulders slumped in resignation. We ended up walking home together by the flow of events, but since we lived in the same place, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad. Think of it as getting one step closer to your rose-colored life.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but…”</p>
<p>“You didn’t want to participate?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s not so much that I didn’t want to… It just feels wrong somehow.”</p>
<p>We arrived at the bicycle parking area, but since it was an awkward place to end the conversation, we stopped there. Nanase leaned against her bike’s saddle, looking downcast.</p>
<p>“What should I do… This is definitely a scam, right…?”</p>
<p>“A scam?”</p>
<p>“Because, I’m not really a beauty… I’m just deceiving everyone with makeup. And now I’m entering a beauty pageant… If they find out, they’ll be mad.”</p>
<p>Nanase hung her head sadly. The woman standing before me now was a perfect beauty, shining and radiant. Compared to her bare face, it might not be strange to call it a scam.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t feel like she was deceiving anyone.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Nanase blinked rapidly as she turned towards me. Her eyes, reflecting the setting sun, were dyed in a mysterious color, and staring into them made me feel strangely moved.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>I regretted speaking up, as if I had said something ridiculous, but I started talking, spurred on by her encouraging gaze.</p>
<p>“The reason you’re, well, considered beautiful now… is because of the effort you’ve put in, right?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“In that sense, you’re much more amazing than someone who’s naturally beautiful. So, I don’t think it’s something you should be blamed for… That’s what I believe.”</p>
<p>Nanase stared straight at me, silent and intense. As she remained quiet, I wondered if I had said something wrong, growing anxious.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nanase, illuminated by the sunset, smiled softly.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun, you’re so kind.”</p>
<p>Our eyes met, and I nearly forgot to breathe.</p>
<p>If I could capture this moment of Nanase in a photo, she would easily win the beauty pageant. Her smile was so charming that I found myself thinking such things.</p>
<p>Two weeks passed, and there was only one week left until the cultural festival.</p>
<p>While studying, I stopped moving my mechanical pencil and picked up my smartphone from the table. I slid my finger across the screen to open the search engine’s homepage, intending to look up the meaning of a word I didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Smartphones are incredibly convenient devices, but their downside is how they can diminish concentration.</p>
<p>Lying down on the tatami, I remembered that the beauty pageant voting period should be starting soon. Typing [Risseikan University beauty pageant] into the search bar brought up the special site for our campus’s beauty pageant at the top of the results.</p>
<p>Opening the page, I saw the words [WEB Voting Now Open!] dancing across the screen.</p>
<p>The entry list showed the faces and profiles of various women. I didn’t intend to outright deny it, but ranking women based on their looks seemed outdated to me.</p>
<p>Scrolling through, a familiar face quickly appeared.</p>
<p>From the next room, I could hear a man and woman arguing, ‘Why don’t you understand?’ ‘I get anxious if you don’t put it into words.’</p>
<p>Lately, Nanase has been hooked on a romance drama that airs every Thursday at 22:00. Every week at this time, I’m subjected to their trivial exchanges. Consequently, I’ve rough idea of  the plot.</p>
<p>They hurt each other over trivial misunderstandings and, just when they seem to have parted ways, they inevitably return to each other.</p>
<p>Nanase passionately claims it’s “frustratingly heart-throbbing,” but I don’t understand it at all. How can people devote so much energy to something as futile as love?</p>
<p>In the smartphone, Nanase is blushing and smiling sweetly. Anyone would be captivated by her beauty, but the person earnestly watching the drama next door is a plain girl in a tracksuit.</p>
<p>Below the photo, her name and a simple profile are listed.</p>
<p>Haruko Nanase, born on May 3rd, Taurus, blood type A.</p>
<p>Her hobbies include studying and shopping.</p>
<p>Her special skill is being able to name all the emperors of Japan.</p>
<p>Her ideal type is someone kind and serious.</p>
<p>Her motto is to be diligent and honest.</p>
<p>…Wow, that’s so Nanase.</p>
<p>I laughed silently, feeling it was somehow “very her.” Compared to profiles listing hobbies like dancing, hot yoga, and flower arranging, hers definitely stood out a bit.</p>
<p>Tapping the photo in the entry list allowed for voting.</p>
<p>The system was designed to prevent multiple votes. The homepage stated:</p>
<p>[Vote for the person you think is the most wonderful!]</p>
<p>While looking at the array of photos, I pondered. Choosing the most beautiful woman among them was a difficult question.</p>
<p>Beauty is subjective, and there’s no absolute standard.</p>
<p>…But if asked to choose the woman I find most wonderful─the answer isn’t that hard.</p>
<p>I tapped Nanase’s photo with my index finger. The moment I saw the message [Thank you for your vote!] on the screen, I threw the smartphone. It made a soft thud as it rolled across the tatami.</p>
<p>“…What am I doing…”</p>
<p>From the next room, a female singer’s ballad played, signaling the drama’s ending.</p>
<p>By now, on the other side of the TV, the man and woman must be embracing. ‘To me, you’re the most beautiful person in the world,’ the man would say.</p>
<p>I laughed through my nose at the ridiculousness.</p>


<p>“Kyaa! Look, look over there!”</p>
<p>“Wow, super cute!”</p>
<p>A pair of women who saw me came running over, all excited. Unless I was a handsome guy like Houjo, this was a scene I’d never encounter again in my life.</p>
<p>“Come on, wave at them,” Kinami urged me, and I awkwardly moved my arm. Squeals of “Cute!” erupted.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, can we take a photo with you?”</p>
<p>“Totally okay!”</p>
<p>Kinami answered for me. The women stood on either side of me, intertwining their arms with mine. It’s a bit regrettable that I couldn’t feel their touch.</p>
<p>As they left, they said, “Bye then, Mr. Panda,” taking turns patting my head. Honestly, I didn’t mind it.</p>
<p>“Hey, ladies, how about some yakitori? We’re selling it in front of the grass plaza!”</p>
<p>So, today marks the first day of our campus —Risseikan University’s cultural festival.</p>
<p>Stalls line up everywhere within the campus, with calls of “It’s delicious,” “It’s cheap,” “There are cute girls here” echoing around.</p>
<p>The visitors weren’t just students from our university. There were parents with their small children, groups of high school students in their uniforms, and even middle-aged men in sandals.</p>
<p>Amidst all this hustle and bustle, for some reason, I found myself dressed in a panda costume, trying to attract customers.</p>
<p>Going back to two hours earlier. Tasked with selling yakitori, I was practically dragged to the lab by Nanase at seven in the morning.</p>
<p>Someone had brought a panda costume and left it in a corner of the lab, and I had a bad feeling about it from the start. My premonition soon proved accurate.</p>
<p>Lifted the panda head, Sudo declared loudly.</p>
<p>“Alright, guys, gather ’round! The loser of rock-paper-scissors has to wear this and be the seller!”</p>
<p>…Come on, give me a break.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I have terrible luck in situations like this. I’m the type who always draws the short straw at crucial moments.</p>
<p>Back in middle school, whenever we did rock-paper-scissors to decide on cleaning duties, I always lost and ended up cleaning the toilets.</p>
<p>Before I could complain about finding another way to decide, Sudo shouted with his hand raised.</p>
<p>“Here we go! Rock, paper…”</p>
<p>…Scissors. And I put out rock. Everyone else chose paper.</p>
<p>“Alright, Sagara’s the only loser. So, please do us the honor.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Sudo pushed the panda head towards me. I reflexively took it and protested, “Hey, wait!”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Why a panda for selling yakitori? That’s weird.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you’re worried about? It’s all about standing out, man! Picky guys don’t get popular!”</p>
<p>Damn, I can’t win against this guy. And it’s not like I want to be popular anyway. As I struggled to find a retort, Houjo, seeing my plight, offered a lifeline.</p>
<p>“Sagara. If you really hate it that much, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>This guy is truly a good person. On top of being handsome, he’s also got a great personality. There’s got to be a flaw somewhere, like athlete’s foot, or the world’s balance would be off.</p>
<p>I was about to say, “I’ll leave it to you,” when the women around us erupted in protest.</p>
<p>“No way! Hiding Houjo-kun’s face is such a waste!”</p>
<p>The women quickly surrounded me, pressing in with an intense fervor.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun! You’ll do it, right? I want to see Sagara-kun in a panda outfit!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, it’s okay! Just wander around quietly, and that’s enough!”</p>
<p>The solidarity women show at times like this is truly formidable. Overwhelmed, I ended up forcibly dressed in the panda costume. The world is filled with injustices.</p>
<p>“Ahaha! It’s so fancy! It doesn’t suit you at all!”</p>
<p>Sudo pointed and laughed uproariously. To think she forced me into this and then has the nerve to laugh.</p>
<p>As I sulked inside the costume, Nanase came running over with her face beaming. Smiling happily, without a hint of malice, she said,</p>
<p>“Wow, Sagara-kun, you’re cute! Let’s take a photo together later!”</p>
<p>…Well, can’t be helped. It’s just for today.</p>
<p>And so, quite out of character, I found myself in a panda costume, selling yakitori.</p>
<p>As for attracting customers, all I did was wander around holding a sign. The only one talking was Kinami, who was beside me. It was strange that he volunteered to accompany me, but I realized he just wanted to use me as bait to talk to girls. Proof of that was how he only approached young women.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara,”</p>
<p>While taking a break behind the school building, Kinami handed me a bottle of mineral water.</p>
<p>“Drink up. It must be hot in there.”</p>
<p>Indeed, it was hot. Despite it being November, with everyone walking around in autumn clothes looking cool, I was sweating buckets inside the costume.</p>
<p>Making sure no one was around, I lifted and removed the panda head. Instantly, breathing became easier, and I could finally take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Kinami opened the cap and handed me the bottle, surprisingly he really considerate. I tilted the bottle, letting the water flow down my throat.</p>
<p>…Ah, refreshing.</p>
<p>The cool breeze caressed my sweaty cheeks, feeling pleasant. As I took in much-needed oxygen, Kinami suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara. About Nanase…”</p>
<p>…Not this again, I thought, feeling exasperated.</p>
<p>Lately, because I’ve been spending more time with Nanase, I’ve been subject to misunderstandings. I was ready to firmly deny it, but Kinami’s words took me by surprise.</p>
<p>“Actually, I confessed to Nanase over the summer break.”</p>
<p>I nearly spat out my water. What an unexpected revelation from him.</p>
<p>“…Con…fessed? You? To Nanase?”</p>
<p>Ignoring my shock, Kinami casually laughed, saying, “Ew, gross.”</p>
<p>I had noticed Kinami seemed interested in Nanase, but I had no idea he had confessed. Nanase hadn’t shown any signs of it either.</p>
<p>“…So, are you two…dating?”</p>
<p>For Nanase, who aims for a rose-colored university life, a bright and sophisticated guy like Kinami would seem close to an ideal partner.</p>
<p>Nanase had mentioned she found Kinami difficult to handle before—but if her feelings had changed and they started dating without my knowledge, it wouldn’t be surprising.</p>
<p>“No, I got rejected.”</p>
<p>Kinami answered nonchalantly. Ah, I see. Good. I unintentionally let out a sigh of relief, then immediately scolded myself for feeling relieved.</p>
<p>“I thought we were getting along well.”</p>
<p>Despite saying that, Kinami didn’t seem too shocked. Given it was over the summer, which was already two months ago, he might have already moved on.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Nanase has someone she likes?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Sagara, you’re close to Nanase, so I thought…”</p>
<p>“…No clue.”</p>
<p>I honestly didn’t know, so I answered truthfully. Kinami just said, “I see,” sounding a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>“Man, Nanase’s amazing, making it through the beauty pageant prelims.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, right.”</p>
<p>“And Sagara, did you vote for anyone?”</p>
<p>I decided to exercise my right to remain silent on that question.</p>
<p>Without responding, I said, “Break’s over,” and put the panda head back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the first afternoon of the cultural festival, Sacchan and I were calling customers over together.</p>
<p>The aroma of nicely grilled yakitori wafted from the stall. Just defrosting frozen yakitori bought from a wholesale supermarket, applying sauce, and grilling it didn’t require much effort.</p>
<p>According to Sagara-kun, it’s a “shady business.” Thanks to our prime location in the middle of the grass plaza, we were quite busy.</p>
<p>“Sudo-san, Nanase-san. If you’re free, why don’t you take a look around?”</p>
<p>While grilling skewers, Torii-kun from the same seminar group said. It seems that Torii-kun was assigned to the role of grilling skewers solely because of the impact of his surname. However, he didn’t complain at all and continued to grill the skewers with a smile.</p>
<p>“Also, bring some customers along. Sagara and Kinami haven’t come back at all. Those guys, they must be slacking off.”</p>
<p>Hearing Torii-kun’s words, I burst into laughter, recalling the image of Sagara-kun wrapped in a panda costume.</p>
<p>Just imagining what kind of face that unsociable Sagara-kun is making under the costume is hilarious. I must take a picture with him later.</p>
<p>“Ok, leave it to me! If anything comes up, contact me.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Torii-kun. Please take care of it.”</p>
<p>“Yeap, take care~”</p>
<p>Waved off by Torii-kun, we started walking side by side.</p>
<p>The sky was a clear blue, and the contrast with the red and yellow tinted trees was beautiful. The roadside was crowded with stalls, and in front of the fountain, a dance circle was showcasing break dancing.</p>
<p>At the stage on the grass square, the finals of a quiz competition were being held. As incorrect buzzers were hit, large amounts of water fell on the contestants, enveloping the venue in laughter. I wonder how it works.</p>
<p>Here and there, cheerful laughter echoed. Wrapped in the lively air of this unusual day, I felt my heart swell with excitement.</p>
<p>“Haruko, looks fun, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s fun!”</p>
<p>In high school, I used to prepare in a corner so as not to bother anyone, and on the day itself, I would hole up in the library studying all day. Participating in a festival like this is a first for me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but skip, and Sacchan laughed, saying, “I like that about you, Haruko.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to the beauty pageant in the evening! Passing the preliminaries, as expected of Haruko!”</p>
<p>Sacchan said that with a proud smile.</p>
<p>The moment she said it, I remembered the fact I had almost forgotten, and my stomach started to hurt.</p>
<p>Somehow, I had miraculously passed the preliminaries of the beauty pageant. I have to stand on the stage for the finals this evening.</p>
<p>How did this happen? There’s no way I can compete with the naturally beautiful girls. If there’s anything commendable about me, it’s only my makeup skills that deceive those around me. This, I’m somewhat confident in.</p>
<p>“Really, I’m proud to have you as a friend! My Haruko is the cutest!”</p>
<p>Sacchan was more delighted about my passing the preliminaries than I was. I’ve always thought so, but it seems like Sacchan overestimates my looks.</p>
<p>Is this what they call ‘friend bias’? If so, it’s quite pleasant.</p>
<p>…Still, I’m deceiving my dear Sacchan.</p>
<p>At that moment, a pair of girls passing by glanced over at me. Curious, I looked their way and heard them giggling. It felt unpleasant.</p>
<p>“…Nanase-san… is going to be in the beauty pageant…”</p>
<p>“…Wow, getting carried away…”</p>
<p>“…Not that great anyway…”</p>
<p>I could somewhat guess the content of the whispered conversation. They should be from the same department of economics as me. We had sat at the same table at the party before.</p>
<p>…Yeah. That’s right. I understand that much.</p>
<p>The overheard words “Not that great” felt like tiny thorns pricking me.</p>
<p>The confidence I tried to muster deflated.</p>
<p>“What’s that about. So rude! If you have something to say, say it clearly!”</p>
<p>Sacchan raised her voice, and the girls hastily walked away. Sacchan patted my back, trying to cheer me up as I looked down.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind that. Oh, want to eat takoyaki? Hiroki gave me a free ticket.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes! I want to eat!”</p>
<p>Sacchan and I headed to the takoyaki stall next to building 2, run by the futsal circle Hiroki-kun belongs to.</p>
<p>Hiroki-kun was holding a large signboard, talking to a girl nearby. As soon as he recognized Sacchan, he interrupted the conversation and his eyes sparkled with joy.</p>
<p>“Hey, Saki! Welcome!”</p>
<p>“Yo, i came for takoyaki. Give me some extra.”</p>
<p>“Can’t help it, for beauties like you, I’ll add some extra. Satoshi, make it a large serving of takoyaki.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Hiroki-kun handed us a clear food pack filled with takoyaki. The takoyaki was topped with green seaweed and fluffy bonito flakes danced on it.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Hiroki-kun.”</p>
<p>“No problem. Sorry, I can’t help you guys out.”</p>
<p>“Really, even Sagara is being made to wear a panda costume.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it tomorrow, the panda.”</p>
<p>“How’s that going to work? Showing your face is your only asset.”</p>
<p>“Idiot, it’s the reveal that’s good, ‘handsome when he takes it off.'”</p>
<p>Watching their exchange, I thought they really are a good match. I wonder if they ever will date. Though I’d feel a bit lonely if Sacchan got a boyfriend.</p>
<p>Then, as we strolled around the stalls, we also bought tapioca bubble tea along the way. Occasionally, we didn’t forget to call out, “We’re selling yakitori in front of the grass square.”</p>
<p>Passing by, a little girl said, “The panda earlier was cute,” and I involuntarily stopped walking. At the same time, Sacchan exclaimed, “Look, Haruko, there’s Sagara.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Looking in the direction Sachi-chan pointed, I saw a giant panda surrounded by high school girls in uniforms.</p>
<p>One of the girls playfully hugged the panda. The panda seemed to be smitten, though of course, I couldn’t see his face at all.</p>
<p>…Huh. He seems to be having a great time.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to call out to him?”</p>
<p>“…No! He seems busy.”</p>
<p>Answering that, I sipped my tapioca bubble tea. The tapioca pearls at the bottom of the cup wouldn’t come out, irritating me even more.</p>
<p>“Hey, Haruko. There’s a dance circle performance in front of the gym now. Nami said she’d be there, let’s go watch.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I replied, crumpling the tapioca cup and throwing it in the trash.</p>
<p>Turning my back so as not to see the panda, I quickly started walking. (tln : haruko is so jelly lmao)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After wandering around for about half a day, I was utterly exhausted inside the panda costume.</p>
<p>I learned for the first time that just walking in a costume can be tiring. It’s hot, the view is restricted, and it’s incredibly uncomfortable to move.</p>
<p>I had never taken a costume job before, and I probably never will again.</p>
<p>Swept up by the magic of the cultural festival, Kinami hit it off with some unknown girls and went off somewhere.</p>
<p>Left behind, I was just a stray panda, wandering aimlessly with a signboard. Can I go home now?</p>
<p>As I aimlessly wandered, I spotted Nanase briskly walking in front of the fountain.</p>


<p>When I saw her with Sudo during the day, she was in high spirits, skipping around, but now she has an unnaturally stiff expression.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, her right hand and foot are moving together. Is she alright?</p>
<p>“Nanase.”</p>
<p>My voice came out muffled due to the mascot costume. Nanase, turning towards me, had an anxious expression like that of a lost child.</p>
<p>“Are you Alone? Isn’t Sudo with you?”</p>
<p>“…It’s almost time for the beauty pageant to start. I’m going to prepare.”</p>
<p>Is it that time already? I looked up at the large clock on Building 1. It was 15:30. The beauty pageant that Nanase is participating in starts at 16:00.</p>
<p>“I need to change and touch up my makeup. I have to make myself at least somewhat presentable…”</p>
<p>Saying this, Nanase slumped. She must be nervous. Her clenched fists were trembling slightly, and her face seemed a bit pale.</p>
<p>“…Are you okay?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Nanase gave a stiff smile. No, it was more like she forced one side of her cheek to twitch rather than a smile. She didn’t look okay at all. However, I’m the type who doesn’t have the right words of encouragement in times like this.</p>
<p>As I remained silent, not knowing what to say, Nanase hesitantly started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Um, Sagara-kun. Can I ask you for a favor?”</p>
<p>“Depends on what it is.”</p>
<p>“…Could you, maybe, say that I’m cute…!?”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded by Nanase’s sudden request. I didn’t quite get what she meant.</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask why! I know I’m asking for something annoying!”</p>
<p>Nanase was holding her cheeks with both hands, screaming in a fit of emotion.</p>
<p>“But, maybe it’s like, the power of words!? If someone says I’m cute, it feels reassuring… Like it gives me a bit of confidence!”</p>
<p>“I don’t get it. Sudo and others are always saying stuff like that to you.”</p>
<p>I often hear Sudo praising Nanase, calling her cute. Kinami does the same. There are plenty of people who call Nanase cute; I don’t see why I need to say it.</p>
<p>Nanase lowered her long eyelashes, fidgeting with her hands in front of her chest, and murmured.</p>
<p>“Because… you’re the only one who knows my true face…”</p>
<p>…Ah, I see.</p>
<p>In essence, Nanase is seeking affirmation for her natural self to gain confidence. Indeed, that’s something only I can do for her. If that’s the case, I don’t mind helping out. It’s not much trouble to say it out loud.</p>
<p>I took a short breath.</p>
<p>“Cu…”</p>
<p>Nanase was staring at me with hopeful eyes. The words got stuck in my throat and wouldn’t come out. Why can’t I simply say a five-letter phrase?</p>
<p>“…You are …Cute.”</p>
<p>The voice I finally managed to squeeze out was embarrassingly cracked. Against my will, my cheeks grew hot. I was glad to be wearing the panda mascot costume.</p>
<p>Nanase took my fluffy hands and smiled with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sagara-kun. I feel like I can do my best now.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m going to go.”</p>
<p>Nanase said, slapping her cheeks lightly. Then, she straightened her back and walked away.</p>
<p>Left alone, I was desperately trying to cool my cheeks. Strange sweat started to break out all over my body.</p>
<p>…Ah, I shouldn’t do things I’m not used to.</p>
<p>As I stood there dazed, Kinami returned.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara. What are you standing around for?”</p>
<p>“…Ah… nothing.”</p>
<p>I replied, attempting to sound calm, and Kinami glanced at his smartwatch.</p>
<p>“Is it that late already? Sagara, are you heading home? You said you have work tonight, right?”</p>
<p>It seemed he remembered what I said this morning. Turns out, he’s more considerate than I thought. After spending half the day together, I realized he doesn’t discriminate against even someone as gloomy as me, and I began to understand why he has many friends.</p>
<p>Come to think of it. It’s the first time I’ve spent such a long time with someone else at university.</p>
<p>Even this morning, I hadn’t talked this much with the others from  seminar before.</p>
<p>…It seems that it’s not only Nanase who has made her way into my otherwise comfortable and solitary university life.</p>
<p>I felt a rough sensation of discomfort. It’s as if something unknown is slowly encroaching upon me.</p>
<p>“By the way, the beauty pageant is starting soon. Nanase said she’s wearing a sleeveless dress! She doesn’t usually show much skin, so her upper arms are a rare sight! I definitely want to see!”</p>
<p>Kinami raised his voice excitedly, to which I directed a scornful look. He asked me, undeterred by my gaze.</p>
<p>“Sagara, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment. Honestly, I was quite exhausted from walking around in the mascot costume. I have work late tonight, and I should be heading home to sleep…</p>
<p>…That was the plan.</p>
<p>But then I remembered Nanase’s face earlier. Her eyes, filled with anxiety as she looked at me for reassurance. Even though my presence might not mean anything, I couldn’t bring myself to just go home and sleep.</p>
<p>“…I’ll go.”</p>
<p>At my response, Kinami showed a meaningful smile. What’s with that look? It’s not like I want to see her upper arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes before the show. In the beauty pageant waiting room, I felt like I was going to die of nervousness.</p>
<p>A temporary tent set up next to the stage in the grassy plaza where the beauty pageant was to be held served as the waiting room. Inside were mirrors and lockers for each contestant. I changed into a rented light blue dress, draped a shawl over my shoulders, and fixed my hair and makeup in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>To my right and left were beauties. In front of me was a plain woman disguised with makeup.</p>
<p>In this place, I was the only outlier. While the other girls chatted amiably, I couldn’t join in. Memories of my lonely high school days came back to me.</p>
<p>Everyone here was a genuine beauty. A place like this wasn’t meant for a fake like me.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00013-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Could I withdraw now? But then, my friends, who were happy about my participation, might be disappointed. …I absolutely don’t want to let my friends down.</p>
<p>With determination, I slapped my cheeks and glared at my reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>—The reason you’re considered beautiful now is because of your hard work.</p>
<p>—In that sense, you’re much more amazing than those naturally good-looking. So, it’s not something to be blamed for.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m okay. There are people… who truly see me and acknowledge me.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes before the show starts. Contestants, please head to the stage!”</p>
<p>A staff member’s voice echoed in the waiting room. Holding the words “you’re cute” close to my heart, I walked towards the stage.</p>
<p>“Well then, it has started! Who is the most radiant Miss Campus of the year? Welcome to the Miss Risseikan beauty pageant! I am Yoshikawa from the executive committee, your host!”</p>
<p>His resonant tenor voice spread through the speakers. The beauty pageant was more popular than expected, and a large crowd had gathered in the grassy plaza.</p>
<p>“Let’s welcome the six beauties who have triumphed in the preliminaries to the stage!”</p>
<p>A passionate cheer vibrated through the air. With trembling legs, I forced myself to walk awkwardly. The other five seemed unnervingly familiar with this, walking like supermodels on a red carpet. Maybe I’m the only one this nervous. Swallowing my saliva, I stood in my designated spot.</p>
<p>“Go Haruko! You can do it!”</p>


<p>I spotted Sacchan in the front row of the plaza, cheering loudly. Next to her was Houjo-kun. Upon closer look, it seemed like some of the kids from the same seminar, as well as Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan, had also come. Once again, the pressure made my heart feel like it was going to be crushed.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I found myself looking for Sagara-kun. And there, at the edge of the front row of the stage, I spotted a panda mascot costume. Knowing he was unexpectedly close calmed my nerves a bit.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s have each contestant introduce themselves and make their appeal! Starting with entry number one, please go ahead in order!”</p>
<p>“Ryoka Kiyohara, a junior in the Literature Department! People often tell me I have a name like a top star from Takarazuka, but actually, my special talent is ballet, which I’ve been doing since kindergarten.”</p>
<p>Her clear voice rang out confidently, and she struck a beautiful arabesque pose on stage, eliciting loud applause from the audience.</p>
<p>What should I do, I can’t do anything like that… My special talent is “being able to name all the Emperors in history”</p>
<p>…Ugh, it’s too plain.</p>
<p>The second woman showcased her talent for impersonating famous celebrities with her husky Kansai accent. The third woman declared, “My appeal point is this sunny, shining smile!” and successfully elicited laughter with her confident demeanor.</p>
<p>One by one, the beautiful contestants made their self-introductions. Each one was beautiful, unique, and radiated confidence from within.</p>
<p>And finally, it was my turn.</p>
<p>“Now, our last contestant! Nanase-san, please go ahead!”</p>
<p>My name was called, and my body stiffened in shock. Somehow mustering my courage, I faced forward with my chin up and began to speak.</p>
<p>“…I’m, Haruko Nanase, a freshman in the Economics Department! …Um, my special talent is…”</p>
<p>Knowing the crowd in front of me was watching, my head started to spin. Never in my plain life had I been the focus of attention from so many people.</p>
<p>My mind went blank, and not a single name of the Emperors came to mind. My blood ran cold, and all I could do was let out trembling breaths.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Seeing me freeze, the host looked puzzled. I need to speak properly.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and was about to start over when──</p>
<p>──Splash!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large amount of water poured down from above. Reflexively, I covered my face with both hands and looked down.</p>
<p>…Huh, what!? What just happened?</p>
<p>The sudden mishap caused a commotion in the venue. “W-what!? What’s going on!?” the host exclaimed in panic. Then, from the side of the stage, I heard the staff’s voice.</p>
<p>“Hey! Wasn’t the quiz show set supposed to be cleared away?!”</p>
<p>“Sorry! That’s strange…”</p>
<p>That’s when I finally understood the situation. The water from a penalty game for a quiz show must have fallen on me.</p>
<p>Whether it was because of the water temperature or the weather, it didn’t feel as cold as I expected. Water was dripping down my body. My hair and clothes were completely soaked, clinging to my body. Ah, my eyelashes came off. My eyeliner and eye tape must have come off too.</p>
<p>My heart pounded loudly, almost painfully. If I raise my face now, my real face──my plain, unimpressive true face will be seen.</p>
<p>…If they know the real me, will everyone drift away from me?</p>
<p>“Nanase-san! Are you okay?”</p>
<p>The host, sounding worried, grabbed my shoulder.</p>
<p>Please, just leave me alone, it’s okay.</p>
<p>Unable to lift my face, I just shook my head from side to side. Ah, it’s all over now──</p>
<p>“Nanase!!”</p>
<p>At that moment, someone called my name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stage in the grassy plaza, the venue for the beauty pageant, was crowded with people.</p>
<p>It was a much bigger event than I had thought, slightly overwhelmed by the enthusiasm around me.</p>
<p>Feeling conspicuously out of place, I realized I had forgotten to take off the panda mascot costume.</p>
<p>Feeling awkward, I knew there was no time to go back to the lab to change.</p>
<p>“Sagara, over here!”</p>
<p>Led by Kinami’s gesture, I made my way through the crowd, somehow ending up in the very front row of the stage. It felt embarrassingly enthusiastic. I decided to stay at the very edge at least.</p>
<p>“Hey, you don’t need to come this far forward…”</p>
<p>“You want to see up close, right? Make sure to properly support Nanase too!”</p>
<p>“I-I didn’t come here to cheer or anything…”</p>
<p>Just then, I felt something hit me in the back as if something had crashed into me. Turning around, I saw two familiar-looking women standing there.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry about that.”</p>
<p>After a cursory apology, the women scurried off towards the backstage. Could they be staff for the beauty pageant? I wondered vaguely as dazzling spotlights lit up the stage.</p>
<p>“Well then, it’s started! Who is the most radiant Miss Campus of the year? Welcome to the Miss Risseikan Beauty Pageant!”</p>
<p>The contest host, likely a student from our university, spoke with a professional smoothness.</p>
<p>Amidst roaring cheers, the five finalists made their entrance onto the stage. Nanase, trailing at the end, had her lips tightly pursed as she faced forward.</p>
<p>Nanase, looking uncomfortable, scanned the audience as if searching for something. When her eyes met mine in the front row, I thought I saw her cheeks relax ever so slightly.</p>
<p>…Do your best.</p>
<p>I found myself silently cheering her on.</p>
<p>Next to me, Kinami, who had been heckling, let out a sigh of admiration.</p>
<p>“Man, the finalists are all so beautiful. That one, I saw her on a TV show the other evening!”</p>
<p>So, there are students who are like budding celebrities among them. Indeed, as Kinami said, they all looked quite polished.</p>
<p>But to my eyes, only Nanase, standing straight with her back, was visible. A serious, hardworking woman who covered her plain face with makeup.</p>
<p>When it was finally Nanase’s turn to introduce herself, she stepped up to the microphone as prompted.</p>
<p>“…I’m Haruko Nanase, a freshman in the Economics Department! …Um, my special talent is…”</p>
<p>Her face, lit by the spotlight, was tense, turning pale. Remembering her usual soft smile, I wanted to tell her that the real Nanase isn’t like this.</p>
<p>In front of me, the Nanase I know is much more──</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Suddenly, water fall down on Nanase from above.</p>
<p>In an instant, the venue was thrown into chaos. “Is this part of the act?” someone wondered aloud. Both the contestants and the host on stage seemed flustered, and the side of the stage became hurriedly busy.</p>
<p>Nanase, drenched from head to toe, was covering her face with her hands and looking down.</p>
<p>“Whoa, that’s bad. What’s happened to Nanase?”</p>
<p>Kinami next to me voiced his concern. The host, clearly flustered, grabbed Nanase’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Nanase-san! Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Nanase kept her face covered, shaking her head. Probably, I was the only one in the venue who understood why Nanase couldn’t lift her face.</p>
<p>──I’m scared of showing the real me and having everyone leave.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was running towards the stage.</p>
<p>“Nanase!”</p>
<p>At my voice, Nanase lifted her face in surprise. Before her face could be seen by those around, I took off the panda head and placed it over her.</p>
<p>Then, I saw the two women from earlier standing at the side of the stage. The moment our eyes met, they visibly panicked and hastily ran off.</p>


<p>…I somehow guessed the reason why the water fell. But, I don’t have time to deal with those guys right now.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I grabbed Nanase’s wrist and forcibly pulled her, descending from the stage. Probably almost everyone at the venue is focusing on me right now. I hate standing out, but it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>“What…what’s this about! Suddenly, a panda invades and takes Nanase-san away! Is, is this some kind of performance!? Huh, it’s not!?”</p>
<p>While listening to the host’s voice behind me, I silently marched on. Like Moses parting the sea, the crowd quickly made way for us.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun…”</p>
<p>I hear Nanase’s muffled voice. People passing by are staring at me, leading a girl wearing a panda head, with puzzled looks. Some even chuckle and say, “What’s that?” Annoying, we’re not some spectacle.</p>
<p>For now, I headed to the lab where our belongings were. Peering inside after opening the door, fortunately, no one was there. Entering with Nanase, I locked the door behind us.</p>
<p>“Nanase, are you okay?”</p>
<p>I asked, but she didn’t answer. Holding the panda head with both hands, she just stood there rigidly. Drops of water fell from her long hair onto the lab’s floor.</p>
<p>When I tried to take off the head, Nanase shook her head in refusal.</p>
<p>“…No, don’t look. My makeup’s all gone.”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. What is she talking about now, this girl.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen your bare face many times.”</p>
<p>“…But, I don’t want you to see now. Because, I…I’m not cute.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t look…”</p>
<p>With a trembling voice, Nanase pleaded. Unfortunately, I can’t grant that request. Pushing aside her resisting hands, I forcefully lifted the panda head.</p>
<p>The completely soaked Nanase had all her makeup washed away. The fake eyelashes that rimmed her eyelids were gone somewhere. The glittery eyelids, the brightly colored cheeks, the rosy lips were nowhere to be seen. It’s the plain bare face I’ve gotten quite used to seeing.</p>
<p>Yet, I think the woman in front of me now is more attractive than any of the beauties who stood on that dazzling stage earlier.</p>
<p>“You’re cute.”</p>
<p>The words I uttered were not just consolations or anything of the sort. They were my genuine feelings.</p>
<p>Hearing my words, Nanase’s eyes snapped open. Her lips trembled as she murmured,</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie. Whether you’re wearing makeup or not, Nanase is Nanase.”</p>
<p>When I firmly stated that, Nanase looked down, covering her face with her hands. I feared I might have made her cry.</p>
<p>“…Sorry, are you crying by any chance?”</p>
<p>I gently pried open Nanase’s hands covering her face. A sigh of relief escaped me the moment I saw her face. Far from crying, Nanase was smiling.</p>
<p>“…See, you’re laughing.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>The day was already turning to dusk, and the setting sun from the west dyed our private lab an orange hue. The hustle and bustle of the cultural festival seemed far away now, and the faint sound of the Jazz Research Society playing “Moonlight Serenade” could be heard.</p>
<p>“No, it’s…I’m happy.”</p>
<p>Nanase said, softening her eyes.</p>
<p>The moment I saw her face, I finally realized. I’ve come to realize.</p>
<p>…The reason my long-cherished solitude is being threatened is because of her. Being with Nanase, I can’t stay as myself.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. Um, you know, I…”</p>
<p>Nanase stopped mid-sentence, tightly pursing her lips. What she was about to say, I couldn’t ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For nineteen years since I was born, romance was something distant for me.</p>
<p>There were boys I thought were a bit cool, but I never had much involvement to fall in love, nor was I particularly interested. Even if I had felt that way, someone as plain as me wouldn’t have been noticed anyway.</p>
<p>Even after entering university, watching the heroines in shoujo manga and TV dramas fall head over heels in love made me wonder why they couldn’t act more rationally.</p>
<p>But now, I can very well understand how they feel. Love makes person stupid. Right now, I’m at a loss in front of a mountain of fried chicken.</p>
<p>…No, isn’t this clearly too much? Is this for sumo or something?</p>
<p>Why did I bother making fried chicken, something tedious to prepare? Because it’s Sagara-kun’s favorite. Why did I get so carried away and make so much?</p>
<p>It’s because I like Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Thinking back to that day, my heart feels like it’s going to burst. The sight of Sagara-kun, leading me away while I was inside the panda mascot costume, sparkles in my memory.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun at that moment was like a hero out of a shoujo manga. Maybe my brain is overreact it by about thirty percent.</p>
<p>──You’re cute.</p>
<p>The moment he said that, I finally realized the love that had always been in my heart. Clumsy but kind, always pushing me forward, someone who sees me. From the start, it couldn’t have been anyone but Sagara-kun I’d fall in love with.</p>
<p>Unable to stay put, I crouched down and hugged my knees. Ever since realizing my feelings for Sagara-kun, something’s been off with me.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m constantly floating a few inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Just then, I heard the sound of a neighbor returning home and quickly stood up. I piled the fried chicken high on a plate and left the room. I quickly fixed my bangs before pressing the intercom.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun, who peeked out, looked surprised to see me.</p>
<p>“Why are you wearing makeup? Are you going somewhere?”</p>
<p>…No, I have no plans other than seeing Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>I didn’t remove my makeup even after returning home, waiting for Sagara-kun to come back. In fact, I even touched it up a bit.</p>
<p>I want Sagara-kun to think I’m a bit cute. Knowing he’s seen my real face, it might be futile effort.</p>
<p>I smiled to gloss it over and said, “Here, I made this,” presenting the fried chicken. Sagara-kun’s eyes widened, “Ah, that’s a lot.”</p>
<p>“Um, ah, I might have made too much… Can you finish it…?”</p>
<p>“…No, I can eat it though. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun said, accepting the fried chicken. As usual, I was about to enter his room when──I stopped dead in my tracks.</p>
<p>Lately, whenever I brought over something I made, we’d end up having dinner together. It would be natural to do the same today.</p>
<p>But, upon regaining my calm, I realized. Eating dinner alone in the room of the person I like, just the two of us, is an incredible situation. I probably wouldn’t taste the fried chicken at all.</p>
<p>“…Aren’t we eating together?”</p>
<p>“I, I…to, today, I’ll eat in my room! See you tomorrow!”</p>
<p>I said that and dashed back to my room at lightning speed. Once the door was closed, I buried my face in a cushion.</p>
<p>…Ah, I really like him! Even in his casual sweatpants, he’s too cool!</p>
<p>I let out a silent scream and rolled around on the floor alone. To anyone watching, I must look completely suspicious.</p>
<p>…Having the person you like living next door is amazing…</p>
<p>Just thinking about Sagara-kun being on the other side of the thin wall made me feel restless. I wonder if he’s eating the fried chicken now.</p>
<p>I thought about pressing my ear against the wall to listen, but decided against it for various reasons.</p>
<p>“Haruko. By the way, were you okay after the beauty pageant? Didn’t catch a cold or anything?”</p>
<p>A week after the cultural festival, during lunch break in the cafeteria of Building No. 3, Nami-chan suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m totally fine!”</p>
<p>After that mishap, the beauty pageant proceeded without me, and Kiyohara-san from the Literature Department won. The organizers apologized to me profusely, and as compensation, gave me some delicious Kyoto famous sweets, Ajari Mochi, which I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I wasn’t bothered at all, but Sacchan was furious on my behalf. Even now, her anger hasn’t subsided, and she puffs up her cheeks saying,</p>
<p>“Still, that was terrible. Making a girl all wet on stage, unimaginable. By the way, what was Sagara doing? He suddenly took Haruko away.”</p>
<p>“Ah, he’s kinda famous now. The ‘Panda Man’ from the beauty pageant.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the existence of the “Panda Man who took away the girl drenched in water from the beauty pageant” is somewhat well-known within the campus.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun hates standing out more than anything, so he seemed utterly fed up with being whispered about behind his back. I feel somewhat guilty for causing him trouble.</p>
<p>“Ah, that was…because I was in trouble on stage, he came to help. Sagara-kun, he’s always…watching over me…and helps me.”</p>
<p>Remembering it, I find myself drifting into a daze again. Ah, he really was so cool… Watching me daydream, Sacchan asked.</p>
<p>“Haruko…do you actually like Sagara?”</p>
<p>Caught off guard, my cheeks instantly heat up. There’s no way to hide it; my face must be beet red. It’s probably going to be difficult to keep this secret from everyone. I resigned myself and nodded.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. I, like, him.” (tln : honest heroine :o)</p>
<p>Answering in a fluster, the three of them suddenly screamed,</p>
<p>“Haruko, you’re so cute~!”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun doesn’t deserve you!”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s okay, he might look a bit plain, but if you squint, he’s got that salt-face handsome look!”</p>
<p>“Hey, guys, keep it down!”</p>
<p>I hastily looked around. Why are these sparkling girls so loud?</p>
<p>“Ke, keep it a secret… I still don’t have the courage to confess…”</p>
<p>“That’s no good, you can’t be the one to confess! Let him say it!”</p>
<p>“Besides, Sagara will probably confess to you sooner or later, right?”</p>
<p>“No, no way!”</p>
<p>At Sacchan’s words, my body temperature rose even more. My frantic behavior made Sacchan smirk and continue.</p>
<p>“Sagara definitely likes Haruko too, I think. He’s only kind to Haruko, after all.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ehehe…really?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but grin. Being told that made me feel a bit hopeful. It might just be encouragement, but it still made me happy.</p>
<p>Sacchan said earnestly, “Haruko, even if you get a boyfriend, you have to hang out with us,”</p>
<p>to which I replied, blushing,</p>
<p>“You’re getting ahead of yourself!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since the cultural festival, Nanase’s behavior has been odd.</p>
<p>When I see her at university, she often skips. When I call out to her, she smiles happily. She’s been making elaborate dishes for dinner, and the amount she brings me has increased.</p>
<p>Even when she’s just in her room, she’s been putting on makeup more often. She stares intently but looks away when I look back. It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>…No. To tell the truth, it’s not like I have no idea why.</p>
<p>“Ah, we found Sagara!”</p>
<p>As I was eating lunch alone in the lab, Houjo and Kinami came in. Without asking, they sat down next to me, who was chewing on fried chicken.</p>
<p>“It’s super cold outside today. The cafeteria was super crowded, so we thought, ‘Why not just come to the lab?'”</p>
<p>Kinami chatted away. Since the cultural festival, they’ve become oddly friendly, constantly striking up conversations. They must naturally be the type to close the distance with others.</p>
<p>“Sagara, you’re eating a bento.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, that fried chicken looks super delicious.”</p>
<p>I had leftover fried chicken from Nanase last night, so I stuffed it into a bento box with some rice. Saving on one meal’s worth of lunch money is appreciated.</p>
<p>“Give me a piece.”</p>
<p>When Kinami reached for the fried chicken, I silently knocked his hand away. This fried chicken was made by Nanase. I’m not giving even a single piece to him. He called me a “Stingy!” but i let him say whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Houjo and Kinami began to eat their convenience store bento. Why am I, of all people, eating lunch with the two most socially active guys in our seminar? I decided to eat up and escape quickly.</p>
<p>Ignoring my intentions, Houjo cheerfully started a conversation.</p>
<p>“By the way, Sagara. That Panda Man incident at the cultural festival has become quite the famous, huh?”</p>
<p>I stopped my chopsticks in their tracks. Please, let’s not talk about that.</p>
<p>Just remembering that day makes me want to dig a hole and jump into it. I’m aware that I’ve been pointed at as “Panda Man” around campus since then.</p>
<p>“Right. I was with Sagara back then, and when he suddenly started running, I was so surprised. Nanase seemed a bit off at that time too.”</p>
<p>“Nanase doesn’t seem to like standing out. She must have been really shocked.”</p>
<p>At their words, I just nodded. I’m the only one who needs to understand why she couldn’t raise her face.</p>
<p>After finishing my lunch, I stowed away the empty bento box in my shoulder bag. Just as I was about to stand up, Kinami leaned in and said, “But you know.”</p>
<p>“Nanase’s been looking even cuter lately, right? Right, Sagara?”</p>
<p>“…Not really.”</p>
<p>…I missed my chance to escape. Interested in the continuation, I stayed put.</p>
<p>“Yusuke, you’ve got a girlfriend, right? Stop saying stuff like that about other girls, or you’ll get in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Well, my girlfriend is the cutest to me, but still. Nanase’s face is totally my type. It’s just for admiring, so it’s fine, right?”</p>
<p>As I listened to Kinami, I wondered what his reaction would be if he saw Nanase’s bare face. He’d probably have an incredibly rude reaction, so I don’t want to show him.</p>
<p>“Has Nanase really changed that much? I can’t tell the difference.”</p>
<p>Houjo, tilting his head, was met with Kinami’s enthusiastic argument.</p>
<p>“No way, she’s definitely gotten cuter! Her eyes sparkle, and she’s always smiling.”</p>
<p>“Well, I kinda feel that too. But maybe that’s because Yusuke’s been hanging out with Sagara? Isn’t that it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kinami and I exclaimed at the same time. Houjo continued in a calm tone.</p>
<p>“Nanase has always been the cutest when she’s with Sagara. Maybe because Yusuke’s been hanging out with Sagara, Nanase seems cuter as a result?”</p>
<p>Wait, I don’t remember hanging out with Kinami. No, more importantly, “Nanase is the cutest when she’s with me”—</p>
<p>“…What does that mean?”</p>
<p>Kinami asked. That’s what I want to know.</p>
<p>I replied, “I don’t know,” and took a gulp of barley tea from my bottle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…Eh, a seminar trip?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, during spring break! It’s in February, so it’s a bit away. Haruko’s going too, right?”</p>
<p>On Friday, after the seminar ended and during lunch break, Sacchan brought it up while we were eating lunch in an empty classroom.</p>
<p>It seems there’s a plan for our seminar group to go on a trip during spring break. It’s an incredibly attractive invitation for someone like me, aiming for a rosy university life… but it’s quite troubling.</p>
<p>…Going on a trip means I’d have to expose my bare face to my friends.</p>
<p>“I, I’m not sure about going on a trip…”</p>
<p>While munching on her yakisoba bread, Sacchan asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Really? Don’t you want to go?”</p>
<p>“No, no! I do want to go, but…”</p>
<p>I can’t say I can’t go because I don’t want to show my bare face. As I hesitated, Sacchan smiled at me.</p>
<p>“I’m in charge of planning it with Hiroki. Think about where you want to go. Oh, a hot spring would be nice! I want to eat crab.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… That sounds good.”</p>
<p>I truly want to go on a trip with everyone. I want to enter a hot spring without worry, exposing my bare face, and talk all night.</p>
<p>But still—if I show them my plain face and they get disappointed, what should I do?</p>
<p>As I thought about it, Sacchan grinned, leaned close to my ear, and whispered.</p>
<p>“…You should invite Sagara to the seminar trip. Your first overnight stay together.”</p>
<p>“…! My, my first overnight stay…!”</p>
<p>Going on a trip with Sagara-kun. Being together all day. That would surely, undoubtedly, be wonderful. It’s definitely going to be fun.</p>
<p>“But…maybe Sagara-kun won’t want to come on a seminar trip…”</p>
<p>“No way, if Haruko invites him, he’ll come. Show him a different kind of charm after coming out of the bath, and win him over in one fell swoop!”</p>
<p>Sacchan raised her fist as she said that, but I’ve probably shown him my post-bath jersey-clad bare-faced look a few times. There’s no charm in it. Living next door, it might be difficult to surprise him with an overnight stay.</p>
<p>As I worried, Sacchan took my hands and gripped them tightly.</p>
<p>“Really, do your best. Honestly, it’s a pain to give Haruko to Sagara… but if there’s anything I can do, just say the word!”</p>
<p>I felt like crying at Sacchan’s encouraging words.</p>
<p>Sacchan is fully supporting my love. I never imagined I’d have such a friend before entering university.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, Sacchan would accept the real me, my bare face.</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I brushed off the thought. Sacchan must have been the center of her class since high school, surrounded by many friends. If Sacchan and I had been in the same class in high school, we probably wouldn’t have interacted much.</p>
<p>──Nanase-san is serious, unlike us.</p>
<p>Sacchan and I are from different worlds.</p>
<p>“…? Haruko, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Sacchan asked worriedly as I looked down sadly. I forced a smile and said, “It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After returning home from university, I eagerly made carbonara pasta and brought it to Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>When he came out of his room, he accepted it with an apologetic “Thank you.” I made it because I wanted him to be happy, so I wished he wouldn’t look so apologetic.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun placed the plate of pasta in the kitchen and looked at me, still standing at the entrance, with a somewhat troubled expression.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, today he didn’t ask if I was going to “eat together.” Even though I was the one who declined last time, I wonder if he’s not inviting me this time. It felt too lonely to just go back to my room, so I asked Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>“…Sa, Sagara-kun… um, did you hear about the seminar trip?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing.”</p>
<p>“Everyone in the seminar is talking about going on a trip during spring break.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>As usual, he seemed to have no interest at all. Just as I was thinking he probably didn’t plan to go, he asked me instead.</p>
<p>“Nanase, aren’t you participating?”</p>
<p>“…I… want to go, but I’m worried…”</p>
<p>“Why? If you want to go, you should just go.”</p>
<p>“…But if we go on a trip, I’ll have to show my true face, won’t I?”</p>
<p>When I said that, Sagara-kun responded with a lackluster “Hah.” He furrowed his brows in confusion and tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?”</p>
<p>“It’s a huge problem! If they see my bare face… Sacchan and the others might end up hating me.”</p>
<p>“…You’re still worried about that?”</p>
<p>His voice sounded exasperated, which made me a bit angry. Even if it doesn’t seem like a big deal to Sagara-kun, it’s a very important matter to me.</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m worried. Because…”</p>
<p>“Sudo isn’t the type to hate you over something like that. Probably.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun said nonchalantly, and I clenched the hem of my jersey tightly.</p>
<p>“…How can you say that? You don’t know. If I stayed the way I was in high school, plain and unremarkable… Sacchan definitely wouldn’t have chosen me.”</p>
<p>When I said that, Sagara-kun furrowed his brows in confusion.</p>
<p>“…You think you became friends with Sudo because you started wearing makeup and became beautiful?”</p>
<p>I silently nodded in response. Sagara-kun scratched his head vigorously, then slowly began to speak, choosing his words carefully.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of… wrong, I think… It feels disrespectful to Sudo.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>“Why did you become friends with Sudo? Because she’s beautiful and bright, so you thought you could become like her by being with her?”</p>
<p>As soon as Sagara-kun pointed that out, my cheeks flushed hot. It felt like he had seen through a sneaky and ugly part of me I wasn’t even aware of—making me feel ashamed and wanting to flee from the spot.</p>
<p>“…Maybe that’s true…”</p>
<p>“Do you still think so now?”</p>
<p>I vigorously shook my head in response to Sagara-kun’s question.</p>
<p>Certainly, at first, I was proud that Sacchan talked to me, thinking it was proof that my efforts were recognized—but now, it’s different.</p>
<p>“…I enjoy being with Sacchan… I like her, that’s why I want to be friends.”</p>
<p>As I said that, Sagara-kun, though looking a bit perplexed, patted my head gently. His usual stern face, but his touch was gentle. Warmth spread from where he touched, and my body temperature seemed to rise.</p>
<p>“Then, you should trust Sudo… Not just Sudo, but… no one around you would leave you just because they saw your real face.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah. Everyone’s kind, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“The reason there are good people around you is that you’re a good person yourself.”</p>
<p>I wanted to say Sagara-kun is kind too, but my lips trembled, and I couldn’t say it well. Being near Sagara-kun, my heart races, and it’s hard to breathe from the tightness in my chest. Yet, I don’t want to be apart.</p>
<p>…I really like Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>Swallowing those feelings about to burst out, all I could manage to say was “Thank you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, getting out of bed was so tough that I accidentally overslept for about twenty minutes, leaving me barely made it in time for my lecture.</p>
<p>When I entered the large lecture hall, the front seats, unusually, were taken. Looking around for an available seat, I spotted Nanase sitting in the middle. Next to her, Sudo was chatting and laughing about something.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Nanase, who noticed me, waved with a full smile. Ignoring her felt rude, but waving back felt embarrassing, so I silently headed towards her.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, good morning!”</p>
<p>“…Morning.”</p>
<p>“Sagara, you wanna sit here? Next to Haruko. I’ll go to the back.”</p>
<p>“W-what!?, bu-but, Sacchan…!”</p>
<p>“…Nah, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>I declined Sudo’s offer and sat down behind Nanase. Her chestnut-colored long hair was intricately braided at the back of her head. I still couldn’t quite figure out how it was done.</p>
<p>As the lecture ended and I was about to stand up, two female students approached us. I thought their faces looked familiar, then it hit me.</p>
<p>…The beauty pageant when Nanase got drenched with water. The two girls who were whispering backstage.</p>
<p>“What are they doing here,” I thought with inward hostility.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t even glance at me but instead spoke to Nanase.</p>
<p>“Hey, Nanase-san.”</p>
<p>One of the girls showed her smartphone screen to Nanase. On the screen was a uniformed female student I recognized. Realizing who it was.</p>
<p>“A friend from my part-time job showed me their yearbook, and isn’t this you, Nanase-san? I was so surprised.”</p>
<p>A snickering laugh, tinged with mockery, escaped the girl’s lips.</p>
<p>The black-haired girl in the photo, wearing her uniform neatly and her hair braided in three, looked plain with her glasses. Below the photo was the name “Haruko Nanase.”</p>
<p>“…This is Haruko?”</p>
<p>Sudo, looking at the smartphone screen, narrowed her eyes in doubt.</p>
<p>I stood up briskly, thinking of how to cover for her—but nothing came to mind. Nanase’s face had gone pale, drained of all blood.</p>
<p>“A friend told me that you used to study alone during breaks in high school. So that’s why you’re smart, Nanase-san.”</p>
<p>“And your makeup skills are too good, aren’t they? Like a completely different person. Nanase-san, you always put so much effort into your makeup.”</p>
<p>“You were a library committee member, right? Definitely gives off that ‘library committee member’ vibe. You seem so serious.”</p>
<p>Their words, spoken brightly, were laced with unmistakable malice. Nanase remained silent, biting her lower lip.</p>
<p>They must be jealous of Nanase. Beautiful, smart, and on good terms with someone like Houjo.</p>
<p>They finally found something they could use to feel superior and seized the opportunity to attack her.</p>
<p>Sudo, frowning, was about to say something like, “Hey, enough is enough…” But I spoke first.</p>
<p>“…What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>The two girls finally noticed me, looking startled. Nanase, lifting her face, stared at me in surprise.</p>
<p>“Do you two have any right to dig up Nanase’s past? So what if she was plain before?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s with you all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“The fact that Nanase is beautiful and shining now is the result of her effort. Plus, even without makeup, Nanase is way cuter than you guys. There’s absolutely no reason for her to be mocked.”</p>
<p>Nanase had always said she wanted to live a rosy university life. She always gave her all, never slacking off in anything. I had always been there to see her efforts up close.</p>
<p>“…Just so you know. I’m aware of what you two did during the beauty pageant.”</p>
<p>It was half a bluff since I had no concrete proof, but when they looked at each other with guilty expressions, my suspicion turned into certainty.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it embarrassing for university students to do such things?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Do you have any proof that we did it?”</p>
<p>The girls retorted, unapologetically. They shrugged their shoulders, glaring at us unpleasantly. I was about to say something more when she spoke up.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Thank you for getting angry for me, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase said in an unusually calm and quiet voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moment I saw the plain, unremarkable face of mine displayed on the smartphone, I felt as though the ground under my feet had vanished.</p>
<p>The laughter of those girls, looking at me and snickering, overlapped with the voices of my high school classmates.</p>
<p>No matter how much I changed, I couldn’t escape being the plain, unremarkable me. It felt like a harsh truth was being thrust in my face.</p>
<p>I couldn’t bear to look at Sacchan next to me. Pretending to be someone I’m not, deceiving those around me—it was karma retribution. Though I understood that, I never wanted it to be revealed in this way.</p>
<p>The words that saved me, on the verge of tears, were Sagara-kun’s.</p>
<p>“The reason Nanase is beautiful and sparkling now is all because of her efforts. Besides, even without makeup, Nanase is cuter than you guys by leagues. There’s absolutely no reason for her to be ridiculed.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun’s words made me feel like crying for a different reason.</p>
<p>He always acknowledges me. In his awkward way, he tells me it’s okay to be myself. A warmth kindled deep in my chest, making my body temperature rise.</p>
<p><strong>──Ah, please don’t make me fall for you any more than I already have.</strong></p>
<p>I took a deep breath and straightened my back. Facing those girls, who looked at me with malice in their eyes, I stated clearly,</p>
<p>“It’s true, I was plain during my high school days. But just like Sagara-kun said… there’s absolutely no reason for you to ridicule me. I’ve always worked hard… and became cute through my efforts.”</p>
<p>My words seemed to make the two of them falter. Sagara-kun glared at them.</p>
<p>“…It’s not worth engaging with them anymore, but… don’t do anything weird to Nanase ever again. If you pull any more unnecessary stunts, I won’t stay silent next time.”</p>
<p>The girls muttered “What’s that” and “Let’s go” to each other and fled the scene like they were running away.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun, left behind, was scratching his cheek, looking a bit embarrassed. Maybe he thinks he said something out of character. Nonetheless, I was happy.</p>
<p>Sacchan, who had watched the whole ordeal, nudged Sagara-kun with her elbow, saying,</p>
<p>“Well done, Sagara.”</p>
<p>“You said everything I wanted to say. But it was refreshing. I see you in a new light.”</p>
<p>Sacchan said this with a bright smile. Sagara-kun, having lost his earlier momentum, became flustered, mumbling, “No, I didn’t really…”</p>
<p>Now that my bare face had been revealed to Sacchan, I faced her directly and deeply bowed my head.</p>
<p>“Um, Sacchan… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by my sudden apology, Sacchan responded with a puzzled “Why?”</p>
<p>“I… I deceived you.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“In high school, I was very plain and didn’t stand out at all… I didn’t have a single friend. The me you called cute was a fake.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…I might not be… the kind of person Sacchan would want to be friends with, after all.”</p>
<p>At my words, Sacchan seemed to look sad and angry at the same time. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but I stopped her with a hand and continued.</p>
<p>“But… I still want to be friends with Sacchan. Even though the real me is plain, unfashionable, and not cute… but, can we still be friends?”</p>
<p>After listening to me, Sacchan let out a deep sigh. Anxiety fluttered in my chest, wondering if she now disliked me.</p>
<p>Sacchan reached out and flicked my forehead lightly.</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>“Haruko, were you really thinking that? You’re such an idiot.”</p>
<p>“I-Idiot…?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t become friends with you just because you’re stylish and cute.”</p>
<p>Sacchan said this and then wrapped my cheeks with both hands.</p>
<p>“…Haruko. Remember at the university entrance ceremony, when you were fixing the fallen signboard by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Uh… yeah.”</p>
<p>I vaguely remembered doing something like that. A welcome sign for new students at the university gate had been toppled over by a strong wind, causing a disaster, so I instinctively went to fix it. It felt like bad luck for the first thing new students to see at the entrance ceremony to be a fallen signboard.</p>
<p>“Everyone noticed but ignored it, yet only Haruko seriously fixed it. Even though it wasn’t your fault it fell. I thought, ‘She’s a good person,’ and wanted to be friends.”</p>
<p>“Sacchan…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that part of Haruko’s true character? I don’t think I was deceived by Haruko. Because Haruko is Haruko. Kind, cute, honest, and a good person. I like that kind of Haruko.”</p>
<p>Sacchan tilted her head, peering into my face. Her greyish eyes were moist, making me feel like crying too.</p>
<p>Holding back tears was all I could manage, managing a nod. I blinked several times, dispelling the heat behind my eyelids.</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure I can show my bare face and still be met with a smile. Because here are people who say I’m wonderful just the way I am.</p>
<p>Turning my head, I looked at Sagara-kun. He was watching me with a gentleness I had never seen before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A week had passed since the commotion of Nanase’s real face being revealed. The comfortable autumn had ended, and the biting cold of Kyoto’s winter was setting in.</p>
<p>Nanase still seemed to be getting along well with Sudo and the others. Rumors that the beauty of the economics department was a university debut circulated, but most people didn’t care. After all, it’s rare for university students to mock someone’s real face.</p>
<p>Nanase, perfectly made up, stood straight with her back erect, facing forward.</p>
<p>Recently, she’s been gradually expanding her circle of friends, chatting with various people. Her university life seems to be on the right track. It’s all the result of Nanase’s efforts. My assistance was never necessary from the beginning.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to the seminar trip! I wish spring break would come sooner.”</p>
<p>No Make-Up Nanase said this while scooping out a daikon radish from the pot of oden.</p>
<p>We hadn’t eaten dinner together for a while, but today Nanase brought over a pot of oden, saying, “Let’s eat together!” The recent chill had made the warmth of the oden deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>While I was munching on a piece of hanpen soaked in broth, Nanase asked me,</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun, won’t you come? To the seminar trip.”</p>

<p>Before I could reply with “I won’t go,” Nanase leaned forward, eagerly making her case.</p>
<p>“Um, you see! We’re going to a hot spring! There’s an inn run by Torii-kun’s relatives, and we can stay there really cheaply… I-I’ll be wearing a yukata! So, Sagara-kun, let’s go together…”</p>
<p>“…I don’t need to be there…”</p>
<p>“No, I want Sagara-kun to come too. I think it’ll be fun if we’re together…”</p>
<p>Nanase clenched her fists tightly on the table. I couldn’t say anything, just silently glaring at the konyaku on my plate.</p>
<p>I knew if I said I wouldn’t go, she would look sad. I didn’t want to see that.</p>
<p>“…I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>Putting off an answer was just an escape, I knew that.</p>
<p>Nanase smiled happily,</p>
<p>“It’d be nice if we could stay overnight together.”</p>
<p>I almost spat out the konnyaku. That way of phrasing might invite some misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s been really cold lately! It’s so hard to get out of bed in the morning. This apartment is really going to be cold in the dead of winter. Maybe I should buy a kotatsu.”</p>
<p>Nanase said this, rubbing her small hands together. Her eyes, smiling with an “Ehehe,” were more relaxed than usual.</p>
<p>“If I buy a kotatsu… Sagara-kun, come warm up with me.”</p>
<p>With her cheeks flushed, Nanase said this, and I silently looked away.</p>
<p>Imagining bare-faced Nanase, snuggly warm under a kotatsu. I thought it must be a cozy spot, but I couldn’t bring myself to nod honestly.</p>
<p>After finishing my night shift, I glanced at my smartphone’s display and grimaced heavily.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, there was one missed call. The caller ID read “Mother.” Followed by a single message, “It’s been a while. Will you come home for the end of the year?”</p>
<p>I turned off my smartphone and shoved it into my coat pocket. “Take Care” I called out and left the store through the back door.</p>
<p>The eastern sky was already beginning to lighten.</p>
<p>Suppressing a yawn, I walked towards my apartment. There were no people walking around early on a Sunday morning, and there were few cars on the road. I quite liked the scene after a night shift. It felt as though I was alone in the world.</p>
<p>As I approached my apartment, something caught my eye. A woman, draped in a blanket over her shoulders, was leaning on the fence, gazing absently at the dawn.</p>
<p>Wearing glasses with no makeup, her long hair casually tied up, dressed in a tracksuit, she had somehow entered my world unnoticed.</p>
<p>──Ah, this is troublesome. What’s troublesome is that I don’t find it bothersome at all.</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, Nanase noticed me and her expression brightened instantly.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” she said, squinting her eyes behind her glasses.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing at this time?”</p>
<p>“I woke up a bit early.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous to be out here alone.”</p>
<p>“It’s already bright, so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. Well, I’m going to sleep. Go back to your room soon.”</p>
<p>As I tried to pass by, my hoodie sleeve was caught. Nanase’s face seemed red, perhaps because of the sunrise. Her bare face, not covered in makeup, looked younger than usual.</p>
<p>Nanase opened her pale lips and whispered,</p>
<p>“…That’s a lie. The truth is, I was waiting for Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>…She was waiting for me in the cold since morning. At that moment, the suspicion in me turned into conviction, leaving no room for doubt. Pretending not to notice was no longer an option.</p>
<p>“You know, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase looked at me with a resolved expression. Please, don’t say anything more. Despite my thoughts, I couldn’t interrupt her words.</p>
<p>“I like you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>…Finally, she said it.</p>
<p>Chewing over her words, a warmth gradually spread through my chest.</p>
<p>“I really do… I want to be with you forever…”</p>
<p>Clutching her fists in front of her, Nanase repeated those words. Her small hands trembled slightly, and her eyes were a mix of hope and anxiety. How much courage did it take for her to say those words?</p>
<p>All I could do was imagine, as cowardly as I am.</p>
<p>Slowly opening my mouth to respond to her confession ── what echoed in my head was my mother’s voice.</p>
<p>──If only Souhei wasn’t there—</p>
<p>The warmth in my chest cooled instantly.</p>
<p>Ah, that’s right. Although I had almost forgotten, I was supposed to aim for a comfortable and lonely university life from the beginning. I can’t get involved in her rose-colored university life.</p>
<p>“…That’s a problem.”</p>
<p>I said, as if squeezing the voice out of my throat. Nanase’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Nanase. …I can’t accept your feelings.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s face had lost its color and turned as white as paper.</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>The moment Nanase nodded, a tear streamed down her cheek. It dropped to the ground as it traveled down her chin.</p>
<p>It was the first time I saw Nanase cry. I never wanted to see her cry, yet I was the one who made her cry.</p>
<p>Nanase flipped her blanket and disappeared into her room. The door closed with a bang. I crouched down right there.</p>
<p>In the bitterly cold air, only the chirping of sparrows echoed in the distance.</p>
<p>Once again, there was no one in my world but me.</p>
<p>Though I had supposedly longed for a world all to myself, for some reason, it didn’t feel comfortable at all.</p>
