<h1>Chapter 4: Determination</h1>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>──Ah, frustating, utterly frustating.</p>



<p>My chest felt as though it might burst with anger.</p>



<p>I, Nanase Yuzuki, stood drenched in the rain.</p>



<p>Even after Kureha had left the rooftop, I lingered there, almost as if trying to cleanse away the ceaseless cascade of tears, standing in a daze.</p>



<p>Frustration, humiliation, mortification.</p>



<p>To instigate a one-on-one confrontation and then suffer a complete defeat, wallowing in tears, was beyond pitiful.</p>



<p>“Cough, snff, ugh, cough…”</p>



<p>I clung to the hope that perhaps letting it all out would offer some solace. Yet no matter how many times I sobbed, the rapid thud of my heart persisted.</p>



<p><em>──Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>I couldn’t retort a single thing against my kouhai. Her unwavering love, her beauty, as she loved the person she cared for wholeheartedly, left me thoroughly defeated. The me who had feigned superiority, the one who had intruded into someone else’s love story, now felt insignificantly small.</p>



<p>Kureha was right.</p>



<p><em>“──What do you want to do with us?”</em></p>



<p>Who did I think I was?</p>



<p><em>“If you’re trying to take advantage of his kindness, then I won’t stay silent.”</em></p>



<p>Who was I to act all high and mighty when we weren’t even a couple?</p>



<p>No, perhaps that was nothing more than a flimsy excuse.</p>



<p>Could it be that I had unknowingly harbored fear? Fear of a girl who might alter our relationship, who could disrupt the calm stagnation where no one got hurt or hurt another.</p>



<p>If that’s the case────</p>



<p>Who was this pathetic girl?</p>



<p>Was I truly Nanase Yuzuki?</p>



<p>Wasn’t I supposed to be the girl who could narrow the emotional distance more skillfully than anyone else? Hadn’t there been more instances that felt like moments between lovers compared to those times when we were mere pretenders?</p>



<p>What was I content with my self-centered assumptions?</p>



<p>How could I ever hope to match Kureha’s resolute determination with such superficial sentiments?</p>



<p>Certainly, I… <em>we</em> believed.</p>



<p>Somewhere within our hearts, we deceived ourselves into believing that our love was uniquely special. We convinced ourselves that only we could carve a place in Chitose’s heart, just like that.</p>



<p>But in truth──</p>



<p>It was merely a matter of chance that we happened to be close to him, happened to be saved by him, and ended up falling in love. It wouldn’t be strange at all if it had been someone else, and it wouldn’t be odd if such a someone were to appear in the future.</p>



<p><em>“Now, I think there are five girls in his heart.”</em></p>



<p>Recalling my own naive thoughts almost felt like being strangled by shame.</p>



<p>Despite yearning for a gentle stagnation of the status quo, I was attempting to erect barriers against the girl who was striving to upend the disparity in the time everyone had spent, genuinely yearning for him.</p>



<p>How utterly ridiculous.</p>



<p>Kureha must have named her uncontrollable feelings—love—and raced ahead without hesitation.</p>



<p>And then there was me.</p>



<p>While I stared in astonishment as Yuuko confessed to Chitose, I must have prayed to the heavens for just a little more time.</p>



<p>Was I really planning to repeat the same thing again? Wasn’t this supposed to be a real love story? Didn’t I intend to bring down the moon?</p>



<p>──Ah, frustating, utterly frustating.</p>



<p>“DAMMIT!!!”</p>



<p>I was furious, utterly furious, at the girl named Nanase Yuzuki.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>I, Aomi Haru, began practicing with my teammates. As planned, Mai who had come, was going through the same routine for now.</p>



<p>Glancing at the clock, about thirty minutes had passed.</p>



<p>Honestly, what was Nana up to?</p>



<p>I had heard she might be running late, and it seemed she explained the situation to Misaki-chan too, but this kind of thing never happened before. She was more sensitive than anyone else about taking away others’ time and effort.</p>



<p>As I continued a light shooting drill, lost in these thoughts,</p>



<p>──<em>Clatter.</em></p>



<p>The door leading to the clubroom building swung open.</p>



<p>Standing by a nearby goal alongside Mai, I called out, “Hey, what are you…”</p>



<p>I had meant to give her a bit of a scolding for once, but my words caught in my throat.</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>For some reason, beyond the surprise of her wet hair, something else…</p>



<p>From my partner, standing there with a gentle sway and a gaze inclined downward, an intense force emanated, enough to send shivers racing down my spine. Though her expression lay hidden beneath her hair, there was something off.</p>



<p>Nervously, I spoke with a hesitant voice, “Nana, what happened?”</p>



<p>“Tōdō.” Ignoring my call, Nana spoke. “Will you play a one-on-one with me?”</p>



<p>“You showed up late and just expect us to—”</p>



<p>Mai extended her arm to stop me. Her lips curled upwards, and she answered in an amused tone. “I’m not really interested in your lackluster plays.”</p>



<p>I could swear I heard the sound of teeth clenching.</p>



<p>Slowly, Nana lifted her gaze. “Don’t worry, I won’t bore you.”</p>



<p>Using her pinky, she brushed a clinging strand of hair away and slowly opened her eyes, meeting Mai’s gaze.</p>



<p>In that very moment,</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>A surge of tingling swept through me, causing my shoulders to quiver involuntarily.</p>



<p><em>Terrifying.</em></p>



<p>That was my immediate reaction.</p>



<p>Nana’s eyes, as thin and elusive as an unsheathed Japanese sword, bore a smile so faint it could chill one to the bone and burn with a heat that threatened to scorch. It was as though a wavering, cerulean flame was erupting from her body.</p>



<p>This was a side of my partner I had never seen. I instinctively took half a step back, feeling almost overwhelmed.</p>



<p>What emotions were swirling in those eyes?</p>



<p>Joy, sorrow, elation, anticipation, anxiety, curiosity, fear, hesitation, determination.</p>



<p>Or perhaps, was it pure anger?</p>



<p>Mai seemed to sense the intense atmosphere as well. “Oh, you’ve got that absolutely nailed look, don’t you?”</p>



<p>Nana licked her lips alluringly. “It’s like an incurable case of love sickness.”</p>



<p>Mai’s eyes softened affectionately as she added, “Given your current state, I might even offer you a comforting embrace, Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Nana’s enraptured expression was nothing short of captivating. “Let me vent my frustration a bit.”</p>



<p>“Choose your opponents carefully, or karma will come back around.”</p>



<p>I turned to Misaki-chan, seeking her judgment.</p>



<p>Personally, I was intensely intrigued. Nana and Mai, going one-on-one. I wanted to know just how far my partner could persist.</p>



<p>After sizing up Nana for a moment, Misaki-chan opened her mouth, “Sure, go ahead. Let’s consider it a learning experience for all of us.”</p>



<p>A glint of anticipation danced in Misaki-chan’s eyes, and a soft chuckle graced her lips.</p>



<p>Mai, much like a child acquiring a new toy, suggested, “How about we go for twenty points with a three-pointer rule? If the offense loses the ball, switch to defense.”</p>



<p>During my initial one-on-one with Mai, we established a one-point advantage on every shot, irrespective of the spot on the court, to accommodate my lack of a three-pointer. She even let me possess the ball first.</p>



<p>But with Nana and Mai, the three-pointer was a given. This would render a regular shot worth two points, making for a simple equation of doubling to reach twenty points.</p>



<p>Even when Nana and I played, this rule was often applied. Regular baskets would require a tally of ten, though incorporating three-pointers could shorten the game even further.</p>



<p>“Not enough,” my partner said with a daring smile. “Twenty points would end too quickly. Let’s make it thirty,”</p>



<p>“Doesn’t really matter, but do you lack confidence in making a comeback with just twenty?” Mai responded, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes.</p>



<p>“It’s quite the opposite,” Nana retorted, brushing back her damp bangs. “With twenty, I’d secure victory with seven shots,”</p>



<p>With the air of someone unsheathing a sword, she declared it with a swift, fluid motion.</p>



<p>“If you were this impressive, you should’ve invited me sooner,” Mai’s cheek loosened, much like when she faced me.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I have high standards,” Nana remarked as she picked up a ball that had rolled nearby. “You get to go first.”</p>



<p>“Sure thing, I’m in,” Mai replied, and the two of them stood facing each other around the center line.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Tōdō.”</p>



<p>“You can apologize after losing, Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>They exchanged a fleeting smile, and Nana passed the ball. Mai received it, her eyes narrowing slightly. She lowered her stance, gathering strength in her knees.</p>



<p>The tension in the air grew taut.</p>



<p>Mai’s body moved slowly, as if measuring the perfect timing, and then the white letters on Ashi High’s black team t-shirt swayed.</p>



<p>──Swift as the wind, fierce as lightning.</p>



<p>A flash in the sky,</p>



<p>──<em>Snap.</em></p>



<p>Mai unleashed a drive like a black lightning bolt.</p>



<p>──<em>Swift.</em></p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate me.”</p>



<p><em>Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>By the time Mai realized,</p>



<p>“Is that all?”</p>



<p>The ball was already in Nana’s possession.</p>



<p>Our teammates erupted in cheers. Mai stared at her own hands, as if she couldn’t believe it.</p>



<p>“Wow.”</p>



<p>I swallowed a breath, trying to comprehend what just happened.</p>



<p>Nana’s move was nearly just a single step. Closer to theft than snatching, she seemed to have merely placed her hand where the ball was coming. A swift, minimal motion, barely using her arm, she grazed the ball effortlessly.</p>



<p>Did she anticipate the path from the very start and positioned herself accordingly?</p>



<p>It sounded simple when put into words, but her opponent was Tōdō Mai from Ashi High, after all.</p>



<p>Nana casually handed the ball over, as if implying that this level of play was a given within her capabilities.</p>



<p>Mai received it, her voice dripping with admiration. “Nice one, Yuzuki. You’re making me feel like switching to you.”</p>



<p>──!</p>



<p>For some reason, those brief words felt like a jab to my chest. Even though she was so obsessed with me until now, she switched so easily?</p>



<p>In an instant, the memory of my embarrassing display at Higashi Park flashed back into my mind. His innocent laughter as he played catch with Kureha… </p>



<p>Just like that, everyone…</p>



<p>Before I could wallow in self-pity,</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, there’s a man I have to shoot down,” My partner boldly declared that on the court.</p>



<p>What had transpired in this short span of time?</p>



<p>“That’s why,” Nana said with a confident smile. “As a starting point, I’ll deal with you two.”</p>



<p>Mai let out a whistle. “This nipping dog is going to bite back.”</p>



<p>After saying this, Mai passed the ball to Nana and then lowered her stance just before the three-point line.</p>



<p>“Ready?”</p>



<p><em>──Whoosh.</em></p>



<p>“I’m not Umi.”</p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>“”Huh…?””</p>



<p>As Mai’s and my voices overlapped, the ball quietly slipped through the net. In the moment it began, it was already over.</p>



<p>A brief silence lingered, followed by the eruption of cheers from our teammates.</p>



<p><em>You must be kidding</em>, my lips involuntarily curling into a wry smile.</p>



<p>I was still grappling with what I just witnessed.</p>



<p>Nana took a slight running from her starting position, around the center line, and effortlessly sunk a shot from far beyond the three-point line. It was no surprise that even Mai couldn’t respond, or anticipate it, for that matter.</p>



<p>It felt like one of those games we’d occasionally play during breaks, a gamble of sorts. No matter how well you were set up in the defense zone, dropping a goal from that distance was a real slap in the face for the opponent.</p>



<p>Nana usually only went for shots with high odds, so what had gotten into her?</p>



<p>Or perhaps…</p>



<p>Could she have taken the shot with absolute conviction?</p>



<p>“Like I said, it was a bit of frustration,” said Nana, retrieving the ball.</p>



<p>“And I did mention that, didn’t I? About the karma,” answered Mai, with even more amusement in her eyes.</p>



<p>Receiving the ball from Nana at the center line, Mai started a slow dribble.</p>



<p>──<em>Tan, tan, tan.</em></p>



<p>A soft rhythm that tricked my senses into feeling the temperature drop.</p>



<p>While Mai never really taken it lightly, she was often in it for the fun. I wouldn’t go as far as saying she underestimated Nana, but she might have misjudged Nana’s true capabilities.</p>



<p>What truly terrified me about Mai was when she acknowledged her opponent.</p>



<p>And then, with a graceful rhythm, black flames started erupting from her entire body.</p>



<p>──<em>Tan, tan, tan.</em></p>



<p>It’s coming.</p>



<p>──<em>Zoom.</em></p>



<p>Mai took a sharpened step forward. Nana wasted no time in getting into her defensive stance.</p>



<p>With steps in between, Mai executed an inside-out crossover, changing its trajectory with each step, creating ripples. Yet, Nana maintained her cool, calculating distance without shifting her center of gravity.</p>



<p>──<em>Snap.</em></p>



<p>Mai darted to the left,</p>



<p>──<em>Thunk.</em></p>



<p>Executing a leg-through dribble beneath her spread legs, Mai switched the ball to her right.</p>



<p>Observing Nana’s prompt reaction,</p>



<p>──<em>Thud.</em></p>



<p>Mai swung the ball around her body using a back change, quickly shifting it back to her left and launching into a drive.</p>



<p>Her movements were utterly captivating. How did she keep her balance with such graceful swaying from side to side without faltering?</p>



<p>Though Nana fell behind momentarily, she recovered quickly, pursuing Mai’s back. Mai’s position was near the three-point line, there was still a slim chance of catching up.</p>



<p>As Mai went into a layup motion, Nana leapt for a block. In that moment,</p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>Mai lofted the ball high with an underhand motion.</p>



<p>──<em>Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>The ball sailed effortlessly beyond Nana’s outstretched arm and nestled into the net.</p>



<p>A scoop shot, it was a technique typically used by smaller players like me to maneuver around larger defenders, yet Mai executed it with her height. Though we had practiced together often lately, witnessing this spectacle from the sidelines was enough to make me laugh at the absurdity.</p>



<p>Her title as the number one player in Hokuriku region wasn’t merely a vanity.</p>



<p>Mai’s lips curled into a satisfied smile as she retrieved the ball.</p>



<p>“Now, shall we dance?”</p>



<p>Nana stood firm, securing her hair with a hairband, as if she was accepting a direct confrontation.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I’ve got a prior engagement.”</p>



<p>No doubt Nana was wary of that earlier three-point shot. As soon as Mai passed her the ball, Nana moved in to close the distance without a moment’s hesitation.</p>



<p>Nana wasn’t the kind of player who focus on inside game. As a point guard, she cleverly utilized her teammates while seizing opportunities to shoot from the outside—a play style that pierced through the defense.</p>



<p>That’s why, when it was a 1-on-1 between someone like me, who leaned towards playing inside, and Nana, who excelled from the outside, the victories and defeats were usually neck and neck.</p>



<p>At the moment when I pondered how Nana would create openings against Mai who could do both…</p>



<p>“Wait… what?”</p>



<p>──Nana charged straight in with a drive.</p>



<p>She initiated an inside-out crossover, flicking the ball between the inside and outside with each step. She darted left, then switched the ball to her right with a leg through dribble, flowed into a back change to the left once more.</p>



<p>She left her opponent trailing and headed for the basket.</p>



<p>Nana entered her shooting motion. Mai leapt for a block.</p>



<p>──<em>Bounce.</em></p>



<p>──<em>Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>This… impossible.</p>



<p>Certainly, Mai must have realized the same thing. With an expression that seemed to shiver with anticipation, she opened her mouth;</p>



<p>“The Mirror Witch, huh.”</p>



<p>It was as if I was watching an instant replay, every detail matching with precision. This was the number one player we were talking about.</p>



<p>A soft chuckle escaped Nana’s lips, her eyes filled with a dreamy glint.</p>



<p>“Shall I ask who’s the strongest among us right now?”</p>



<p>──<em>Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Memories of my racing heart while watching Kureha and that guy’s catch ball resurfaced. I wanted to avert my gaze, but there was no escaping the truth.</p>



<p>Nana was overwhelming Mai.</p>



<p><em>Why?</em> I bit my lips.</p>



<p>I had always believed that it was my role to surpass Mai someday. It wasn’t that I underestimated Nana’s abilities, there was no falsehood in my conviction that she was my most reliable partner.</p>



<p>Yet, somewhere in my heart,</p>



<p>──At the very least, in basketball, I didn’t want to lose.</p>



<p>Hey, Nana, is this the real you?</p>



<p>Is this Nanase Yuzuki at her fullest?</p>



<p>I had irrevocably intertwined basketball and love within myself. </p>



<p>Stop it, wait for me, don’t go into that secluded place alone.</p>



<p>Everyone…</p>



<p>Please don’t leave me behind in my own world.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>The patter of raindrops, the scent of damp asphalt, the flow of air, the approaching azure sky from afar, the sweat trailing along my neck, the rhythm of my breath, the steadying beats of my heart, the watchful gazes of my teammates, Misaki-chan’s gentle smile, the unease in my partner’s eyes, Tōdō’s steps, gazes, balance, the distance to the ring, the sensation of the ball against my fingertips – all of these sensations flowed naturally to me, effortlessly perceived.</p>



<p>A world, uniquely my own, painted in tranquil shades of blue. Regardless of where or how I shot, it felt as though missing was beyond the realm of possibility.</p>



<p>There were moments when I purposely turned a blind eye, feigning ignorance.</p>



<p>──A locked room hidden within the depths of Nanase Yuzuki.</p>



<p>Since as long as I could remember, I had lived guarding against vulnerabilities that others might exploit. Efforts exerted where required, results attained as demanded, an unending cycle. Gradually and steadfastly, they bore fruit, shaping me into the person I was today.</p>



<p>Be it basketball, academics, appearance, fashion, or even love, I dedicated myself to each endeavor, making no concessions. Yet occasionally, I found myself grappling with this self I had crafted.</p>



<p>For instance, had I been unconsciously avoiding delving into a part of myself, concealing it away?</p>



<p>Nazuna’s words resurfaced in my mind, on the evening of our return from Kanazawa after watching Yuuko depart in her mother’s car.</p>



<p><em>“Is this truly the extent of your resolve?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Whether it’s in love or basketball, are you truly giving it your all, Nanase Yuzuki?”</em></p>



<p>Could this really be the sum of my capabilities? Was I truly giving everything I had?</p>



<p><em>“──I believe that the Nanase Yuzuki who’s shed her shackles is, in truth, more incredible than Tōdō Mai or Aomi.”</em></p>



<p>Could Nanase Yuzuki be more remarkable than Umi or even Tōdō?</p>



<p><em>“Love is no different, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“If you set your mind to it, you could probably shoot down the moon.”</em></p>



<p>As simple as those words sounded, there was a part of me that didn’t want to fully deny them.</p>



<p>──Deep within me lay a room still locked.</p>



<p>It was likely because I didn’t want to reveal any vulnerabilities, perhaps because I wasn’t ready to confront the depths of my own self. When even after giving everything, when my grasp fell short, when my hopes went unanswered, I was afraid that I might no longer be Nanase Yuzuki, afraid that I might crumble.</p>



<p>And so, like a secret weapon, I sealed it away, making it the foundation of my heart. I hadn’t truly given my all yet, I clung to such a simple and cheap excuse.</p>



<p>I once confessed this to Haru;</p>



<p><em>“Maybe I’m afraid of getting serious.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s obvious, but when you truly commit, you’ll eventually hit a limit, won’t you? Training might become so grueling that you throw up. You might give your all in a game and still be easily taken down. Someone might just snatch away dreams you worked so hard for, dreams that seemed unattainable. Maybe we don’t want to face that side of ourselves.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s probably easier to draw a line and say, ‘That’s just how things are.’ That way, our dedication won’t be denied to such an extent.”</em></p>



<p>Ah, I see, my heart must have been crying back then.</p>



<p>Confined within that locked room, I held my knees and shivered alone, desperately seeking rescue.</p>



<p>──The real Nanase Yuzuki was there, pleading for someone to come and save her.</p>



<p>I’m sorry, <em>me</em>.</p>



<p>Whether it was love or basketball, I had been distancing myself, observing from a detached perspective, avoiding defeat, evading pain.</p>



<p>He wouldn’t embrace a girl just like that. Shooting down the moon wasn’t something achievable by such limited efforts.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the words that Haru uttered back then flickered across my mind.</p>



<p><em>“But if you don’t get serious, you won’t even know your limits. You won’t know what lies beyond those limits, what you might be able to overcome.”</em></p>



<p>You were right, partner.</p>



<p>──And that’s why I’m going to face it.</p>



<p>My own determination.</p>



<p>It might end up being messy, embarrassing, and pathetic. I might even shed tears if my efforts still fell short. But I would still unlock the door and go meet the real Nanase Yuzuki.</p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>Almost in silence, my three-pointer found its way through the net, shifting the score to twenty-seven to twenty-four.</p>



<p>Tōdō was no pushover, but she hadn’t managed to bridge the gap from my initial three-pointer. My body felt light, my field of vision expansive – it was almost as though I’d been reborn.</p>



<p>There were plays I believed I could execute, shots I thought might actually go in. Watching Umi, I had moments when I thought, if it were me, I could make that shot. Watching Tōdō, I had moments when I believed I could stop her.</p>



<p>I believed there were opponents I could genuinely defeat.</p>



<p>The version of myself that I had envisaged seamlessly merged with the person I was now. That’s right, isn’t it? For Nanase Yuzuki, achieving something like this was only natural.</p>



<p>Without uttering a single word, I passed the ball to Tōdō.</p>



<p>Thank you, for being here today. If I had been up against Haru, I probably wouldn’t have been able to break out of my shell. I would have ended up drawing lines again, proclaiming the inside to be Haru’s territory, holding back because basketball was her battleground – it would have been a cycle of repeating the same patterns.</p>



<p>So having you in front of me was a good thing. At least, if I could face you head-on, I could have faith in my own determination.</p>



<p>Tōdō wore an expression I had never seen, even in official matches. It was as if she was stating that she would never relinquish this place, wouldn’t concede superiority to anyone, especially not someone like me who appeared out of nowhere.</p>



<p>I understood. I had been nothing more than a halfhearted pretender, never truly dedicating myself to anything. It was only natural for her to think this way, especially when compared to Umi. I’m sure my partner must be wondering as well.</p>



<p>But, sorry, that’s just how Nanase Yuzuki was.</p>



<p>From Tōdō’s clenched teeth, the intensity in her gaze, and the pride that declared she wouldn’t lose, even if this was just a game…</p>



<p>──<em>Zoom.</em></p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>I could anticipate the next step, the move she was about to make.</p>



<p>I spun the stolen ball around on my fingertips before passing it to Tōdō. Standing at the centerline, I took a slow, deep breath.</p>



<p>──I’m just deeply in love.</p>



<p>It just so happened that basketball was my first introduction. It was mere chance that I fell in love with it.</p>



<p>You didn’t know, did you? Well, if that’s the case, allow me to demonstrate how I could turn it into destiny.</p>



<p>…Although, I’m not quite settled with the fact that it was that cheeky brat who made me realize it.</p>



<p>Receiving the pass from Tōdō,</p>



<p>──<em>Thud.</em></p>



<p>I took my first step forward.</p>



<p>Through the rain, through the dusk, through the present moment, through myself, I ran.</p>



<p>──Ah, frustating, utterly frustating.</p>



<p><em>“Someday, until the day you give this feeling a name.”</em></p>



<p>But when would that “someday” arrive? If you couldn’t name it, then I would engrave it.</p>



<p><em>“──I hope this imitation lasts forever.”</em></p>



<p>I didn’t need imitations; I wanted the real thing.</p>



<p><em>“I won’t lose to a woman who can’t even commit herself wholeheartedly, Nana-san.”</em></p>



<p>If she was challenging me using my court name, then it was a serious showdown, right?</p>



<p>The shot I released from far behind the three-point line created a beautiful arc. Like the emotions named on that day, like the yearning for that distant moon on that day.</p>



<p>With absolute certainty that it would go in, I turned my back.</p>



<p>──Ah, frustating, utterly frustating.</p>



<p>Hey, Haru, Tōdō, Kureha.</p>



<p>And you too, Saku.</p>



<p>──<em>Whoosh.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to show you, the intensity of the love that the woman named Nanase Yuzuki feels.</p>
