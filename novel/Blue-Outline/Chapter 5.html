 <h2>Chapter 5: The Terrifying Cave I and the Princess Must Traverse</h2>

<p class="calibre5">I had a dream. I understood immediately that it was a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I don’t know this place, I have never been here before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I convinced myself that these fully bloomed red flowers of death around me were fake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I knew it was a dream, I was frightened and shivered at the red spider lilies and the red sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN:Red spider lily refers to a type of flower known as “彼岸花” (higanbana))</p>

<p class="calibre5">The flowers blooming in intense red, like sparks, were incredibly scary.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I ran.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m running at full speed while screaming.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I moved my heavy feet desperately, not knowing left from right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely, no one will come to help. Because this is my dream…</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I thought I absolutely wouldn’t meet anyone in this world of death. But I was wrong. It was a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;A woman was standing on the hill. A beautiful black-haired woman.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I run desperately to the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Relieved and overjoyed that I was not alone in this cruel world, I reached below the woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know this person, and this person knows me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But this person is a little different from the one I know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The girl I know had white hair, not black; she also couldn’t stand and wore glasses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She smiled at me with an expression that I didn’t recognize.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t understand why she could smile in such a place. Anyway, I thought we had to escape from this place together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I tried to grab her hand, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was like she was a ghost. Perhaps she was an illusion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tried to grab it again, but her hand slipped through mine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was very sad and scared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt that if I could grab this hand, I could change the miserable outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, this world did not permit it. The world did not indulge us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing me so desperate, she gently shook her head and smiled again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And, she left the words ‘goodbye’&mdash;&mdash;and disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was in despair, disappointed in my powerless self.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The red spider lily petals scatter in the red sky. The world is stained even redder.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was lost, and all I could do was crumble on the spot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Then I woke up with a jump.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sweat is pouring down my face, and it is incredibly hard to breathe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wiped the sweat with the sleeve of my jersey and grabbed my smartphone to check the time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a scary dream and at the same time, a very sad dream.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I had a bad premonition. I felt something unpleasant was about to start.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I found out there were two missed call notifications on my smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both were calls from Takashi Harukawa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I was about to call him back, my smartphone rang.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Again, it was a call from Takashi Harukawa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I answered the phone from him. And shortly asked him ‘What happened?’ and I played dumb.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I knew what’s going on. What business he had, why he called me… Still, cowardly, I was trying to make him say it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, we both kept our mouths shut.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, he broke the long silence,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Natsumi Onē-chan has…passed away…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words that broke the silence were so cruel.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">A person with a good smile has died.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The beloved Himegi Natsumi has left this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now I was at school, because I decided to attend the classes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I made a mess in my room this morning morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I overturned and destroyed everything in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know where to direct my aimless anger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know who to appeal this absurdity to.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite knowing it was disgraceful, I could only lash out at objects.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My parents didn’t reprimand my behavior. They just hugged me in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking at the messy room made my heart feel even more emptier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I ran away to school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the first time, I sought salvation in this place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Kanako wasn’t at school. Takashi Harukawa was also absent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, Touka Himegi was not present either.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The homeroom teacher, while looking down, spoke of the tragedy of the Himegi family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone here was silently listening to the teacher’s words. Then, classes started as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, as if nothing had happened…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Naturally, I couldn’t absorb the content of the lessons at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I guess there was no salvation in this place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">That night, it rained.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The raindrops fell as if even the sky was crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My parents and I visited the funeral hall to attend Himegi Natsumi’s wake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Many people attended. Many people shed tears for her death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the staff sorrowfully looked at the picture on the altar, saying, “It was just the beginning of her life…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone lamented her premature death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We could only grieve over the harsh reality.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi’s mother was continuously breaking down in tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi’s father was bowing his head to the mourners coming one after another, greeting them as the chief mourner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka Himegi was in a state of shock, continuously looking at her sister’s portrait.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi Harune was also trying to act bravely, but her hands were constantly trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was painful. It wasn’t a sight one could easily look at.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If what Touka-san said is true…the future Hakuba Ouji overcame this hardship….</p>
<p class="calibre5">Do I really have the strength to alleviate this family’s pain?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know. I don’t know anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I realized that I’m not a special human being.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, I found out. How painful powerlessness is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her portrait had beautiful black hair. Black hair I didn’t know… Why did she wear a white wig?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The one to ask is no longer in this world. This is death&mdash;&mdash;This is an eternal farewell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I understood, but it seemed I couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking back about my memories with Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was an impactful person from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had a good smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was weird and kind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Messaging on smartphones was fun. The stories of the Himegi family she told were truly enjoyable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If possible, I wanted to meet her when she was healthy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If possible, I wanted to share more time with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bid farewell to her sleeping in the coffin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking about it, Natsumi-san was always thinking about others.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Until the very end, she prioritized her family over herself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think she was a person with wonderful character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone would praise her existence. …But, I wished she prioritized what she wanted to do in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted Natsumi-san to see a sunflower field in full bloom with her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That alone was regrettable beyond measure.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, ‘Thank you’ was the only word that came out of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the time the wake ended, the rain had stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And, we, the family, left the funeral hall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With our backs turned to the Himegi family, whose smiles had vanished… My body wasn’t tired, but my heart was exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a strange feeling for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I slept in my messy room, I fell into a deep sleep like a log.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, the next day&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I woke up, I put all my heart and soul into my hands and struck my own cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then&mdash;a loud ‘smack’ resonated through this small house.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Ouch!!…&mdash;Ah, it hurts!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But, I’m awake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, my head is clear. Only the foolish part should have flown away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The worrying stops here, the overthinking stops here, and the complaints stop here!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I won’t be downhearted anymore, I won’t utter any more words of weakness, and I won’t run away anymore!</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yesterday, I was defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right I was defeated by fear, and because of fear, I wasn’t myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I acutely felt my own powerlessness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I understood that I’m not a special human being.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;So what! What about it! To hell with all that!</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s with the ‘thank you.’ &mdash;&mdash;That’s wrong! It’s completely wrong!</p>
<p class="calibre5">What did I promise to the two of them!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What did I inherit, and what did I decide to bear!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The words that should be conveyed to Natsumi-san are not such flimsy words as ‘thank you.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The words that should be conveyed to Natsumi-san are “Don’t worry.” and “Leave the rest to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, I will convey that to Natsumi-san. I have to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Otherwise, I can’t face her. I must reassure her and see her off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is the compensation and responsibility I, who know a bit of the future, must bear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I won’t fear anything anymore&mdash;and I will fulfill my duty.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having decided so, I, once more, yelled and struck myself again with all my might.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;A loud ‘smack’ echoed again in this small house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely my cheeks are swollen red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s fine. Thanks to that, I’m completely awake.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“O-ohhh…… You are so fired up this morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My father was standing in front of the door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Crossing his arms as he intently watched me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“.. I’ve finally understood what I should do.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? You’re looking good right now… You’ve grown up a bit…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My father smiled broadly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also smiled broadly in return.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I will say goodbye to the two of them.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My parents have some unavoidable business to attend to, so I’ll be the only one at the funeral and the farewell ceremony today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I can leave it to you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Get dressed, and then&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;The ringtone of my smartphone sounded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems someone is calling my smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“.. Kanako?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shorty Kanako” was displayed on the smartphone screen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tapped the screen of the smartphone and answered the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What happe&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『&mdash;It, it, it’s terrible! It’s so terrible!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even over the phone, it was clear how flustered Kanako was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could faintly hear Harune-chan’s crying voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems like the people from the Himegi family are nearby.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s so terrible?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Himegi-san has shut herself in her room&mdash;&mdash;She won’t come out!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I was not surprised when I heard those words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….Kanako, I want you to tell the Himegi family people.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『What should I tell?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“.. I’ll handle it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『W-wait! What do you mean by ‘handle,’? What are you planning to do! You can’t be seriou&mdash;&mdash;』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I ended the call.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, operating the smartphone, I tapped the photo app.</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the smartphone screen was a woman in a wedding dress and a woman in hospital garments.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The two, in contrasting attire, were smiling happily.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I made a promise. I made a promise that I mustn’t break with two people who are no longer in this world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Dad, I have a favor to ask.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I won’t allow such an ending.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">In front of Himegi-san’s room, a crowd had formed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone was not in their usual attire but was clad in mourning clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan was crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The child who was always smiling like an angel no matter how painful things were, was shedding tears…</p>
<p class="calibre5">You idiot… don’t make your sister cry…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amidst all this, the man who is the master of this house was banging on the door violently, trying to persuade her daughter who presumably was inside.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Impatience could be seen on Himegi’s father’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He probably never thought that his daughter would barricade herself in.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, he stopped banging on the door and slumped in that spot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t like this man.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t like him, but I genuinely respect he, who, even after losing his precious daughter, still serves as the chief mourner with a resolute attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He showed me the strength of a man trying to fulfill his responsibilities as an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a man slumped, his spirit broken, weeping manly tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If things continue this way, everyone present here will be absent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I won’t be able to face Natsumi-san if that happens.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I approached the flustered Kanako and gently placed my hand on Kanako’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Everyone, please go to the funeral home first. I will definitely bring her there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone present turned towards me all at once.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you going to do? It’s locked.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll figure something out.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, I approached the man slumped in front of the door,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can I handle this…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi’s father stood up and glared at me as if he had encountered his parent’s nemesis.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I returned his gaze without averting my eyes from him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Himegi’s father bowed his head,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry. Please take care of my daughter…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The man bowed deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He bowed his head to me, even though he didn’t want to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Next, I knelt in front of the crying Harune-chan,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s going to be alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I spoke with all the reassurance I could muster and lightly patted Harune-chan’s head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please….Please bring Touka-nee…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I promise.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, everyone present headed towards the memorial service, believing that I would bring her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, shall I begin…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took a hairpin from my pocket and stuck it into the door lock.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, it’s open!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In just a few seconds, I managed to unlock the door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe I should become a phantom thief rather than a magician…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, now is not the time to be self-congratulatory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Opening the door, I entered Himegi-san’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Upon entering, she, in her mourning clothes, was sitting quietly on the bed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly Himegi-san glared at me and threw a stuffed toy at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course I deftly avoid the thrown stuffed animal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That came out of nowhere.…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san’s room was messy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably, like me, she must have gone on a rampage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I deflected her sharp gaze and, without asking for permission, sat next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sat at a distance where our shoulders could bump.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she moved a fist’s length away from me…I was hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Annoyed, I closed the gap.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, this time she moved two fists away…I was even more hurt….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m not going. I absolutely won’t go! I don’t want to see Nee-san turned to bones!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to see that either. I don’t want the sight of that beautiful person turning into bones etched into my eyes. Nevertheless, we have an obligation to witness it. It’s not acceptable to abandon that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh… I understand. I understand very well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, then…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;I’ll also stay here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">How could I persuade this stubborn girl?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had simulated various things, and I used my lacking brain to its full extent to figure it out to reach this point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Forcing her to go against my principles, doing such a thing would surely leave resentment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I thought to try and persuade her through straightforward means, but I quickly realized that was impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, this girl is an extremely selfish and whimsical princess.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Half-hearted persuasion won’t make her nod, and once she decides on something, she is a stubborn woman who won’t budge.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I understand that thoroughly after living together for this one month.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This was the answer that came out, and i t was the only means by which the current me could persuade her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is a gamble. It’s a game of life and death.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If this doesn’t work, then…no, let’s not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I was confident.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I showed this determination, she would surely surrender to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I think I understand her well enough.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely she won’t abandon me, and she won’t make me bear the sin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though she’s a selfish Princess, the person I’ve come to like isn’t such a heartless girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I-I’m not going, but y-you should go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She said with a trembling voice. She’s clearly agitated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, this method was the correct one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, if you’re not going, I’m also not going.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said decisively, looking into her swollen eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can guarantee you, if you spend the day like this, you will absolutely regret it later. Even by that time, time can’t be turned back. It will be too late to regret.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….N-no…that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s why, I’ll join foolish act with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Why…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s better to have an accomplice than bear the sin alone. This way, the sin is lessened. After all, I’m shouldering half of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…it’s not like that will halve it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indeed. It’s not about halving the sin; it’s doubling it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From here on, she will have to bear the foolish sin for both of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Given her nature, she would sincerely regret that I also didn’t attend the funeral.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She will keep cursing not only herself but also the fact that I didn’t go.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She understood this instantly. She probably imagined her life after this moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, this isn’t persuasion&mdash;it’s a kind of threat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a way, it might be worse than forcibly taking her along.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I transferred the right to decide life and death to her; there’s nothing more cowardly than this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nevertheless, I thought it was much better than tying her up with ropes and taking her along.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ideally, I wanted her to come out by her own will…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s a little late, but let’s go get some breakfast. I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday morning, I’m so hungry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stood up from the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, there is no time to eat breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the time we spend on such things, Natsumi-san would probably be cremated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I really didn’t want to waste even a second. But, I hid such impatience and invited her to eat in my usual tone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Coward! It’s not fair! And what’s with ‘I’m so hungry’? It’s not funny at all! It’s super creepy!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She also got up from the bed, and she looked at me straight in the eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, it was unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had calculated that she would break here and come to the funeral.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, she was far more stubborn than I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t even think that she would play the “reverse anger” card.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll accept that fight, and I’ll fight her head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll crush such a desperate card she played!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha… Magicians are all cowards and always playing unfairly!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Magician? Don’t talk like you’re a pro when you’re not! That’s why you’re not popular! That’s why I rejected you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh! You really have a bad personality.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re the same! You, Pitiful Prince (Ouji)!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If I’m a Pitiful Prince, you’re also a Pitiful Princess (Hime)!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Stupid Prince! Idiot Prince! Dumb Prince! Disappointing Prince!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Selfish Princess! Stubborn Princess! Gloomy Princess! Clumsy Princess!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Useless Prince! Otaku Prince! Shorty Prince! Perverted Prince!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Cowardly Princess! Ugly-Natured Princess! Bitchy Prin&mdash;&mdash;Ouch, w-wait, stop!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the end of the harsh words, the Ugly-Natured Princess kicked my right shin with all her might.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It really hurts! She…she kicked my leg without hesitation!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Due to the pain, I hopped around on the spot.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000014.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Who are you calling ugly-natured! And, I… I’m not a bitch!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m against violence!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, since she was the first to get physical, I’ll consider this verbal fight my victory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fine, I’ll go! Just shut up if I go!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I wish you would have said that from the start.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, such a troublesome woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The man who becomes her husband will surely have a hard time…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You really talk too much, Pitiful Prince.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..haha….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…ahaha…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ” Ahahahaha…” “</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, we pointed at each other and laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She and I had our first fight. For the first time, we said what we wanted to say to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She and I faced each other for the first time. For the first time, we understood each other’s hearts a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So next, we have to look in the same direction.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right, not facing each other, but looking in the same direction we should go.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…don’t worry, I will always be by your side.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With how we are now, we should definitely be able to share our fears too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…that’s a promise. I won’t forgive you if you break it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I tightly grabbed her hand, and she also tightly grabbed my hand back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, let’s go. You can have a wedding anytime, but a funeral is only once.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, we ran with all our might to the garden.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And when we arrived at the garden,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Eh? Weren’t you making a taxi wait or something???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san was surprised to see what I came in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s no way I have that kind of money. So, from my father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;You borrowed it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I was made to buy it. I was put into an Ouji loan, sixty payments of five thousand yen each…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think that as a father, it’s his duty to willingly lend a hand in his son’s pinch, and yet, to foist it on your son at such a high price…</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is why I hate poor merchants.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So, this is your motorcycle? I thought you have a complex about your own name?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Let me be clear, I didn’t choose this motorcycle to be funny. This was the only one available to use immediately under my father’s name…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Originally, it was not a motorcycle to sell at the store but a hobby motorcycle that my father had acquired to ride as a second bike.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, it’s fine. I like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san said so, gently touching the motorcycle’s tank.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s just like the Prince’s white horse (Hakuba’s Ouji) huh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: His name Hakuba Ouji means Prince on a White Horse, with Hakuba signifying white horse.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">The motorcycle I bought from my father was in an untarnished, pure white color.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s a motorcycle with a horse emblem on the tank.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, in a sense, this is also… Hakuba.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, a white iron horse…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But…can you drive?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san skeptically looked at me, doubting my driving skills.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine. It’s been a while since I last drove, but there are no issues.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san, believe it or not, I’m better at motorcycles than at sleight of hand. If you think it’s a lie, come to our house next time. There are trophies and medals displayed…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s a bit boastful, but I have an undefeated record in junior road races, and I’ve even been featured in magazines several times.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Heh, is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Huh? She didn’t react at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is she not interested in my past at all?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, nevermind…</p>
<p class="calibre5">More importantly, we have to head to the funeral parlor as quickly as possible now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I will drive safely, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, we headed to the funeral parlor on this white iron horse, and somehow, just in time, we were able to meet Natsumi-san before she was cremated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As promised, I stayed by her side the whole time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We cried.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing her sister turned to ashes, we broke down and cried hard on the spot. Finally, we said our eternal goodbyes to Natsumi Himegi.</p>


<p class="calibre5">I made a vow, and I promised her again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Natsumi-san, I’m sure that from now on, I will face difficulties many times, experience setbacks over and over, and feel despair again and again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Each time, I will probably curse my own powerlessness and lament my lack of strength.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even so, I’ve decided not to run away. I will never run away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Your thoughts…I will&mdash;no, everyone here will carry on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The people you love will inherit your thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, it won’t disappear, the only thing that won’t happen is disappearing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, don’t worry, I want you to rest in peace.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Goodbye, the person we loved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Goodbye, the person who loved us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Goodbye&mdash;&mdash;sister-in-law.</p>

<h2>Touka Himegi: Reminiscence 5</h2>

<p class="calibre5">During the final summer of university, Ha-kun and I traveled by motorcycle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Initially, we aimed for Tokyo, and there we climbed the Tokyo Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite my constant protests against it, this idiot forcibly made me go up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Who on Earth thought it was a good idea to make a glass floor?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was this very close to wetting myself!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why do I have to climb up six hundred steps and be terrified in the process?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, the soft-serve ice cream was… delicious, though…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, we continued north through Tohoku, ultimately arriving at a sunflower field in Hokkaido. The sunflower field was truly breathtaking; everywhere I looked was awash in yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was at a loss for words at the grandeur of the landscape.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s surprising to think such a place exists at the far end of Japan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Riding on the wind, the scent of the sunflowers stimulated my nostrils.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That smell somehow had the same fragrance as my nostalgic sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wondered if Nee-san ever wanted to see this view.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s incredible, everywhere you look… sunflowers.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah, I didn’t expect it to be this much.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was truly more beautiful than I had imagined…</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was the one who proposed the trip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know why he suddenly suggested it, but I was certainly happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt fortunate to share this wonderful view with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to come here again, just the two of us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You might not believe me, but Natsuki-san appeared in my dream.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And in it, she asked me to bring you here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, that’s why I brought you here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..I see. Thank you, Ha-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He had spoken to Natsumi-neesan in his dream.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It could have been just a dream, or maybe it was really a message from Nee-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, I was a little happy to hear about my sister from him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“T-Touka!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a serious expression, he stared intently at my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s come to see this sunflower field again next year, and the year after…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, let’s do that. Let’s come again next year and the year after.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was happy that he felt the same way as me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That he was thinking the same thing as me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, no… I didn’t mean in that way… well, in that way too but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahh, come on! You’re so dense today! Why are you playing dumb all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had no idea why he was mad at me, and I couldn’t understand why his face was turning so red.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In other words, what I’m trying to say is…um…what is it…um…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can you not mumble? What happened to you all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He was not like his usual self.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The him I knew, at least, was the type to speak his mind clearly. And now, he’s looking at me, blushing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is this the first time I’ve seen him like this since he confessed to me that time?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Touka, I want you to marry me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He said, with a seemingly anxious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His words reached my ears clearly, carried by the gentle wind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been asked out nearly a hundred times, but this is the first time I’ve been proposed to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, this is the first proposal I’ve ever received in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah! Did he… just propose to me…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I want to hear your answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“?! …d-did I…get rejected?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, no, no! This sorry is an ‘I’m sorry for not realizing it was a proposal’. Um…yeah, let’s get married.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There was quite a pause there, why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because it was so sudden…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After seeing Kanako and Takashi get married and be so affectionate with each other, I too started to think about marriage more seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I am to marry, it has to be Ha-kun; anyone else is absolutely out of the question, and I don’t even want to think about Ha-kun marrying another girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The same goes for having children. I would want to have as many babies as possible if they were Ha-kun’s and mine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had been waiting, feeling anxious about him proposing someday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I thought that was something for the distant future.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because I am still twenty-one… I am still a fourth-year university student…</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels too early, but I understand that missing this opportunity would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">People don’t know when they will die.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister’s passing gave birth to such a value in me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, the world is not sweet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The world does not guarantee tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I shouldn’t postpone what I want.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what I learned from my sister’s death.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I-I see, I’m glad. I have been thoroughly rejected by you before, so I was a bit worried…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… I’m sorry about that time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine. It’s a thing of the past now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I thought it would be something for a distant future, but let’s get married!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Touka, I will definitely make you happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. I will make you happy too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, we gently exchange kisses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We have kissed countless times, but today might be the happiest one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I love you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I love you too, more than anyone in the world.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When was the last time I felt this excited…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“More importantly, Ha-kun, if you are proposing, you should have ‘that’, right? ‘that’ thing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I extend my left hand to him, eagerly anticipating him sliding the ring on.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ‘that’? What’s ‘that’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I mean, ‘that’! You know, that ‘that’?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wiggle my left ring finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Gosh, why does he always make me anxious like this?</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then he freezes on the spot, making a face as if he’s feeling awkward and sorry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, ah… Do I need… a ring when I propose?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Blinking his eyes, he asked with a straight face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Of course, isn’t it obvious?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, there are proposals nowadays that don’t involve giving a ring, but frankly, that’s heretical.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the very least, you have prepared a bright red rose, right???</p>
<p class="calibre5">Come on, produce a ring or a rose with your magic like always…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see, that’s how it is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, where is the ring?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I, I forgot. I’m truly very sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He droops his shoulders, hanging his head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also droop my shoulders and hang my head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ahhh~~. Even though this is a once-in-a-lifetime event…</p>
<p class="calibre5">… Really, this man will always remain a Pitiful Prince no matter how old he gets.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the person I love is not the cool and composed Prince.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right, the Prince I love is this slightly pitiful one who is good at magic tricks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I will prepare it properly, so please wait a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay. I’ll wait patiently.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was an unconvincing proposal, but I think I will never forget this day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, even when I become a grandmother, I want to visit this sunflower field again with this person…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was savoring happiness while thinking about such things.</p>
