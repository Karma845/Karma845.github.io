 <h3>Epilogue &#8211; If You Could Say It In Words, There Would Be No Reason To Paint.</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Even though you didn’t get the prize, personally, I really like how this painting turned out. It’s like you have shed something, retaining your style yet somehow daring. There will be a nationwide contest again at the end of August, let’s challenge.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Originally, the art preparation room forbade food and drinks. However, Hiiragi-sensei had made it clear that this was his lair. He nonchalantly passed me a cup of coffee, while downing his own.</span>/p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“May I ask you something.” He set the cup down. “Is this a painting you drew because Kashiwazaki joined the competition?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes, it is. Just as I had told you, I couldn’t draw at all during the time before that. The one who put me back on track was Yuri, and you said my art has changed&ndash; has grown… I think that’s her handiwork too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Because she participated, I regained the frenzy I needed. Jealousy and admiration, because I could express all the feelings in my chest onto the canvas, I could move one step closer to my dream.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To sum it up, it was all thanks to her who stayed as my goal, as my rival, from the day we met until now. There was no better way to say it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Hiiragi-sensei just stared at me with an unreadable expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Is there anything?” I couldn’t stand the stare any longer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Nothing… Geniuses are difficult to handle. Even if you shelter and take good care of them, they could take it as a pressure. I have seen too many lost their way because of it.” His voice was unusually bitter. “And even more crushed by the publicity and media of the star-hungry industry. Looking like this, the talent you pine for, is it really worth it?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">His philosophical ramblings too, were the same as Yuri’s gaze, things belonged to the “Geniuses”. Or he was just warning me of the future ahead of us as a veteran who wanted to see younger generations suffer no longer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">He was probably concerned about his students future and gave proper advice. He even took my point of view into consideration and sympathized with my feelings. Hiiragi-sensei was a good teacher.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri is different. I think you’re underestimating that girl.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But despite his concerns, I just couldn’t think so. Yuri wasn’t the type to be easily swallowed by the rough waves he spoke of. She would probably be enjoying herself as she surfed through them.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Your absolute confidence in her would weigh her the most…” he mumbled, “Nah, enough with worrying. Your existence will certainly support Kashiwazaki, just… just don’t crush her yourself.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wonder if he would see me as another ignorant kid. But despite that, I believed that the day would come when the world would roar the name of the genius Kashiwazaki Yuri.&nbsp;</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Out the preparation room and down the hallway. In habit, I veered to the second year classroom and spun back. I was already a third year student, I reminded myself as I righted my course. And with the word “third year”, I was reminded of Sugawara-senpai.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Late March, the night before she left for Tokyo, she had called me to a nearby cafe. Remembering the favor I owed and the troubles I had caused, I hastily grabbed some overpriced, high-end sweets from the station.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Everyone gave her at least a glance as she made her way to our seat. A beauty, truly unfitting for Maimori. After she finished stirring the sugar in her coffee, she began.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“The initial objective I had set, ‘Getting Yuri to draw’ was a success. With this, I think I no longer have any unfinished business here.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes. I had already known that she would win a prize the moment she gave her word that she would participate. Although I set my sights on getting a better prize, guess that didn’t really come out well. But the honorable mentions and above will be exhibited at Kouji Art Museum in Tokyo from September 1 to 13. Please let my painting say my thanks again at that time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I owed her more than I could thank her, and I caused her more trouble than I could ever apologize for. That was why I ran my mouth about getting one of the prizes as an act of gratitude, that was before I knew the results.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her eyes locked on mine. Had I been improvident because I thought I knew how she thinks? Looking at her perfectly chiseled face and seeing myself in her big eyes, I wondered. What had I done to be in such a position?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Then,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I like you. No matter what, I won’t give up on you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The conversation flipped a perfect 180 degrees. My head went blank.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When she told me over the phone that she liked me, I had clearly turned her down. Besides, after I weaseled my way to paint Yuri instead, I didn’t think she would still hold such affection towards me. There was no other reaction than to be flustered or dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I still knew what I should say.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Um… See, I’m sorry, but I can’t. I still…” I desperately searched for the next word.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yup, I’m good with that for now. But from now, I’m definitely going to make you look at me.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She removed the bracelet she always wore from her left wrist and placed it on my hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Senpai… This is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was as if her sky blue eyes were drawing me in. Utilizing her long lashes, she blinked gracefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She straightened and proclaimed. “I think you wouldn’t prefer a girl who put love before her dreams, so I have to go…” Lonesome yet determined, she continued on, “I’ll make you fall for me. Wait for me when I polished my charms, and make sure you’re ready for it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Someone with as much charm as her polishing it even more? Would I even survive that? That was going to be a big test for my love for Utako and my self control.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Uh, um… Please be gentle with me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The processing of my brain had reached its limits and I had already said a reply so embarrassing I wanted to roll around on the ground with my head in my hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To cover up the reply that would be one of the pages in my dark history, I hastily offered her the sweets I brought.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Um, Senpai. I want to repay you, but I’m not sure what I should do. At least, please have these sweets. If there’s anything I can do to be of assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ahaha. Just as I thought. Your sense of duty never ceases to amaze me. Well~”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Was it because it was unexpected? Or was it because of her charms?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I could follow her motion with my eyes, yet petrified, unable to move as she pecked me on the cheek.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“So you did it, Senpai…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I can’t believe I did something so classic like this…damn. Aah!” She squirmed sheepishly. “But… Yup…I’m happy I did that!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even though she was the one who had done such a bold action, she was smiling bashfully. The gap between her demeanor was too cute. No, I turned my eyes away.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“By the way, I’m saving my lips for when you decide to do it, ‘kay?” This is an overkill…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But she peeked at me, her plump lips forced their way into my view. This time around, I can’t resist blushing. As if she enjoyed looking at my face, she flashed me a grin brighter than in any magazine cover she was in.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A short time after the results for the Kouji Exhibit was posted, a call from Senpai came.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Tell Yuri congratulations on winning the grand prize. And then, when Yuri comes to Tokyo, you’ll come too, right? Tell me as soon as you can decide a schedule.” Was what she said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wanted to grow into a man who could be calm enough when she teases. And so I started fostering a new goal.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My life as the most senior student around, however, wasn’t going smoothly. And the reason for that being, in Maiei High, students stay in the same class even when moving up, or in short, I was stuck with Kashiwazaki Yuri until graduation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And when I entered the classroom, the usual racket between Yuri and Seino greeted me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Aah! stop that talk! Stop that before it’s too late, people will get irritated, trust me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Can’t I? He’s my first boyfriend! Let me enjoy myself!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm… No, no one would mind, no one cares about you anyway. By the way, your boyfriend isn’t even famous or anything, what’s the point of bragging?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Really, would you just shut up?! Talking with you spoils the mood!”</span><span class="calibre6"></span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A sigh escaped me as I listened to their conversation. I approached her seat, the seat on the last row by the window, and gave her a chop on the head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You’re noisy since morning. What happened?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Here, look at this. I can’t hold it in&ndash;” She bursted into laughter.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her phone showed Seino’s SNS account, the latest post being two cups and some gushy hashtags.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Seino…I don’t usually take Yuri’s side, but…” I thought Seino would know better…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Komiya’s cruel too! But… I don’t care what Yuri says, but if you say so, then maybe I’ll consider changing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her shoulder slumped as she returned her concentration to operating her phone. From their posture, I couldn’t feel the slightest vibe of someone preparing for entrance exams. I smiled wryly at myself as I tried to imagine what would happen in one year’s time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had started studying for entrance exams and also started attending an art prep school in Sapporo. Still, I was drinking in my last days of highschool in my own way, being silly with friends and painting like a fool.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And about Yuri…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri, come to club activities today. Nah&ndash;… I thought you would finally take painting a little more seriously…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;After the Kouji Exhibit, her days without painting resumed.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Me? Painting seriously? What is that? Which parallel universe are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Just a while ago you were painting Utako for the Kouji Exhibit! Eh? What’s wrong with what I said? Did I reincarnate in another world?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I had never associated telling lame jokes with you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You were the one who started talking about parallel universes!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If I were to tell some stranger that this silly girl was a genius pianist, no one would have believed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Both Hiiragi-sensei and Utako are waiting for your new painting, you know? And I’m participating in the next countrywide competition this August, you too, Yuri.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But she just rejected me flatly. “Nahh, the one before was because of you two. I don’t have such motivation now. I don’t feel the fire of passion burning inside me. Go find some heart pounding goal, if not then I won’t, that’s it.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My dream is to surpass the genius in front of me. I knew that it seemed impossible, but I wouldn’t have this burning drive if it was anyone else. That made her lack of goal irritating to me.&nbsp; But still, was a goal something that could be defined by others? Was that something I had the right to say?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As I was mulling it over fervently, something knocked my forehead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ouch?!” I cringed back, hands pressing where I had been knocked. Seeing my reaction, Yuri smiled triumphantly. I realized that she had flicked me in the forehead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Don’t get too happy, Sousuke. You’re a hundred light years away from getting hold of me. Listen, all you have to do is look at me,” she commanded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She had said that line once before. But this time, there was no clamor from the classmates. They probably knew that this was not a romantic confession, but her domineering possessiveness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Sugawara-senpai had been suspicious about Yuri’s feelings towards me, but there was no way that was the case.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Besides, she said she was motivated when painting for me and Utako.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The day when we could fulfill our wish as promised might not be too far away now. I mean, we cared about each other this much.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My head jerked her way in response. She gave me her usual devil’s smile.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Don’t look at just those boring visible stars. There are so many more invisible to us, Utako said that, didn’t she?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Unable to grasp the meaning of her words, Seino and I tilted our heads in unison.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Before entering the art club room, my phone buzzed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">[Yuu-chan’s painting was really exhibited at the Kouji Art Museum! You’ll come to Tokyo this Fall, right? Can we meet?&nbsp; If you have the time… I want to see you again.]</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even a short message like this, she must have blush bright red while sending this. After an unintentional chuckle, I tightened my expression&nbsp; and tied my apron.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I slid the phone back into my pocket, the reply was for later. Today too, I, an untalented, ordinary Joe, couldn’t beat the genius.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I am aware of this fact, so I couldn’t neglect daily efforts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">To fulfill the promise the three of us made on that day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">For my own dream.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Today, too, diligently, carefully, and passionately, I wielded my paintbrush.</span></p>
