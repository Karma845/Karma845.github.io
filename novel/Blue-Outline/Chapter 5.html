 <h2>Chapter 5: The Real Thing</h2>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, are you working on a homework assignment again today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… Chifuji-san, that’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san gently smiles, as if it’s nothing at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve got a bit of a stye, so my eye is swollen.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, is it painful…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, not at all. I’m fine. I apologize for serving you looking like this… Would you like your usual iced coffee for your order?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Understood, please wait a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Eyepatch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The white object covering one of his eyes as he walked away was clearly imprinted in my mind as I sat in the café.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Senpai, you’re not allowed to serve until that heals! You might drop something if you use one eye!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I understand. …Sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, please make me a cup of coffee later.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I could hear such a conversation, but my worry outweighed any jealousy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A stye…Really?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had already been harboring doubts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The tears shed when he was being cared for, his constant saying of ‘I have to do things properly,’ and above all, the phrase ‘ it was good that I was born’ a sentiment one wouldn’t express unless they had thought otherwise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Additionally, based on what I heard from Kusakabe-san yesterday, there’s verification that his self-assessment is strangely low compared to the facts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Among those traits, he’s ‘often careless and prone to injury.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">In reality, I’ve seen what looked like bruises on his body when we were bouldering.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both in front of me and Kusakabe-san, and even at school, he’s not the careless type at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…As I start to harbor these doubts, there’s another matter that worries me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The time when he fell ill at the movie theater.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He said it was motion sickness from the seat vibrations&mdash;but could it be…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What should I do…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…but none of these are decisive proofs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If someone were to say I’m overthinking, they might be right.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for the wait; here’s your iced coffee. Please enjoy it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one who brought the coffee is a girl who’s friendly with Chifuji-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…The likelihood that she knows something… is perhaps slim?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t deny that my own wish for them not to be too close may be influencing that thought.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Who I should really ask is, well…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I subtly shift my gaze towards the back of the store.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The one there is the manager&mdash;his uncle. He finally came out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At this late hour when the café is quiet, the manager appears at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I watch him from a concealed spot so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing that all the lights inside the café have been turned off, he’s clearly closing up and going home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Incidentally, something I’ve known since my stalking days is that Chifuji-san stays and works a bit after closing time but always leaves before the manager.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, he’s already gone for today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, I’ve been waiting for a moment when the manager would be alone&mdash;to ask him about Chifuji-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Are you there? Ah, I’ll head over there in a bit.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And that was the plan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The manager, who seems to have made a phone call, mentioned Chifuji-san’s name.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It appears he’s going to Chifuji-san’s house.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The decision I made here wasn’t particularly logical.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Instead of approaching the manager, I chose to return to my own house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">An intuition I gained from the manager’s expression, tone, and atmosphere made me do so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I arrived home quickly, grateful for my own stamina, and immediately dashed into my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mother hadn’t come home yet; she often returns late due to work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What I pulled out from the shelf was a wiretap receiver.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clutching it, I leave the house again, heading in the direction of Chifuji-san’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Riding my bike hastily, I sprint through the night streets at full speed… and arrive at a park near his house, where I had previously listened to the listening device.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, too, I activate the receiver here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I inserted the polished earphones into my ears, their voices, along with some noise, immediately reached me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Kei, …be honest. What happened to your eye?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…It’s just a stye, it’s swollen.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Then remove the eyepatch and show me.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s the manager and Chifuji-san. And yes, they are indeed talking about the eyepatch.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『You’re worrying too much, Uncle. It’s really nothing.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Kei!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…It’s nothing, really nothing.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san’s voice had an oddly breezy, controlled flatness to it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In contrast, the manager’s voice harbored an unconcealed tremor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Kei, I understand that you want to protect her. That’s just how you are, like my older brother, like your father. What I can’t stand is that woman taking advantage of it, constantly playing the victim!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Uncle…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Enough already! If she wants to find a guy who can ‘understand’ her, she’s free to do so! But acting like a child when things don’t go her way and throwing tantrums at her own son&mdash;that’s beyond saving!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…it’s because I haven’t been a good son or a good family member.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『What nonsense…! How many bruises have you gotten? How many bones have you had broken!? The crazy one is her, completely!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;I had expected as much.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…No, the injuries are…I did it to myself.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Kei! …Damn it, how many times have we had this conversation… Listen, if you admit it, she’ll get what she deserves, and you will no longer have to be involved with that woman.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…Uncle…Mom can’t handle the fact that Dad is gone. She’s always been like that. …And if Dad were here, he wouldn’t leave a crying mom alone.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『That’s her problem. My brother chose to be with a woman like that, and that’s his choice. But you are different. You have no obligation or responsibility to get hit by that woman.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, there’s no room for misunderstanding what I’m hearing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『If we’re talking about responsibility, …Mom feels it too. She feels responsible for me not having any talents, for me not being able to do anything properly… That’s why she’s always on edge.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Wrong! When people like her throw fits, they’re not really saying what they mean. They’re just irritated and looking for someone to take it out on, so they just find any excuse from whatever catches their eye.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">The store manager’s voice, striving to make his point, was filled with strong emotions and deep resignation, as if indicating that this issue had been repeating for many long years.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『She’s not angry for a reason, she’s angry because she’s in the mood. She comes back to this house because it’s a place where she can do what she wants!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『……..』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『You know the truth as well, don’t you, Kei? Stop indulging her selfishness, her victim mentality, and her princess fantasies!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Yet until the end,</p>
<p class="calibre5">No answer that the manager sought came from Chifuji-san’s lips through the listening device in my ear.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">With a quiet clattering sound, I push my bicycle along the nighttime road.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Stars twinkle beautifully in the night sky, yet their glow isn’t enough to clear the shadows on the road.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Darkness always finds its way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not sure whether it’s because I’m trying to sort things out in my head, or because I can’t decide what my heart is set on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A buzzing noise comes from the basket of my bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My smartphone lying there is vibrating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s an incoming call, with the word ‘Kanon’ on the screen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hello?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Hello, Onee-chan? Is the time okay? What are you doing?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just taking a little walk.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Really? It’s morning here, so it’s nighttime in Japan, right? Be careful.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, thanks. So, what’s up?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Well, actually…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon, who is studying sports in Canada with Shion, starts talking about how a boy at school confessed to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s been popular since we lived in Japan, and it seems her popularity continues even in a foreign country.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I’ve never had a boyfriend before, but I’ve heard that kind of experience can help with expressing emotions in skating… So I’m wondering, is it okay? But then again, it might be too frivolous to get a boyfriend while I’m studying abroad…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Since I’ve moved up from Novice to Junior in my skating class, it’s time to get serious. So I’m not sure how that fits in.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Both Kanon and Shion have extremely promising futures as athletes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They are constantly on the podium, and expectations from those around them are high.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Every time I worry about it, Shion starts taunting me, saying, ‘Someone looking like that won’t win the next competition!’ It’s not like I’m skating just to beat her!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, for Shion, her biggest rival is you, Kanon.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While Shion is very competitive, Kanon is an artist at heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I know, but I also want to skate in a way that satisfies me.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">For her, the ice is not a battlefield to compete with others, but a workshop to create her art.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『What should I do, Onee-chan?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I may not know much about figure skating like you or others do.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Therefore, I can’t give proper advice as an athlete.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I do know a lot about our family. Kanon, you look the happiest when you’re focused solely on yourself, rather than worrying about beating someone or meeting someone else’s expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…Is that so?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. So don’t worry about what others say. What you truly believe is the right thing for Raihara Kanon. That’s what will be right, and you have the strength to make it the best choice.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…I see.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s how it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know how much my words help, but Kanon says, ‘Thank you, Onee-chan.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">We chat about this and that for a while&mdash;things at home, things at school, delicious food we’ve had recently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Onee-chan, you don’t sound too cheerful, do you?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Kanon suddenly says that, I can’t help but react with surprise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『If you say you know a lot about me, then I know about you too. Your voice today sounds a bit different.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Yes. Did something happen? …Ah, I see. It’s about Chifuji-san, isn’t it?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m amazed, she’s sharp.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Eh, could it be that… it didn’t go well, or something?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon asks me cautiously, and I respond.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Not that it didn’t go well, more like… it’s stuck before even getting to that point.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Before that point?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m… hesitating, I guess.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I choose the words that seem to best fit my feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m hesitant to get too involved. Because… I’m not exactly a stable person.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Knowing his situation, there are things I want to do, things I want to go through with.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But should I be the one to do them?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Would my actions really be beneficial for Chifuji-san?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering the life he’s led, I can’t help but think so,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shouldn’t the person at his side be someone more stable?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In response to my words, Kanon speaks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『You say you’re not stable…I don’t really understand the situation…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I can’t go into details right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Eh, I see. Hmm. But, Onee-chan, you know how Mom and Dad have always been really busy with work, right?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">The topic changes abruptly, but I answer, ‘Yes, why?’</p>

<p class="calibre5">My mother is still the same way, and while my father is currently in Canada prioritizing my two younger sisters over his job, he was always busy up until then, just like my mother.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『That’s why you, Onee-chan, took care of all the housework&mdash;cooking, cleaning, laundry, everything. On top of that, you’ve always supported me and Shion. You drove us to our club activities, gave us massages when we got home, and listened to us whenever we had concerns.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘So, you know,’ Kanon says, pausing before she continues,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I’ve always felt guilty towards you, Onee-chan…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanon…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I mean, you’ve been working 24 hours, every day of the year, for the sake of the family. I felt guilty, and I was also worried that you might collapse someday. If that happened because of us…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…But Shion and Kanon are…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Now I understand, Onee-chan. There was a time when I didn’t. The turning point was when Shion and I went on our first intensive training camp. When we returned after three days of non-stop skating…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『You were totally drained, Onee-chan. From our perspective, it was like, ‘Why are you like this?’ We thought you’d be refreshed since you don’t need to take care of us anymore.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I remember that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not being able to care for them, I felt increasingly drained with each passing day.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Every time we went to a camp and saw you like that, Shion and I realized, ‘So that’s how Onee-chan is…’』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…From around that time, both Shion and Kanon started calling me the ‘most eccentric’ one in the house…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Well, it’s just the way it is. So, I wonder if feeling sorry is pointless.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">That is exactly right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The truth is, I enjoy taking care of people.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While it was incredibly tough, not once did I find those days painful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『We know it best; your daily busy life was anything but normal, Onee-chan. That you lose your energy when you’re not enjoying yourself is something you can find in just anyone. So, well, it’s not wrong to say you’re ‘not stable.’』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon’s willingness to say things clearly is one of her strong points.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Kanon, besides what you mentioned, there are other ways in which I’m not stable. I only realized it myself recently.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Really?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… I wonder why it’s like this. Even though I was raised in a stable home, why am I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Wait, wait, wait, Onee-chan. Raised in a stable home?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh, yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『So that’s your perception… That’s amazing…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon tells me in response to my question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『It’s the opposite. It’s not ‘despite being raised in a stable home, you’re not stable.’ It’s ‘because you’re not stable, our family could be stable.’!』</p>


<p class="calibre5">***</p>
<p class="calibre5">TN: The term ‘not stable’ can also be interpreted as ‘not proper’, ‘not decent’ or ‘nor normal/abnormal’.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">『It’s the opposite. It’s not ‘despite being raised in a stable home, you’re not stable.’ It’s ‘because you’re not stable, our family could be stable.’!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t get it. Then my sister groans, ‘Hmm~…seriously…’</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Think about it, Mom and Dad are workaholics, right? They’re not working desperately because we’re short on money; they work because they want to, it’s because they love their jobs.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y- yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Then, Shion and I are also putting our lives into skating. Sure, now Dad has finally taken a break, but at least when we were in Japan, Dad, Mom, Shion, and I all had to pour our whole hearts into what we wanted to do. If it was just the four of us, do you think such a family could have survived?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon said quietly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『We wouldn’t have had the time to deal with daily life or the luxury to support anyone else; all four of us were like that. A family like that would have fallen apart, right? Something would have broken… but it didn’t. Why?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『It’s because there was someone different in the family. Someone who from grade school did housework and took care of us, and instead of being exhausted, seemed to be energized by it. Absolutely not a normal person.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Kanon.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『It’s thanks to Onee-chan that the Raihara family usually gets along so well and even has time to go out occasionally. Because Onee-chan is not ‘stable,’ we could be a stable family.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is that so…but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…but it’s not like I’m a good person. I’m just…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I didn’t say you were a good person. I’m not saying Onee-chan is a saint; not at all. You’re very kind, but that doesn’t mean you’re a righteous person. Your altruism is selfish in its own way.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『For better or worse, your love for taking care of people is based on desire. You do it simply because you want to.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I have no words to respond to my keen-eyed sister’s spot-on commentary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Like when you were overly enthusiastic as a manager in middle school and nearly destroyed the club, that was an example of your flaws.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s why I want to become normal…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『That’s impossible.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon cut me off bluntly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I’ve thought it was impossible since I heard you were practicing to become more reliant on others. Even if you learn to rely on people a little, you’ll just develop issues somewhere else.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m breathless at how unerringly accurate her insights continue to be.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In reality, that’s exactly what happened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After learning to rely just a little on that person and becoming drawn by his kindness, I eventually overstepped, uncovering things I wasn’t aware of and was blown away by the explosion of issues.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, I haven’t become ‘normal’ in any overarching sense.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Wanting to become a ‘normal’ person is impossible. Shion and I often say this, but Onee-chan, you’re essentially a monster.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….Huh, what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What did you say?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I mean, I was born to the same mother as you and Kanon, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Yeah, you just happened to be born from a human, that’s all.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanon, do you realize what you’re saying…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I don’t have to explain it, do I? You understand how Shion and I feel, right? We’ve always been worried that Onee-chan will collapse one day because you get more energetic the busier you are. No matter how selfish we are, you just keep smiling and being kind&mdash;it’s actually kind of scary.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『No, really, even in interviews when they ask us, ‘Who are you most grateful to?’ we always answer, ‘Our sister,’ and we mean it 100%. We don’t think there’s anything wrong with that; we’re grateful and love you very much. But at the same time, being perpetually kind is scary!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon continued, expressing how even my joyful smile gives them the creeps.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My smile when I’m extremely happy is popular among my siblings for its eerie quality.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『But once I started thinking, ‘Ah, so that’s the kind of Monster she is,’ it felt incredibly fitting. You just happened to be born from a human; fundamentally, you’re a Monster.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">“M-Monster…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『So, what if you also start thinking that way, Onee-chan?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon suggested, addressing my long-standing anxiety about becoming a ‘normal’ person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Thinking of myself as a Monster is something I’d never considered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『In fact, be it a Monster, a supernatural being, an anomaly, or a strange person, whatever the word may be, it doesn’t matter. You’ve even said it yourself, right? ‘I’ve been like this since I was born.’ Then you already know you were born as such a creature.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That… it might be true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Deep down, I felt no discomfort with what Kanon was saying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because when it was pointed out to me, it made perfect sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It explains both my old self and the new person I’ve become since falling in love with Chifuji-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Monster…that kind of creature.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">How fitting that feels.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had known this way of thinking before meeting Chifuji-san, I don’t think I would have been as drawn to it as much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wouldn’t have resonated as deeply, and it wouldn’t have fit so perfectly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for who I am now… it feels incredibly sweet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…still.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, to me who hesitated to take the leap, Kanon said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Consider this a proposal from one human who has been protected by such a Monster all this time.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanon…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『There are things that ordinary humans can’t do, but a Monster can, and that’s what appealed to the Raihara family. I don’t know about Chifuji-san, though.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000012.png">

<p class="calibre5">『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No, it’s nothing. Haha.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Something came to mind. The conversation about the manager’s favorite movie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">How much, and for how long, had that person seen through me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;There are things that only a Monster can do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a role that can’t be performed otherwise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In that case….if that’s the case,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Onee-chan?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I know it’s a convenient way of thinking. But still…but still…</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;At this moment, I hear the sound of chains breaking, over and over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Inside me, the chains that I had wrapped around myself were tearing apart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I am a Monster, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">In that case, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Hey, but don’t go overboard, okay? Since forever, when Onee-chan decides to do something, you go all out, and that worries me. Like suddenly dyeing your hair, or becoming a stalker. You’re so extreme.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe so, ahaha.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t say I won’t though.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sorry, Kanon.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">『To think the day would come when I’d have love-talks like this with Onee-chan. I’m not sure if it’s a common love talk or not though. Oh, did you know? Mom and Dad are worried about you.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Yeah, because it’d be bad if you got tangled up with a no-good guy. Hahaha, well, that’s completely off the mark, isn’t it?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At this point, I understand that as well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Whether it’s convenient or malicious, Onee-chan’s desire to take care of people doesn’t respond well to those who are self-indulgent. Because Onee-chan wants to care for those who are working hard.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… That understanding might be one step short.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Eh, Really?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. What I want is&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my following words, Kanon was silent for a moment, then said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Onee-chan, you’re really the real deal.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">Opening my eyes, the digital clock on my bedside table reads 5:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It being a Saturday, there’s no school today, and although I have work, I don’t usually wake up this early.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I woke up to the sound of something breaking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Mom, is that you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She didn’t come home last night, and she rarely comes home at this hour.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t have a good feeling about this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom has been showing up at this house more frequently lately.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Based on past experiences, that generally means things are not going well with her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The last time she came home, she seemed a bit unstable, and I failed to catch a smartphone she threw in a sudden outburst.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The congestion around my eye, which I hide with an eyepatch when I go out, is a remnant of that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With these thoughts, I walk through the corridor to the living kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s a noise coming from there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Too slow!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The moment I open the door, a plate comes flying at me. It hits around my collarbone with an unpleasant sound. Worse than the pain, a nasty sweat bursts from my body at Mom’s angry shout.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t you come sooner!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I was sleeping…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I guess you don’t care about Misa, huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom says, suddenly switching to a dark tone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her emotional volatility stoked my anxiety even more.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You don’t care about Misa, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You don’t care, do you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…My guess that something must have happened with her boyfriend is probably right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She seems more agitated than usual, likely because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shattered plates are scattered around my mom’s feet in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…She was in a terrible rage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ughh! uuuu, ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom is frantically tearing at her own hair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s your fault…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ts…um…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Misa doesn’t cook… it’s because you said you wanted to do the cooking yourself, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…The topic has shifted, and the line of reasoning is a bit unclear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there are signs that cooking had been attempted in the kitchen&mdash;ingredients, a frying pan, and a knife are all out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did she try to make something?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Mom doesn’t really cook.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From what I remember, she’s terrible at it and gets irritable whenever mealtime comes around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because of that, I took over the responsibility of cooking many years ago.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s all your fault, not Misa’s.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…if I had to guess, did they break up because of something related to cooking?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think that’s probably the case.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, it’s my fault…but Mom,”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Glancing down at the floor, I notice the broken plates that look like they could cut my mom’s feet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I take a step closer to at least move her away from them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Misa’s not at fault!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thud&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">An impact popped into my face. A moment later, the pain rushes in.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Through my blurry vision, I see my mom holding a frying pan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s old, rugged, and heavy&mdash;the impact from being hit with it is considerable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…ughh, uuu.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems like I picked a bad time to walk in.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I got hit with it while it was heated before, I didn’t feel this wobbly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, it probably hit around my jaw.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unable to stand, I involuntarily lean against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Ah, ah, …you’re making a face like it’s Misa’s fault! Ah! Ahhhh! Like that!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not…ouch!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thud&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">It came from within my body.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking down, the frying pan had hit me in the stomach, right at the pit of my stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unable to hold back, I let out a groan and curl up on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Glancing upwards through my still-distorted vision, I see that Mom still has the frying pan in her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You always blame Misa…! It’s always Misa who ends up getting hurt!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom has a tendency to imagine things I haven’t said, and her thoughts spiral from there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I, I didn’t…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…If it were Takkun, he would have been much kinder. Takkun never told Misa she couldn’t cook…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Dad…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Dad was a man who could do anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So why!… Why don’t you do anything for me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tears start to stream down Mom’s face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’ve always been clumsy like an idiot, without any talent, constantly causing trouble for Misa… M-M-Misa is always the one who ends up getting hurt because Takkun is gone…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom stomps on the floor angrily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Amidst the shattered plates at her feet, she could hurt herself at any moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“M-Mom…a-at this point, pleas stop&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I try to intervene, but the pain from the hit to my jaw hasn’t subsided yet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unable to stand up straight, my balance wavers…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I ended up grabbing hold of Mom’s clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Eh?… Ah, Aaaaaah! He’s angry! He’s angry at Misa! Ah! Aaaaaaaaah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A scream as loud as an explosion, reverberates through my eardrums and shakes my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How could you, how could you, why, ah~!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, Mom&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How could you, how could you, why does everyone treat Misa like this!? Aaaaaaah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What my flickering vision captures is Mom holding a knife.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait…Stop&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom! Wait, that’s&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t raise your voice!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Listen! If you do that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If it comes to that, then no matter what, I won’t be able to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then I won’t be able to protect Mom anymore… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Desperately, I utter these words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no hiding it now. Mom will find out eventually.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Won’t be able to protect?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Mom&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You want to say it’s Misa’s fault, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve provoked the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The knife in her hand is raised, its tip glistening ominously in the dim room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Strangely enough, I can see it quite clearly, even through my fleeting and distorted vision.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, I see&mdash;&mdash;maybe it’s because I’m in slow motion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My sense of balance is still off, and my body is thrown into disarray by Mom’s scream.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, there’s no image of me being able to dodge. Only my brain senses the danger and accelerates its processing speed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It understands the critical moment I’m in right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Coming to this point, I realize. I’m sorry, Mom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">‘I guess I’m really not a good son, just like what you said.’ That’s what I’m thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…but I also think, ‘That’s not true’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps a proper good child would love their parents purely, honestly, and wholeheartedly at all times, but it seems that when pushed to the brink, my true colors have been revealed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is a part of me that thinks of my parents. But at the same time, another part is screaming, ‘Why? This is not right!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The latter shows me a single vivid image.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s an image of a spoon being offered to me, rice porridge on it, and a smiling woman sitting across.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I knew somewhere why I had cried back then.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted more of those kinds of moments in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I could wish for it, always, but it’s too late.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Resigning myself, all I could do was brace for the impact&mdash;just then, a loud crash reverberates.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;Clank</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wha…!? What? Eh, eh… What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sudden, high-pitched sound, followed by more crashing noises, makes Mom unexpectedly halt with her knife.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We both looked toward the source of the noise at the living room window.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The closed curtains spontaneously opened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, a gentle but not dazzling morning light flooded into the room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And what became visible was a large, shattered window, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Huh? …What? Who is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haah…Haah…Haah… Did I make it in time?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A blend of pink and black hues. Cute frills, ribbons, and seductive lace.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A fashion statement that was both distinctive and striking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her face, wet with sweat was still beautiful, radiating a charm that outshone her clothing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Rai, hara-san…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know why I could see her through the shadow so clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The person who opened the curtains to let in the light also extended her own shadow toward us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was an otherworldly, mysterious atmosphere about her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In her hand was a small hammer, likely the object that had shattered the window.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, who rushed toward us, tossed the hammer aside as if it didn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It bounced on the floor with a loud ‘thud’, causing Mom to shudder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What? What is this?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom kept retreating step by step.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And just like the hammer, without paying it any mind, Raihara-san came over to where I was crouched and knelt down to meet my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-sa… ah, …ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she immediately noticed the bruises on my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san, um, this is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I was late… I’m sorry… we need to go to the hospital, no, call an ambulance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I am…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I try to move, the pain in my abdomen resonates and my breath halts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I may have a fractured rib.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re hurt there too? Ah, I’m sorry… I should have been faster…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s voice trembled, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s not like that… um…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If she hadn’t come, I’d probably be dead by now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mom would have become a murderer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wanted to thank her, but hesitated, wondering if it was appropriate to say it out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I then reconsidered, thinking that such indecision was pointless at this point… Maybe my mind was in a state of panic right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To begin with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…You! What is this!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom screams.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Who are you? How did you get here?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right… why is Raihara-san here?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…How? I climbed up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’re on the fifth floor.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s why I climbed up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is that even possible?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, she’s here, so it must be, and if it’s Raihara-san, it wouldn’t be surprising.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-who are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m his former stalker.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My apologies. Whether I can truly say ‘former’ is highly questionable.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t understand what you’re saying!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, the feeling is mutual. I also don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t get you, not at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she says this, Raihara-san stands up swiftly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So, you’re saying this is Misa’s fault…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mom, stop it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not Misa’s fault!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the worst.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mom, still holding the knife, starts waving it recklessly as she approaches Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I need to stop her, I think, trying to stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My vision keeps shaking and it feels so hard. However, I can’t just&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, you mustn’t move, stay still…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, Raihara-san, run&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll handle this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll probably never forget the scene that unfolded next.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unfazed by the swinging knife, Raihara-san took a step forward&mdash;her skirt flipping lightly as she unleashed a powerful kick that sent my mom flying through the air.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” !?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom’s body flew back in an almost a horizontal movement and stopped when it hit the far wall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……!? cough, Wha-… Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Coughing, Mom looked as if she couldn’t quite grasp what had just happened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As for Raihara-san,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Now, Chifuji-san, you’ll aggravate your injuries. Please sit down quietly… it must hurt, ah… even though you’re being treated so horribly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She immediately turned towards me and spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘What is it’, she asks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes are filled to the brim, a full 100%, with concern for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…She was just attacked with a knife, and yet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t see any fear, confusion, or even anger in her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Normally, anyone caught up in such a violent situation would show some sign of distress, even if they were as athletically gifted as she is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A-Are you hurt…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about others right now! Just think about yourself, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her words, her tone, her demeanor, and her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Isn’t it all too ‘unnaturally’… kind?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t even slightly think there’s something hidden or an ulterior motive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s exactly why it feels as if it’s not about a facade or true intentions; it feels like the very core of her being deviates from what I consider normal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel a sense of danger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh… ah, no, it’s just… ah, my mom&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Gently, she takes my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her touch is as delicate as if she’s handling something fragile yet strangely firm that it feels oddly unbreakable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It felt as if I was confined in a prison.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Your injuries will get worse.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Slowly and clearly, Raihara-san speaks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Directly in front of me, at a very close range, her bottomless eyes are fixed on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You don’t have to move your body. You don’t have to move your heart. It must hurt, it must be painful, but it’s okay now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That, I am&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It must have hurt, it must have been painful… right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uhh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I realize how naive I’ve been. To think that it would end with just my hand being confined.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Would you be mine?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you’re going to be by someone’s side, why don’t you choose me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her voice lacks any edge, peaceful and serene, yet it possesses a sticky persistence and a vivid intensity that envelopes me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I like you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she takes a breath before continuing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This ‘like’ is a ‘wanting to be by your side’ kind of like. This ‘like’ is a ‘wanting you to see me as a woman’ kind of like. This ‘like’ is a ‘not wanting to give you away to anyone’ kind of like. …This ‘like’ is ‘wanting to become someone indispensable to you, who tries so hard,’ kind of like…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The warmth in her breath as she makes this confession is mixed with a sweetness I’ve never encountered before in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It carries danger with it, it’s a sweetness that could addict people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How about it, am I… Well, am I not good enough for you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder what kind of goosebumps these are, spreading all over my body?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I… I am&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ow…it hurtss! Why?! Why does this always happen to Misa?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My focus, which had been rapidly narrowing, snapped back at the sound of my mother’s screams.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the same time, my body tense up in response to her voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Watching me, Raihara-san silently stands up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She walks toward my mother, who is curled up against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not Misa’s fault! Why does this always happen to Misa?! Go away! I hate you! I hate you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? I didn’t really do anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t lie! You think it’s Misa’s fault, too, don’t you?! You kicked her! You must hate her!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I have a question for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Strangely enough, her voice is crisp and clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When you throw away trash, do you ever think, ‘I hate doing this’? Isn’t it just something you have to do?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no emotion in Raihara-san’s voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I might think it smells, at least.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Smells… I hate you! I’m calling the police! You broke into the room! You should be arrested!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Fine, let’s call them. We can both be judged properly; after all, we’re both trash.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Misa is not at fault! She’s the victim!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A victim, huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san stops in front of my mother and looks down at her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mother shivers for a moment, perhaps remembering that she was kicked, but continues to scream.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right! You know it when you see it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you still feel the same, even after seeing the person who’s injured because of your yelling?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …Misa is not at fault! Because every child loves their mother! So&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…So?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san questions back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Behind her, I wished I could cover my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had a premonition.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can do whatever I want to my children! They love their mothers!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">‘That’s not how it works.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I had a feeling that those words would come, and I was right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mother, that’s not how it works… that’s wrong…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s natural for me to be loved! Misa has struggled! Misa worked hard! Misa gave birth! Misa raised him despite her having no talent and only being able to do things poorly, unlike her father! Misa has worked hard!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Certainly, I’m incapable of many things unlike my father.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But still…</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, that’s not it. Don’t think like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because we’re family, because I am her child, I should cherish her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …I do have one thing I’m very grateful to you for.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ha?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m grateful you gave birth to this person. But, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words Raihara-san directs at my mother carry no warmth nor emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even now, as she expresses her gratitude and her apology, her tone remains flat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t even seem to be forcibly holding back her emotions either.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m just as selfish as you are.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But if there’s no emotion, why is that?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Because no matter how I think about it, I can’t believe this is how one human talks to another.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When one human speaks to another, emotion should be there in some form, yet I can never sense it in her voice…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was then that I finally understood.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I came to grasp a truth that couldn’t be explained any other way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d like you to be quiet, if possible, forever.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san lifted her foot over the head of my mother, who was still crouched on the ground.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Was that “what?” from my mouth or my mother’s?</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no atmosphere of doing anything special on Raihara-san’s posture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was just talking about trash earlier…</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why, looking at her now, I feel as if she’s standing over a soda can, ready to throw it away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’d crush it only because it needs to be done before throwing it away, without any special feelings&mdash;in other words, of course, without any hesitation at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What? W-Wait!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems my mother noticed Raihara-san’s demeanor, too, but neither she nor I were in a position or timing to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What did Raihara-san say?</p>
<p class="calibre5">‘I’d like you to be quiet, if possible, forever.’? If possible, forever?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, what does that mean…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, a sound that could only be described as a thunderous ‘thud’ resonated through the room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That was the only sound that leaked out from my mouth.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">When the vibrations in the air and floor that remained as an aftereffect finally settled, what came into my field of vision was…</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sight of my mother, who looked dazed and didn’t say a word, and Raihara-san, who had swung her foot down beside her face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought of two things.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First, it was unexpected. After all, she had a posture that made it seem like she was seriously about to stomp my mother’s face into the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And the second thing&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Raihara-san turned toward me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her face transformed into that of the kindest woman in the world, brimming with compassion and concern for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think to myself, ah yes, she’s really different from us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Regardless of what makes up our food, our bodies, or what’s encoded in our DNA, the way her mind exists is fundamentally different from ours.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A different kind of creature.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why… I hesitantly spoke to her when she came over again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I was just thought, for a moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can you… understand how I feel?”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000009.png">

<p class="calibre5">“…Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san gently and softly hugs me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…if this woman enveloping me is some different kind of creature,</p>
<p class="calibre5">If human ethics don’t reach this place,</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought it might be okay to speak such true feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…No, that’s not… that’s not what I meant…just now….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not it… I…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But because I could even think that for a moment, and because I could verbalize it, guilt strongly surged within me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I said something I shouldn’t have, even though we are family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay, Chifuji-san. I know you still have feelings of concern for her… you are worried, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because, that’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I look over Raihara-san’s shoulder at my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing my family cowering in pain and fear, there’s no way I could be without concern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Regardless of the circumstances… even if you thought she deserved what she got… if I’m not worried, then even if blood ties us, we aren’t family…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I think so too. …I’m sorry, Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, apologizing, Raihara-san takes out her smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Displayed on the screen she holds before me is… my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not a photo; it’s the front camera.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s reflected, just like in a mirror, is my current face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is the face you’re making right now. This is the expression you have. …hey, Chifuji-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A particularly large chill runs through me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have a premonition that I’m about to hear words I shouldn’t hear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Wait, please!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I involuntarily shake my head a little, but Raihara-san, with a deeply sad expression, asks the question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Has your mother ever made a worried face like this for you in your memory?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What about today, as she looked down at me doubled over clutching my stomach?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even just a little would be fine, even if she is just exaggerating it, that’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did she ever show even a hint of concern on her face?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Uh… ahh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Not today, what about other days?</p>
<p class="calibre5">For instance, memories from when I was little, like when I tripped and fell, not when my mother hit me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or when I was bedridden with a fever?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What kind of face did my mother make?</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mother… my mother is looking at me…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, ah, aahh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if I dig through my memories for a face full of worry…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If you’re not worried, even if blood ties you, you’re not family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just a moment ago, I myself said something like that…</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I couldn’t make excuses or a cover-up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry… I said that because I knew you must be like that. I knew it would hurt you and yet I said it… I’m sorry… I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san says, her voice sounding as if she herself had been cut.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After a moment of silence, I then ask her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san, are you… human?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I am some kind of monster.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san answered in a sorrowful voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t have a proper form, I am a monster that deceives you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, so it is true…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In that case…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, Chifuji-san …I’m sorry, I…I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was something I absolutely had to tell her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Please stay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Stay by my side.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I… can’t live with people anymore…I can’t give my heart to anyone. Even family… I can’t think of them without fear.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Exposing my weakness, these are my true feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But being alone is unbearable… too lonely, and too cold to go on…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My heart bares itself as I pitifully cling to the woman before me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To leave a place this warm… I just… can’t do it anymore… so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t have the confidence to live outside of this warm circle that has been the warmest fifty centimeters of my life up to now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I want you, who are different from others… to stay by my side.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’ll be by your side for a lifetime.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She immediately answered my plea.</p>
<p class="calibre5">More than any other words, I silently sought her warmth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if eventually the heat I receive from her is the only thing I could call warmth, I wanted it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Eventually catching my breath and steadying my heart, I speak.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Can I lean on your shoulder?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite the aching in my body, I was okay because she was there to support me. I stand up, walk, and move forward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I arrive, my mother, still crouching on the floor, fixes her eyes on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Wh-why… why are you like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You only cause trouble…! And you bring that woman here…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why, why are you like this! You’re not like Takkun! You have no talent, can’t do anything right, completely useless… if you were like Takkun… if you were Takkun then…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry, Mom.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my apology, my mother narrows her eyes sharply.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s all your fault! Misa has done nothing wrong! Apologize properly!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right, Mom. There’s something I have to apologize to you for.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can’t hear you! I can’t hear you, I can’t hear you! Apologize! To Misa more!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry… I’m sorry, Mom. I… I have no talent.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right! That’s why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. So, I’m sorry. …I’m sorry that for eighteen years, I didn’t have the talent to be your son.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At those words, my mother made a face I had never seen before.</p>
