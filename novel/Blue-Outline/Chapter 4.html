<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; When The Spirit Does Not Work With The Hand, There Is No Art</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Before I could start painting, there was an important decision I had to make.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m sorry, but I… I am thinking of not using the painting you modeled…I want to paint a picture of someone I want to paint the most.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I contacted Senpai and visited her house. I firmly declined her kind offer for me to come inside. Instead, at the entrance, I bow low.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I took a lot of her time, then declined her confession, and now I was going to paint another person. If a girl did the same thing to me, I wouldn’t want to see their face again after giving that girl’s man a good punch. It was just that despicable.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She said nothing and silence fell between us. There was a saying that a beauty’s angry face is the scariest, I had never thought I would experience such things for myself like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Unbelievable. This is the first time you have done such a lousy thing to me. Hmph.” Her voice was cold.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes, I’m just as you said…I’m doing something really rude to you, it would be normal that you resent or hate me. I am not thinking of apologizing for forgiveness. That’s why I’m here to accept my punishment. If you want to hit me, then I’ll gladly offer you my cheeks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even bowing, I could feel her staring down at my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Punishment, huh…Then I won’t hold back. The worst of the worst. Idiot. Self-centered. Enemy of all women. You’re so serious and sincere, but now you’re just outright horrible.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I winced.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes… Just as you said. I’m terribly sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I’ll take whatever she threw at me with all the integrity I had. Although I did take damage, that was the least I could do. In fact, this was incomparable to my abysmal treatment.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Say, I still have that one favor left from the mixer, remember? What if I told you to draw me? What will you do?” She asked, hope returning to her voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Just this one picture, I want to paint what I want,” I said. I couldn’t turn back now, “I have no choice but to keep my head down until you accept that”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I stubbornly kept insisting on my selfish request. A while passed before her exasperated sigh fell on me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hahh… Unbelievable… Really. But that means that you can now draw, right?” Her tone switched to her usual calm one. My head jerked up and saw her gentle sime I knew so well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes… I can barely hold myself. I want to paint that much,” I answered with all the confidence I had.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was as if I couldn’t stand another second, I craved a paintbrush in my grip that much. I hadn’t wished for something this much for such a long time. It felt like I went back in time, no not really, but I felt the innocent joy of drawing again. I wanted to indulge in this feeling forever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Is that so? Then, good for you… You know, I like your paintings. Yours doesn’t have Yuri’s intense impact, but they are hearthly. Made me smile before I knew it, that’s what your paintings are… So, go for it, I’m rooting for you, okay?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My heart beated fast and my body heated. Vigor spread through my body.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After all, I become happier when someone praises my art than praising myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Wow… I, um, super happy! I will paint a picture that’s worth all your trouble, and aim for the grand prize!” Seeing my ear to ear grin, Senpai let out hers too. She then held out her raised pinky in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Then… When you finish my painting, give it to me, ‘kay? I’ll wait for it forever.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Being asked by the most beautiful woman in the world, there was no way I would refuse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“When I’m more skilled, I will paint one for you. Please wait for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I intertwined my pinky with hers, with that I vowed to paint her to be as attractive as the real Senpai.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The canvas fabric trimmed to the size of the wooden frame, I stretched it and fixed its four sides with pins. Placing the taunt canvas on the easel, I began the process of pouring my soul onto the pure white cloth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Until now, I had seen all her expressions and poses. With her image burned into my mind, I was filled with strange confidence that I could paint her without any reference.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her large eyes, then her soft hair, and each of the elements of what made her who she was. The paintings until now were like preamble to this painting, I was destined to paint this. I was so confident that I could say such conceited things.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The hours spent painting nonstop made my shoulders and back ache to a point that my youth couldn’t compensate for it. Even so, more and firmly, I put my feelings into shape on this canvas, and hoped that it would convey these feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Doing what I wanted to do. Drawing what I wanted to draw.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That was the kind of painting I wanted to paint, and the kind of painter I wanted to be.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Serious was my byword, a characteristic I had no intention of changing. But I am not a professional who draws for a living now, not yet. If I don’t paint freely now, then when? This was one of my last chances.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I’ll keep painting. I wasn’t a genius. Just another ordinary person who happened to like to draw.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I was painting something that I could only draw.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It’s burning me. The burning passion. The burning desire to draw.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I already had the picture of the finished painting in mind, with that out of the way, it was surprisingly enjoyable and comforting to spend time painting like this, even though I was putting everything I had on the line.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Completion of a painting is indefinable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even though the painting seemed finished to me, the people looking might think the contrary, the judges might deemed it too sloppy for a finished work.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But despite that, I was proud to say that I have created a masterpiece that incorporated all my skills and my every emotion. I thought smugly while looking at my painting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wonder what she would think when she sees this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My excitement amplified when I traced the surface of the painting.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri left school early without saying anything. She didn’t answer my phone nor my messages.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was her, so in all probability, she was drawing. But remembering what happened to Utako when she went silent, I couldn’t stand still.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">So I called her residence, which her mother answered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“She’s concentrating on her painting. If only she could do the same for studying too.” Although it was supposed to be exasperated, her tone exudes exuberance. She must be happy that her daughter was finally drawing again</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That night, with the permission of her mother, I visited her house, bringing a cup of coffee for her. I was about to press the intercom when I noticed a presence, I spun back and saw her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I froze as if someone had casted a spell on me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In the Maimori winter night where temperature was never above zero, she was face to face with her canvas, her feet and the easel grounded on the packed snow.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The snow sparkled milk white under the moonlight. Gleaming in the half light, she looked like a divine deity.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her eyes trained on the canvas, her hand zipping around at an incredible speed. She didn’t even notice me. No indication of her feeling the cold, the unwavering&nbsp; intensity of her profile face, I realized that she wouldn’t even hear me if I speak. She had probably been concentrating on the painting since she got home from school, the only thing that mattered to her now was the canvas in front of her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I painted my entry for the Exhibit, I thought it was the most concentrated I had been. But seeing her now made it clear that we were on different levels. Hers was beyond the word concentration.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Nr1whQ8/000006.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She was in her reverie. While painting, Yuri forgot what it takes to maintain life support as a human being. Eating, drinking, and resting, she didn’t understand these concepts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As if the painting in front of her was the only reason for her existence, she painted with pride, and a worrisome fragility. She was entrancing, drawing my sight towards her with a feeling of irresistibility.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“A long way… before I could compete with her, huh…” Listening to myself mutter, I couldn’t help but want to laugh.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even if I describe this as “concentration” for the sake of simplicity.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The magnitude of her concentration was not something to be compared with an ordinary person like me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Geniuses had better concentration? Or was it because they had better concentration, so they became geniuses.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Until the end of time, I could never know the answer to this question, but there was one thing I could say for sure.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;If I don’t work hard, I will always be behind her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Sitting back and watching her shine wasn’t an option in the first place. I sucked in the cold air, feeling my lungs freezing, and strained my voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri! I brought you some coffee! Let’s take a break!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was unexpectedly happy when she finally turned her eyes towards me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">We sat together on the snow, drinking coffee and watching our breath dissolve into the night sky. Born and raised under Hokkaido’s starry sky, yet today’s stars were more sentimental than the rest, it was just simply beautiful.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“By the way… The quality is just as absurd as before. Really, amazing.” I shot the canvas a glance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, because I’m the one painting, you should know that already. And it’s only 60% finished, so look forward to completion.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She wasn’t egotistical, she was just simply stating the facts. That was why I wasn’t angry with her in the slightest. I was more occupied with what I wanted to say to her now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri, I’ve got something to tell you,” I began.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My eyes met with hers. I saw my own serious face inside her beautiful eyes. Although her personality was twisted, she was still attractive, it seemed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I want to be a painter. I don’t care if I can’t paint something that will be extolled by critics and leave a lasting mark on history. I just want normal people who know nothing about art to see my painting and think ‘This one is kind of nice’, a picture that could make people dissolve into a smile. I want to spend my life painting.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When Utako told me she liked my paintings, or when Sugawara-senpai praised my art, the warmth in my heart and the sense of fulfillment was enough for me. I was proud to be painting.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I realized that I want to cherish that feeling, my future goals that had always been vague like “because I like painting”, “I want to be better than Yuri”, or “because I want to keep that promise”, became clear. I now know what I wanted, and what I should do in order to achieve it. I could finally see the future laying out in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When she listened to my dreams, she smirked teasingly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You made it sound easy. Actually, that’s quite a hurdle, no? Could the crybaby Sousuke do it?” she jested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m not a crybaby!… I know it’s difficult. But I want to do it. It’s now about whether I can or cannot, I’m painting because I want to. How’s it? That’s pretty artist-like , isn’t it?” I replied to her with a grin, showing my teeth, and added, “Just this, I want to tell you this before anyone else.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“‘Just this’… Hey… You know? You know nothing about a woman’s heart.” She let out a miffed sigh.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Huh? The topic has nothing to do with a woman’s heart?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I voiced my discontent, she laughed as if she found the statement funny.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That’s why, Yuri, draw with me. From now on too, continue painting, be my lifelong goal and rival for me.” I switched back.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What are you even talking about? You really think I would let you decide my life?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Isn’t this fine? Please, you have pushed me around for the past seventeen years,” I reminded her, “Give a bit of your future to me too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What’s that, a proposal?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No, you idiot. It’s my extremely self-serving negotiation.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She didn’t respond. Instead, she returned her gaze to the canvas and sipped her coffee. I meant every word I said, but I won’t push her for a reply. My top priority now was to keep her painting without any incident.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Say, Sousuke. Why does Utako like the stars so much? She believes that her dead father became a star?” She looked up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Don’t make up stories on your own. And her father should still be alive. She longs for shining things, something brilliant.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She was one of the things Utako longed for, one of those brilliant things. But I chose to omit that part.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm,” she grunted, “Then my prediction is correct. Sousuke, I won this match.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Wha? You don’t know until the results are out! I’m telling you, I’m painting my best picture here. I have no intention of losing!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I see. Here, drink, drink. It’s on me today.” She patted my head with one hand, the other offering me the coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What’s with that cheer-up party atmosphere! And I mean, isn’t that my coffee?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Although I said that, I brought my cup of now cold coffee to hers. I felt the change&ndash;growth&ndash;that I had come to face with her talent and accepted it. Under the starry sky, I smiled to myself.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Thursday, April 11. The announcement of the award-winning entries of the Kouji Exhibition Competition was scheduled to be on the official website at noon.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was 11:45 now. For the past two hours, I have been staring at the computer, doing push-ups impulsively, and going to the toilet so often my mom chided about the water bill. Yeah, all this suspicious behavior was because I was nervous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was usually indifferent to test results and stuff, but competition awards was something I couldn’t get used to. That was because this winter… no, my entire life’s worth of experience in painting was for this.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“The results are gonna be announced anyway, so calm down. Could you just sit down quietly?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri was with me, reading manga on my bed. She looked the same as she did a few months ago when we were in Seino’s room, talking about how she wanted to be popular with guys.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But this genius now drew a picture.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She was indifferent with the results, but I dragged her here anyway. How could she be so indifferent? Was that confidence? My jealousy flared up again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I put those complicated feelings aside just for today. Waiting for the results announcement with her was nostalgic, emotional, and most of all, heartening.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Well, that didn’t really make me less nervous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Saying that doesn’t help… Ahh, my heart’s exploding. Can you do surgery for me?” I wailed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hm, got it. I’ll put my signature on it too. Where’s the fountain pen.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That doesn’t sound like a joke at all. Somehow, I feel sick all of the sudden.” I returned to my usual demeanor. Rubbing my stomach exaggeratedly, I remembered Utako’s face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If it was her, she would have showered me with encouragement. It wasn’t that I wanted to cling to her, but I couldn’t resist the notion of being spoiled by her unconditional kindness and loving eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I shook my head to chase the fantasy away. I recalled her tales about the stars to calm myself down. From what I remembered, the Southern Cross could only be observed in the southern hemisphere now. However, the earth’s axis was gradually changing, if we waited for another two thousand years, it could be seen in Japan&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Oh, it’s noon. Earth to Sousuke!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">While I was lost in thought, the fateful hour had arrived. At Yuri’s urging, I straightened my back and clicked the mouse a few times. With a shaky hand, we inched closer to the announcement page.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Now the next page was the announcement itself. I took shallow breaths through my dry lips. With my heart’s current thudding, it wouldn’t be strange if Yuri could hear it too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ei?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri put her hand over mine and clicked the mouse smoothly, leaving me unprepared against the bright screen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"><br class="calibre8" />
</span><span class="calibre6">“Ah…” The one who let out that voice was me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The page was displaying a girl I know painted by an artist I knew too well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">[Grand Prize “The Girl Who Holds the Stars”]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I finally saw the finished painting by Kashiwazaki Yuri for the first time. I had been avoiding looking at her finished painting all this time, saving the moment for now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was spellbound, even forgetting to breathe.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even though it was through the screen, the attraction was too strong… I was surprised, but such a feat was completely possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Afterall, the painter was Kashiwazaki Yuri. The genius who could pull it off.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Utako’s outline blurred with the jet-black darkness. She was vacillating in the void as if the black hole was swallowing her, stirring up primitive fear of nothingness. The only emotion was in her eyes. Still, only her eyes were enough to evoke the feeling of, for example, the immorality of falling in love with someone you know you shouldn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: I tried to make it less cheeky, but that would mean taking too much liberty, so this is it]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And yet when you looked, there was nothing else but hope in those eyes. Even though the composition and overall colors were dark and depressing, the painting overflowed with dreams, love, and hope. Was it because of her posture that seemed to be engulfed and flow on her own? Or was it the white and gold treads of light in the utter darkness?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I can’t… It was beyond words. I was sure the bigshots who judged the painting must have had a lot of discussions about it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I felt an urge to see the actual painting. I wanted to smell the oil paint, to see the unevenness of the canvas, and examine how the light hits it. I want to experience this painting to the fullest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">How did she paint something like this? How do I&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke… Oi, Sousuke!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri’s voice pulled me back. Aah, this is my room. The time is 12:06.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The only thing different from a minute ago was that I just learned that I didn’t get the first prize, that was reality. The thundering heart slowed down to a gallop.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Exhaustion, feeling of defeat, fulfillment and satisfaction were already mixed together and were soaking my tired body.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I clenched and unclenched my fists, and squeezed out the words that were stuck in my throat.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Congratulations, Yuri… As expected.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Despite my frustration, I wasn’t a child who couldn’t say a few words of congratulations. Yuri put her hand on my shoulder from behind, the corners of her mouth lifted slightly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, seems that I won.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Despite how close we are, her back was always so far away. The more I tried to get closer to her, the more I realized how far apart we were. Swallowing my bitterness, I looked at the five excellence award winners following Yuri’s first prize. The creativity of ideas and techniques used were also advanced, the effort these artists put into their work was evident.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Reminded again of my current ability, I let out a sigh of resignation as I scrolled through. At the bottom of the screen, I found a button that led me to the list of honorable mentions. Just when my heartbeat had calmed down, the button appeared in front of me, great.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Want me to click?” She offered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I-I can do it by myself!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Before she had any ideas, I clicked the button myself. Through a long list of names, I scrolled. Finally, my eyes found “Komiya Sousuke”. I blinked a few times at the undramatic entrance of good news.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I looked back at Yuri, saw her grinning face, looked at the homepage again, and finally confirmed the fact.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Apparently, I was not mistaken. I saw my name on the honorable mention list.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But the honorable mentions paintings were not displayed like the grand prizes, where paintings were to be seen by countless people across the internet, so the impressions of the viewers were still unknown to me.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even so,&nbsp; the fact that my name showed on the screen must mean that at least one of the judges approved my work. I was so overjoyed that I collapsed on the bed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m not as good as you… But still, this is something,” I couldn’t hold back the exhilaration any longer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri lay down next to me and patted me on the stomach as if I was her child.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Okay, okay. It’s fine, it’s fine, Sousuke. Don’t cry. Chu&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Stop that act. I’m okay… I won’t lose next time.” I took her wrist and sprung up.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She looked at me and smiled smugly. “Maybe I’ll let you win the next one? Vanquishing you is no fun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She could have just accepted the victory normally. Revolting, she was. But this was the Yuri I had grown with, that I had come to chase, that I had come to admire.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Um… Can I show you my painting? I know you don’t like judging paintings, but only this once, can you?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hn? Well… I suppose I could have a look at the Utako you drew. This is in commemration of winning the prize. Come on, go fetch your canvas.” She gestured.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">While she wasn’t exactly pleasant, I had expected her to be more reluctant. I spoke nothing of her belittling attitude and went to get the painting I kept inside the closet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Somehow, I felt like a villager trying to battle the last boss. But the match was already decided, the winner chosen, no matter how hard I scuffled, no one would care.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But that was okay. The painting I painted was only for this one person in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“My competition is not over yet. The final judge is you, Yuri.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The moment I revealed the canvas her blue eyes flew wide.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She goggled at the painting of herself that I painted with love, unblinking.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yes, I didn’t paint Utako for the Kouji Exhibit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was Kashiwazaki Yuri that I painted, my childhood friend, my rival, someone I admired, someone I loved and cared for, someone I directed my foul feelings towards, Kashiwazaki Yuri.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My feelings towards her were ineffable, there were just too many, I could never get it right. But I believe that this painting expressed it for me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Mine is incomparable to your self portrait in the second year of middle school. But by passion wise, I won,” I declared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My life until now, I spended it with her. I knew her more than anyone in this world.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The Yuri I drew wasn’t laughing, wasn’t playing around, wasn’t pouting nor upset.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But instead, the forlorn look of her staring into the distance, the look of someone who thought that there was no one who understood them. I painted her as best as my ability allowed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Hzh68VZ/000005.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">For a long, long time, I had chased her with burning desire and searing jealousy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Friendship, jealousy, longing, and pride, she was looking at the canvas that depicted it all. It was as I had accomplished something significant in life, a sense of accomplishment and excitement flooded me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I professed that I admire you, didn’t I? The one who I had been chasing forever, the one who filled my head with thoughts about her… There’s only you who could do that. The one who I wanted to draw the most, is you, Yuri.” I puffed my chest as I spoke.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Ever since I saw her first picture. I couldn’t think of anything other than her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Not romantic feelings, and a bit different from respect, this feeling in my chest couldn’t be explained by such words. And to put these feelings into a picture, in this entire world, I was the only one capable of doing so.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wanted to paint her. I couldn’t go on without painting her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With her eyes still glued to the canvas, she whispered. “This is a mistake…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Unable to understand what she meant, I demanded, “What is? Can you judge my masterpiece properly?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Drop that bossy act… How can you be so cocky.” Her voice wavered a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Noticing something off about the ears peeking from her hair, I moved closer. She stubbornly turned her face away, so I grabbed her arm. “Yuri,” I called. Giving up, she finally faced me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her face, and even ears, blushed deep red in embarrassment. A sheepish expression I had never seen in these seventeen years with her. It was so destructive that… that I was forced to realize that Yuri was a girl.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The beating of my heart was getting louder and louder. I don’t want to admit it. I hate to admit it, but she was cute.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I couldn’t let go of her wrist, my eyes failed to look away from her, I had already wished that this moment would last forever.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My eyes then met with hers. When she noticed that, her lips parted hesitantly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“As an appreciation for this painting, I’ll say it once… Thank you. Thank you for painting me. This is unexpected, so I’m quite… no, I’m really… happy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Being thanked by Yuri was something beyond my dreams. Was it because I let my guard down, or was it because she broke my tear gland the other day, my eyes watered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri… I’m the one who&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Thank you for always being my goal was what I was going to say, before I was kicked in the leg and staggered back.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Just until when will you stare at me, you dummy!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She grabbed me by the chest and pulled me close. Despite her pink cheeks, despite her moist eyes, she glared threateningly.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Do you think I would let you make my heart flutter? Don’t push your luck.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Of course, I’m not, so let me go. I haven’t finished what I have to say.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Was she trying to get back to her usual bearing? She was back to whipping me with her unreasonable aggressions. Thanks to that, I started to cool down too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My leg still hurted, but this was for the best. Better than to be sucked into that atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Regaining our composure, I took a breath. Now, let’s ask her something I wanted to know the most.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Tell me, Yuri, frankly, what do you think of this painting? What do you feel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It wasn’t hot at all, but I could feel sweat forming on my back. It seemed that I had yet to experience the most nerve-wracking thing of the day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If only it could resonate with her heart. That was my only goal for this painting, the only reason I poured my heart and soul into this painting.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That was why it would mean nothing if it couldn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm… The jelosity, fondness, admiration, and hate towards my unstoppable talent… I think? 910 × 727 millimeters, a gigantic love letter?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Seeing her mouth curling into a smile gave me goosebumps. In relief and excitement, my heart burned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I did it. With my best painting, I conveyed what I want to the one I want to the most. I had never thought I could be this happy and proud.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&mdash;Yeah, I really love painting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Once again, I felt thrilled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I want to show this to Utako too,” Yuri whispered, her eyes never leaving the canvas.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thanks. But… Yours won the first prize, so she might be able to see it. But mine… That would be a bit hard.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I painted this picture for Yuri, but I also want Utako, who cares about Yuri as much as I do, to be able to see this painting too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No, not just mine, yours too, Sousuke. I’ll make sure she sees it. Trust me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“‘Trust me’… There’s nothing more untrustworthy than that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke, lend me the painting. I’m claiming my personality rights, so you have no right to complain. Well, I won’t do anything bad, so no worries.” She flashed her signature devil’s smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights</a>]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That’s not how personality rights work! I don’t know what you’re up to, but don’t do anything weird, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: I’m not sure how personality rights work either.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">No matter how hard I probed, she slipped through my grip. But seeing how she appeared more happy when looking at my painting than when she found out she won the first prize, I decided to let her be.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Besides&ndash; I know that the god of painting loves Yuri.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">　</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">So I decided to trust her as she brushed the canvas happily.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Three days had passed after the results were announced.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was a precious Sunday, but I couldn’t care any more and slept like a log. When I woke up, it was already nighttime.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But having a day like this once in a while wouldn’t be so bad, and so I made excuses for my laziness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Plopping down on my bed, I decided. For today, I’ll give up being productive. I rose again and shuffled to the gaming console I hadn’t touched in months. I booted the game and started playing online. In a game full of hardcore players, a few months of absense was fatal. I wasn’t good at it to begin with, but I was destroyed mercilessly and suffered a humiliating defeat this time.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The defeat irked me and I tightened my grip on the console. For a while I immersed myself in the competitiveness of the game. Then the mechanic ringing of an incoming call pulled me out of my reverie.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was an incoming call from an unknown number. Normally, I would ignore, but I felt the same pull I felt during the mixer a few months back, so I pressed the answer button.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hello?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Ah… S-Sou-chan? It’s me, Utako… How are you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Although my hunch was proven correct, I was honestly astonished. My eyes widened, I stood up with a bounce. “Utako! Is it really okay to call me?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Actually… no. My mom deleted your numbers and told me to never contact you again… But I have them memorized. She must have been aware of something like this too, but she believes that I won’t disobey her orders. She’s making light of our bond.” She giggled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was Utako’s voice! It was really hers! Her lovely voice echoed in my eardrums and stimulated my tear ducts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I see. But still, thanks for calling me! I’m really happy to be talking with you like this again!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Yeah, me too… Um, Sou-chan, where are you right now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Considering that she was in Tokyo, that was a strange question. “Now? I’m at home, playing games.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Oh… Sorry for interrupting. I’m, now, at Maimori Station… Can we meet?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The invitation made my heart explode. Without any second thoughts, I put on my down jacket, threw the door open&mdash; then went right back in. After shoving a small box into my pocket, I hightailed to the station.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was a quiet night, the kind of quiet that made you think you could hear the stars moving if you listened well enough.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Utako!” I called out.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Sunday night, well after the peak hour, the station was practically deserted. Alone, she sat on an old bench in front of the station roundabout.The moment she saw my face, her eyes were filled with tears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sou-chan… I’m sorry. Sorry I came here before we realized our dreams. But I’m glad I could see you again…I missed you…!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It had been so long since I had last seen her. She had grown up to be so cute that my heart fluttered just by just the sight of her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Me too, Always, I have always wanted to see you again.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I vigilantly held back the desire to hug her tight. First of all, I needed to check her physical condition.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Are you cold? Here, pocket heater. Then…” I unwrapped my scarf and gave it to her. “The weather was fine these last few days, but it had gotten cold all of the sudden. Minus five Celsius in March, simply unbelievable in Tokyo, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As if to hide her tears, she quickly wiped the tears from her face. “Thank you,” she mumbled softly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sorry, coming here all of the sudden… Seems like I ran away from home. First time I’ve rebelled against mom too, as far as I can remember…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I sat beside her as she began her tale. The bench was cold and hard.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Running away… You’ve decided where you’re staying? Of course, not my house, so Yuri’s? I’ll walk you there. Have you told her before?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Nope, I haven’t…” She shook her head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No worries, it’s already late, she won’t turn you away. Let’s go, I’m sure you’re cold out here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was happy that she sought out my help even before Yuri’s, and that was why I couldn’t disappoint her. To do so, I had to act quickly and decisively to make her feel at ease. It wasn’t like I could let her catch a cold. But she stopped me as I was about to stand up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“W-wait. I’m thankful for the offer, but… I know I’m being a nuisance, but there’s a reason I called you.” She had her fists clenched at her chest, her voice was resolute. “It’s a long story, but your contacts were blocked by my mom…&nbsp; but then there’s a message from Seino-san… The messages were a few pictures and a short text, Yuu-chan was the one who sended it, it seems.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">So that was what Yuri was up to, I realized. She robbed Seino’s phone and messaged Utako. How self-serving. She probably didn’t even bother to explain the situation to Seino. I could just imagine Seino trying to reclaim her phone. Borrowing her words, I’ll only say this once, but thank you, Yuri, Utako came to see us because of you.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“‘Look’ Just the usual Yuri, isn’t it,” she smiled fondly, “But when I saw the pictures, there was no need for any more explanation… The paintings you two drew, the painting of me by Yuri, and of Yuri you painted, I can feel the emotions in it. That’s what our relationship is, it told me, we are inseparable. When I realized that, I was so happy I couldn’t stop the tears… Thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thanks for saying that… We painted with everything we had, afterall.”</span><span class="calibre6"></span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The days spent painting, the days spent pouring my heart and soul weren’t in vain. One statement from Utako made it all worthwhile. I experienced a new height of fulfillment, my body went limp, it was as if I was melting with the snow.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Don’t be offended, yeah? But maybe, objectively speaking, Yuu-chan’s the better one. But to me… Since a long time ago, I prefer yours. Your paintings warm my heart, drawing me in… I don’t know how to explain, but I’m moved.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Those words, the same words she said in fifth grade, were still effective against me, very effective. I wanted to put the words on frame and hang them forever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“T-thank you. Damn. I can’t stop this grin. Even though it’s been a while and I don’t want you to remember me like this…”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But she only laughed when I tried to break this grin by pressing my hands onto my cheeks. To the glimmering stars above, she threw her head back happily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“The stars are just so beautiful here… Living in Tokyo is convenient, but the sky isn’t this clear.” She raised her hand as if to grab the stars.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“A ridiculously cold countryside, but still the best place for stargazing anyway, huh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah… To me, here’s the best. I love this town.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her profile as she looked at the stars was truly alluring. I felt the emotions I had been suppressing in my heart for so long began to unravel. But I knew I couldn’t force my feelings on a runaway girl.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In hope of distracting myself, I reached for my phone in my down jacket. However, my fingers found it instead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I looked at her face. I wasn’t nervous. There was no need for any fancy words.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Just my honest feelings as it was. The feeling that resided within me for these five years.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“There’s something I wanted to give to you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She tilted her head slightly. I slowly held out the small box from the jacket.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“This is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’ve always wanted to give it to you. My present for your birthday. I thought it would look good on you. My first present for a girl, actually. I did my best, um, if you would…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I opened the box, the star hairpin showed its face, still as beautiful as the day I brought it. I waited for her to take it until my hand itches, but she was perfectly still.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Apprehensive, I took a peek at her face. The distant streetlights, the moon and the stars, the visibility was awfully low, but she was certainly blushing, redder than ever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Did I get carried away? Was that cringey? What happened?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As my thought fumbled on the possibilities, small, soft fingertips touched my hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“T-thank you… I’m happy… Somehow, it’s as if I’ve been given a star. As if something was glowing in my chest, that kind of feeling.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Smiling, she took the hairpin and gently clipped it on her long bangs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her unusually visible face was cuter than I expected. I had chosen the hairpin because I wanted her to show her beautiful eyes, but now that I had come to see it, I wanted to keep the sight to myself instead.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“How…is it?” She tilted her head a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah! It looks sooo good on you!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She scratched her cheek shyly. She paused to catch her breath a while before looking straight at me with her big round eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sou-chan, um, I have a request. Can I… hold your hand? Can I borrow your courage for a bit? I feel like I could face my mom if you’re beside me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“That’s nothing. Err… here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The process was wobby and awkward, but we managed to hold hands. Our hands gently clasped. I knew it was cold, but still, I was surprised by how cold her hand was. How I could wrap my hand around the entirety of her small hand was also strange. I held her hand tightly, I wanted to lend her my warmth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“By the way, why don’t you tell me something about the stars? I like it when you talk about them.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;When talking about stars, Utako became more confident. And if I could keep the momentum going, then she might fare better against her mother.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her expression brightened a little, her shaking hand calmed down.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah, okay… Um, there. The two bright stars east of Betelgeuse, if you could find them, you’ll see the equilateral triangle they form,” She traced the stars with her fingers. “The triangle was called the Winter Triangle. Sirius, the white star in the southern side, was the brightest star in the constellation. Its name translates to ‘scorching’. The people of the past must have looked up at Sirius and thought, ‘It’s scorching the sky’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ehhh, ancient people sure were romanticists. Well, maybe not as much as I am today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thanks, Sou-chan,” she whispered. She gave my hand a squeeze before hitting the call button with her other hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The calling tone rang and echoed through the empty station. Then, it switched abruptly,</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Finally ye cried, ye delinquent! ken yer steid! where’re you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Finally you called, you delinquent! Know Your place! Where’re you!]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Maimori…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Maimori, ye say!? hahh…” I never knew a sigh could be this aggressive. “good heavens…find a change-hoose near th’ station, i’ll gang pick ye up th’morra at noon! am ah understaun!?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Maimori, you say?! Hahh…” I never knew a sigh could be this aggressive. “Good heavens…Find a hotel near the station, I’ll go pick you up tomorrow at noon! Am I understood?!]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her mother was yelling hysterically. A few seconds was enough to tell me that she wanted to rule over Utako’s every action.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“S-sorry for making you worry. But, I… I have something I really need to tell you&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Don’t blether back tae me! stoap causing yer mither ony mair concern! don’t ye ken better?! ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Don’t talk back to me! Stop causing your mother any more concern! Don’t you know better?!]</b></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even with the phone to her ear, I could still hear her mother’s screamings. Imagining how she endured something like this everyday, I finally understood why she had developed the “It can’t be helped” attitude.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Light played inside her pairpin, she didn’t give in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“M-Mom, I… I’m tired of being at your mercy. I know you raised me with care, but I’m already seventeen? My future, my university, and my friends, I want to choose them by myself. Sou-chan ‘n’ Yuu-chan too, they’re important to me, I want tae continue this relationship, I won’t cut ties wi’ them, ne’er.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: A bit of Kansai dialect here, so I localized some words]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her voice was shaky here and there, but she held her ground, expressing her feelings to her mother in her own words.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But even though it was through the phone, I could easily imagine her mother’s sneering face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“’n’ wha th’ hell dae ye think you’re talking tae!? ah wale hings wi’ care, mah hings tae decide ur a’ fur yer guid! git it!? juist keep silent ‘n’ follow mah wurds as you’re aye dane! ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: And who the hell do you think you’re talking to?! I choose things with care, my decisions are all for your good! Got it?! Just keep silent and follow my words as you’re always done!]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She froze. I could feel the fear instilled at her heart at work through her shaky fingers. Even though she wanted to break free, all she could do was shrink back in fear. And the only thing I could do here was&ndash;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I know you can,” I whispered. I squeezed her hand, gripping her hand tight. </span><i class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I’m here, Utako.</span></i><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She turned this way and took my words, her eyes even clearer than the night sky.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Mom, I want to talk to you face to face, can I? I am still a kid, and I am still causing you troubles. But that doesn’t mean I would continue to obey yer every single word, that’s just running awa’. Mah precious friends taught me, I won’t run away any longer…and Mom, stop running awa’ from Dad too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Here too.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">For the first time, her mother’s screeching stopped. Either she was too aggravated to say anything, or her brain couldn’t process the fact that her compliant daughter had actually rebelled.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wasn’t quite sure what happened, but I could say that she scored a victory in this first round.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“And don’t worry about where I’m going to stay tonight, I’ll be at my friend’s. You’re arriving at th’ station at noon, richt? I’ll wait fur you thare.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: And here]</b></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With that, she hung up, then slumped down. Her muscles slackened as the tension left her body. She put her hand to her chest and breathed out loudly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah… Thanks. Although I have to talk to her tomorrow, I think I’ll be fine. I think I could finally face her.” She said just when I was about to ask if she would like my company.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I quickly closed my mouth. I couldn’t hold down her growth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Got it… Well then, let’s go to Yuri’s! I want to see the surprise on her face already, you too?” I beamed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Y-yeah! But… I’m quite excited, it’s been so long. My heart’s pounding.” She replied with her own smile.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">None of us drew away our joined hand and we went on just like that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“But, I’m sorry, Utako.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Eh? Why are you apologizing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I mean, see, I’m pathetic? If I had said something back then, if I had the courage to speak up, you wouldn’t have to go through all this trouble…I want to be the one who offers you help when in destitute. I want to be a cool guy who could do that! That’s why when&ndash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“W-wait!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My declaration was cut short.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I-I think you’re misunderstanding something, so I want to know…I, never for a second have I thought of you as uncool or unreliable.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Eh?” My head went blank while her face flushed bright red.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Like now, that I could gather the courage to come here, it’s because of you. Your painting moved me, made the feeling of wanting to meet you unbearable…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My heart made a loud thump, my skin sizzled as if on fire.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She turned to me, “Since back then, and from now on too, I’ll stay in love with them forever, both you and your paintings.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Aah, afterall, she’s lovely. The rest of my life, I couldn’t imagine one without her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Looking back at her now unobscured eyes, I told her, “If you’re there, then I can go on… I don’t want any more goodbyes. Can you not ever leave me again?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sou-chan…You’re as bold as usual,” she giggled.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The stars twinkled above her head, and the artificial star pinning her hair too, but none was comparable to her beautiful smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Variable star, was it? The star that its brightness varies as time passes, the one that she told me long ago. Seeing her now reminded me of it.</span></p>
