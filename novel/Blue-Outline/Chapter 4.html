<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 4: The Winter When We Take a Step Forward</h2>

<p>Ever since the day I decided to live on my own after graduating from high school, I never wanted to let anyone else into my world.</p>
<p>Right after I graduated high school, my parents got divorced. Custody went to my mother, and my family name on the registry changed.</p>
<p>It was unfamiliar at first, but I’ve gotten used to it.</p>
<p>Even before the divorce, my family was a mess. As far back as I can remember, my parents’ relationship had already turned cold, and they barely spoke unless necessary.</p>
<p>My father was heavily into playing around with other women, hardly ever coming home. My mother endured his treatment and always smiled in front of me.</p>
<p>Not long after I started high school, it came out that my father had gotten one of his subordinates pregnant.</p>
<p>My parents fought almost every night, constantly blaming and berating each other. Especially the last year of high school was the worst.</p>
<p>──If Souhei wasn’t here, we would have separated long ago.</p>
<p>My mother kept saying that to my father. If they had separated sooner, I think my mother would have been able to find peace much earlier.</p>
<p>It was my existence that made my mother unhappy back then.</p>
<p>In the end, they divorced right after I graduated. My mother found a new partner, and now she lives with him. She seems much happier than before. There’s no place for me there.</p>
<p>Leaving home, I decided to live alone, without getting involved with anyone. I don’t need friends, let alone a lover.</p>
<p>After all, love eventually fades, doesn’t it? At least, it did for my parents.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get hurt, nor do I want to hurt anyone else. I no longer want to be a burden to anyone. So, it’s better not to get involved with anyone at all.</p>
<p>…That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>The night after Nanase confessed to me, a Sunday night, I had a mandatory class for the economics department. To avoid seeing her face, I woke up more than thirty minutes earlier than usual and got ready.</p>
<p>I barely slept last night. Whenever I closed my eyes, the image of Nanase crying would appear on the back of my eyelids.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I’ve always been hurting Nanase from the very beginning. Why would she like someone like me? There are surely better guys out there.</p>
<p>Putting on my sneakers, I opened my door. At the same time, the door next to mine opened.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>I unfortunately ran into Nanase, who had just left her room. The area around her eyes, usually perfectly covered with makeup, was faintly red. Realizing she had been crying, my heart ached.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw me, she quickly looked away. She clattered down the stairs and rode away on her red bicycle.</p>
<p>The fact that she didn’t smile and say “Good morning” as usual made me unbearably lonely… and I deeply despised myself for being so selfish.</p>
<p>There will never again be a time when she innocently smiles and directs her goodwill toward me. It was I who pushed her away.</p>
<p>After Nanase was completely out of sight, I mounted my bicycle and started pedaling.</p>
<p>“Can we talk for a sec?”</p>
<p>After the second class, as I was walking towards the cafeteria by the fountain, Sudo caught me.</p>
<p>What flashed through my mind was a memory from when I was in fifth grade. After inadvertently making a female classmate cry, I was surrounded and severely reprimanded by her friends.</p>
<p>Back then, I learned how terrifying the solidarity among girls could be.</p>
<p>I wondered if Sudo knew that I had made Nanase cry and had come to denounce me. While I didn’t think I deserved to be scolded by Sudo, if it made Nanase feel even a little better, then it might be for the best.</p>
<p>Sudo led me quietly to the back of the school building and suddenly asked, “What do you think about… Haruko?”</p>
<p>His voice was low, filled with anger. I didn’t know how to respond and remained silent.</p>
<p>“…I know it’s not fair to ask this when Haruko isn’t here. But, Haruko is really cute and nice, you know?”</p>
<p>Sudo was looking down, fists clenched. He didn’t seem to be asking out of mere curiosity.</p>
<p>“Did Nanase tell you anything?”</p>
<p>“…She said she was rejected by Sagara.”</p>
<p>Sudo’s answer made me flustered. So, objectively speaking, it meant I had rejected Nanase. How presumptuous of me.</p>
<p>Sudo added, “Just to be clear, Haruko isn’t spreading bad rumors about you. She’s been acting strange since this morning, so I just pried it out of her.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Nanase isn’t the type to speak ill of others. I wouldn’t mind if she spoke badly about me, but she wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p>“Do you hate Haruko?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t hate her.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Haruko? I thought you liked Haruko too.”</p>
<p>“…I think Nanase is too good for someone like me.”</p>
<p>Sudo raised his voice, “Then why!”</p>
<p>“After you defended Haruko from those guys… I had a newfound respect for you! And now you reject her!? Why!?”</p>
<p>I had no intention of revealing why I couldn’t accept Nanase’s feelings, as it delved deep into my own issues. Remaining silent, a nonchalant voice came from behind.</p>
<p>“Leave it at that, Saki.”</p>
<p>Houjo had appeared behind us at some point. With a refreshing smile, he stepped between me and Sudo.</p>
<p>“I get what you’re trying to say, but think about Sagara’s feelings too. It’s insensitive.”</p>
<p>Despite Houjo’s attempt to pacify, Sudo persisted, “But, Sagara…!”</p>
<p>“You know how I feel, and yet you’ve been avoiding the subject all this time.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m not talking about that right now!”</p>
<p>Sudo turned bright red. What’s this, a lovers’ quarrel? They should do this without me. Honestly, I’m not in the mood to deal with this right now. As I turned to leave, Sudo called out, “Wait!” I looked back to see Sudo staring intently at me.</p>
<p>“Actually, Hiroki is right… I was insensitive. It was rude of me to say all this without considering Haruko’s feelings.”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>Sudo’s confrontation was out of genuine concern for Nanase. Perhaps she just couldn’t forgive me for hurting Nanase. I thought it was insensitive, but I couldn’t bring myself to blame her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered Nanase from our high school days. A girl who studied alone in the library without speaking to anyone. I genuinely felt glad that she found a good friend.</p>
<p>Returning to my apartment after a night shift at six in the morning, it was especially cold, and my breath turned white, blending into the morning air.</p>
<p>Then, I heard the sound of someone coming down the stairs. Looking up, there was Nanase, barefaced, wearing a jersey with a half-coat draped over her. She must be taking out the trash since she was holding a yellow garbage bag; today was the day for burnable waste.</p>
<p>Nanase noticed me and momentarily looked away, hesitant. Then, she turned to me and smiled. It was a stiff, somewhat painful smile.</p>
<p>“Good work on your shift, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>I was taken aback by how normally she spoke to me. Nanase, looking down guiltily, said in a small voice, “Sagara-kun. I’m sorry about the other day.”</p>
<p>…Why are you apologizing? It’s all my fault, and there’s absolutely no need for Nanase to apologize. Unable to say anything, she continued.</p>
<p>“If it’s okay with you, let’s… um, continue to get along.”</p>
<p>Her face was smiling, but her clenched fists were trembling slightly. I tried not to look directly at Nanase as I nodded, “Understood.”</p>
<p>“…That’s good. See you then, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase said this, placed the trash at the garbage collection area, and quickly returned to her room. The sound of the door closing echoed.</p>
<p>I walked upstairs and stopped in front of Nanase’s door. I couldn’t tell what kind of expression she had behind that door.</p>
<p>I hoped she wasn’t crying, and I felt disgusted with my own arrogance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Even Ryunosuke Akutagawa once said that it’s not reason but busyness that saves us from love. Following those words, ever since I was rejected by Sagara-kun, I’ve been leading incredibly busy days. (tln : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABnosuke_Akutagawa" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABnosuke_Akutagawa</a>)</p>
<p>I started working more shifts at my part-time job every day, began studying for a qualification, and even started attending a cooking class with Sacchan.</p>
<p>I participated in volunteer activities outside of school and actively showed up at social gatherings. Being on the move kept my mind off unnecessary thoughts.</p>
<p>However, whenever I’d hear noises from the room next door during my study breaks, I’d find myself wondering what Sagara-kun might be doing.</p>
<p>At work, if I saw someone who resembled Sagara-kun, I’d inadvertently follow them with my eyes.</p>
<p>When I learned a new dish, I’d think about wanting Sagara-kun to try it. No matter where I went or whom I met, I felt that no one was more wonderful than Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>In the end, I hadn’t gotten over my feelings for him at all.</p>
<p>It’s been five months since I started my part-time job at a cafe near my apartment.</p>
<p>Although I struggled with the unfamiliar work at first, I think I’ve gotten pretty good at it. My job in customer service helped me overcome my shyness, and I’ve expanded my relationships with my coworkers… all thanks to Sagara-kun for pushing me forward.</p>
<p>“Nanase-san, can you work the shift on the 25th night?”</p>
<p>Right after changing back into my casual clothes, the manager approached me with an apologetic tone.</p>
<p>“It looks like everyone else has plans, and we’re really in a pinch because it’s going to be busy. I’m sorry to ask.”</p>
<p>The manager, a gentle woman in her mid-thirties with a laid-back Kansai accent different from Sacchan’s, looked relieved when I said, “It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. You’re also working on the 24th, so feel free to take the 25th off if you want.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I can work both days.”</p>
<p>The manager was surprised by my response.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Don’t you have a party or something with your friends?”</p>
<p>It then hit me. December 25th is Christmas.</p>
<p>I do have plans for a Christmas party with friends, but it’s on the 22nd, a Friday.</p>
<p>Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan seem to have overnight dates with their boyfriends on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>I haven’t asked Sacchan what she replied to Houjo-kun’s invitation.</p>
<p>My Christmas plans, fresh from a heartbreak, are completely blank.</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. Please let me work!”</p>
<p>“Really? That helps a lot. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Eh, Nanase-chan, you’re working on Christmas night? Lucky, we’re together then.”</p>
<p>Atsushi Shibata-san, who was restocking cutlery in the back, suddenly joined our conversation.</p>
<p>Shibata-san is a second-year student at a nearby university and has been working here for over a year.</p>
<p>He’s a friendly and approachable senior but tends to close the distance a bit forcefully.</p>
<p>The other girls warned me, “Be careful around Atsushi; he’s a bit of a ladies’ man,” so I’ve been a bit wary around him.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Shibata-kun, for working on Christmas.”</p>
<p>“No problem! I don’t have a girlfriend this year, so I’m spending Christmas working! It’s totally fine if I get to spend it with Nanase-chan!”</p>
<p>I responded with an ambiguous smile to Shibata-san’s words. In moments like these, I’m not sure what the right expression is.</p>
<p>…I wonder what Sagara-kun will be doing for Christmas. Probably working, I guess.</p>
<p>Ever since Sagara-kun rejected me, we haven’t had a proper conversation.</p>
<p>Whether at the apartment or university, I’ve been avoiding Sagara-kun as much as possible, only exchanging brief greetings when we bump into each other.</p>
<p>After all, I haven’t gotten over him at all. There’s no way I can have a normal conversation in this state. My feelings for him would just spill out and bother him again.</p>
<p>…Ah, this is no good. I need to move on from these feelings as soon as possible and go back to just being neighbors.</p>
<p>“Manager, I’ll do my best with the part-time job!”</p>
<p>As I clenched my fist and declared this, the manager laughed and said, “I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since the day I pushed Nanase away, I regained my solitary, carefree, and comfortable university life.</p>
<p>It’s strange how much less frequently I see Nanase’s face now, considering we used to meet almost every day.</p>
<p>Without her initiating conversation, there’s no reason to interact. The Nanase I see at university, perfectly made up and radiating a dazzling aura, seems so different from the girl who used to smile at me in her plain glasses and jersey that I wonder if she was ever real.</p>
<p>From a distance, she shines like the sun… reminding me once again that she belongs to a world different from mine.</p>
<p>With winter break just around the corner in mid-December…</p>
<p>After finishing my second class, I headed to the cafeteria for the first time in a while. The dining hall in Building 2 was moderately crowded.</p>
<p>As I walked past a group of four female students looking for a seat, I settled down at a counter seat by the window. This is another advantage of being solo.</p>
<p>As I snapped my chopsticks, I overheard a couple sitting behind me planning a date. They sounded excited about seeing the Christmas tree at Kyoto station.</p>
<p>…Come to think of it, Christmas is just a week away.</p>
<p>After silently saying grace, someone pulled the chair next to mine. It was Houjo.</p>
<p>“Yo, Sagara.”</p>
<p>I thought ignoring him would be rude, so I casually responded, “Hey.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mind if I sit here, right? I’m already sitting anyway.”</p>
<p>“…Do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t interacted much with Houjo since I stopped talking to Nanase. It’s been a while since he last approached me like this.</p>
<p>Houjo’s tray held the daily special meal, today’s main dish being chicken nanban. I felt envious as I looked at my own plain udon, still a week away from payday.</p>
<p>“By the way, Christmas is coming up. Got any plans, Sagara?”</p>
<p>“Work.”</p>
<p>“You never change, huh? Try to schedule something fun for once. It’s Christmas, after all.”</p>
<p>“Everywhere’s crowded on Christmas, it’s the worst. I don’t get why everyone’s so excited.”</p>
<p>It’s a bad habit of the Japanese to excessively partake in events. Just like how people who never bother with it suddenly eat eel on the Day of the Ox. I choose not to be swayed by society’s trends and work as usual.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Nanase was all excited about having a Christmas party with Saki and the others. Can you say the same thing in front of Nanase?”</p>
<p>The image of Nanase, thrilled about the Christmas party with Sacchan and the others, popped into my head as if I’d actually seen it.</p>
<p>…Like I could say something that would dampen her spirits.</p>
<p>It seems Nanase’s university life is going exceptionally well. She never needed my help in the first place. As long as she’s happy, that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>The broth of my hundred-yen udon, topped with a thin piece of fried tofu, was bland and light. I grabbed the shichimi pepper from the tabletop and sprinkled it on my udon.</p>
<p>“By the way, did you know?”</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>“Nanase got confessed to recently.”</p>
<p>A chill ran down my spine, followed by a rising wave of irritation from the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>“…Oh, is that so. It’s none of my business, though…”</p>
<p>“Sagara, how much shichimi are you going to put? The soup’s turned red.”</p>
<p>Startled by Houjo’s comment, I put the shichimi back in its place. The udon in front of me had transformed into something that looked like a punishment game, but it should still be edible. Well, maybe it’s a bit too much?</p>
<p>As I grimaced at the udon, Houjo chuckled, shaking his shoulders in amusement.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so flustered.”</p>
<p>“…I’m not flustered.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter who confesses to Nanase or if she gets a boyfriend. I have no right to say anything about it.</p>
<p>Bracing myself, I took a bite of the udon and immediately choked. Yeah, maybe this is impossible.</p>
<p>“She turned him down, apparently. Said she wasn’t in the mood for that kind of thing right now.”</p>
<p>Hearing Houjo’s words, I internally breathed a sigh of relief while simultaneously wanting to punch myself for feeling relieved. Who do I think I am?</p>
<p>“Well, Christmas is coming up. There are a lot more couples around. There are probably plenty of guys eyeing Nanase.”</p>
<p>“…What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“Just saying, if you keep being stubborn, you might regret it. That’s all.”</p>
<p>I silently slurped my udon. It was too spicy, and I felt tears welling up.</p>
<p>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you if it’s too late.”</p>
<p>“…Why do you even care? What about you?”</p>
<p>I retorted, but Houjo just grinned smugly.</p>
<p>“I’m going on a date with Saki on Christmas. It’s time to settle things.”</p>
<p>I responded indifferently to Hojo’s declaration, and as I slurped the udon, I choked again when the shichimi went down the wrong pipe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><em>December 25th, Christmas night.</em></p>
<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>
<p>After seeing off the last customer, I let out a sigh. I changed the sign on the door to “Closed” and brought in the standing signboard that was placed outside.</p>
<p>On Christmas day, my part-time shift was from 19:00 to 23:00. The cafe closes at 22:00, so the remaining hour was spent cleaning the interior, washing the machines, and tidying up.</p>
<p>“The last couple really stuck around until closing, huh? They must’ve been reluctant to part ways.”</p>
<p>As I returned to the counter inside the cafe, my senior, Emi Shinozaki-san, chuckled wryly.</p>
<p>She was the beautiful elder sister I had secretly admired even before I started working here. The real Emi-san, whom I got to know, turned out to be a wonderful person who was not only competent at her job but also kind. I quickly grew to love her.</p>
<p>“Really. But man, it was busy today.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, it’s Christmas, so let’s forgive them.”</p>
<p>Near our cafe, there’s a headquarters of an electronics component manufacturer where a large-scale illumination event is held.</p>
<p>Many couples visited the cafe around 21:00. There must be a typical date routine of watching the illumination, having dinner, and then moving to a cafe.</p>
<p>Someday, I’d like to have such a wonderful date with someone I love.</p>
<p>…It would’ve been nice if that person were Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>If it were Sagara-kun, he might say, “Why bother going somewhere so crowded?” But I guess, one way or another, he’d go along with me.</p>
<p>Imagining this made me feel empty. I haven’t given up on him at all.</p>
<p>As I was feeling down secretly, Emi-san called out to me, “Haruko-chan.”</p>
<p>“Do you have plans after this? It’s late, but do you want to grab some food?”</p>
<p>“Eh, is that okay!?”</p>
<p>“It’s lonely to go home and drink alone. It’s late, but are you okay with that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll definitely go! Let’s hurry up and finish cleaning!”</p>
<p>Although Emi-san and I often have overlapping shifts, we’ve never gone out to eat or play together. Eager not to miss this opportunity, I enthusiastically started on the dishes.</p>
<p>“Emi-san and Nanase-chan, going for drinks? Can I join?”</p>
<p>Shibata-san, who had been listening from somewhere, barged into our conversation.</p>
<p>Emi-san glanced at me briefly and asked, “What do you think?” I really wanted it to be just the two of us, but I didn’t have the courage to outright refuse.</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Awesome! I know a great yakitori place. I’ll call to see if they’re open.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Shibata-san retreated to the back. Emi-san turned to me and playfully winked with one eye closed.</p>
<p>“Haruko-chan. We’ll have our alone time on another date, okay?”</p>
<p>Her wink hit me directly, and my heart was shot through. Emi-san is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>In the end, we stayed at the yakitori place eating until about 2 a.m. Shibata-san’s recommended restaurant had a great atmosphere and was delicious.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll leave here. Atsushi-kun, make sure you take Haruko-chan home safely.”</p>
<p>In front of the apartment building on Nishi-Oji Gojo, Emi-san said.</p>
<p>Emi-san had drunk quite a bit but didn’t look any different. Shibata-san, as usual, responded, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Make sure not to do anything weird to our cute, cute Haruko-chan.”</p>
<p>“I won’t, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Shibata-san laughed sheepishly. Emi-san then grabbed his collar and threatened him in an octave lower than usual.</p>
<p>“Just a warning… If you lay a hand on Haruko-chan, I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>“I got it, I got it.”</p>
<p>Shibata-san’s face turned pale, and his voice was slightly trembling.</p>
<p>We walked side by side until we reached my apartment. Seeing the shabby exterior of the apartment, Shibata-san looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Huh. Didn’t expect you to live in a place like this. Doesn’t seem like you, Nanase-chan.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for walking me home. Good work today.”</p>
<p>I bowed slightly, and Shibata-san stared at me with heated eyes. After a moment of silence, he suddenly grabbed my arm.</p>
<p>I tried to shake him off in surprise, but he was too strong for me to move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wearing a Santa Claus hat on my head, I served customers with dead eyes.</p>
<p>I operated the register with a dead heart and bowed with a blank face, saying, “Thank you very much! Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>Next to me, working the register as well, Itogawa-san was in high spirits. Her bright and friendly nature made the bright red Santa Claus hat suit her perfectly.</p>
<p>Late at night on December 25th, I naturally had a shift at work.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people eager to work on Christmas, so the manager was particularly grateful to me.</p>
<p>I wanted the money, and I had no plans, so I had no complaints about working on Christmas.</p>
<p>However, being made to wear a Santa Claus hat was unexpected. It might suit Itogawa-san, but from the customers’ perspective, a sullen man wearing a Santa hat wouldn’t be amusing at all.</p>
<p>…It might be better than being forced to stand on a beauty pageant stage wearing a panda costume.</p>
<p>The evening was unusually busy for late night, possibly due to Christmas parties happening here and there. Chicken, sweets, alcohol, and snacks were selling like hotcakes. The cake sales were moderate.</p>
<p>As I watched a couple leave with two chickens, I thought about Nanase. Maybe she’s spending Christmas with a man I don’t know about.</p>
<p>Just the thought made me feel nauseous.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m beat. Today’s super busy.”</p>
<p>When there was a break in the customers, Itogawa-san stretched and said next to me.</p>
<p>“We have quite a few cakes left over. Maybe we should mark them down a bit more.”</p>
<p>Christmas cakes are perishable, and their sales drop significantly after the 26th, so they end up being sold almost at throwaway prices. The manager had apparently instructed us to mark them down as much as possible to sell them off.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, you’re done, right? I’ll buy you a cake.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>I really think so, but Itogawa-san is incredibly considerate, even to someone as unsociable as me. Seeing me trying to get through December in just a hoodie, she couldn’t stand it and said,</p>
<p>“Here, my boyfriend got too fat to wear this, so I’m giving it to you,” giving me a black down jacket.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s too nice for her own good. Without Itogawa-san and Nanase, I feel like I would have been long dead.</p>
<p>“A whole one, can you eat it? Well, you’re young; I guess you’re still growing.”</p>
<p>I gave a wry smile at Itogawa-san’s words. Why do university students, only a few years my senior, treat younger students as if they’re much younger?</p>
<p>“I don’t eat that much sweet stuff. A small one is fine.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then, why don’t you eat it with your neighbor?”</p>
<p>I looked down silently. That’s impossible.</p>
<p>After receiving the cake from Itogawa-san, I said, “Thank you for your hard work,” and left the store.</p>
<p>The date had changed, and Christmas was long over. Couples could still be seen, but the festive atmosphere of the city seemed to have calmed down.</p>
<p>Even on Christmas, it’s just an ordinary weekday.</p>


<p>When i almost reach my apartment, I heard the sound of a man and woman arguing. Perhaps a lovers’ quarrel at this hour, I thought, feeling exasperated.</p>
<p>I intended to just walk past them, pretending not to notice.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t. Please, just go home.”</p>
<p>However, the desperate tone in the woman’s voice sounded familiar.</p>
<p>Immediately, my heart started to race with a bad premonition. I hurried toward my apartment, only to find under the streetlight a man with his arm around a woman’s shoulder.</p>
<p>My worst fears were confirmed. There stood Nanase, desperately trying to turn her face away and escape from the man. The moment I saw this, a wave of anger surged within me.</p>
<p>“Nanase!!”</p>
<p>I called her name louder than I ever had before.</p>
<p>Upon seeing me, Nanase’s eyes widened, and her expression softened with relief. Her lips moved, seemingly mouthing “Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>The appearance of a third party made the man hesitate. Nanase shook off his hand and ran to me, quickly hiding behind my back. The man clicked his tongue in annoyance.</p>
<p>“…A friend of Nanase-chan? Or her boyfriend?”</p>
<p>I hesitated on how to answer. I am neither Nanase’s friend nor her boyfriend. Just a mere neighbor who happened to pass by.</p>
<p>Nanase clung to the hem of my down jacket as if seeking salvation, her fingertips turning white. Seeing this, I made up my mind.</p>
<p>“…I’m her boyfriend.”</p>
<p>The man seemed intimidated and took a step back. Seizing the opportunity, I slipped past him, took Nanase’s hand, and climbed the stairs to my apartment.</p>
<p>Feeling it would be bad for Nanase’s room to be discovered, I pushed her into my room instead. After locking the door behind us, I finally let out a breath of relief.</p>
<p>In the dim room, Nanase was trembling. It surely wasn’t just from the cold.</p>
<p>“Who was that earlier?”</p>
<p>“A senior… from work…”</p>
<p>“Was he hitting on you?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that, but…”</p>
<p>If it wasn’t like that, then what was it? The way he touched her clearly had ulterior motives. Just recalling the scene made my blood boil.</p>
<p>“Nanase, you’re always smiling, making you an easy target for those types. You should brush them off more firmly.”</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase’s eyes welled up with tears. She looked down, biting her lower lip hard.</p>
<p>I realized I had gone too far. It sounded as if the problem lay with Nanase, but the fault was entirely that man’s.</p>
<p>“…Ah, no, sorry. It’s not that Nanase is to blame.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, Nanase wiped her eyes and slowly began to talk.</p>
<p>“We were eating dinner, the three of us from work. It wasn’t just the two of us. He was walking me home, but then suddenly, he said he wanted to come into my room.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to refuse, but he grabbed my arm. He was so strong, I couldn’t shake him off…”</p>
<p>…That damn bastard.</p>
<p>Just hearing about it made my anger boil over again. Maybe I should have called the police.</p>
<p>Nanase, looking up with red eyes, sniffled.</p>
<p>“I was scared… Thank you for saving me…”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to see her crying, especially since it had been a while since we last faced each other directly. Come to think of it, I’ve only been seeing Nanase cry lately.</p>
<p>No, last time, it was me who made her cry. Remembering that, my chest hurt with guilt.</p>
<p>Do I even have the right to comfort her now?</p>
<p>Slowly reaching out to Nanase’s back, I gently patted her. Her fragile body was still trembling slightly. After a while, Nanase looked up at me with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. I have a request.”</p>
<p>“Depends on what it is.”</p>
<p>“…Can I hug you?”</p>
<p>“…W-What!?!”</p>
<p>I inadvertently stepped back and hit the back of my head hard against the door. A loud “Gon!” sound echoed, followed by a dull pain.</p>
<p>…What is she thinking?</p>
<p>It’s late at night, we’re alone in my room, and she was almost attacked by a man just moments ago. She’s seriously lacking in self-preservation.</p>
<p>“Don’t say something so stupid!”</p>
<p>“But, I won’t be able to sleep feeling grossed out if I go back to my room now. I kind of want to… overwrite those feelings with you, Sagara-kun…”</p>
<p>Wait a minute, she’s saying something outrageous. Does she understand the meaning of her own words?</p>
<p>How does she think I’d react? My head started to spin from the implications.</p>
<p>Nanase looked down dejectedly, seeing my panic.</p>
<p>“…Sorry. I know it’s troubling for you to hear this…”</p>
<p>…That’s the problem, it’s not troubling at all.</p>
<p>I pondered. It was an unreasonable request, but it seemed cruel to send her back still trembling.</p>
<p>Damn it, what am I even thinking? Just think of it as a stroke of luck and go for it.</p>
<p>My reason and instincts were at war inside my head. Enough, be quiet.</p>
<p>“…Then, just for ten seconds.”</p>
<p>I had succumbed to my own desires. But strictly ten seconds. Any longer, and I wouldn’t trust my own restraint.</p>
<p>As I spread my arms, Nanase’s face lit up.</p>
<p>“Really? Can I?”</p>
<p>“Just hurry up. This is embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, excuse me!”</p>
<p>After politely saying so, Nanase threw herself into my embrace.</p>
<p>Her slender arms wrapped around my back. Even through the thick down jacket, I could feel the softness of her body. A sweet scent tickled my nose, causing my body temperature to soar and my heartbeat to quicken.</p>
<p>I could feel my blood rushing from the top of my head to my toes at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>Nanase closed her eyes and rested her head against my chest. Unconsciously, my arms moved.</p>
<p>I wanted to hug her.</p>
<p>I forcibly expelled such instincts from my mind. Grabbing Nanase’s shoulders, I roughly pulled her away.</p>
<p>“Time’s up, ten seconds have passed. It’s over.”</p>
<p>Trying to sound calm, Nanase reluctantly pulled away. Her cheeks flushed, she shyly looked at me.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sagara-kun. I managed to overwrite it.”</p>
<p>…As if she knows what the guy she just hugged was thinking. She has the nerve to thank me.</p>
<p>The heat in my cheeks wouldn’t cool down. The sound of my own heart was deafening.</p>
<p>The thought of someone else holding her, so soft and sweet-smelling, filled me with an unbearable sense of distress.</p>
<p>At that moment, I became painfully aware of my own selfish desires. Yet, I swallowed them and picked up a convenience store bag.</p>
<p>“…Nanase. Let’s eat Christmas cake together. It’s just the leftovers from work, though.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I want to! I’d love to!”</p>
<p>Nanase said, smiling without any hesitation.</p>
<p>I turned on the room’s light and switched on the old electric heater in the corner.</p>
<p>The cold was harsh as ever, but perhaps being together made it slightly warmer.</p>
<p>Nanase neatly sliced the cake and placed it on plates. On the table, there were just convenience store cakes and two cups of tea.</p>
<p>It was a far from a Christmas party. I should have at least bought some drinks.</p>
<p>Nanase took a bite of the cake and her expression brightened.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious!”</p>
<p>“…It’s just a convenience store cake, sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m happy. Convenience store sweets these days are amazing!”</p>
<p>Nanase, with graceful movements, brought the fork to her mouth. Her lips, curved into a happy smile, were as red as the strawberries on the cake.</p>
<p>As I was mesmerized by her, our eyes met, and my heart threatened to race again.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun… Thank you for today. I’m sorry for saying strange things. I’ll try to sort out my feelings quickly.”</p>
<p>Nanase said, awkwardly lifting the corners of her mouth. The painful smile stabbed at my conscience.</p>
<p>To be honest, there’s nothing wrong with Nanase. The only reason I can’t accept her feelings is because of my own troublesome nature.</p>
<p>“…It’s not that you’re at fault, Nanase. This is… my problem.”</p>
<p>“What problem?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t say anything more. I had never revealed my inner feelings to anyone, so I couldn’t find the right words.</p>
<p>Nanase seemed to give up on my answer and started eating the cake again. “It’s delicious,” she smiled at me, and I nodded honestly.</p>
<p>Why does a leftover convenience store cake eaten in a rundown apartment late at night taste so good? I already know the answer.</p>
<p>“Is it snowing? No wonder it felt so cold.”</p>
<p>Nanase stood up and looked out the window. In the darkness of the night, white snowflakes were gently falling. It was already past midnight, so it was a called White Christmas.</p>
<p>“It’s the first time I’ve seen snow falling since I came to Kyoto. It’s the first snow of the year.”</p>
<p>Nanase turned to me with a soft smile. The moment I saw that expression, the selfish desire I had just acknowledged resurfaced.</p>
<p>…I don’t want Nanase to be with any other guy.</p>
<p>If I said that out loud, Sudo would probably punch me. With inner turmoil and the sweet and sour taste of strawberries, I swallowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Christmas has ended, and the university is on winter break. I’m sitting at my desk in my room, working on a report.</p>
<p>I’m in my bare face with glasses, wearing a jersey with a hanten over it. It’s not a look I’d show anyone, but it’s the most comfortable style for studying.</p>
<p>While I’m busily typing on the keyboard, the intercom rings, “Ping-pong.” As a minimal act of resistance, I put on a large mask before opening the door slightly.</p>
<p>“Delivery service. Please sign here.”</p>
<p>I sign with the pen and receive a large package. The sender is my mother from home. The cardboard box is marked with [Relief Supplies] in black marker.</p>
<p>Even after coming to Kyoto, I occasionally receive packages like this from home. Inside are rice, vegetables, instant miso soup, cup noodles, and my favorite snacks.</p>
<p>This time, along with those items, there was a Christmas limited edition coffret from a brand I’ve always admired. The handwriting that says [To Haruko, a Christmas present] belonged to my beloved older sister. My heart leaps at the sight of the colorful eyeshadows and blushes.</p>
<p>After sending a thank you LINE message to my parents and cousin, I walk to the window.</p>
<p>I open the curtains and gaze absent-mindedly outside. It seems Sagara-kun has gone to work today. I wonder if he’ll be coming back soon, unconsciously searching for his figure.</p>
<p>It’s nearly midnight. At this hour, I can’t even offer to bring him dinner. That means I lose a reason to go see him.</p>
<p>I wish we could have the kind of relationship where I can see him anytime I want, without needing a reason.</p>
<p>How audacious of me to think that, especially after being turned down.</p>
<p>…What exactly is at the core of Sagara-kun’s solo living philosophy?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the first time Sagara-kun rejected me was when I talked about my family. Perhaps the problem he’s facing is related to that.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun is still closing off his heart, trying to live alone without involving anyone.</p>
<p>If Sagara-kun truly wishes for a solo living world, I think that’s fine. If he genuinely wants to be alone from the bottom of his heart, (though it’s sad) I have no intention of interfering.</p>
<p>…But. The thought of Sagara-kun suffering… I hate it.</p>
<p>Even when he pushed me away, saying he couldn’t accept me, or when he said, “This is my problem,” Sagara-kun always seemed to be in pain.</p>
<p>Even if I became a sparkling girl, made lots of friends, and had fun days, if Sagara-kun isn’t smiling, my university life surely wouldn’t be rosy.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun said he would cooperate with me to protect his solo university life. Then, I will help Sagara-kun to obtain my rosy university life.</p>
<p>At that moment, I saw Sagara-kun’s figure illuminated by the streetlight outside the window.</p>
<p>He was wearing a black down jacket, blending into the night, but somehow, my eyes always find him.</p>
<p>Unable to stay put, I rush out of my room and greet Sagara-kun, who is coming up the stairs, with a “Welcome back!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my way back from work, I glanced at the remaining calls on my smartphone and involuntarily held my breath.</p>
<p>I stopped and leaned against a telephone pole, using my numb fingers to operate the smartphone and check the history.</p>
<p>The caller was my mother. There were three calls in total, one every hour. It’s the first time she’s called so frequently since I left home.</p>
<p>The unpleasant thought that it might be an accident or illness caused unrest in my heart. The current time is 22:00, my mother is probably still awake.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, I tapped the call button from her number.</p>
<p>“Souhei? Are you doing well?”</p>
<p>Mother picked up after one ring, her voice tense and slightly stiff.</p>
<p>Even after I left home, my mother called a few times. However, those exchanges were awkward, filled with uncomfortable silences, and ended in an uneasy atmosphere.</p>
<p>I’ve forgotten what it’s like to have a casual closeness with family.</p>
<p>“Is there something you needed?”</p>
<p>“Well, Souhei… are you coming home for winter break?”</p>
<p>“…Ah. I have work, so it’s difficult.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie that I have work. But to be honest, I had no intention of going home.</p>
<p>My mother is now living with her new partner. If I go back, I’d probably just be in the way. In fact, I haven’t seen my mother once since leaving home. I wasn’t asked to come back for Golden Week or summer break.</p>
<p>But unusually, my mother didn’t back down.</p>
<p>“…Can’t you come back, just for a little while? I’ll pay for your trip.”</p>
<p>“…But…”</p>
<p>“Listen, Souhei. Actually, there’s something important your mother has to tell you.”</p>
<p>Even over the phone, I could sense the strong will in her voice. That’s when I finally understood her intention.</p>
<p>Ah, I see. It’s not that she wants to see me.</p>
<p>“Mom. Are you getting remarried?”</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end of the phone at my question. After a while, I could hear her sigh.</p>
<p>“…This isn’t something to discuss over the phone.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Check your schedule again and get back to me. Good night, Souhei. Don’t catch a cold.”</p>
<p>With that, the call ended in the usual awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>I shoved my smartphone back into my down jacket’s pocket and started walking again.</p>
<p>The cold wind howled fiercely, making my ears painfully cold.</p>
<p>As I was going up the stairs to my apartment, Nanase rushed out of her room. Nanase, in her bare-faced glasses and hanten, lit up with joy upon seeing me. (tln : A <em>hanten</em> (袢纏) is a short winter coat and an item of traditional Japanese clothing.)</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun! Welcome back!”</p>
<p>The moment I saw her face, I felt a sense of relief, but I hid that feeling and shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t come out at this time.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun coming home, I saw it from the window.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t expected her to be watching. Maybe she was waiting for me.</p>
<p>…I can’t say I’m glad to see her face because I was feeling down. Saying something so suggestive would surely confuse her.</p>
<p>Looking at Nanase’s innocently smiling face, I scratch my head in confusion.</p>
<p>“…? Sagara-kun, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Noticing my gloomy expression, Nanase asks with concern. Hesitating, I finally speak up.</p>
<p>“…Nanase, are you going home for winter break?”</p>
<p>“Ah? Yeah, I’m planning to.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t you not want to go back to your hometown?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine now,” Nanase stated firmly, showing no signs of forcing herself.</p>
<p>I replied with a short “I see,” and looked down.</p>
<p>Nanase has stopped dwelling on the past and is trying to move forward. It’s only me who’s still stuck.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun, are you going home?”</p>
<p>Nanase timidly asked. I kept my gaze down, staring at the tips of my sneakers.</p>


<p>I know I should go back. Despite being a minor and technically under my parents’ guardianship, I haven’t received any financial support from them at this point.</p>
<p>But if something were to happen in the future, I might end up causing trouble for my mother. Maybe I can’t keep rejecting my home forever.</p>
<p>…Still, I…</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go back.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“My mother, she’s getting remarried.”</p>
<p>Nanase gasps softly. With a self-deprecating laugh, I say,</p>
<p>“Even if I go back, I’ll just be in the way.”</p>
<p>Nanase blinks and then looks down. Silence falls between us for a while.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>After a moment, Nanase takes both of my hands in hers and grips them tightly. The chill from outside slowly melts away in the warmth of her hands. Looking straight into my eyes, Nanase says,</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you properly go back home and talk with your mom?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really understand… but your family circumstances are related to why you insist on being alone, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase continues in a tone like she’s gently scolding a child,</p>
<p>“…To solve a problem, facing it head-on is important, I think. Otherwise, Sagara-kun… you’ll never be able to move forward.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t say things so irresponsibly. You don’t know anything…”</p>
<p>I regret the words as soon as they come out, realizing it’s just me lashing out. But Nanase doesn’t flinch and keeps looking straight at me.</p>
<p>“Yes, I don’t know. Because Sagara-kun, you won’t tell me anything.”</p>
<p>I’m at a loss for words… She’s right.</p>
<p>“If Sagara-kun is anxious, I’ll go back with you.”</p>
<p>“…Eh, what?”</p>
<p>Her unexpected offer leaves me wide-eyed. Nanase’s eyes, gazing at me, are shining brightly, filled with strong determination, making me slightly recoil.</p>
<p>“Go back together, you mean…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, I won’t intrude. I’ll just accompany you part of the way.”</p>
<p>“…But…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, right? Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Such audacity. Where did the girl who was scared to invite friends because she feared rejection go?</p>
<p>“Understood…”</p>
<p>Half-pushed into agreeing, Nanase beams and extends her pinky.</p>
<p>“Then, it’s a promise.”</p>
<p>Hesitantly, our pinkies intertwine, and she grips firmly. The cheerful sound of “pinky promise” oddly comforts me, despite thinking, we’re not kids anymore. Yet, it somewhat soothes my feelings.</p>
<p>The next day, as if in a hurry to do good, Nanase takes me to the station. We board the express bus at Kyoto Station, heading to Nagoya, where my hometown is.</p>
<p>On the bus, we hardly exchange words, mostly gazing out the window.</p>
<p>When we arrive at Nagoya Station, light snowflakes are fluttering down. I remember seeing a headline on the net, warning of a severe cold wave this weekend.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, will you take a bus to your home?”</p>
<p>Nanase asks. After I tell her the closest bus stop, she says, “That’s the same line as mine,” while breathing out white puffs of air.</p>
<p>It takes about thirty minutes by local bus to get to my home.</p>
<p>Although I resolved to face my mother properly, as the scenery outside the window shifts, my heart sinks heavily like a lump of lead.</p>
<p>My reflection on the bus window looks more stern than usual, with deep wrinkles between my eyebrows. As we draw closer to our destination, the snowfall gradually intensifies.</p>
<p>Nanase, sitting next to me, silently stares straight ahead with her back straight. I wonder what she’s thinking right now.</p>
<p>Then, the bus announcement informs us of the next stop.</p>
<p>“…This is where we get off.”</p>
<p>As I stand, Nanase says, “Then, I’ll go too,” and follows behind me.</p>
<p>The bus stop closest to my home is right in front of the elementary school I attended. The candy store across the street has closed down, now turned into a parking lot. Not all my memories in this town are bad, and I do feel a sense of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Yet, i just couldn’t shake the feeling of depression.</p>
<p>The asphalt is lightly covered in snow, making a soft, crunching sound with every step. Neither Nanase nor I speak. The cold wind howls fiercely.</p>
<p>We arrive at my family home after about a five-minute walk. It’s a small, single-family house that my parents bought just before I was born.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine now, but they must have been a happy couple back then. My father has left this house, and my mother now lives with another man.</p>
<p>I hesitate to press the intercom.</p>
<p>What should I say to my mother after such a long time? Maybe I shouldn’t have come back. Thoughts like these circle my mind, rendering me immobile.</p>
<p>“Um, excuse me.”</p>
<p>Startled by a voice from behind, I hastily turn around. A girl in a sailor uniform with a duffle coat and her black hair in a ponytail stands there.</p>
<p>“Do you need something at my house?”</p>
<p>I’m shocked when the unfamiliar girl refers to my family home as “my house,” but then realization dawns on me.</p>
<p>…That’s right. My mother’s partner has a high school-aged daughter.</p>
<p>“…Ah, no. …It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I mumble and quickly leave. The girl’s puzzled gaze pierces my back. I must seem like a suspicious person.</p>
<p>I stop when I reach a nearby park. Suddenly, I hear, “Sagara-kun!” from behind and flinch. I had completely forgotten about Nanase.</p>
<p>“Sa, Sagara-kun, wait… Ah!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Nanase slips on the snow and falls dramatically. I rush over to help her up.</p>
<p>“Nanase. Are… Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Nanase insists she’s okay, but her dress is stained from the snow and mud, her black tights torn at the knee, oozing blood. I feel terrible.</p>
<p>“…Nanase, sorry… I…”</p>
<p>As I speak, Nanase shakes her head. I’m disgusted with myself for running away after coming this far. But I couldn’t muster the courage to confront that place.</p>
<p>Surely, there’s a happy family there that I don’t know.</p>
<p>“I can’t go back. It’s impossible for me.”</p>
<p>Nanase looks down sadly at my words. Perhaps she’s appalled by my cowardice at this point. It’s only natural for her to be disillusioned by my pathetic state.</p>
<p>“…Can’t go back… So, what do we do? There are no buses back to Kyoto now.”</p>
<p>Confusion seeps into Nanase’s voice. I think for a moment and then say, “We’ll find somewhere to stay.”</p>
<p>“Somewhere like? A hotel?”</p>
<p>Upon further thought, I realize I don’t have enough money for a hotel before payday. As I stay silent, Nanase stands up decisively.</p>
<p>“…Alright. I’ve decided.”</p>
<p>With a determined look, Nanase grips my hand tightly</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“…Where?”</p>
<p>“My family home. If you don’t want to go back, you can stay at my place for tonight.”</p>
<p>“…W-what?… Huh!?”</p>
<p>I let out a dumbfounded cry. Wait a minute, what kind of development is this?</p>
<p>Nanase firmly holding my hand, marches ahead.</p>
<p>I follow her, still in shock, but unable to do anything but follow her lead.</p>
<hr />
<p>tln : man, even though he’s working his bone off, but still he can’t spare any money because he paying all of his bill.</p>


<p>About five minutes by bus from my family home, Nanase said,</p>
<p>“This is where we get off.”</p>
<p>On our way to her house, we passed an elderly woman. It seemed like they knew each other</p>
<p>Nanase greeted her with a smile, saying, “Good evening.” Thinking it rude to just pass by, I also nodded silently in greeting.</p>
<p>The woman returned the greeting with a “Good evening,” but her expression was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>She probably didn’t recognize Nanase. Given how different Nanase looks compared to her high school days, it’s no surprise.</p>
<p>Nanase, however, didn’t seem to mind and kept walking.</p>
<p>She stopped in front of a small single-family house in the middle of a residential area.</p>
<p>“…Hey. Is it really okay for me to come here so suddenly?”</p>
<p>When I think about it calmly, it’s incredibly impertinent. If I had a daughter who suddenly brought home a stranger, I might punch him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll explain everything properly,” Nanase said with a smile, but my anxiety wasn’t eased at all.</p>
<p>How exactly is she planning to explain?</p>
<p>“This guy kept giving me mixed signals, eventually turned me down, and on top of that, whined about not wanting to go back to his family home, so I brought him here”?</p>
<p>If it were me, I wouldn’t stop at just punching such a guy.</p>
<p>Nanase unlocked the door, calling out, “I’m home!” The house was dimly lit, and there was no response from anyone.</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s odd… maybe they went shopping?”</p>
<p>“Nanase… did you actually tell your parents you’d be coming home today?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Nanase pressed a hand to her mouth and said, “Ah.”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I got carried away and forgot to tell them about it.”</p>
<p>“Ha!? You, you should’ve said something about that…!”</p>
<p>“I’ll give them a call now! For now, come inside!”</p>
<p>Pushing on my back, Nanase urged me into the living room. The lights were off, and it was chilly inside. Clearly, no one was home.</p>
<p>I took off my down jacket and hesitantly sat down on the sofa. Nanase took out her smartphone and started calling her parents.</p>
<p>“…Ah, Mom? Actually, I’m back home right now… Oh, really? Okay, got it. Um, I brought a friend with me, it’s okay to let him stay over, right?”</p>
<p>After a while, Nanase hung up, her eyebrows furrowed in slight trouble.</p>
<p>“Um… my dad and mom are at my grandma’s in Mikawa.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“They said they’re staying over, so they won’t be coming home today.”</p>
<p>…Which means, we’ll be alone here tonight.</p>
<p>I stood up, saying, “I’m going home,” and started putting my down jacket back on. Nanase, in a fluster, tried to stop me.</p>
<p>“Wa, wait! That’s not okay! After coming all this way.”</p>
<p>Nanase gripped the hem of my down jacket firmly, refusing to let go. Cutting off my “But,” she spoke rapidly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I got permission from my mom. You should stay. We have a guest room too. You can sleep there after laying out the futon. Okay?”</p>
<p>Nanase’s desperate demeanor made me wonder what exactly was “okay” about this. However, the truth was, I had no other option.</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>As I reluctantly agreed, Nanase breathed a sigh of relief, then flushed and tugged at the collar of her mud-stained dress.</p>
<p>“…So, can I take a bath first? I got all dirty when I fell earlier…”</p>
<p>…Perhaps I should have left immediately. But it was already too late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite being in the familiar changing room, I felt a slight tension the moment I started undressing. I knew why. Sagara-kun was under the same roof.</p>
<p>I had shoved Sagara-kun into my room on the second floor. Physically speaking, the distance might be closer than in our usual apartment.</p>
<p>Yet, getting completely undressed in this situation made me nervous. Not that I was worried about anything in particular, but I locked the door to the changing room just in case.</p>
<p>With a determined effort, I stripped off my clothes and tossed them into the laundry basket. I entered the bathroom, twisted the faucet, and waited for the water to warm up.</p>
<p>After ensuring it was sufficiently hot, I first removed my makeup, then showered from head to toe. I lathered up with a foaming net, washing my body.</p>
<p>When the hot water hit the scraped knee, it stung a bit, making me frown slightly.</p>
<p>Could it be… that I’m doing something outrageous?</p>
<p>The thought of my own forcefulness hitting me now made me cringe and squat down on the spot.</p>
<p>To think I dragged him all the way to Nagoya and then to my family home on a whim. Perhaps Sagara-kun is completely put off by me right now.</p>
<p>But I just couldn’t leave him alone.</p>
<p>When I saw Sagara-kun’s pale face fleeing from his family home, gasping, “I can’t go back,” I thought I couldn’t leave this person alone.</p>
<p>There might be nothing I can do for Sagara-kun right now. Yet, I wanted to be by his side.</p>
<p>…Turns out, I’m far more assertive than I thought.</p>
<p>I had never realized this side of myself until I fell in love with Sagara-kun. I used to be passive and timid, unable to even invite friends over to play.</p>
<p>Or rather. Tonight, I’m going to spend the night alone with Sagara-kun here.</p>
<p>I never imagined my “first sleepover” would turn out like this. After all, he turned me down, and I’m not expecting anything to happen. But still, I found myself washing more carefully than usual.</p>

<p>When I cleared the steamed-up mirror with the shower, my naked reflection appeared. Suddenly, I started worrying about my figure.</p>
<p>My chest is naturally decent-sized, not particularly small, but I’ve never compared it to others, so I’m not sure. I wonder if my stomach looks okay, if my makeup-free face is too plain and unremarkable.</p>
<p>…Ah. I should’ve prepared some cute pajamas at least.</p>
<p>With such minor regrets, I left the bathroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right now, I’m at Nanase’s family house, sitting alone in her room on the second floor, waiting for her to finish showering. I’m sitting in seiza.</p>
<p>What kind of situation is this, I wonder, feeling the urge to hold my head in my hands. I never imagined I’d find myself in such a scenario.</p>
<p>The sight of the bed, pushed up against the wall, only adds to my awkwardness. It’s probably better than waiting downstairs, but being here is still quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Feeling restless, I look around the room. It’s neatly tidied, not a speck of dust in sight, clearly indicating that Nanase’s family regularly cleans it.</p>
<p>It feels different from the room at our apartment in Kyoto, which is practically being suffocated by a giant closet, leaving no space for anything unnecessary.</p>
<p>There’s a study desk, a bookshelf, and a bed. A single chest of drawers. By the window, there’s a small music box. The bookshelf is crammed with reference books, dictionaries, and encyclopedias, with hardly any manga or novels in sight.</p>
<p>Despite being a library committee member, it seems she’s not much of a reader. However, she does have a surprising collection of children’s books, with titles like “Elmer’s Adventure” and “Momo” lined up at the bottom of the shelf.</p>
<p>Has Nanase spent her entire childhood in this room?</p>
<p>There aren’t any of the so-called feminine, cute interior decorations. Yet, I feel this space, overflowing with Haruko Nanase’s essence, is incredibly comforting.</p>
<p>Among the items on the bookshelf, there’s also a high school graduation album. Come to think of it, I left home on the day of our graduation and never looked through the album.</p>
<p>There probably aren’t many photos of me in it, but I find myself wanting to see Nanase from our high school days.</p>
<p>The moment I pull out the album, a notebook that was next to it falls out. I think “Oops” and reach down to pick it up—then I stop.</p>
<p>The page it’s opened to is filled with Nanase’s handwriting. It details what kind of clothes, shoes, and bags to pair together. Notes about skin tones that match certain colors, clothing that suits her frame, makeup techniques, and color usage. There are also some not-so-great illustrations in the margins.</p>
<p>This notebook is likely—the record of Nanase’s efforts for her college debut.</p>
<p>Nanase worked so hard to change herself, and here I am, stuck in the same place, unable to take even a step forward.</p>
<p>I close the notebook and carefully place it back where I found it. Just then, I hear Nanase coming up the stairs. Startled, I quickly sit back in seiza.</p>
<p>The door opens, and Nanase pops her head in.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait. Sagara-kun, you should take a bath too.”</p>
<p>Nanase, fresh from the bath, is makeup-free, her cheeks slightly flushed, wearing simple pajamas, with the tips of her hair still a bit damp. I hurriedly avert my gaze from her and nod.</p>
<p>After borrowing the bath and having dinner in the dining room, Nanase suggests, “It’s a bit early, but let’s go to bed.” The air suddenly becomes awkward. But I manage to keep my composure.</p>
<p>Nanase shows me to the guest room on the first floor. It seems she prepared the futon while I was in the bath.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, then.”</p>
<p>I say “Goodnight” and turn my back to Nanase. The lights go off, and I hear her footsteps going upstairs. She’ll be sleeping in her own room.</p>
<p>The pillow is a bit firmer than what I’m used to. There’s a fresh scent in the air. The ticking of the clock is unusually loud.</p>
<p>I toss and turn, feeling somewhat suffocated, struggling to breathe properly.</p>
<p>Forcing my eyes shut, I drift off for a bit, but when I check my smartphone by the pillow, not even two hours have passed.</p>
<p>Unable to sleep, I leave the guest room and return to the living room. Without turning on the lights, I sit on the sofa and stare up at the dim ceiling.</p>
<p>…What should I do?</p>
<p>I’m always halfway about everything, whether it’s home or Nanase. I understand that I can’t continue like this, but—what would change if I confronted my mother now?</p>
<p>Would it only confirm that I have no place there?</p>
<p>As I ponder, I hear the sound of someone coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>Nanase, in pajamas with a blanket draped over her, calls my name. I silently turn my gaze towards her.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I just got a bit thirsty…”</p>
<p>Nanase says, then heads to the kitchen to pour herself some mineral water. After drinking it, she comes over and sits down next to me with a soft thud.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, what about you? Can’t sleep?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit cold here, right? Let’s share the blanket.”</p>
<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00017-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Saying so, Nanase drapes the blanket over my knees. The moment our shoulders lightly touch, a sweet scent wafts over, making my heart race.</p>
<p>The warmth from Nanase’s body, right next to mine, feels far more comforting than the fluffy blanket.</p>
<p>She said she was thirsty, but Nanase probably came down because she was worried about me. She’s that kind of person, always caring for others…unlike me.</p>
<p>“Hey…can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun…why don’t you want to go back home?”</p>
<p>It’s a question that cuts to the core. But I can’t bring myself to push her away anymore. I look away from Nanase, staring down as I mumble my reply.</p>
<p>“My mom…she has her own happiness now. There’s no place for me there…and I don’t really want one.”</p>
<p>“…Do you really believe that?”</p>
<p>“…Not having a place…being alone…it’s easier, isn’t it? If it means not hurting or being hurt by someone…I’d rather be alone forever.”</p>
<p>In the quiet, dimly lit living room, my voice sounds pathetically alone.</p>
<p>Then Nanase whispers, almost inaudibly,</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun. Were you actually lonely?”</p>
<p>Caught off guard, I inadvertently look at her. Her makeup-free eyes, softer than usual, gaze at me tenderly.</p>
<p>“Interacting with people is scary, isn’t it? After entering university…I’ve been hurt and faced hardships far beyond what I could’ve imagined in high school.”</p>
<p>“…Uh. S-sorry.”</p>
<p>I blurt out an apology reflexively. But she just smiles and leans in to look at me.</p>
<p>“But, you know. I’m glad I had the courage to expand my world. Sure, there were tough times…but I made friends, fell in love…and experienced many more happy and fun moments.”</p>
<p>“Nanase…”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Because of Sagara-kun, my university life became really enjoyable. So now…I want to help make Sagara-kun smile.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s words warmly seep into my heart. She’s trying so hard to encourage me, to push me forward.</p>
<p>As I remain silent, Nanase, as if making a decision, clenches her lips and wraps her arms around my back, gently leaning against me.</p>
<p>“…Huh!?”</p>
<p>I meant to protest, but no sound came out. My blood races through my veins at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>The body touching mine feels unbelievably soft, not like another person at all.</p>
<p>I can almost imagine the smoothness of the skin just beyond the thin layer of fabric, and I involuntarily swallow.</p>
<p>Her chestnut hair tickles my cheek. We both feel each other’s loud heartbeats.</p>
<p>Just as my reason is about to fly away, I notice Nanase’s body trembling slightly. Her tense form conveys her nervousness, and that finally cools my head.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s okay, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>“…Hey. You don’t have to force yourself…for someone like me…”</p>
<p>Why does she go to such lengths for me? I’m not worth the kindness and effort of such a caring, hardworking girl like Nanase.</p>
<p>Nanase looks up, her eyes moist, gazing steadily at me.</p>
<p>“…So, please don’t look like that…”</p>
<p>“What kind of face am I making?” I start to ask when a droplet falls onto the blanket.</p>
<p>It takes me a few seconds to realize it’s from my own eyes. The back of my hand, used to wipe my cheek, is wet.</p>
<p>Huh. Why am I crying?</p>
<p>I thought I was fine being alone. I thought I didn’t need anyone. Yet now, enveloped in a warmth that isn’t mine, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief.</p>
<p>…Ah, I see. I’ve been lonely all this time.</p>
<p>“Sorry…just a little longer, stay like this.”</p>
<p>I know it’s pathetic to say, but Nanase nods.</p>
<p>I bury my face in her slender shoulder, and a few more tears escape from me.</p>


<p>The moment I woke up, Nanase’s sleeping face was right in front of me.</p>
<p>At close range, her peaceful breathing almost stopped my heart. I was suprised and rolled off the sofa in a big way.</p>
<p>I hit my head hard on the table. A dull thud echoed.</p>
<p>As I writhed, holding my head, Nanase stirred and murmured, “Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun. Good morning…”</p>
<p>Nanase, now awake, gave me a smile. The moment I saw that smile, everything else seemed trivial.</p>
<p>Rubbing my head, I replied, “…Good morning.”</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“…I’m disappointed in myself for being able to sleep so well.”</p>
<p>I felt refreshed, maybe because I had slept so soundly. How could I sleep so carelessly in such a situation? Maybe I was thicker-skinned than I thought.</p>
<p>“That’s good.”</p>
<p>Nanase stood up from the sofa, making a swift sound as she opened the curtains.</p>
<p>“Let’s go buy breakfast at the bakery nearby. Their cream bread is delicious.”</p>
<p>Beyond the window, the sky was a clear blue. Her chestnut hair reflected the sun, sparkling. It felt strangely dazzling, and I squinted my eyes.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Nanase and I took the city bus to my parents’ house. Getting off the bus, I told Nanase, “This is fine.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back soon after talking to my mom… Wait for me at a café or somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I understand. Take care.”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled softly and waved goodbye.</p>
<p>…Nanase has done so much for me… I’ve been so selfish.</p>
<p>Pushing Nanase away with my selfish reasons. Afraid of getting hurt, I’ve been running away from her feelings and mine. I know that can’t continue.</p>
<p>To face Nanase’s feelings head-on, I must first confront and resolve my own issues.</p>
<p>I straightened my back and walked toward my parents’ house.</p>
<p>There’s a small park on the way from the bus stop to my house, where Nanase fell yesterday. I remember, as a child, I fell from the jungle gym and had to get stitches on the back of my head.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the incident, but I recall my mother saying, “I was so scared at that moment.”</p>
<p>…The memories I’ve been avoiding might not all be bad.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I arrived at my parents’ house. I was nervous, but I didn’t feel like running away as I did yesterday.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Souhei.”</p>
<p>My mother appeared at the door. She seemed a bit plumper than I remembered, and her complexion was good. Not knowing how to react, I stood there with my hands stuffed in my down jacket pockets.</p>
<p>“It’s cold, come inside. Was the trip okay?”</p>
<p>I entered the house as prompted. It was warm inside.</p>
<p>The guest slippers prepared at the entrance weren’t the ones I used to use but brand new ones, feeling stiff and uncomfortable. Although this was undoubtedly the house I grew up in, it felt strangely unfamiliar.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you come back yesterday?”</p>
<p>My mother’s voice didn’t sound accusatory but rather worried about me.</p>
<p>“Ah… sorry. Um, I was at a friend’s house…”</p>
<p>“Ichika-chan, mentioned seeing someone who looked like you.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t lie, so I vaguely nodded.</p>
<p>My mother looked at me intently, then muttered with genuine relief.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you came.”</p>
<p>Surprised by her unexpected words, I asked, “Ah?” My mother looked down and continued softly.</p>
<p>“I hardly ever get calls from you. And you don’t accept the money I send.”</p>
<p>“That’s because…”</p>
<p>“I thought you wouldn’t come back here.”</p>
<p>My mother’s voice trembled slightly, then she turned her back to me.</p>
<p>When I apologized, I heard her sniffle. She was crying, something she never did, even when things were tough with my father.</p>
<p>I finally realized that before being my mother, she was a person with her own feelings.</p>
<p>Quickly wiping her eyes, my mother turned to me, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s okay. Will you stay for dinner? How about fried chicken?”</p>
<p>Fried chicken was my favorite. My mother still remembered what I liked.</p>
<p>“Mom…”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever regretted having me?”</p>
<p>It was a question I had been too afraid to ask, fearing the affirmation.</p>
<p>My mother hesitated for a moment at my abrupt question, then looked away, ashamed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Souhei. I said terrible things to you… ”</p>
<p>“If only Souhei had never been born…”</p>
<p>Those words, spoken during an argument with my father, had clung to me like a curse.</p>
<p>“I can’t excuse it, but… I was struggling every day back then, with no other choices.”</p>
<p>I nodded. Now, I could understand. A mother is also a person. It’s possible to say something you don’t mean when you’re overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“I understand if you can’t forgive me. But let me say this.”</p>
<p>My mother paused, then looked directly at me and said firmly.</p>
<p>“The idea that I regretted having you… There’s no way that’s true.”</p>
<p>At that moment, it felt as if a thorn that had been lodged in my heart was gently pulled out.</p>
<p>This might no longer be my place, but I knew my mother still loved me. Just knowing that made coming here worthwhile.</p>
<p>“Mom… Congratulations on your remarriage.”</p>
<p>At my words, my mother smiled and said, “Thank you.” It was a genuinely happy smile I hadn’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p>After a bit more conversation with my mother, I put on my down jacket and said, “I should be going.”</p>
<p>“You could stay a little longer.”</p>
<p>“No, today… I’ve kept a friend waiting.”</p>
<p>My mother looked slightly disappointed but didn’t insist.</p>
<p>“I’ll come again properly next time… to greet… the person you’re remarrying.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, my mother nodded happily. Although I don’t plan to return often, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to visit once in a while.</p>
<p>I put on my sneakers and stepped outside.</p>
<p>The cold was still harsh, and my breath could almost freeze, but a ray of sunshine pierced through the grey clouds.</p>
<p>The remaining snow reflected this light, sparkling white. I was eager to see Nanase, my steps quickening naturally.</p>
<p>Then, I noticed a figure at the bus stop. A woman with long hair was standing alone.</p>
<p>“…Nanase!”</p>
<p>I called out her name loudly. Noticing me, Nanase quickly ran towards me.</p>
<p>“…Why are you here?… I told you to wait somewhere.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah. I just couldn’t settle down…”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you cold?”</p>
<p>Nanase replied, “I’m fine,” with a breath that turned white in the cold, though her nose was visibly red. When I touched her hand, it was ice-cold.</p>
<p>…She had been waiting for me in this cold.</p>
<p>I grasped her hand tightly, as if to melt the ice. Nanase, holding my hand in return, asked timidly.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. How… was it?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah. My place… it’s not there after all.”</p>
<p>As I answered, Nanase looked down sadly, her long eyelashes casting a shadow.</p>
<p>“So, I see. Sorry… Maybe I did something unnecessary…”</p>
<p>“…No. It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>It was Nanase who thawed my stubborn, frozen heart. Thanks to her, I was able to prepare myself to face my mother.</p>
<p>“Maybe… it’s going to be alright.”</p>
<p>“…Really? If so, that’s good.”</p>
<p>Before Nanase could finish speaking, I pulled her close and hugged her tightly. Her body fit perfectly in my arms. Her chestnut hair smelled sweet.</p>
<p>“…Nanase, I…”</p>
<p>I had so much to tell her, but words failed me.</p>
<p>All I could do was hold her tight, overwhelmed by my emotions.</p>
<p>After a while, Nanase’s hands wrapped around my back.</p>
<p>In the biting cold, only the part of us that touched felt unnaturally warm.</p>
<p>All I wanted was to keep this warmth inside me, so I tightened my embrace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s been two weeks since my quick trip back to Nagoya.</p>
<p>Winter break has ended, and final exams for the semester are looming. I’m determined to achieve top grades once again.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun, as usual, seems grumpy while working his part-time job, but somehow, he looks a bit more relieved.</p>
<p>He used to avoid interacting with anyone, but now I see him talking with the seminar students. Perhaps going back home helped him sort out his feelings somewhat.</p>
<p>I was worried that I might have been meddling too much, so I’m a bit relieved.</p>
<p>Our relationship has seemingly returned to how it was before I confessed my feelings to Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>We share dinner occasionally and chat when we meet at the university. It’s as if the hug in Nagoya, both giving and receiving, never happened.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to call this relationship. Sagara-kun hasn’t said anything definitive to me.</p>
<p>It’s still dark at six in the morning. I woke up early to take out the trash and took a deep breath, filling my lungs with the cold air. I quite like the crisp air of winter mornings.</p>
<p>I can relate to Sei Shonagon’s sentiment about winter in her writings. (tln : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei_Sh%C5%8Dnagon" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei_Sh%C5%8Dnagon</a>)</p>
<p>By the way, Sagara-kun mentioned he had a night shift at his part-time job. I wonder if he’s about to come back soon. Thinking this, I decided to wait in front of his room.</p>
<p>Doing this reminds me of the day he turned me down. I was waiting in the same place, exhaling white breaths, waiting for him.</p>
<p>Gazing absent-mindedly at the streetlight, I see Sagara-kun walking toward me. I wave, and he looks surprised. Climbing the stairs, he says in an exasperated voice,</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“…Just thinking how nice the winter morning air feels.”</p>
<p>“Where? It’s just cold. …You’ll catch a cold.”</p>
<p>It’s a lie. I was actually waiting for you, Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>Swallowing those words, I smile and say, “Yeah, you’re right. I’m heading back to my room.”</p>
<p>If I were to say I love you now, just like then, I wonder what Sagara-kun would think. Would he be happy, or… would I just trouble him?</p>
<p>The words he used to push me away that day still linger in my heart like a thorn, pricking me whenever I remember them.</p>
<p>“See you, Sagara-kun. See you at campus.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun, with a sleepy voice, says, “Yeah.” He’s probably going to take a nap before his first class. It’s quite a tough schedule, especially before exams. I need to get ready soon too; it takes me over an hour just to do my makeup.</p>
<p>Back in my room, I sit huddled in a corner.</p>
<p>…What does Sagara-kun really think of me…?</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more anxious I become. I don’t think he dislikes me, but whether he likes me or not… I can’t be sure.</p>
<p>He used to proclaim his strong belief in being a “lone wolf,” but will he really stay with me? Does he intend to? I want to give our relationship a proper name and feel secure.</p>
<p>…In that case, I just have to try even harder!</p>
<p>The old me would have given up without trying, but now I have makeup as my weapon.</p>
<p>After washing my face and doing skincare, I apply makeup with extra determination and draw lipstick on my thin lips.</p>
<p>I lift the corners of my brightly tinted lips and smile at the mirror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>>
<p>“Sagara-kun, good evening.”</p>
<p>At twenty-one o’clock, after finishing my part-time job, a dazzlingly beautiful woman, incongruous with the shabby apartment, came to my room.</p>
<p>Despite the late hour, she was fully made up.</p>
<p>“I made cream stew. Please have some if you like.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks.”</p>
<p>As I receive the pot from her, Nanase smiles beautifully. Her stunning appearance almost mesmerizes me, but I found myself missing her gentle, droopy-eyed smile.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I haven’t seen Nanase’s bare face lately.</p>
<p>She used to remove her makeup as soon as she got home, but now she’s always made up.</p>
<p>Her attitude feels somewhat distant… or rather, completely guarded. What’s with this discomfort? After pondering, it hit me.</p>
<p>Ah, right. This is the sparkling Nanase I saw at the university before we got to know each other.</p>
<p>“Well then, goodnight, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Nanase flutters the hem of her skirt and briskly returns to her room. Left behind, I’m overwhelmed by an inexplicable anxiety.</p>
<p>…It feels like we’ve grown farther apart than before…</p>
<p>After the incident in Nagoya, I resolved to face things with Nanase. I like her and want to be with her. I think… she knows that.</p>
<p>But does Nanase still like me?</p>
<p>It’s been two months since Nanase told me she liked me. It might seem like just two months, but in that time, Kinami broke up with his girlfriend, dated another girl, and then got back together with the first one. Do people like him live in a different timeline than me?</p>
<p>…And after rejecting her like that, wouldn’t it be the worst to say I like her now?</p>
<p>If Nanase were to say, “Ah!? I thought that was long over! I have someone else I like now!” I’d have no choice but to…</p>
<p>The mere thought suffocates me, making me want to scratch my throat out. If I had a time machine, I’d run up and punch my past self for turning Nanase down.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, let’s have lunch together.”</p>
<p>After Friday’s seminar, Nanase approached me.</p>
<p>Even as Nanase and I leave the lab together, no one gives us curious looks. Our being together has become a normal sight to our seminar mates.</p>
<p>“I made lunch for you today too. There’s fried chicken!”</p>
<p>Passersby glance at Nanase as she says this. Walking next to her, I feel intimidated by her flawless beauty.</p>
<p>Yes, with all that’s happened lately, I almost forgot—Nanase, with her makeup on, is a sparkling beauty from a different world than mine.</p>
<p>Crossing the fountain plaza, we spot Sudo and Houjo sitting on a bench. Sudo waves at us excitedly, calling out, “Haruko!”</p>
<p>“Look at you two, always together. You’re really close, huh?”</p>
<p>Houjo teases us with a grin, looking back and forth between me and Nanase. I turn away, muttering, “Shut up.” You guys have been hanging out a lot recently too.</p>
<p>“By the way, I’ve been wondering…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you and Nanase, like, dating?”</p>
<p>Hojo’s question sends a jolt of tension through me.</p>
<p>…This guy, smiling mischievously, has a knack for hitting where it hurts. That’s what I want to know. Um, Nanase-san, are we, like, dating?</p>
<p>Of course, I can’t say that out loud and end up mumbling, “Uh…” Glancing at Nanase next to me, she smiles brightly and says:</p>
<p>“Nope! We’re not dating!”</p>
<p>…You didn’t have to say it so clearly…</p>
<p>Her words, delivered with a broad smile, pierce me deeply.</p>
<p>Nanase calmly says, “Let’s hurry, or lunch break will be over!” and walks ahead with light steps.</p>
<p>Left behind, I can only stand there, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Did Sagara get rejected? Poor thing.”</p>
<p>“Ha, serves you right. I hope you learn your lesson.”</p>
<p>Houjo and Sudo add insult to injury. I hurry after Nanase’s shrinking figure.</p>
<p>We move to an empty classroom in building six and sit facing each other to eat our lunch.</p>
<p>Nanase’s fried chicken is delicious as always, but I’m too preoccupied to savor it.</p>
<p>Facing Nanase, who’s eating her tamagoyaki, I hesitantly speak up.</p>
<p>“…Um, Nanase. About what you said earlier…”</p>
<p>“Oh, did you hear? Sacchan and Houjo-kun finally started dating!”</p>
<p>“Uh, no. I mean, I don’t really care about them…”</p>
<p>The pressing issue is not about Houjo and Sudo, but about Nanase and me.</p>
<p>Nanase, do you still like me?</p>
<p>I almost blurt it out but stop myself, thinking, who do I think I am? Yet, I don’t know how to confirm Nanase’s feelings.</p>
<p>As I ponder in silence, Nanase smiles and leans in, saying:</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, you know. I’m aiming for a rose-colored university life.”</p>
<p>“…I know.”</p>
<p>“So, if I were to date someone, I’d want it to be in a super romantic situation, with the guy I like confessing to me.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes sparkle with expectation. A cold sweat runs down my back at her gaze.</p>
<p>Is this… is she waiting for me to make a move…!?</p>
<p>But she makes it sound so simple. “Romantic” is a word that feels so distant from me. I guess I need to start by looking it up in the dictionary.</p>
<p>I straighten up and ask Nanase formally:</p>
<p>“…Um, Nanase-san. Just for reference, if you don’t mind me asking…”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>“…What, exactly, is a ‘romantic’ situation?”</p>
<p>Nanase blushes, tilting her head coyly and leaning in close to my ear. So close, her lips almost touch my ear as she whispers:</p>
<p>“I won’t tell you.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“…It would make me happiest if the guy I like puts in the effort to think of something special for me.”</p>
<p>Her sweet breath tickles my ear, nearly stopping my heart.</p>
<p>Dizzy from her devilish smile and enveloped in Nanase’s scent, I foolishly nod, “Yes.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Ah…what should I do…I definitely overdid it…”</p>
<p>Holding a cup of warm milk tea, I sighed deeply. Sacchan, sitting across from me with a cool expression, was munching on cheesecake and said, “Nah, you’re overthinking it.”</p>
<p>Right after class ended, Sacchan claimed she’d “die without something sweet right now,” so the three of us, including Houjo-kun, ended up at a cafe near the university.</p>
<p>I hesitated, wondering if I’d be a third wheel, but Sacchan sharply dismissed that concern, saying, “The nuisance here is Hiroki, not you.”</p>
<p>“Sacchan. I really don’t think it suits me…I definitely weirded him out…”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? That type of person needs a bit of a work to get it just right.”</p>
<p>Following Sacchan’s advice, I launched the “Make Sagara-kun’s Heart Flutter with My Femme Fatale Mode” operation, but now I regret it. Just recalling my actions and Sagara-kun’s stunned face makes me want to squirm.</p>
<p>Saying things like I want a boy to confess his feelings to me was just inviting trouble. What a disaster of trying to be a little devil.</p>
<p>“Alright, next up, let’s try the body touch tactic. Casually touching his thigh might work wonders.”</p>
<p>I gasped at Sacchan’s suggestion. If I had that kind of courage, I would’ve already secured my rosy university life.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I can do that!”</p>
<p>“It’s not about can’t, you just do! It’s all about spirit and guts!”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t do it yourself! If you’re going to say that, you try it!”</p>
<p>“Hah!? As if I’d ever do something like that.”</p>
<p>I slumped in defeat. This is just cruel. She’s definitely enjoying this…</p>
<p>While Houjo-kun was sipping his coffee next to Sacchan, he chimed in with a smirk, “I wouldn’t mind being seduced with a body touch, you know?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. Why are you even here? Today was supposed to be my date with Haruko.” (tln : man, i really liked this hojo and sacchan duo)</p>
<p>Sacchan glared at Houjo-kun sitting next to her. She’s probably the only girl who can get away with treating him like that. Their relationship seemed so pleasant, making me smile.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, how long does Sagara plan to dawdle? Haruko’s been trying so hard, he should just give in already.”</p>
<p>“Just a minute ago you were saying ‘It serves him right to suffer more.’ Talk about inconsistent.”</p>
<p>“Well, I still haven’t accepted Sagara, you know. But if Haruko says he’s the one, then I guess it can’t be helped. As long as Haruko’s happy, that’s all that matters to me.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Sacchan, you weren’t just having fun with this?”</p>
<p>At my comment, Sacchan called me an “idiot,” playfully flicking my forehead. Then, we ended up laughing together.</p>
<p>She might be having fun with this, but I knew Sacchan was genuinely concerned for me and supporting me from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>Having friends really is nice, I thought, feeling a warmth spread through me.</p>
<p>“Anyway, you can’t back down, Haruko. In love, losing the upper hand means defeat.”</p>
<p>“O-okay…I’ll, I’ll try my best!”</p>
<p>“Wow, the words of someone who’s been on the losing end sure carry a different weight.”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun teased, and Sacchan, turning red, snapped, “Shut up!” Apparently, in their case, Houjo-kun held the reins.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but secretly laugh, feeling a bit sorry for Sacchan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my third-period class was unexpectedly canceled, I was studying alone in the lab.</p>
<p>As my concentration broke, Nanase’s words crossed my mind, and I involuntarily stopped.</p>
<p>──If I were to date someone, it would have to be in an ultra-romantic situation, with a confession from the boy I like.</p>
<p>For about a week, I’ve been troubled by what Nanase said. As if exams and part-time work weren’t enough, why add more worries?</p>
<p>Love is hard. How do people who change partners like clothes even manage?</p>
<p>If I were the “ideal boyfriend” Nanase originally wanted, I wouldn’t be struggling to make her happy. Am I even worthy to stand beside Nanase?</p>
<p>Nanase might have been a social butterfly from the start, now more than ever. Even without me, she could probably achieve her rosy university life.</p>
<p>Now that her bare face is leaked, she can be herself around others, not just me. My role has long been over.</p>
<p>…Should I really… still be by her side?</p>
<p>As I buried my head in my arms on the desk, I heard a voice from behind, “Sagara. What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Turning around, Sudo stood there, looking at me quizzically.</p>
<p>“…Ah. St-studying?”</p>
<p>“You don’t look like it.”</p>
<p>Sudo said, sounding exasperated, and put the pouch she left on the desk into her bag. It seemed she only came back for something she forgot.</p>
<p>As she was about to leave, I called out, “Hey.”</p>
<p>“…Sudo, I heard you’re dating Houjo?”</p>
<p>Sudo blinked quickly, probably surprised I initiated the conversation.</p>
<p>“Did Haruko tell you? It’s not a secret, so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“…You knew how Houjo felt and ignored him, right? What changed?”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly asking? You’re unusually probing.”</p>
<p>Sudo shrugged and sat down across from me, resting her chin on her hand and began speaking plainly.</p>
<p>“I’ve always hated the idea of dating a popular guy. With all the jealousy and complications, is it worth the risk? That’s what I thought.”</p>
<p>I could somewhat understand her perspective.</p>
<p>“But that’s just me being scared of getting hurt. When I thought about it, the idea of Hiroki dating someone else was absolutely unbearable. So, I decided it’s better to face the music and be ready to make enemies.”</p>
<p>After saying so much, she blushed and abruptly ended the conversation with,</p>
<p>“Okay! That’s enough of that!”</p>
<p>Listening to Sudo, I felt a kind of kinship with her.</p>
<p>Afraid of getting hurt, running from my true feelings, and unable to accept the other’s feelings. Sudo and I were the same in that regard.</p>
<p>Yet, Sudo chose to be with Houjo, even if it meant getting hurt.</p>
<p>“…Maybe you and I are kind of alike…”</p>
<p>I muttered, and Sudo grimaced visibly. Then, she let out a deeply disgusted sigh.</p>
<p>“Ah~!? What are you saying? Please stop. That’s the worst. I want to die.”</p>
<p>…I got the message; she hates being lumped in with me, so there’s no need to look at me like I’m a cockroach. Even I felt a bit hurt by that.</p>
<p>“But why are you worried about me? Shouldn’t you be focusing on Haruko?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>
<p>“Haruko’s pretty popular, you know. If she gets tired of waiting, don’t blame me. Personally, I think she could do choose better.”</p>
<p>The words she casually threw out hit me harder than expected. Why does she always manage to strike right at my core?</p>
<p>I know that. The girl who said she liked me, even though I’m pathetic and pitiful—I don’t want to make her wait any longer.</p>
<p>After returning home from class, I pressed the intercom at Nanase’s room. “Just a moment!” she called out, and after about five minutes, she appeared wearing a mask.</p>
<p>“…You have a cold?”</p>
<p>“No, no. I’m just…not wearing makeup right now…”</p>
<p>Nanase said, covering her eyes with her hands, looking embarrassed. I had the sudden urge to forcefully reveal her face but restrained myself.</p>
<p>“More importantly, what’s up all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“…Ah. Well, um…after the exams, it’s spring break, right?”</p>
<p>I blurted out something obvious as a prelude to the main topic. Nanase tilted her head, puzzled. I tried to continue as naturally as possible.</p>
<p>“After the exams…let’s go somewhere.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes widened behind her glasses in surprise.</p>
<p>“Is that…just the two of us?”</p>
<p>I nodded silently. What’s Nanase thinking right now? Her large mask made it hard to read her expression, which made me anxious.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. I’d like to go.”</p>
<p>After a brief silence, Nanase answered.</p>
<p>Internally, I sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. Then, I’ll…think about various things…”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>Nanase softened her gaze and said, “See you then,” before closing the door.</p>
<p>Her unexpectedly nonchalant reaction made me suddenly uneasy.</p>
<p>…It’s going to be okay, right?</p>
<p>Trying to lift my spirits, which were on the verge of sinking, I started boiling some thirty-yen udon for a pre-work meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moment I closed the door, I raised my fists high in triumph.</p>
<p>YESSSSSSSSS! I finally got asked out on a date!!</p>
<p>Though he didn’t exactly say “date,” going out together just the two of us is definitely a date.</p>
<p>Yeah, let’s go with that.</p>
<p>Unable to contain my excitement, I opened my closet, wondering what to wear. Then, realizing I was getting ahead of myself, I closed it again.</p>
<p>It’s still a while away, so I’ll go shopping for new clothes as soon as the exams are over.</p>
<p>I never thought Sagara-kun would be the one to invite me. Maybe Sacchan’s “Femme Fatale Operation” actually worked. Though I didn’t manage to touch his thigh…</p>
<p>I silently exploded with joy in my room, careful not to alert my neighbor.</p>
<p>Once I calmed down a bit, I realized this might be my last chance.</p>
<p>Slapping my cheeks, I switched gears and returned to my interrupted exam studies.</p>
<p>To fully enjoy my date with Sagara-kun, I must achieve the highest grades possible.</p>
<p>I won’t cut corners, not in studies or in love.</p>


<p>And so, with the end of the final exams, spring break began. Alone, I found myself waiting in front of a fashion building in Shijo Kawaramachi for Nanase.</p>
<p>Thinking back, since coming to Kyoto, I’ve rarely ventured into this area. Surrounded by people who seemed too dazzling, I felt intimidated.</p>
<p>…Enough hesitating.</p>
<p>Today, I’m going to confess to Nanase.</p>
<p>But it can’t just be any confession. I have to create a “romantic situation” that would satisfy Nanase.</p>
<p>After much agonizing, I finally settled on a date course.</p>
<p>First, we’d watch a romance movie that Nanase would like, then eat tart at a trendy café, and finally sit side by side on the banks of the Kamo River, watching the sunset.</p>
<p>The old me would have fainted at the thought of such a plan.</p>
<p>But this is also a step toward becoming a “wonderful boyfriend” for Nanase.</p>
<p>As I waited, restless, I spotted Nanase across the street. She wore a new coat over her white dress, something I’d never seen before.</p>
<p>She must have bought new clothes again, I secretly thought. Perhaps she spends most of her part-time job earnings on clothes.</p>
<p>Nanase noticed me and waved happily. I raised my hand slightly, returning the gesture. As the signal turned green, she jogged over.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, sorry! Did you wait long?”</p>
<p>“No, not really…”</p>
<p>I answered, then regretted it. Maybe as a wonderful boyfriend, I was supposed to say, “I just got here.” In reality, I had been waiting here for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>But as I fidgetting for words, Nanase started walking with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“This is kind of new! We don’t usually meet up since we live next door to each other.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, right.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun wanting to watch a movie is rare. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Well, just thought…”</p>
<p>I mumbled my response and awkwardly took Nanase’s hand. As I gently squeezed, her cheeks flushed red. After a moment, she squeezed back, stronger.</p>
<p>And so, I set off, determined to make Nanase’s dream date come true.</p>
<p>…However, things didn’t go as smoothly as planned.</p>
<p>Maybe because I worked late last night, I spent most of the two-hour movie nearly asleep. The cinema’s chairs were too comfortable.</p>
<p>Nanase said, “It was interesting,” but she probably noticed I was sleeping.</p>
<p>The tart shop we visited next was busier than expected. A three-hour wait? This isn’t a theme park ride.</p>
<p>As we debated whether to wait, Nanase kindly suggested, “I want to eat a crepe instead.” I felt bad for making her consider my feelings.</p>
<p>Later, when we moved to the fashion building at Nanase’s request, the price of an accessory she was pondering made me gasp. If she bought it, I’d have to survive on weeds next month. Nanase said, “Maybe I’ll buy it with my next paycheck,” and left the store without purchasing anything.</p>
<p>…I’ve accomplished nothing…</p>
<p>My actions so far were far from those of a “wonderful boyfriend.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Nanase’s behavior was perfect. She laughed off my failures and kindly supported me.</p>
<p>She seemed happy no matter where we were or what we did, subtly expressing her wishes when we were indecisive.</p>
<p>I was grateful, but wished she would show some frustration or anger. Maybe, I was imposing too much on Nanase.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, we crossed the Shijo Bridge and descended to the riverside. We were late, and the sun had already set behind the mountains. We were supposed to watch the sunset. Nothing went as planned.</p>
<p>On the Kamo River banks, though sparse due to the cold, couples sat at intervals. I quietly asked Nanase, “Want to sit down?”</p>
<p>“Really? I’m happy! Yes, let’s sit!”</p>
<p>The moment Nanase lit up with joy, I threw my silly pride over Mt. Daimonji. I’ll never mock couples sitting at intervals on the Kamo River again.</p>
<p>Nanase and I sat side by side on the riverbank. The evening in February was colder than I expected. Nanase sneezed a small “Achoo!” and I panicked.</p>
<p>“Sorry, it’s cold, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, a little.”</p>
<p>I took off my scarf and wrapped it around Nanase’s neck. She buried her face in the black scarf and smiled, “Thank you.” Just that made the biting wind seem insignificant.</p>
<p>“…Nanase. This is for you.”</p>
<p>I handed her a paper bag I took out of my shoulder bag. Recognizing the brand logo on it, she exclaimed, “Ah!”</p>
<p>“Can I open it?”</p>
<p>After I nodded, Nanase carefully unwrapped it. Out came a small, black tube—a lipstick.</p>
<p>I had bought it at a department store about a week ago, overwhelmed by the variety of colors. I showed the clerk Nanase’s photo and bought what they recommended.</p>
<p>“Is this a gift for your girlfriend?” they asked, and I felt my face burn.</p>
<p>“It’s cute! I love this brand. Thank you. I’ll cherish it.”</p>
<p>Regardless of how she truly felt, her words relieved me. After all, I don’t trust my own taste.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, I’m not the enviable boyfriend others might wish for. Being with me might not lead to the rosy life Nanase hopes for. Surely, there are many men who could fulfill her desires better than I could.</p>
<p>Yet, I wanted to be with Nanase forever.</p>
<p>The gently flowing river reflected the city lights. In silence, we placed our hands together, our body warmth slowly blending until it became the same temperature.</p>
<p>I faced Nanase directly. Her eyes, clear enough to draw me in, were once too dazzling to look at directly.</p>
<p>But after nearly a year, I was finally prepared to face her. No more running from her feelings or mine.</p>
<p>There was only one thing I needed to say.</p>
<p>“Um, I-i…like you, N-Nanase…”</p>
<p>…Ah, damn, I stuttered.</p>
<p>I couldn’t think of any clever lines, there was no beautiful sunset, and the Kamo River in midwinter was freezing. My once-in-a-lifetime confession was far from cool.</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes widened, then blinked—and she let a tear fall.</p>
<p>“!? Uh, s-sorry, Nanase!”</p>
<p>Panicked by her sudden tears, I floundered.</p>
<p>Was it wrong? Should I have said it more coolly…?</p>
<p>I searched for a handkerchief, but unfortunately, I had nothing like it. Large tears streamed down her cheeks, staining her skirt.</p>
<p>As I fumbled, Nanase, with tears brimming in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy…”</p>
<p>“Eh, what?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting…for you to say that…I’m glad…”</p>
<p>Nanase sobbed like a little child.</p>
<p>“I…couldn’t give up on you, Sagara-kun…I wanted to say I like you again, but couldn’t…I had to work hard…so you’d confess…I was really scared.”</p>
<p>“Nanase…”</p>
<p>I made her feel so insecure because of my indecisiveness. A mix of guilt and affection tightened my chest.</p>
<p>The urge to embrace her, crying before me, was almost overwhelming, but I restrained myself with reason.</p>
<p>“Sniff, what should I do? My makeup will run…after all my effort…”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eye makeup was gone, her tears slightly blackened. The girl crying before me was far from the glittering girl she aspired to be.</p>
<p>Yet to me, she was the most adorable girl in the world.</p>
<p>I reached out and gently wiped her tear-streaked cheeks.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You can just be yourself around me.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I like the hardworking Nanase…but you don’t have to force yourself around me. I’m happier when you can be yourself and smile.”</p>
<p>After sniffling, Nanase gave a soft, tearful smile. Even if it wasn’t perfect or fully smiling, that kind of smile was the most charming to me.</p>
<p>“Then, let me say one thing honestly.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Nanase, sulking, whispered:</p>
<p>“I’ve been hurt a lot. If you don’t say you like me a hundred more times, I won’t forgive you. Make sure I feel secure.”</p>
<p>Indeed, that was true. I had to make amends to her with all my might.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Saying so, I gently grasped Nanase’s slender wrist and pulled her toward me. She widened her eyes in surprise and slowly, I moved my face closer to hers.</p>
<p>Just before our lips touched, Nanase placed her palm over my mouth, saying, “Wait.” Slightly frustrated, I pulled her hand away.</p>
<p>“What? You were the one who said to make it clear.”</p>
<p>“What are you planning to do?”</p>
<p>“Something only lovers do.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Nanase’s face turned bright red. Mine was probably just as red.</p>
<p>After looking around, she braced herself and closed her eyes tightly.</p>
<p>I pressed my lips clumsily against hers, covered in rose-colored lipstick. The contact was brief, and we quickly pulled apart.</p>
<p>“Do you understand now?”</p>
<p>“…Not yet.”</p>
<p>As she asked from up close, Nanase answered. Drawn by her invitingly lowered eyelids, we shared an awkward second kiss. “One more time,” she whispered, and we kissed again.</p>
<p>By the time Nanase fully understood my feelings, the rose color on her lips had completely vanished.</p>
