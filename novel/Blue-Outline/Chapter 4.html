<h2>Chapter 4: Fight A Monster With A Monster</h2>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it homework?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… Is it inconvenient for me to study here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all. We have many customers who do that. Please take your time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san, who came to take my order, said in his usual kind voice and then walked back to the counter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can be patient. I just want to talk a little more, but I’ll do it later.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…No, that’s not it. I’m here because I couldn’t be patient.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today is only Wednesday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t wait until the next Sunday to see him, so I went to the café where he works after school on a weekday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, this is the first time I’ve shown my school uniform to Chifuji-san… I wonder what he thought about it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Which does he prefer? Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion or this? Is my hairstyle weird?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…This whole time, the homework I used as an excuse hasn’t made any progress at all. The pen in my right hand hasn’t written a single character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I like him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no misunderstanding or deception; it’s an unmistakable feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But there were other things that were clear as well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Senpai, look! I’ve gotten so good at stacking plates!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow, that’s impressive… But let’s do it later for when there are no customers.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay~!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My left-hand reaches up to my chest area and grabs the collar of my shirt. It makes a creaking sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I am jealous. I found out for the first time when I fell in love that I can ‘feel’ jealousy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t remember ever being jealous of anyone in my life up until now, but the moment I fell in love, this happened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know how this jealousy compares to others, but I was aware of its intensity.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Right, I’ve also gotten a bit better at making coffee. Please try some later!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? I’m looking forward to it. Did the manager teach you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! Actually, I’ve been getting lessons quite frequently. Hehehe, I might have surpassed you already, Senpai.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the edge of the shop, Chifuji-san is typing something into his laptop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Talking to him is a girl who works here with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She has a friendly atmosphere about her and is quite cute.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She met Chifuji-san before I did, has spent more time with him than I have, and now, she is definitely closer to him than I am.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll be out soon, I don’t have the talent for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah~? If you say that, then where does that leave me, who loves your coffee? Come to think of it, I feel like you haven’t brewed any for me recently.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager of this cafe is the type who often chats with customers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps because of that, Chifuji-san and the others also talk with customers in the same way, and the employees often strike up conversations among themselves in that same atmosphere.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(The fact that the serious Chifuji-san talks while working probably means the manager likes creating that kind of environment).</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course, the two of them weren’t speaking loudly, but my keen ears strangely could pick up their conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whether this is fortunate or unfortunate, I’m not sure.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wonder if I’ve ever brewed for you before. I’ve decided to offer it only to my hard-working colleagues.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, how could you say that to a devoted junior like me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">… His tone is completely different when talking to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t recall him ever making such playful, teasing remarks to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can feel the force in my hand, enough to stretch the fabric of my shirt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like an idiot. I came to the shop on my own and am now jealously eavesdropping.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it a difficult task? You look very upset.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sigh… uh, what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sigh I was about to let out is swallowed hard by the surprise of being suddenly spoken to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, saying I was ‘suddenly spoken to’ might be an exaggeration.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for the wait, here’s the iced coffee you ordered…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That person, the manager, brought the item I ordered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No-no, I came here to say thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You took care of him the other day, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: When he’s sick)</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager speaks in a hushed voice, probably so Chifuji-san won’t hear us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah… no, it was more like I insisted on going with him.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I appreciate that. That guy, he never relies on others on his own initiative. He hardly ever comes to me saying ‘This or that is troublesome’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘I wish he’d rely on others a little more. ‘</p>
<p class="calibre5">The manager says with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s the complexity of men. If he says, ‘I’ll speak up when I really need help,’ it’s a bit hard for me to intervene too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that how it is…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s just how it is. It’s the annoying part of being a man. That day too, I happened to go to his house for a different matter in the evening and found him bedridden. It surprised me. He should’ve said something to me, but he didn’t.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager sighs and goes, ‘Ah, yes’ as if remembering something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you for preparing the stored food as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, it wasn’t much…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That day, with Chifuji-san’s permission, I used some ingredients and prepared some stored food after making porridge.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought it would be good for him to have some food for the next day, whether he got better quickly or not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, no, for a high school student to prepare so many things is amazing, you didn’t even have enough ingredients. You really helped him out, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“N-no, to begin with, I’m the one who’s been taken care of by Chifuji-san a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha, that’s true. He has been working part-time so much that he hasn’t really hung out like a typical high schooler. This is a good opportunity for him.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager smiles warmly, thinking about his nephew.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I inadvertently stare intently at his face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no, I’m sorry… it’s just… you and Chifuji-san, you look alike.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s something common in their expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Especially when their expressions soften, it’s very obvious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hahahaha! Well-well, I see, hahaha.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said something weird!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No-no, it’s fine. …Haha, I’ve been looked at by women many times in my life, but this might be the first time someone mentioned another man’s name.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m really sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine …I see, Raihara-san is really… yeah, my judgment isn’t clouded after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then the manager nods as if he was convinced about something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What is he talking about?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Regarding me and Kei, I guess we do look somewhat alike. After all, my older brother and I looked quite similar. And by ‘older brother,’ I mean…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, Kei’s father. He passed away over a decade ago… He was my much ‘older’ brother, but before I knew it, I’m ‘older’ than him.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This was the first time I heard information about Chifuji-san’s family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, he lost his father when he was young.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Does he now live with just his mother?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was tableware for one other family member at Chifuji-san’s house, so I assume that might be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Back then, Chifuji-san only told me that his family wouldn’t be back for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I wonder if they’re very busy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No, I’m sorry, never mind.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really want to ask more about his family situation, but I hesitate and hold back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『&mdash;&mdash;Maybe someday, I might feel that it was good that I was born, haha, that’s all.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those words Chifuji-san said to explain the reason he should be proper are still deeply etched in my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not just ‘I might feel that it was good that I was born.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s ‘I might feel that even being born was a good thing’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: It’s a little vague, but from what I can understand, you can also read it like this,</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not just [Simply feeling glad about being born.]</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s [Feeling glad even just for the act of being born, regardless of any hardships or circumstances]. )</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words… those are words someone wouldn’t say unless they felt that their existence shouldn’t have come into this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And he said that with such a casual expression…</p>
<p class="calibre5">It felt to me like nothing more than a fresh wound that was still bleeding.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to do everything I can for him, but I am aware that I am not in a position to do so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Oops, I talked a bit too much. I must’ve interrupted your studies.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, not at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Anyway…please continue to be friends with Kei.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Until the end, the store manager spoke with such affection for his nephew and then departed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And sure enough, the straight posture as he walks, his dignified back, reminds me of him… I can’t help but think that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I take a sip of iced coffee. I’m no expert at tasting coffee, but without exaggeration, it tastes better than any I’ve had at other places.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having chatted with the manager and taken a break with the coffee, I feel the jealousy that was boiling within me has slightly settled down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alright, since I’m here, I might as well get on with my tasks&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can hold many plates and make delicious coffee, it feels like the roles between senior and junior might soon reverse, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you become good at washing dishes, I’d have no complaints.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Patience, it’s okay, whatever, it’s nothing…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, did the cafe manager teach you to hold many plates?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, no, that wasn’t trained. It’s simply an increased arm strength! Or maybe finger strength? I got that somewhere else.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she says ‘finger strength!’, the junior girl grabs Chifuji-san’s arm, the one that was typing on a keyboard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…What’s that?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Hold on, stay calm. I have no right to comment on their close relationship. It’s a matter of course.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, calm down… It’s okay, I’m composed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s with the ‘wow’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You, senior, have quite some muscles, don’t you? I mean, I’ve been into bouldering recently, and I think you’d be suited for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Bouldering? That’s the wall climbing thing, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, exactly. There’s a place near the station. I got invited by a friend, and I instantly got hooked!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, so that’s why you gained arm strength… Don’t squeeze me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It started with a pinch, and now the junior girl is kneading Chifuji-san’s arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I realize now that the moral lessons from elementary school weren’t in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Otherwise, I wouldn’t be sitting here like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Stay calm. It’s okay, I’m composed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, senior, how about bouldering together? It’s fun~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Me? No, as you know, I have my part-time job…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just for a bit after you finish your shift! I go there after school too! Have you never tried it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, not even once.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, it’s not up to me whether he can go or not…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then let me teach you! I’ll guide you through every step and take perfect care of you~!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, there was a ‘snap’ sound from my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The mechanical pencil I was holding had broken in two.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, this is bad.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I quickly pack up the textbook, notebook, and writing utensils I had spread out into my bag and get up from my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Standing in front of the cash register, Chifuji-san, having noticed me, came over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, excuse me, I’d like to pay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, thank you. …By any chance, do you have something urgent?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It must be weird for me to leave so quickly after claiming to do my assignment and having only one sip of coffee.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, um, I… I suddenly don’t feel well, my stomach hurts, so I thought I’d better head home.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry, that was an inappropriate question.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, not at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A classmate who had a boyfriend once told me that pretending to have ‘stomach pain’ was a handy excuse when dealing with men.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If you said that, most men wouldn’t question it further, but they’d still show concern.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I heard that, I thought, ‘Is it okay to use such a lie? Especially when women genuinely have stomach pains every month…’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Your payment, from a thousand yen… here’s your change. …Um, if you’re feeling unwell, you can stay here a bit… Oh, never mind.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, just as my classmate said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without causing too much trouble, I can still feel a comforting sense of being cared for.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No-no, it’s not that I can’t walk.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..I see. I’m glad then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Leaving behind the words ‘See you on Sunday’ to him, I left the cafe.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This person is the worst.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I’m referring to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“..Ah&mdash;―&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Letting out a strange sigh, I cover my face with my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I couldn’t help it. I lose my composure just by seeing him talking to another woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Especially, I can’t stand watching another woman other than me take care of him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Overwhelming self-centered anger and intense irritation flood my body in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t bear to listen any longer, so I got up from my seat, yet I lied like that because I wanted him to be concerned about me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a lie to soothe my dangerously unstable emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unable to control my inner emotions, I end up affecting others with my behavior.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I, I am…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I always wore ‘Jirai-kei (Landmine type)’ fashion that when going out with Chifuji-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe I don’t need to wear that outfit anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because the current me, even when wearing a school uniform, is a proper ‘Jirai-kei (Landmine type)’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not just fashion, it’s the real thing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, it has a mysterious power when you see it up close.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a sight you don’t see elsewhere.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Walls were angled in various ways, and numerous colorful protrusions were set on them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are mats laid at the base of the walls.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s Sunday, our usual day out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san and I were at the bouldering gym that recently opened near the station.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, Raihara-san, I didn’t know you have experience with this too. Was it with your family?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, we’re a family that loves to stay active.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s very healthy. Your father was a soccer player, and your mother was a former amateur wrestling athlete, right? And they still work in related fields?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He remembered. That makes me really happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">About my father and mother, I only casually mentioned it once…</p>
<p class="calibre5">It might seem silly to get so excited over something so small, but I can’t help but feel happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Being careful not to let my voice sound strange, I continue the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes. Hehe, my two younger sisters went off to do skating, but I’m not particularly passionate about any sport, so I feel a bit guilty towards my parents.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, nobody does soccer or wrestling then?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. But from my parents’ perspective, they’re probably glad we didn’t. When it comes to their specialized sports, watching their children as an athlete can be a bit hard and painful. Because they might end up having too many expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s certainly a thing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying this, Chifuji-san stretches his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Is it just me, or do all women feel their cheeks getting hot from seeing gestures like that from the man they like?</p>
<p class="calibre5">This alone makes me so glad that I came.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I genuinely feel that way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;This is the worst.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry to ask, but could you teach me about it, Raihara-sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha, please don’t call me ‘sensei.’ I’ve only done it with my family a few times.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not a lie. A few years ago, my mother wanted to try it after seeing a special feature on TV, so we all went to do it together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But even if I hadn’t done it before… I think I would have still invited him out today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Then let me teach you! I’ll guide you through every step and take perfect care of you~!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">…It was Wednesday when I heard those words, and there were still days left until Sunday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there’s enough time to try something out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I tried to invite him to take over the role of taking care of this man from his younger female coworker.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what I did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Jealousy, impatience, competitiveness, selfishness, and possessiveness surged within me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“After hearing that there’s a place to do it nearby, I wanted to try it again after a long time. I’m sorry for dragging you along.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, actually, I was thinking of trying it myself. A junior even invited me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…That’s exactly why I invited him today, but I wonder if Chifuji-san does not see the two as related?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, it’s comforting in a way, but it’s also sad that it means I’m hardly on his mind at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad. I was wondering how it would be since I made a selfish request.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, letting you be selfish is essentially my role after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His way of putting it as a ‘role’ is accurate. After all, that’s the premise under which we’re hanging out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s selfish of me to feel lonely about this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, going out to practice being selfish towards others doesn’t really make sense anymore. There is no need for it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today, I wanted to practice ‘asserting where I want to go from the destination,’ which is why I invited him here, but that’s really just an excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When it comes to him, I’m already a selfish and self-centered ‘Jirai-kei (Landmine type)’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It doesn’t matter even if I’m wearing sportswear different from my usual outings, because that’s my true nature.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’re climbing that wall, right? Um…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, basically&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I explained to Chifuji-san about the rules, manners, and precautions of bouldering.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s pretty simple, so I remember what I learned before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I even watched a video yesterday to review the information again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see-I see. So, the rocks attached to the wall… the holds? We climb using only the specified ones from the start to the goal. That becomes the course.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. There’s a mark on each hold, and in this place, colored tape with numbers is attached, so you follow the holds with the same color and number.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I thought we could just climb as we wanted.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, it’s not necessarily wrong to do that, but the real charm of bouldering is, after all, thinking about how to conquer the specified course and challenging it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, since arm lengths differ, the way to conquer might differ for everyone, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san nods with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Wow, he’s cute. So cute… too cute…</p>

<p class="calibre5">…</p>
<p class="calibre5">……</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Ugh… I’m at a loss for words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can I try it right away? I start by holding the start hold with both hands and lifting both feet off the ground, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, good luck!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san steps onto the mat and approaches the wall then puts his hands on the holds.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Alright, …okay, …where to next, …is it that one?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although it’s the course most suitable for beginners, Chifuji-san climbs smoothly without much difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It doesn’t seem very dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I do think that he’s amazing and cool… but why does the feeling of him being cute overwhelm everything else?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if the reason for this lies within me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Safely, Chifuji-san placed both hands on the goal hold and held for three seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He cleared it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maintaining that posture, he turned his head over his shoulder and showed a delighted smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, no… No.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ugh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, I feel like I’m going to faint.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah! A photo! I didn’t take a photo or even a video!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait, why didn’t I take it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really didn’t? No one took it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Uh, if someone other than me had taken it without my permission, I wouldn’t have forgiven them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But yeah, if I didn’t take it, then probably no one did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While such thoughts intensely swirled in my head, Chifuji-san had descended from the wall and came back.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I somehow managed…! Was it okay? Like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it was perfect!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘I thought a national treasure was climbing the wall!’ When put through a social filter, it comes out like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, my emotions are all over the place, it was the very definition of emotional instability.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When you finish climbing, there’s a unique sense of accomplishment… I feel like I’ve gotten a slight grasp of what kind of sport this is.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, I’m glad you enjoyed it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If someone’s good, how do they climb… Oh, that person over there is amazing!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Following Chifuji-san’s gaze, there’s a man moving confidently across the holds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s attempting a course that, just by looking, has a high difficulty level with a good angle.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, he jumped…! I see, so there are moves like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Watching the man use momentum to jump towards the next hold, Chifuji-san exclaims in admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That move is called a ‘dyno’ or ‘lunge.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“He’s amazing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san is intently watching the man.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I scan the wall to find a good course.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, I’ll give it a try now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, good luck!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I step onto the mat, face the wall, and grab the starting hold.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Here, …and there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Being conscious of my balance, I first determine the position of my feet, then extend my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like climbing a ladder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The next foothold is high up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I lift my foot high, hook my heel onto the hold, and then use it to lift my body.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a move where the foot is used like a third hand, called a ‘heel hook.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, that’s amazing! You’re so flexible…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that time, I heard Chifuji-san’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s watching me, only me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m glad my face is turned towards the wall, so he can’t see my embarrassed and slackened expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moving forward, the next hold is far.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if I reach out normally, I can’t grasp it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Using one leg as a pendulum, I create momentum and jump.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After a moment of floating, I firmly grasp the targeted hold and stabilize myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Wow! …amazing…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hear an even more admiring voice and a thrilling sensation runs down my back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not particularly interested in being told I’m amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the fact that Chifuji-san is intently watching only me sets my spine and brain on fire.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I deliberately move a bit slower.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think this way, he might watch me for a longer time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Man, your girlfriend is amazing!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s not my girlfriend, but thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While I’m doing this, I hear Chifuji-san talking to someone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A quick glance confirms it’s the man who was doing an advanced course earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Not his girlfriend. …Yes, that’s right.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, she’s not? My bad. She seems like a real pro, huh? She must’ve participated in competitions? That stability is just insane.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Even to skilled climbers, she appears that way? She’s only climbed a few times, actually.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">… Since it’s a man talking to Chifuji-san, I don’t feel that muddy-like feeling welling up as much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, with that being said, I also feel like the attention towards me is diminishing… and I don’t like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">An embarrassing amount of greed, even to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I’m aware of it, I can’t control it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah, the next hold is there. …Whoa, it’s high up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Only two or three times? Are you kidding me?… Wait, seriously?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems so.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way… Oh, a double dyno!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Releasing all four limbs from the wall and holds, jumping, and then grabbing the next hold with both hands to stop the momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a visually impressive move called a double dyno.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m glad I succeeded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Though, technically, I hadn’t failed it from the first time I tried, so I did think I’d be okay.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, that’s amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way, she stops her body so perfectly… What kind of grip strength and core does that girl have…? Her joints are flexible and she has a good sense too… Does she do some other sports?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, but her family is kind of sporty.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, it’s a pure talent then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Listening to their conversation, I reached the goal hold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alright, cleared.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I descend from the wall and head towards Chifuji-san and the others, the man praises me, saying, ‘Nice!’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onee-san, you’re amazing! Have you ever considered joining competitions?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you… But, I’m not really into competing against others.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? That… Well, that’s a shame… If you ever change your mind, please let the owner of this place know… oh by the way, sorry for interrupting you two!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, the man left with a cheerful laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That was amazing, Raihara-san, what you did earlier.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha, I just tried a little challenging move. I’m glad it worked out.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not just about strong legs or something like that. You have a lot of talent.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But as for competitions… Hmm, Raihara-san, that’s not really your style, is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san pondered with a thoughtful ‘Hmm…’</p>

<p class="calibre5">I do enjoy being active, but more than dedicating myself to one sport, I like to try various things and enjoy them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Above all, I’m honestly not interested in either improving my own records or competing against someone else.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Just having Chifuji-san tell me I’m great is enough for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, that’s an honor.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt like I had tried my best to be direct, but… it seemed like he took it as a joke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san, how do you feel about competition?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not too fixated on winning or losing either. Haha, but if I were, it might have been troublesome. I don’t have talent in anything anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t think that’s true…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From what I can see, he seems to have good athletic reflexes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Haha, well, it’s fine. I like enjoying sports with someone like this. Alright, I’ll give it another go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, Chifuji-san begins to challenge a different route.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He advances steadily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…He does have good athletic reflexes, doesn’t he?</p>

<p class="calibre5">It would be good if Chifuji-san took up some sport.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I would cheer him on to death and give as much support as a living human can.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But then, that might become bothersome.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just like I did in junior high school in six different clubs.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, I don’t think someone like me should approach Chifuji-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I’m in love, I’m only disappointed with my own worthlessness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was lost in thought, Chifuji-san suddenly appeared in my line of sight missing a hold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then he fell onto the mat with a ‘thud’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Waa, are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, I’m fine. I thought I could grab it but… Hmm, let me try again.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Good, he seems to be alright. Chifuji-san quickly gets up…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, his shirt slightly rolls up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I, holding my breath, focus all my nerves and intently watch until the hem of his shirt returns to its place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is there a woman in this world who dislikes a glimpse of her favorite man’s stomach?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that I don’t look away from him at all showcases my shameless, desire-filled side&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;wait, what?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I think I saw a bruise on his stomach?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, here we go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san tries again, and there is nothing strange in his movements.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It might have been my imagination, or maybe it’s an old bruise that doesn’t hurt anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, Chifuji-san successfully reaches the goal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He comes back to me with a smile, saying,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I somehow made it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That was amazing!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, I might be able to tell my junior that I managed to do it properly.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Junior.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A certain word arises, and something dark stirs inside me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Is it the person from the cafe?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it seems she recently started bouldering too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That person… that person…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Come to think of it, Chifuji-san speaks to her in a casual tone, without using honorifics.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It could be because she was younger, but… then why doesn’t he use the same tone with me, who is the same age?</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s always spoken to me using honorifics from the first time we spoke, and it hasn’t changed since…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If we come together, she’d definitely ask me to compete. She’s the type that gets fixated on winning or losing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Our relationship…It’s not a relationship where I can ask him not to talk about other women.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Do you, you know, go out together sometimes or something?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t want to ask, but my foolish curiosity made me speak.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, not like that, at least for now. Ah, we do play games on our smartphones. We use voice chat at night.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At night, just the two of you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…</p>
<p class="calibre5">……</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re close, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe she’s just looking out for me. She’s a good person.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, that’s…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At night, just the two of you, what do you talk about? Just the game?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…that’s nice.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My hand involuntarily tightly grips the hem of my clothes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry… for disturbing you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine. It also helps me out.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tap- tap- tap- tap.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s a rhythmic tapping sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’ve been working so hard lately, I can see why you’re feeling the backlash.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you say so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, whose voice seems timid, is currently cooking in my kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I received a message saying something like ‘I’m sorry, I’m experiencing withdrawal symptoms’ on a Wednesday evening after work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san had been making positive changes recently, confidently expressing her preferences about movies or inviting people to places she wanted to visit.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, it seems like this surge of confidence had a counter-reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just like the previous cheat day, she asked if she could do something for me and is now cooking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Do you always cook, Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I live with my mother, but she’s often not home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Household chores are my responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, seeing someone else cooking in my kitchen… How many years has it been since I’ve witnessed such a scene?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The last time Raihara-san made porridge and some other dishes for me, I was asleep in my room and didn’t see it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I try to cook, but I don’t really improve much. Raihara-san, you’re quite good.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“R-really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, the lunchbox you made was also delicious. It has a taste that makes me feel pleasant.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The rhythm of the knife chopping falters slightly. I might have said something strange while she was cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. The meals I prepare for myself always give off a vibe of ‘as long as it’s edible, it’s fine.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Compared to that, Raihara-san’s cooking seems to be infused with genuine hospitality and consideration&mdash;&mdash;and I feel it deeply in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if it’s because I’m not used to eating such food with so much care and thought?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The day has grown quite long, but it’s not yet dusk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reddish light from the setting sun pours into the room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The delicious aroma from the pot on the stove fills the air, accompanied by a consistent rhythmic sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such a scene, perhaps it might also be in my future… No.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…thinking like that really gets to me. My eyes are getting a little misty…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Um, Chifuji-san. I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, I… I’m having so much fun cooking that I can’t stop…! I love cooking for someone else… If it’s alright, not only for today’s dinner, but I also want to prepare some dishes in advance…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had thought that my intense staring might have been bothering her, but it turned out to be a completely different issue, and this is so typical of Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since today is another ‘cheat day,’ it’s probably best to let her do as she pleases.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, for me, the opportunity to eat more of Raihara-san’s cooking is very welcome.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d appreciate that. I’m looking forward to it. …Ah, do you have enough ingredients?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well…sorry, I might be running a bit short.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess so. I’ll go buy some.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The supermarket is quite nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She sent me a list of the missing items via a message on my phone, and I headed out to shop.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Having someone cook for me at home, huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On my way, I felt a strange emotion, but I quickly finished my shopping.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I returned, there were already many dishes prepared.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, I actually have a concern.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?! What is it!? Is there something I can do?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…At this rate, I might end up loving eating so much that I’ll gain weight.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Geez… ahaha, then I guess I have to cook more!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san laughed at my silly comment which was delivered with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…In truth, there was another concern that I couldn’t voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Raihara-san’s prepared meals run out, I might get disheartened by the blandness of my own cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t possibly say that out loud.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">『And, this goes in the refrigerator…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s a bit of static noise, but it’s tolerable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Now then…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Following the voice, the sound of dishes being washed comes through.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Subtle murmurs and sounds of everyday life seemingly made without consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, I’m listening to these sounds which weren’t meant for someone else to hear through my earphones.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After finishing cooking at Chifuji-san’s place and being given a ride to my home not far away, I arrived here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This place, a small park, is located about a hundred meters from Chifuji-san’s residence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sun had completely set, with only the light from a single streetlamp illuminating the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The sounds of dishes being washed continue to flow from the earphones, unchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the dimly lit landscape, I was listening to the sound I had obtained through shady means.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While Chifuji-san was out shopping for ingredients, I had planted a listening device.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It captures real-time audio and transmits it within a radius of about a hundred meters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m doing something wrong. Not just ethically but legally as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, knowing that, I…</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Hmm, hello?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …! “</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was just something, something I desperately needed to hear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Me? I just finished washing the dishes from dinner. Right now? Ah, I’m good. Let’s do it.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Oh, right, that event started. Should I participate in it? …Oh, is that so? Then, let’s do it.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that, right away, it turned out to be a precisely targeted moment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Playing games together in the evening. With a junior from his workplace, and it’s a girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Is this lineup okay? Hm? I’ve only done the free gacha draws, you know…Oh, is that how it is? Hmm, then I’ll work on it later…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t really understand the game.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Haha! No, sorry, sorry, I made a mistake… Oh, nice! That’s some great aggression there… Haha, really?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can feel that they’re having a good time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a casual tone, joking around here and there, the two of them are enjoying their game together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In contrast, I’m here alone in this dimly lit park, realizing just how distant my relationship with him is compared to that girl’s.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to know&mdash;&mdash;I needed to confront the truth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if I clenched the receiver so tightly that it creaked, even if the taste of blood persisted from my bitten lip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I don’t know how much I’m losing, after all, I can’t win.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t help but laugh at my own thoughts…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Win? Me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not even a matter of whether I stand a chance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Should I even be thinking of winning?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Me…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I love him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Amidst his strong, kind, and mature demeanor, there was a distorted and fragile vulnerability&mdash;&mdash;a bomb that went off right at my feet when I was drawn to it and stepped closer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, I fell in love as if stepping on a landmine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The problem is that I ended up being a genuine Jirai-kei (Landmine type) with quite a problematic nature.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Honestly, I truly don’t wish for him to do everything just for me without even sparing a glance at other women.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I genuinely want to be the one to handle everything about him, and I wish from the bottom of my heart that he doesn’t give even a single thing to another woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For that, I’d disregard both ethics and the law, and I’d effortlessly lie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If there’s pain and hurt within him… if he’s bleeding, I want to do everything I can for him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I couldn’t convince myself that a woman like me deserved that right or was in a position to earn it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want him to be happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I wish for his happiness, I’m clear about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara Amane is a visible landmine.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, it seems you’ve become quite close with Raihara-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Oh, yes, at least I intend to. Just yesterday, she came over and prepared a lot of meals and stocked up food for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, she really is caring.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But as initially intended, she has started to be able to voice out her selfishness to me…Really, it’s all thanks to the manager being so accommodating.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s ‘uncle’ now. And drop the formal language.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, sorry Uncle.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Inside the shop after closing time, the relationship becomes that of an uncle and nephew rather than that of a store manager and an employee.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That was my uncle’s rule, and this held true even if we were inside the store, doing post-closing tasks and preparations for the next day’s opening.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Speaking of formality, weren’t you two speaking in a very formal manner?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, yeah… I guess the initial feeling just didn’t wear off.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess the beginning of your meeting was a bit unique. Although I don’t personally see it that way, objectively speaking, it might seem like a relationship between a perpetrator and a victim.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe I should try suggesting that we drop the formalities.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You don’t have to, but if you want to get closer to Raihara-san, you probably should.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If I want to get even closer huh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“To be honest, do you see her as a woman?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After being asked, I ponder… and then I answer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… It’s not really about how I see Raihara-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“For me, love is… I guess it’s just scary. Facing all the emotions of a woman… it’s a bit much. It’s completely fine if it’s just as friends.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I talk with female friends at school, and there’s that friendly junior at this shop, and on holidays, I even hang out with Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That kind of relationship, up to the level of friendship, is fine. But anything more…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because having stronger emotions directed at me is…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Moreover, it’s not like Raihara-san likes me in that way. Even at first, I was just a suitable partner for her simulations.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But after that, you two became quite close, right? To the point where she comes over to your house to take care of you and cook for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s just a person who likes taking care of others. And, haha, if you’re talking about her coming to my house, she has also seen my pathetic side. So there’s no way she’d like someone like me romantically.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pathetic side?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To my uncle’s inquiry, I respond with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t remember it very well because of the fever, but when Raihara-san was taking care of me, I have this memory of crying… I don’t think I was feeling sad or hurt, but for some reason, the tears just wouldn’t stop.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What was that about, I wonder? I still don’t get it. But anyway, she wouldn’t be into such a pitiful guy, right… Uncle?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You… Well, I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My uncle remained silent for a few seconds, looking down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, he lifted his face and spoke in his usual light-hearted manner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, relationships in general are important. Even if you don’t become a couple, having friends of the opposite sex is valuable. Leaving aside the matter of becoming lovers, isn’t it okay to try and close the gap just a bit more?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Absolutely. Knowing you, haven’t you refrained from sharing much about yourself with her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, now that you mention it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon reflection… I might not have actually shared much about myself with her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha, hit the mark, didn’t I? Indeed, the conventional approach when talking to women is ‘just listen to them,’ and with that, you can please 99.9% of them. But don’t forget, there’s that remaining 0.1%.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is Raihara-san the 0.1%?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I have more confidence in understanding women than in my coffee brewing skills. You can see something like her true nature once you talk about yourself to a certain extent.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t think this is something a barista who has won prizes in the world barista competition would say, but that’s why it’s so convincing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Try telling her something you’d think she wouldn’t necessarily want to know. Starting with that is good, even before discussing dropping formalities.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that how it is?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, you could talk about some recent unusual event or your favorite movies. Oh, have you gone to see movies? Surely you’ve talked about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We have, in a way.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, tell her about my favorite movie instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why would that be the case?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s a mysterious line of logic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The movies you frequently watch, Uncle, they’re non-fiction war movies, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, while I do like them, that’s not my favorite. No, no. Listen and make sure to convey this to Raihara-san. My favorite title is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After the detailed introduction, the name my uncle mentioned was a bit unexpected.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Uncle, I didn’t know you liked that kind of movie…</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clank-</p>
<p class="calibre5">A clattering sound came from the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems Mom is back. The time is 10 PM. I, who had been doing my assignments in my room, went to greet her at the entrance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom, welcome back.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mom, looking down as she took off her shoes, eventually raised her head and shouted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why did you lock the door?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She threw the key case she was holding in her hand towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It whizzed by and narrowly missed my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why did you lock the door?! You knew I was coming back! Why didn’t you leave it open for me? Misa feels so sad!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Misa is my mother’s name.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When she’s emotional, she refers to herself by her first name.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I didn’t know when you’d be back…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Normally, mom stays over at her boyfriend’s place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her returns are irregular.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I thought I had texted you on the phone…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Mom silently checked her smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There should probably be a message from me asking for her return.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…You could have just left it open!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Um, last time when I did as you said and left it open, you scolded me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Why can’t you just lock the door?!’ It was fairly recent when she hurled a shoe at me for that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mom?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why do you get angry so quickly…? That’s not what Misa’s talking about… Misa just didn’t like coming home tired and finding the door locked… Why do you talk to Misa like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not angry, I’m sorry, the way I said that was wrong…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t use that tone! You’re obviously angry!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mom scolded me and headed for the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She took a seat with a thud, and without looking back at me who followed, she said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I just want to be asked, ‘What do you want to eat?’ when I come home tired.” (TN: Not using Misa.)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry… what do you want to eat?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s too late!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The TV remote control on the table was thrown at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It missed over my head, hitting the wall and bouncing onto the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Pick it up!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I had picked it up before she said anything, she would’ve gotten angry, saying, ‘Stop doing that so deliberately in front of me! It’s sarcastic!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a difficult situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pasta! The Neapolitan one!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As instructed, I started cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Fortunately, during this time, Mom only quietly fiddles with her phone, which is a relief.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ever since I was young, whenever I hear my mother&mdash;or now any woman&mdash;shouting, I instantly break out into an uncomfortable sweat and find it hard to move.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Therefore, I can’t make the dish properly if she does that while I’m cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Luckily, Mom kept looking at her smartphone, and since I had the ingredients in the fridge, the dish she ordered was ready after a short while.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I placed it on the table, she picked up her fork and hesitantly took a bite.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she began to cry softly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why… why are you like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s just a small thing, just please do it right… Why can’t you do it properly?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If it was Takkun, it wouldn’t be like this… Why? This isn’t made properly like Takkun would… Why can’t you make anything right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems my effort wasn’t satisfactory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Takkun refers to my father.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He passed away when I was young, so I don’t remember the taste of his cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Would it have been better if I remembered?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I don’t think so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t you have any talent in anything? Why can’t you do it like Takkun? Stop it, why are you like this…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do it properly… just do it properly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘You’re not talented at anything you do. At least do it properly. Why can’t you do that?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">All throughout the meal, Mom kept saying that, and I had no words to respond.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, Mom left the kitchen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was grateful that today, at least, she didn’t throw any plates.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There had been times when they hit me in the wrong places, causing various troubles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I began doing the dishes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…mm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The smartphone I placed on the table vibrated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A quick glance at the screen showed it was from my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s probably about work shifts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, I remembered a conversation I had with my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He said I could get closer to Raihara-san as a friend and should try telling her more about myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For instance, any recent unusual events.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Unusual events.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There aren’t any.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s mostly just my usual routine, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary has happened&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, Chifuji-san, did something happen today? …Do you, um, have something to tell me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I asked Chifuji-san this question, my heart was beating incredibly fast, not in a good excited way, but with intense tension.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes? …Um.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s our usual Sunday outing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We meet around ten, and now we’re having lunch together, but he’s been acting strange since the start.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He seems like he wants to say something to me but then stops himself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, he’s not doing it too overtly, but I’m the kind of girl who would plant listening devices in someone’s home, so my observational skills are probably sharper than most. So I noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And… yes, a listening device.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That…I’d appreciate it if you’d speak freely.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Did he perhaps notice it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s so kind; he’s probably struggling with how to broach the topic. It must be that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since the day I planted it and went to the park, I haven’t listened to it again, even once.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that doesn’t mean it’s naturally forgiven.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, It’s not about what to do; I’ve done something I shouldn’t have, in other words, I am &mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Wow, did you see through me? How embarrassing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No…that’s not it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, Raihara-san… Ehm… This is hard to say, but… Do you have any questions about me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m being so self-conscious about this… The thing is…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san explained, a bit bashfully, that the store manager, who is also his uncle, had advised him, ‘Why don’t you tell Raihara-san a bit more about yourself?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">He wanted to tell me, but couldn’t think of what to talk about.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It wasn’t about the listening device.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, I wasn’t sure what to share. The more I thought about it, the more confused I became. So, I wondered if maybe you could ask me something instead…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san continued hesitantly in front of me, looking more and more embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then he continued,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…The more I explain, the more embarrassing it becomes. I’m overly self-conscious and indecisive. …What do you think? I’ll answer anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Anything?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I reacted strongly to that word.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Look at how shallow I am…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, but… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anything?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anything!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anything…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thoughts raced through my mind at an incredible speed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A significant portion of them was painted in an unspeakable pink hue of lust, which I immediately shook off with vigor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Calm down… Calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all&mdash;&mdash;I had already given up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Rather, a no-good woman like me shouldn’t be beside someone like Chifuji-san. So, I decided to lock away these feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Haha, I intend to answer anything, so if you have any questions, don’t hesitate.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though I had decided that!</p>
<p class="calibre5">It felt like there were two of me inside.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both were unmistakably me, but one of them was noisy…</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘What type of woman do you prefer?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Wouldn’t it be bad to ask that?!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Too direct? Isn’t that practically a confession? Or maybe not?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe casually say, ‘Well… hehe, I’m curious about what type of person Chifuji-san prefers. You never talk about that kind of thing, so I’m curious!’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, isn’t that good? This feels right!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Okay, maybe I’ll ask it&mdash;&mdash;but if I let my guard down, my consciousness will drift to the shamefully sinful side of me and I<br class="chapter-warning" />‘ll get carried away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I shouldn’t say it, I mustn’t.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ahaha, I guess you don’t have anything to ask me after all,”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, no, no, no, it’s not like that!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m just silent, giving him the wrong impression!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to make him think like that!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No! Wait a moment! There’s a glitch in my personality!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“G-glitch in your personality…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Future plans!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The word that my rapidly thinking mind came up with was those words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Future plans! I’ve always wanted to know what Chifuji-san plans to do after high school graduation!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somewhat pressed by my mysterious insistence, Chifuji-san nodded his head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a reasonable and interesting topic, yet also appropriate for high school students.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I believe I managed to come up with something decent on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I also did want to know about his future plans.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve never discussed this with Chifuji-san before.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, I plan to go to university. I’m still a bit undecided about my top choice, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. There are many options when it comes to universities.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. And Chifuji-san is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to work.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Work?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no hierarchy between pursuing further studies and finding a job, and I don’t have any particular thoughts on that matter, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san’s school is a college-prep school, right? I had the impression that not many choose that path.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, it might not be common, it’s been many years since I’ve heard someone do that. Actually, my teachers have been advising me to reconsider for a long time… but I thought it might be better to start working soon and bring more money into the house.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…It’s a topic I’m hesitant to delve into, probably due to family circumstances.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Besides, no matter what I do, I feel I don’t have talent. I don’t think there’s enough potential growth in me to justify going to college. So, I feel it might be better to get a job and at least earn some money.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san, you often say that, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That you don’t have talent in anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as he needs to be ‘proper’, this sentiment occasionally escapes his lips.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If there’s something I wanted to ask Chifuji-san, it’s that. I’ve always been curious. Why do you think that way?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Why? …Hmm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san’s face seems to indicate he’s been caught off guard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After freezing for a moment, he bows his head in thought.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s because… uh, just because… To be honest, I’m full of flaws.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…But you attend a college-prep school, you’re relied upon at your part-time job, and from what I’ve seen, you’re also good at sports, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, I barely manage in my studies. At the part-time job, I’m simply the most experienced there, and as for sports, it’s nothing impressive. My physical strength isn’t particularly great either.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-san continues with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In real life, I’ve always struggled with everything… haha, if there’s one thing I can be proud of, it’s that I’ve been lucky with the people I’ve met.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Lucky…with the people you’ve met?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“At both school and my part-time job, everyone around me is kind. They don’t get mad at me and even flatter and praise me. I always think I’m fortunate.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t it a bit strange?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What Chifuji-san is saying makes sense, but there seems to be something inherently skewed about that logic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s strangely reluctant to recognize his own worth&mdash;&mdash;no, that’s not it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like he’s already concluded that he’s worthless, and it’s as if he’s twisting all his perceptions to match that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It may be humility that is typical of this person, but… can it really be called humility?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“At home, I’ve always been a burden to my mother. I’ve constantly caused trouble for my uncle as well. At the part-time job, I sometimes nag him about minor things, but still, he has always taken care of me. All things considered, I’ve only been on the receiving end.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I, I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes…Ah, speaking of my uncle, it reminds me of something. Well, it’s not related to our current conversation.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Did something happen to the manager?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When we were talking about movies, for some reason, he said, ‘Tell Raihara-san about my favorite movie.’ I have no idea why.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Um, what?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, probably just one of his high-level jokes. He sometimes says weird things… by the way, the title he mentioned was unexpected.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now that he mentions it, being someone interested in movies, I’m curious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What was the title?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, it’s not some hidden masterpiece. On the contrary, it’s super famous. It’s ‘Alien vs. Predator 1.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, a renowned film.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The clear stance of ‘Fight a monster with a monster!’ is immediately conveyed from the title.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It has the impression of being one of the pioneering films about monstrous confrontations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t think my uncle was the type to enjoy such flashy blockbusters, but maybe that’s just my own assumption. You never really know… Hmm, I wonder if his past girlfriends knew about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, our impressions of someone can change a lot depending on who’s looking.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I suddenly realized from my own words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That’s right, it might be the same for Chifuji-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What I’ve heard today is the story of himself from his perspective.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wanted to hear about Chifuji-san from someone else’s perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because, no matter what, the image Chifuji-san paints of himself seems skewed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And within that distortion, I feel there’s something crucial that shouldn’t be overlooked.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Now, who should I ask?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, are you leaving too, Kusakabe-san? What about the soccer club today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m the only one taking a break today… I slightly strained my calf muscle yesterday, so I was told I’m not allowed to participate today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon hearing my response at the school’s exit after classes, my classmate Chifuji-kun’s mature-looking face clouded over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh… Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, totally, totally! It’s not a big deal. It’s mostly due to overtraining and accumulated fatigue. It’s like I got told, ‘You seriously need to rest!'”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see, that’s a relief then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, Chifuji-kun let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s genuinely a great guy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-kun, you’re working your part-time job again today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. I’m going to earn some money.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s amazing~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having such a conversation, we walked together for a while and then parted ways at the school gate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Chifuji-kun, who seems to live within walking distance, and I, who heads to the station, go in entirely different directions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">… Our school, despite being a college-preparatory institution, also promotes excellence in both academics and sports.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are many prominent clubs, and it’s not uncommon for students like me to be heavily involved in sports.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, because it is still a college-preparatory school, I didn’t know anyone else who dedicated their after-school time to part-time jobs as much as Chifuji-kun did.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He doesn’t seem to be planning on going to college, but he probably has his reasons…</p>
<p class="calibre5">With such thoughts on my mind while walking home, I was suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Kusakabe-san, it’s been a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That voice and figure almost made my heart stop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A strange sound came from my throat, something like ‘Hyuu.(sfx)’</p>

<p class="calibre5">The person standing before me, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, was…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. Sorry for surprising you out of the blue. I didn’t mean to startle you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara Amane. A classmate from junior high.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For a period, she was the manager of our club.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Compared to the image in my memory, her body now has more feminine curves, and her face now also possesses beauty on top of retaining its cuteness from back then.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Without a doubt, it’s Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s someone I’m very grateful to and, for some reason, a person I feel trauma about.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine, it’s…uh, quite a coincidence. Wait, do you live around here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, well, it’s not really a coincidence… I came to see you, Kusakabe-san. I figured you commute by train, so I thought I’d run into you if I waited along the route to the station.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She came to see me?… Why?</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, since graduation, we haven’t been in touch even once.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Moreover, after the incident which made it seem like she was driven out of the club, we hardly spoke to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why now, after all this time…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..? Kusakabe-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is a reason, right?!</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s right, I just recently talked about Raihara-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ch-Chifuji-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thump! One step closer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment I uttered that name, Raihara-san closed the distance between us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the reddening world of the evening with the setting sun casting dark shadows on her, Raihara-san stared intently at me with her big eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They were like a bottomless swamp, mysteriously deep and dark.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…are you two close?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-well, uh, … he’s, he’s my classmate.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just a classmate, I see… But I’m glad. It was the right decision to come and ask you for a favor.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ask? Did she just say ‘ask for avor’?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san did? …I don’t remember anything like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Actually, I’ve been helped by Chifuji-san, and, …I wanted to, …you know, learn a bit more about him.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san said, with a shy expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering her stunningly beautiful face, it should unquestionably look cute, but for some reason, I can’t simply see it that way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“And then, I remembered that Kusakabe-san went to the same high school as Chifuji-san. You know, in our school, almost everyone advances internally using the elevator system, so it was rare, and that’s why I remembered you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yes…wait, you didn’t come here to be angry, did you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Angry? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, because I, um, told Chifuji-kun about what happened during our junior high club activities without thinking…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait, did I just dig my own grave? No, did I just put my foot in my mouth?</p>
<p class="calibre5">But, right, Chifuji-kun isn’t the type of person who would spread around that someone told him something like that, is he?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see, Chifuji-san… he knew.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m, I’m sorry… It was my fault…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine. It’s not something to hide… rather, I’m glad you told him.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…She’s not angry?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I’ve never seen Raihara-san angry in the first place… But the reason I find her intimidating isn’t because she’s probably very scary when she’s mad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s because she’s so kind, so overwhelmingly so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, still… I’m really sorry for talking without permission…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay, don’t worry about it… But you see, I’m sorry too. I want to ask you to ‘talking without permission’ again…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Could you please do it for me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can I… refuse?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve been in the same class as Chifuji-kun since my first year and now in my third year. I know him as a classmate, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I want to hear it, please tell me. I want to know about Chifuji-san from Kusakabe-san’s perspective.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Moving to a bench in a nearby park and sitting side by side, Raihara-san says in a quiet voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Also, if possible, tell me everything you remember… Can you tell me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can I? This is tough…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I don’t have that good of a memory… But, Raihara-san… you like Chifuji-kun, I guess? Just to confirm that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That… yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s so straightforwardly cute… Cute, but also really sultry…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What about Kusakabe-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? No, no, no! I’m not! I’m just a friend. A really good one, at that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see… That’s good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san seems relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m also glad I don’t have to compete with such a beauty over a guy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, looking at Raihara-san now, I truly feel that it’s not about whether I can win or lose against her, but that making her an enemy would be a really bad idea.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“As for Chifuji-kun… Like I mentioned earlier, he’s a good guy, isn’t he? He’s kind and considerate, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen him genuinely angry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seems pleased.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Maybe it’s because he works part-time? He always takes the initiative and is always dependable. He does seem a bit mature, I guess… Right, he’s not the overly outgoing type, but he feels more mature than those around him. He doesn’t seem like a typical high school student.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What about his studies…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“His grades are good. He should be ranked quite high. He’s serious in class.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And sports?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, he doesn’t do any club activities, but I feel like he was quite active during the sports festival. I wonder if he plays soccer…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Regardless of sports or studies, he manages to do everything smoothly. If I were to exaggerate a bit, he seems like a guy who can do anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san seems lost in thought about my answers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe that was unexpected?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“As for other things… He’s popular among girls. I mean, it’s not surprising. There’s no reason a mature, considerate guy wouldn’t be popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She sounds incredibly conflicted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But he doesn’t have a girlfriend and probably hasn’t been in a relationship either. Also, as far as I know in our school, I don’t think anyone has confessed their feelings to him.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-kun goes straight to his part-time job after school. It’s rare for someone in our school to be that committed to work, so people probably guess that he has some sort of circumstance. And with that, they might feel that he wouldn’t prioritize a relationship.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“More importantly, it’s hard to close the distance with him. Many girls have asked male friends close to Chifuji-kun to invite him out, but I don’t think anyone has succeeded.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s pretty much invulnerable in that sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From what I know, female classmates aiming for Chifuji-kun probably think that since he’s likely busy preparing for entrance exams, they should focus on their studies for now and then confess their feelings on graduation day, even if it means facing rejection.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, it was actually a bit of surprising news at school when Chifuji-kun was spotted hanging out with a girl on a holiday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, the friend who told me about it had asked me to find out more details.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, there are rumors that Raihara-san goes out with Chifuji-kun, but how did she manage to get that close to him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s surprising.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…but I’m afraid to ask because it might stir up unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So, no one’s confessed. I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After a long pause, Raihara-san, deep in thought, finally asked me:</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you think Chifuji-san is aware that he’s popular among the girls?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ummm, I wonder? I get the impression he might not really realize it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…This is a girl thing, but there’s also a sentiment like, ‘Chifuji-kun is probably busy with various things, so let’s not approach him directly and inconvenience him!’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san seemed to quickly understand as well, but of course, that’s just a facade.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In reality, it’s a truce formed from a shared sense of urgency that says, ‘Right now, it seems like it’d be pointless to actively approach or confess to him, so I want to maintain the status quo. But it would be the worst if someone reckless other than myself were to swoop in and succeed during this time.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Needless to say, in the world of women, there’s nothing more terrifying than breaking these unspoken rules that have somehow formed among everyone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’ve been on the receiving end of those glares too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just recently! Chifuji-kun seemed like he had a fever, so I instinctively placed my hand on his forehead to check. Then, I got this ‘What are you doing?’ kind of look. I have a younger brother who often gets fevers, so I just did it out of habit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, shoot. Raihara-san is like that too…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, given such a tacit agreement is in place now, maybe he doesn’t realize he’s popular? To begin with, he seems to have low self-esteem.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He has a low self-esteem… Kusakabe-san thinks so too?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. He seems like the type to brush off compliments, thinking they’re just flattery.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why is that, I wonder?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No need to say thank you, that’s all I know about Chifuji-kun from my perspective. I don’t know anything else…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I owe Raihara-san for helping me out in the past, but on the flip side, I also feel guilty for seemingly repaying her kindness with betrayal by having her kicked out of the club.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, wanting to somehow be of help, I vigorously searched my mind, repeating ‘Chifuji-kun, Chifuji-kun’ like search keywords.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What came up was…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, if I had to say… he might have quite a few unusual injuries.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Injuries?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Though I’ve never seen Chifuji-kun trip or bump into anything at school…It seems like he’s quite clumsy.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“As far as I know, he’s broken his bones at least twice. Both times, it wasn’t at school but at home. I think he broke a rib in his first year? He had to skip PE for a while. And at the end of his second year, it was either his left or right hand… was it his right hand?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We were in different classes at that time, but I remember being surprised when I saw him with a cast in the hallway.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Injuries… injuries… injuries?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Could it be… No.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I unintentionally gasped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the second time today, a sharp intake of breath escaped from my throat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…If that’s the case, then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve always been afraid of this quietly murmuring person ever since that summer in middle school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I once told Chifuji-kun, she feels like a completely different kind of creature from the rest of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her seemingly boundless compassion becomes more incredible the more I understand it&mdash;&mdash;so gentle and warm, yet so elusive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sometimes think she’s truly a different entity from us, and therefore her deep-seated motivations, thought processes, and even ethics might operate on an entirely different system.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe that’s why she’s so hard to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I know it’s impossible for that to be true, such fantasies somehow make sense.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…If that’s the case, then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san murmurs the same words once more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The strangeness I felt from her kindness, I can now recognize it in the coldness of her voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve never seen her angry, and she’s unusually kind to the point where I can’t imagine her ever being otherwise, but precisely because of that…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“R-Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At this moment, I didn’t know what she was going to do.</p>
