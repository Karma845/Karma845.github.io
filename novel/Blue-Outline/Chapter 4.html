<h2>Chapter 4: The Promise Between Me and the Princess' Older Sister</h2>

<p class="calibre5">Several weeks have passed since Touka-san returned to the future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems she had said her goodbyes over the phone, but my parents are still saddened over Touka-san’s departure from our home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To tell the truth, I’m lonely without Touka-san too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I don’t have time for regrets right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I made a promise with Touka-san; she entrusted me with Natsumi-san and the Himegi family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I don’t have time to wallow in sadness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I’ve been visiting Natsumi-san in the hospital frequently recently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sometimes with Kanako, sometimes with Takashi Harukawa, and at times, I took my own parents to visit Natsumi-san’s hospital room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think Natsumi-san was happy to see us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the very least, she didn’t seem to find it bothersome.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But reality is indeed cruel; Natsumi-san’s condition worsened each time I visited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, she even had difficulty walking on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, Natsumi-san was discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No explanation was given, but I understood that she wasn’t discharged because she had recovered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Probably, it was for spending her limited remaining time in the place where she was born and raised.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, it meant that Natsumi-san didn’t have much time left.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A few days after she returned to her mansion, I was invited to the Himegi estate under the pretense of a ‘discharge celebration.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unlike Harune-chan’s birthday party, today’s gathering was a small indoor party.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t as large as Harune-chan’s birthday party, but it seemed that several dozen people were invited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, that included both me and Kanako.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There were also friends of Natsumi-san, and people who appeared to be her former mentors.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At Natsumi-san’s request, I was set to perform magic tricks in front of everyone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My partner for today was not Himegi-san but Natsumi-san, who was in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This was also at her request.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though she’s the guest of honor and the one supposed to be entertained, she wants to entertain others; Himegi Natsumi must be inherently someone who enjoys making people happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, I will bend the spoon that Natsumi-san is holding using telekinesis…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I casually twirl the wand in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the spoon in Natsumi-san’s hand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hakuba-kun, it’s not bending?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, my apologies. It seems I didn’t focus enough.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I twirl the wand in my hand once again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hakuba-kun, it’s still not bending…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Th-that’s strange? Then, let’s try once more.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pretend to be flustered. Of course, it’s all an act&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Harune’s spoon is bending!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Ah! Takakyun, look, look, my spoon is bending too!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems I accidentally bent someone else’s spoon. It can’t be helped. Natsumi-san, can you shake that spoon with all your might?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay. &mdash;&mdash;Hya!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then the spoon she was holding&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! It changed into a fork!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Laughter and applause arise from the audience.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san, who is next to me, is also giggling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The most joyous part of performing magic tricks is being able to see people’s smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no time when I feel more glad to have learned magic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Afterward, I performed various tricks using bills, coins, and cards and turned a water-filled bottle upside down without the water falling out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Each trick brought laughter from the audience.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today’s magic was focused more on making people laugh rather than surprising them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought that would make both Natsumi-san and everyone else happier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, I’m glad I went with that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t make the wrong choice this time. And as the enjoyable party ended, I was in the garden with Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was sitting on a wooden bench, and she was next to me in her wheelchair, holding a white frog plushie I had seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, it was a gift from Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you for today. It was fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m glad everyone enjoyed it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She had a silver bracelet on her left arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both Himegi-san and Harune-chan had the same bracelets.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems the sisters decided to wear matching items.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely, these bracelets are a testament to the sisters’ bond.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m really glad everyone enjoyed it. If I had messed up, I would’ve had to take off this wig (カツラ, katsura).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“At least call it a wig (ウィッグ,wiggu).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’m glad it didn’t happen.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A pleasant wind blows.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The grass sways, and the sound of insects can be heard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Spring is almost over…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san closes her eyes, feeling the spring breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely, for her, spring is a season that will never come again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking about it makes parting even more painful…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You passed!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Uh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I said, you passed. I can entrust Touka, my family, to you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hakuba-kun, this is the moment where you should be happy…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, you’re right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m genuinely happy to have received approval from Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think there’s nothing more honorable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, now I can somewhat understand the feelings of Harune-chan when she tried to run away from the birthday party.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I might have experienced the first real pressure in my life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Are you feeling pressured?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I would be lying if I said no. But I made a promise to Touka-san, so I intend to face my responsibilities until the end.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I don’t have a shred of confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m also overwhelmed by anxiety about whether I’ll end up being self-complacent again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even so, I can’t disregard the feelings of Touka-san and Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And Touka-san told me. She said I am a person who uses his own abilities for the smiles of others.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to make those words a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I’ve decided to keep my promise to the two of them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s fine-that’s just fine. But, I just don’t want you to misunderstand one thing: I want you to remain as you are. Please, stay as you are.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I understand. I know I cannot become your substitute, Natsumi-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay to be uncertain. It’s alright to fail. It’s fine even if you can’t meet my expectations. However, I want you to share a bit of the pain with the family I loved. I understand I’m asking something hard, but even so, in the end, I want to choose you. Please make me feel happy that I made the right choice, that I chose you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed my short words satisfied Natsumi-san, and she smiled gently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, she really does have a wonderful smile, as expected of Himegi-san’s older sister…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you… Indeed, treasures do lie in the most terrifying caves.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What does that mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Someday, Touka will tell you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it some kind of spell? Or maybe a quote from someone?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, even from a sister’s perspective, I think a man like Hakuba-kun suits a type like Touka the best. After all, my younger sister has more pride than anyone else yet is also more delicate than anyone. I can be at ease if a man who can be attentive like you is by her side.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I feel the same way, I do suit her best…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha… geez… Now, let’s go back to the room. The night wind is too harsh for the sick girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, you’re right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s regrettable but… that’s it for today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I escorted her to her room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Until I escorted her to the room, Natsumi-san and I talked about various things with smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Episodes from Natsumi-san’s student days and stories from when Himegi-san and the others were little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also told her various things. I spoke about why I aspired to perform magic, what I was doing before I performed magic, and about the siblings who would be born from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a fun time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since I’m an only child, I wondered if having a sister would feel like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If the relationship between Natsumi-san and me continues from now on, I wonder what kind of siblings-in-law we will become…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Would we be able to laugh together as we do now?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought it would be nice if so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If so, I felt it would be happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I understand in my head that such a day won’t come, but still, I desired such a future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because… I know that future would be the best one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A clever youngest child, a slightly clumsy second daughter who is the exact opposite of that, a moody father with a gentle mother, and lastly, the eldest daughter, always smiling, is at the center of everyone with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a perfect family composition.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It would be nearly impossible to score full marks in any other way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, reaching the room, we waved at each other with smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We promised to meet again and exchanged farewells between her and me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;But it didn’t happen that way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">God did not allow the continuation of the story, and the paths of her and me had the curtain fall here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This became the last conversation between Natsumi-san and me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This was the last goodbye between Natsumi and me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She left this world soon after June arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the Himegi house&mdash;&mdash;the sun disappeared.</p>
