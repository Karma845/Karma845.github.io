<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eye-catching. Stunning. Addictive. Mesmerizing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t like it. It’s disgusting. It’s the best. It’s the worst. I’m enthralled. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those were the impressions that people have when they look at a picture by Kashiwazaki Yuri. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinary people’s drawings could only be judged by how good or bad they were, but Yuri’s drawings had an overwhelming lure and charm that reminded everyone of something. No matter if they were highly rated or not, they grasped people’s eyes and hearts, and never let go. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was why her paintings were so highly regarded, and she had been given the title of “genius” since she was little. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her specialty was oil painting, but specialty or not, she excelled in all arts. She had been attracting the attention of the industry’s big shots since the first grade, when she started taking painting class. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wasn’t there a saying “When the light is stronger, the shadows become more intense”? I probably got the saying wrong. But the point was that it was always the ordinary people like me who were in the shadow of the genius. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Yuri was my childhood friend, our families were also close. Today, we went shopping at a nearby shopping center with our mothers, as Yuri was planning to have a meal at my house this evening. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a bit crowded around the exhibition hall, isn’t it? The plan was just to take a peek at Sousuke-chan and Yuu-chan’s paintings, but it seems to take a while.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: “Chan” was used to call a child affectionately, regardless of sex]</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shopping center had a special stage set up for the Mother’s Day event every year. Even though it was called a stage; it was no more than a simple display of pictures of mothers drawn by our local elementary school children, the Maimori Elementary. Our mothers who came to the exhibition were bewildered by the unexpected crowd. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had predicted this, I knew the exact reason why people were stopping by one after another, accumulating into a crowd. In a small town like this, where most people had no interest in art, there was only one thing that could have attracted this much attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we finally got into the exhibition hall and saw Yuri’s drawing, I was struck again by the overwhelming beauty, even though I had already seen it once in the classroom. In a room full of smiling portraits drawn with colored pencils, Yuri’s mother was not smiling benevolently, nor was she trying to be funny with her devil horns. This was different, a masterpiece that could only be achieved by Yuri’s ability to correctly depict the texture of skin and hair of a woman in her early thirties with her excellent observation skills. No doubt, everyone who saw this painting would be reminded of their own mothers, wanting to see and greet them, love them, remembering their anger or resentment, or feeling all kinds of emotions towards their mother, whether good or bad. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was always the audience who fussed of it being a masterpiece or a monstrosity, the artist herself was just enjoying painting the portrait. Looking at the crowd around the painting as if it did not relate to her, Yuri laughed next to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mom said she wouldn’t be able to come shopping here for a while. She’s just a normal old lady, but she’s enjoying this like a celebrity.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Whose fault did you think it was?’ I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had learned that geniuses who lacked self-awareness could cause havoc to those around them, and I too, would be suffering from her presence for years to come. </span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every citizen of Japan probably associated Hokkaido; Japan’s northernmost island, with extreme cold and snow. The city we lived in, Maimori City, which was located in the central part of Hokkaido with a population of less than 70,000, was no exception to this. The winters were so cold that people of all ages, men and women, were sent out to shovel snow. For ten years I had lived in this town, yet I could not remember a single time when I had ever enjoyed winter. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gee, it’s snowing again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring came late in Hokkaido. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not unusual for it to snow during the graduation season, or even the entrance season, and cherry blossoms were out of the question. Sakura bloomed in May here. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Elsewhere, Sakura usually blooms in March]</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My shoulders slumped as I realized that the new shoes I had gotten as a fourth-grade graduation gift would get soiled on the first day of school. But then gushed over the sight of an old dog sleeping in the shed across the street from us, which somehow reminded me of my father lounging on the kotatsu table. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next time, I might use that dog as a model for my next drawing. Regaining my vigor, I waved to the sleeping dog and ran out on the snowy road. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started going to painting classes a while after I started elementary school, so it has been almost five years now. To the surprise of my parents, who were thinking something along the lines of “He might like drawing, but there are tons of other fun stuff to do. He’s going to quit soon”, I’m still obsessed with drawing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned at the corner of the dry-cleaning shop and continued straight ahead to a small park. As I was walking past the park like usual, I paused. When I saw my childhood friend leaning against a jungle gym, silently drawing in the powdery snow, I had no choice but to call out to her. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, what are you drawing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She swept her big cat-like eyes across me once, then her gaze immediately returned to her sketchbook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuki-onna. I’ve been thinking about how a Yuki-onna in April could be a bit too late, and that’s when the image came to me.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Yuki-onna, a yokai/demon in Japanese folklore]</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bit too late… Are you a little irritated that it snowed at the start of the new school year, in your own way?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took a peek at her sketchbook, I saw a beautiful perfectly proportioned woman in a kimono smoking a cigarette on a swing. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Word “Hattoushin” is used in the original text, Japanese body standard]</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People who were not familiar with painting would probably be attracted to the mismatch between the character and the action and found it interesting, but people like me who had learnt a little bit about painting would be astonished by the details of the drawing.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing that amazed me was that it could be depicted as completely natural without any sense of discomfort. If the bones and muscles were not drawn correctly, you would unconsciously notice them. In addition, the shading added by the pencil alone was so accurate that the border between reality and the picture blurred. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a rough sketch, drawn in a few minutes on the way to school, and yet it was so good that I could not believe it was drawn by someone my age. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adults always used the word “genius” to describe Yuri’s drawings, regardless of whether they were praising or criticizing. That’s why I hated that word. I had started going to art classes before Yuri did. I loved to draw as much as she did. But everyone just looked at her.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jealousy had always churn in my chest at times like this. I tried to calm down, letting the cold air into my lungs as I inhaled the powdery snow along with it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have to go to school now. Cut it out, or we’ll be late.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri ignored me as if being late for school was perfectly normal. Troubled, I scratched my head. Whenever she found something she wanted to draw, she would keep working on it until she was satisfied. At this rate, she would be drawing here for the rest of the day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A part of me wanted to see the finished work as soon as possible, but today was the first day of fifth grade. It was not a good idea for her to be late on the first day of school. She had already been getting a lot of attention from the teachers for her bad attitude. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to use the last resort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure you don’t know this because you missed the spring break animal caretaking duty, but there’s a new transfer student coming to our class today. It’s a girl from Kansai!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? What’s she like? Come on, let’s go, Sousuke!” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word “transfer student” was just so rare and just as appealing in this rural town. Her eyes instantly lit up, she then shoved her sketchbook into her school bag and ran off through the snow. I picked up the knit cap she left behind and chased after her, staring at the distant back that carries everything I could ever want. Brimming with curiosity, self-absorbed, free-spirited and genius… Kashiwazaki Yuri was that kind of person. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the attention of the whole class, the girl introduced herself in a muzzy voice like a mosquito, and with a face as red as an apple. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m… Utako Kashii…Nice…to meet you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kashii, who had been moving around the country because of her mother’s circumstances, had been in Kansai just until the other day. She was a girl who spoke timidly. When we saw her blush and turn her head down the instant she stood out, we who were filled with the naive impression that she was cheerful and funny just because she came from Kansai were disappointed and lost interest in her in no time. In less than a week, Kashii had become an easy prey for the boys in our class because of her timid nature. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I suspected that about half of them were guys who were just trying to hit on their crush. Kashii had bangs that covered her eyes, but if you looked closely, you could see that her eyes were big, and her nose was well-defined</span>, and her skin was snow white<span>. S</span>he was short, but that was what made her look like a cute cuddly animal.</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was keeping an eye on those who were making fun of Kashii, but what could I say? I was also one of those who thought she was cute. I felt protective of her, and since I was always around a boisterous girl like Yuri, I had a good reason to be attracted to the more reserved Kashii. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Yuri, when it came to Kashii whose personality was completely her opposite, after losing her initial curiosity, Yuri did not seem to be interested in her. However, she would help her out if she ran into her while she was being teased by the boys. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys can only be so cocky in front of girls who look like chihuahuas like this? You guys are so dumb.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! &#8230;How we treat Kashii is none of your business!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! “It’s none of your business!”? Are you saying that how you treat your classmates is none of my business? How sad. Well then, it shouldn’t be any of my business if I am to beat you guys into a pulp. Just think of me as a random street thug or something, after all it’s none of my business .” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk. Let’s go, you guys!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way that Yuri would lose in that kind of trivial fight, no matter with her words nor with her physical strength. As a result, Yuri was always protecting Kashii.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teachers and the parents praised her for her actions, but she was not just acting out of a simple sense of justice, such as “can’t stand bullies bullying the weak”.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was doing it because she was just bored, or because she was in a bad mood, or for some other self-centered reasons. But to me, what she did was just plain cool. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you…Kashiwazaki-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t do it for you, Kashii. You don’t have to thank me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yuri protected Kashii, her face would turn red as she repeatedly thanked Yuri, to which Yuri replied in a bothered tone. My impression of the two of them, or you could say, their relationship, was as simple as that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without the ulterior motive, I could not leave her alone as she became even more isolated from class. Finally, I decided to actively approach Kashii who was reading a book alone in her seat during the lunch break, having failed to make any friends even after Golden Week had passed.  </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Golden week, Japanese holiday around late April-May, usually students should be able to make new friends by this time] </b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kashii, what are you reading?”  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly spoken to, Kashii’s eyes widened and she blushed again, then answered in a small voice. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s…a book about astronomy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the paper were illustrations of stars shining in the night sky and explanations in small letters.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks like a very difficult book. You like them that much?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… Yes, I like them very much.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? I only know the Big Dipper, the Great Triangle of Summer and the major constellations, the famous ones. What do you find interesting about it?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was meant to be just a casual question, but Kashii’s large eyes, hidden by her bangs, seemed to sparkle.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are different types of stars,” she said, “although they may all look the same. There are stars that shine on their own, planets, and satellites that shine by reflecting the light of stars…No two stars are the same size, nor do they exist at the same distance from Earth. Every star is unique and fascinating…I’m very, very fascinated by them.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I have ever seen Kashii speaking so smoothly. More importantly, her smile was much prettier than I could ever imagine. I felt my heartbeat rushing the way I had never felt before.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, are you aiming to be an astronomer or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I want to be an astronaut because I want to see the stars more closely than anyone else. So, I have to graduate from the most famous university possible, and I have to be able to speak English. There are a lot of things I need to work on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chance of becoming an astronaut was very slim. It was a fact that even I know. But that shy Kashii was not intimidated in the slightest and spoke about her dream without hesitation.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that Kashii was very smart. She had never failed to answer a question in class, and the teachers had always praised her for getting perfect scores on tests. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had already decided on her future dream. She had already done her research on what she needed to do to get there, and she was willing to put in the effort. I was overwhelmed by the amount of passion that radiated from her small body.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woww, reading a book about the stars alone at recess&#8230; Are you the definition of a literary girl?”  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to savor the admiration for just a little longer, but the moment was gone. Annoyed by the familiar voice, I turned around, eyeing Yuri who was examining Kashii’s book.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing? And don’t just butt into someone else’s conversation, will you?” I said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kashii’s number is next to mine, so this is my seat. So, you’re the one who’s in the way, Sousuke.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept silent at Yuri’s sound argument. Kashii tilted her head slightly, looked at Yuri and she then continued. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-definition of literacy girl…? Anyway, I really like astronomy. There might be a difference in brightness, but no matter the star, it still shines…I am plain, I have nothing I could proudly show others,…But this…I guess it’s something I’ve always wanted, what I’ve always yearned for.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised to see Kashii trying to continue the conversation on her own, it’s as if she could be more assertive when talking about astronomy. She was talking about the wonders of the stars, and yet she seemed lonely when she said she was attracted to shiny things. That particular contradiction bothered me.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…By the way, since when did you become this shy? Has it always been this way?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t be sure if Yuri was listening to Kashii or not, but she was staring at Kashii’s face, making her blush even more than usual. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been like this for about a year now…Whenever I get nervous or just even get talked to, I immediately blush and can’t speak well, which I’m sure troubles people around me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking, ‘That sounds bothersome’, Yuri suddenly sat down next to Kashii.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, are you interested in changing yourself? Wanna stick with me?” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kashii’s eyes seemed to well up with fright as Yuri began to pester her like a yakuza exploiting profit from an unfair business deal. It surely was a nightmare for Kashii, but there was no way that the unobservant Yuri could have noticed what Kashii was going through. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes! Kashiwazaki-san, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, while I was thinking about how to divert Yuri’s attention, Kashii bowed her head low. It was as if I had witnessed someone being scammed in front of my eyes, and somehow, I had to feel guilty about it.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, Kashii, you need to calm down. I’m sure you’re thinking that being with Yuri, who is the polar opposite of you, might have influenced you to change, but it’s only going to stress you out and make you exhausted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay! I think that Kashiwazaki-san is a very amazing person who is not afraid to be in front of people, is self-assured and confident…I admire her because she naturally does things that I cannot do. The “She’s so impressive” kind of feeling. So, I’ll follow you Kashiwazaki-san!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure I understood the reasons behind that look of complete trust that Kashii showed to Yuri, despite the explanation she gave me. After the contract between the two of them was sealed, Yuri showed a broad smile. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the three of us started to hang out together. From that day on, I had decided to protect Kashii from being alone again.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, we would hang out in the classroom, in the park near the school, or played games at one of our houses. Whatever our activity was, they did not seem to concern Kashii. Even on days when there was nothing to do, we would just zone out, or when Yuri and I were focused on painting, Kashii always seemed to have enjoyed it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We spent time together except on Fridays when Yuri and I had art classes. Day by day, we grew closer. Kashii, who was from a single mother family, could not seem to disobey her strict mother and would always leave before six no matter where we were playing. I didn’t think it was just my imagination that Kashii seemed happy to be with us.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I found myself becoming more and more attracted to Kashii as the days went on. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The short summer was gone, the way we called each other’s names had changed, and the long-sleeved season came in a flash. She was still blushing and frightened when she talked to others. However, in front of me and Yuri, she could talk normally, showing a cute smile on her face from time to time.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to Utako’s growth, Yuri was still as self-centered as ever, even though she had grown taller and her birthday had come and gone. As soon as the party was over, she came over to me and shoved a broom in my face.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sosuke, take over the cleaning duty. I have to do something today.” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And before I could complain, Yuri fled the classroom like a loose hare.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about leaving without complying to what she asked me to, but I could not ignore it if she would be in trouble because I left. As I was putting my school bag back down again, Utako tapped me on the shoulder.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll help you. I’ll go bring the broom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We usually hang out with Yuri, so my opportunity to be alone with Utako was rare. Recalling the proverb, “Turn misfortune into fortune,” I decided to finish cleaning with determination.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. You saved me.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing. If anything, thank you for always helping me out. I’m glad I could be of help.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to take my time and indulge in the moment when I realized that I had left my pencil case in the arts and crafts room where I had my last class of the day. After apologizing and asking for permission to stop by, Utako and I headed for the arts and crafts room.  </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either the sixth graders who were in charge of cleaning the room forgot to clean up or they were too lazy to do it, for my pencil case was not handed into the staff room and was left on the desk where I sat. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There it was. I’m sorry, Utako. Let’s go home–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remained motionless as she stared, and what lay ahead of her gaze was a scribble on the desk. I almost fell in love with the way she stared  intensely with her clear eyes.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathed out quietly and called out to her, careful not to let her know about the dark feelings–the envy–inside me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazing, isn’t it?…This was drawn by Yuri.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t exactly remember her sitting here, but from the scribble, I just know that she did. I guess she just half listened to the class and drew it out of boredom and forgot to erase it before she left.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Realistic styled lion fused with Yuri’s fantastic imagination by remarkable precision and balance. The life she breathed into the lion’s lone mane, majestic yet supple… I felt a mixture of pride in Yuri’s talent and jealousy. Jealous that I could not capture Utako like she did.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was beauty and skill in Yuri’s drawing, obvious even to an untrained eye. In addition, she was good at drawing pictures that only she could draw. She had Jackson Pollock’s abstraction, abstraction with no limits in interpretation, even though it might seem that anyone can draw them at first glance. She was flawless, difficulty could not stop her from drawing as she desired. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why her drawings, even if they were still in progress, had an uniqueness, a trademark that made them instantly recognizable as being drawn by Yuri. I still remembered the comment of one of the judges of a competition, who said that this was the most impressive and advantageous thing about Yuri.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if it’s that good. To her, it was merely a scribble…unlike me. She’s just that talented.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Yuri’s drawing expressed her personality and charm at first glance, I wonder how my art looked to others. It would probably be just elementary school level, and probably just as unoriginal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many artists who boldly drew without caring about what other people thought, drawing what they wanted to draw. However, I had no such confidence in myself, and I could not be that creative. I put my heart and soul into each piece of work I drew. If someone praised my work, I would be happy to the brink of tears. Meanwhile, I would also be devastated if I were to be criticized. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could gain that confidence, I might be able to build a solid foundation for my creativity. Unshaken by anything, but I had not reached that point yet. That’s why it was so frustrating.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know what a variable star is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t know about it.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that I could not grasp the point of the sudden question about stars, she looked me in the eye and began to explain about it in detail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are many reasons for this, but the famous star Mira changes its brightness by repeatedly expanding and contracting itself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A variable star… I wondered if I were one of those dull stars now, and could one day become a star emitting light bright enough to attract everyone’s attention. Noticing my own naïveness in the thought, I quickly hid it with a wry smile. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think the picture you drew… It really does reflect who you are.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Reflect who I am?”  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help but ask her back, but she slowly said in a calm voice.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can sense your soul…your character through your pictures. I think you are serious, hardworking, sincere, and…charming. I like the pictures you draw.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt each of her words sank in. And at this moment, I learned the irresistibility of the feeling called love, along with its wildness and its irreplaceability. </span></p>

<p><b>[TN:I got a native Japanese teacher to read the original text and she said the grammar was wrong, lol] </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to think that falling in love with a delinquent who was kind to abandoned cats, or with the hidden beauty who came to school first to water the flower beds portrayed in a lot of mangas were simple-minded. But now that I had learned firsthand that there was no way to resist the tsunami of feeling of love that unexpectedly rages uncontrollably through your heart, you just had to be swept away by it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She got me. I was completely taken. What she just said was a clean hit. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this time, overshadowed by envy lay a bright innocent hope. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope that I could meet someone who would understand me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… Did I say something weird?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you didn’t say anything weird… Just, your words made me very happy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this moment, it was as if every cell in my body was paralyzed, all but my fluttering heart. I didn’t even know what expression I had on my face. While Utako tilted her head questioningly, my unsure feelings for her became clear.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the arts and crafts room after school, while staring at Yuri’s scribble, I had fallen in love with Utako.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After realizing that I was in love, I learned that I was more passionate than I had imagined.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to spend as much time with her as possible, and I was not ashamed to express my feelings for her in words. Fortunately, it seemed that she felt the same way about me, and our days were filled with the joy of being able to express how much we cared for each other.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there were rare occasions when we would encounter troubles unique to elementary school. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did not identify our relationship as lovers. However, our mutual affection for each other was not overlooked by our observant classmates, and their curiosity was directed at Utako, who was an easier target than me. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kashii is dating Sousuke, right? Ugh, that’s so romantic!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Utako, who did not have the courage to stand up to them, would always turn over in tears, her face bright red. In such cases, it was usually me who would get furious while trying to shield her, or Yuri who would appear out of nowhere and beat them to a pulp. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day after school, when we were walking home together, Utako gently held my hand.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sou-chan, thank you for always protecting me. But I’m fine even if other boys are mean to me. I don’t care what they think of me, as long as I have you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart leapt at the softness of the linked hands. It was childish, but my instincts told me that this is the girl I needed to protect. I squeezed her hand back to reassure her… No, not to reassure, it was just an excuse, a selfishness.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too, as long as I have you. But I can’t stand the idea of letting someone make you cry like that. That’s why I’m going to take them down like I always have.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha…Sou-chan, you know what? I love you.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Remember they’re fifth graders]</b></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From that day on, Utako’s affectionate behavior became unrestrained. Despite her shyness, she seemed to have no hesitation in expressing her feelings. If I attempted  something, she would say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look cool, Sou-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever I made a mistake or felt down.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be alright. I’ll always support you.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was extremely kind and comforting. Even if I hadn’t done anything in return at all.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Sou-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She called my name over and over again and whispered sweet nothings to me. Even an eleven-year-old could understand that we were in love with each other. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was what they called love, then people who were in love must be exceptionally happy, was what I thought. Maybe I was experiencing only the good parts of love. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of us went to the Maimori Snow Festival, a famous event held in Maimori City in early February. Yuri was at the front, slurping her yakisoba while checking out the various snow sculptures. Not far behind was Utako, excited about her first snow festival. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if Yuri’s as good at making snow sculptures as you are at drawing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s unbelievably handy, you know. She’s also strong, I’m sure she could make a stunning snow sculpture–No, I’m confident I can make a better snow sculpture than her! I’ll even make a special one just for you!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unintentionally, I had let out my envy towards Yuri. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, I can hear you, Sosuke. You need to sleep before sleep talking, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, Yuri spoke with her mouth stuffed with yakisoba like a squirrel.  </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up!”, I taunted back. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Utako laughed at our usual exchange, then muttered. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to be with you guys forever”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounded like a wish from the bottom of her heart, so I replied with the same earnestly and honestly.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too. I’ll be with you no matter when we grow up. I want to grow old with you.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Utako’s eyes widened, and a moment of silence fell between us. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah! Me too!” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw her reaction, her cheeks blushing almost to the point of a primary color, I realized what I said was just  the same thing as a marriage proposal.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, it’s not that… Well, I was just thinking it would be good if we could be together… You don’t need to answer immediately… But it would be great if” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so embarrassed that I started to ramble, then she grasped my hand. Normally she would do this when she wanted to tell me she liked me or to calm herself down, but today I knew she was doing it to calm me down instead.  </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks… Um…Until now, I’ve changed schools so often that I’ve never been able to stay in the same place for more than a year, but I really want to grow old in Maimori with Sou-chan and Yuu-chan. I’m going to tell my mom that I don’t want to transfer schools anymore.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if I could take this as a good thing. But when our eyes met, as if there was magic in Utako’s beaming smile, I felt my heart and future being gently held in her hands.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my feet go limp, so this was how dreamy state felt…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was taking in the news, Yuri came in between us, wearing her infamous “devil smile” when teasing people.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could you two say such romantic things in front of this snow sculpture? Please check your background before you decide to be romantic, will you?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When jolted back to reality from our private world, we found ourselves in front of a poorly made snow sculpture, which was probably an unfinished display of either a camel, a llama, or a goat. The background was so ugly that we looked at each other and laughed until our stomachs hurt.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to be with you. I wanted you to stay by my side forever. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did not think it was such a big wish, simple even, But it did not take long for me to realize that it was a very difficult dream for a child to fulfill.  </span></p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who in the world left behind such an abominable saying that first love never bears fruit?  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only a month after the snow festival, the three of us were on our way home  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have to move at the end of March. So, I’ll have to…transfer to another school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment her trembling voice reached my ears; my mind went blank. My lips were dry, my heart was racing. My breath went wild, my voice unintentionally hoarse.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s less than a month left! Why? You said you wanted to stay in Maimori, you said you wanted to stay here with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry… But it’s my mother’s decision… There’s nothing I can do about it.” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how long her mother had been talking about moving. Maybe Utako had been told about it a long time ago, and had been preparing for it on her own.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the meaning of “I want to be with you” that she had said at that time instantly changed from a wish to a hopeless fantasy. A good moment turning into a bitter memory. I clenched my fists. I hated this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?! We’ve gotten so close… I’m not okay with this! We’re going to be sixth graders then junior high schoolers. I’m sure we’ll have a lot more fun things to do. I want you to be with me when we’re going through all the fun stuff and see all the interesting things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was like a spoiled child, but I did not care. If I could stop her from moving away, even if she came to hate or despise me, I would be fine with that.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too. I don’t like the idea of a straight-up farewell, so let’s make some kind of a promise. Like meeting again after we have grown up.”, Suggested Yuri. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was really surprised at Yuri’s suggestion, as if she was considering Utako’s situation for once. At the same time, I felt embarrassed that I had only cared about my own feelings.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah! Let’s do that!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it was just a random suggestion, Yuri’s words brightened Utako. I was relieved, yet envious. But I was going to suggest something so ambitious that it would surprise them both anyway.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Utako, you fulfill your dream of becoming an astronaut! Yuri will become a famous painter and a star in the world of art! And I’m going to be a painter too…No, I’m going to be a painter of even more prestige! Then… we’ll meet again in Maimori when all three of our dreams come true!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my grandiosity, Yuri and Utako blinked their eyes several times.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re insane. And please don’t decide my future.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s wonderful! I’m with Sou-chan’s suggestion! It’s just like the three of us are shooting for the moon and we’ll land amongst the stars. Knowing this, I think I’ll be motivated to do my best even if I’m separated from the two of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking excitedly, she took the hand of Yuri who was frowning </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Utako has been working hard to become an astronaut since before she had even met us. If it was her, I have a feeling that she will make her dreams come true even without this promise to motivate her. But if this promise could at least hold her together when she is having a hard time in a distant land or when she felt like things were falling apart, then I would do whatever it took to convince Yuri on board.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t like this suggestion?” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fed up by the persistent Utako, Yuri let out a sigh. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just want to complain to Sousuke. It’s not like I disagree with the suggestion.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then fished her pocket, pulling out a crumpled handout. She then wrote a barely decent autograph as if she had just thought of it, right next to the scribble she was drawing on the back of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she has to be so cool?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears brimming, Utako brought the picture to her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too!…Oh, I don’t have a sketchbook with me. Wait, I’m drawing one now. I’ll draw and tear it from my Japanese notebook!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Sou-chan. I’m happy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although my impromptu drawing and autograph were not good enough to be shown to others, Utako had accepted them with sincere joy. </span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/F8YkjXS/S-12271620.jpg" height="500" width="350"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I promise. I’ll see you back here when we accomplish our dreams!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could still vividly remember the warmth of our hands piling together amidst the darkening dusk sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was childish. Other people might have snickered at our foolish dreams, but not us. Each of us believed that our ambition would come true without a doubt. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring came late in Hokkaido.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time I was annoyed. Before, I hadn’t really paid attention to it before, thinking it was normal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was snowing on the day I said goodbye to her, in the silvery white world. I couldn’t help but feel that it would be better if I could see her off in the midst of the blooming cherry blossoms. But because of that promise, I was able to contain this suffocating feeling of being without her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so began my sixth grade without Utakoko. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being elected as the president of the student council, my schedule became occupied, but I always made sure that I had time to draw. However, it was obvious that Yuri was spending less and less time drawing. When she found something that she wanted to paint, she would forget about everything. But now, she tended to take a break from painting classes, and she even seems to be avoiding drawing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, you are low on motivation lately, aren’t you? What’s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really. I just draw whenever and whatever I want to, is that wrong?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I had said something wrong, and she wouldn’t talk to me that day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard through my mother that there are lots of people who have been actively urging Yuri to enter competitions lately. When It came to this, Yuri was quite defiant, refusing to bend to even art gallery directors or any big names. But the more stubborn she was, the more stubborn they became. I was sure she would be stressed out by all the adults pestering her with their demands in all kinds of ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart fluttered with anxiety. Maybe because I was her childhood friend who understands her more than most, I had a hunch that this would all turn wrong.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the winter break of my sixth-grade year, we entered the “Children’s Future Painting Contest”, a contest aimed for elementary school students. I didn’t qualify, while; Yuri got the first prize. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though disqualified, I was taken to the Sapporo Art Museum as Yuri’s friend. I couldn’t help but mutter “Wow” when I saw Yuri’s painting, which stood out among the numerous outstanding entries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri’s F20 canvas was displayed in a noticeable area of the museum. No, I don’t think it was just the location that made it stand out. The fact that the piece was also eye-catching was a testament to Yuri’s ability again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the artist who drew such a touching picture seemed to be in a very sour mood. She was being photographed by a lot of cameramen, and even though she was dressed in beautiful garments, she had an impassive look on her face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My stomach began to churn with worry as I wondered if there was something wrong, but then I heard our painting teacher talking to a very high-profile old man. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He smiled at Yuri, but I found his smile strangely physiologically unpleasant. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The next thing I want you to do is to draw a picture of a marine creature for the Environmental Art Exhibition at the end of the year. and also emphasize the concept of ’freedom’. You know, the head judge, Mr. Takashima loves marine life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might be the only one who noticed.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last glimmer of light disappeared from Yuri’s eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in that moment, the carefree Yuri noticed the irony of the chain of so-called “freedom”.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> My suspicions had come true. From that day on, Yuri wouldn’t pick up the paintbrush by herself anymore. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why aren’t you painting? Are you saying you’re tired of painting? What about the promise you made to Utako?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it would be counterproductive if people nagged her to draw because of her carefree and self-centered personality, so at first, I just kept an eye on her. But after two months without drawing a single picture, I had to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do I need to tell you, Sousuke? Do you want that promise to become chains that further bind me?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sneered at me; her expression colder than I had ever seen.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep telling you to draw no matter what you’ll think of me. And I’ll do this until you can enjoy drawing again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri left without replying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even now, I was still chasing after the look of pure joy she used to have when she’s drawing, and the brilliant paintings she breathed life into. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the letters I regularly received from Utako, she wrote that she was studying hard to make her dreams a reality. Every time I heard from her, I became irritated by the fact that Yuri had tried to break her promise. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so frustrated that while I’m trying to get better at painting every day, I still got less appreciation than Yuri who refused to even hold a paintbrush.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our relationship had become strained by our complicated emotions, and our relationship stayed that way all the way to our second year of junior high school.</span></p>
