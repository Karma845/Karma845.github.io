<h2>Prologue</h2>


<p class="calibre5">“Senpai, she’s back again…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Having someone become a regular is a good thing, isn’t it? .”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On a Saturday afternoon, while tidying up around the cash register at the café where I work, I said so to my junior coworker’s whispered voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh, your danger sensor must be broken. That girl looks like trouble, and she seems to be here for you. Look, she keeps staring this way.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean she’s here for me… More importantly, what are you saying about a customer? Isn’t it nice that she has conviction in her style? What’s it called again?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s called ‘jirai-kei’ (Landmine).”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN : The term “landmine type/style” (地雷系, jirai-kei) is slang primarily used in Japan to describe someone who might appear attractive or interesting at first glance but reveals problematic or “explosive” traits as you get to know them better.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, that’s it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are a few customers in the store right now, but among them, the girl sitting by the window stands out with her unique appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her fashion, which features pink and black and is adorned with ribbons, frills, and lace, strikes a balance between cute and dark&mdash;&mdash;it’s known as the ‘Landmine Type’ (Jirai-kei).</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know why it has such a dangerous-sounding name, but I do get the sense that she looks somehow mysterious, and that’s probably part of its charm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s probably the type of thing that people who like it really like.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But it really suits her. Her face is incredibly attractive, and her face doesn’t lose out to her bold fashion choices. Even though her hair is black in half-twins with pink inner coloring… It’s over the top, but it seriously suits her.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you complimenting her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Please take this as advice from a woman. Nowadays, not everyone dressed like that is an actual ‘menhera,’ but it’s also true that there are some genuine cases among them.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My junior coworker said this in a tone as if explaining something obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is that how it is?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If she turns out to be a genuine case, it would be really bad, you know? If you get caught up with someone like that, Senpai, you could end up in a really messy situation.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“First of all, don’t talk recklessly about someone you don’t even know. It’s disrespectful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh, argument featuring logic!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She made a displeased noise and grimaced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s an expressive one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, thanks for your concern.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Now then, I’m leaving the register to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, I left my junior coworker and stepped away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In my field of vision, I briefly caught sight of a male and female customer couple who seemed to be giving off a ‘Won’t a server come over for our order?’ vibe.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Would you like to place an order?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yes. I’ll have this café au lait… and what else was it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll have the cheesecake set&mdash;Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As the woman peered into the menu the man was holding, she accidentally knocked over her glass.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The contents splashed across the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! I’m so sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No worries, I’ll wipe it up right away. Did it get on your clothes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m fine!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, that’s good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I removed the knocked-over glass and fetched a clean cloth to wipe the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I brought a replacement drink to the woman.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, are you sure it’s okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course. So, one café au lait and one cheesecake set, is that correct? The set comes with a drink&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While engaging in this conversation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait, I’m being watched?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt a piercing gaze on my skin, and when I took a quick glance, the one staring was that girl dressed in jirai-kei fashion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes, which looked eerily deep, seemed to be swallowing up every single move I made… or is this just me being overly self-conscious?</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="images/000005.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">Noticing that I saw her, she quickly averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From that reaction, it didn’t seem like she wanted to place an order.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Senpai~! Sorry to bother you! How do I do the electronic payment at the register?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m coming.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My junior coworker, who was at the register attending to a customer, called out to me loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s nice that she calls me when she’s unsure, but I wish she would lower the volume and enthusiasm just a bit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What part are you up to? Hmm, just tap here on the register, then… right, that will bring up the payment options&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I returned to the register at a brisk pace and instructed my junior coworker on the procedure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She can be forgetful, but she’s quick to understand. So without any particular errors, the payment process was successfully completed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you~… Phew, that was stressful. Sorry, Senpai.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine. The register has a lot to remember… But you startled the customers who are trying to relax, so please call me more quietly next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, but honestly, you’re so reliable, Senpai. Even the store manager said it’s really bad when you’re not here~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Tell him not to rely too much on a part-time high school student.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager may be a monster when it comes to making coffee, but he’s too lax in just about every other aspect of running the business.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wish he’d take managing the shop a little more seriously.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“True~. By the way, Senpai.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s still staring at you, that girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Please take it seriously.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">My junior whispered to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;It’s not so far in the future that I would come to understand those words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Had I taken her words more seriously then, would my life have not changed so dramatically?</p>
