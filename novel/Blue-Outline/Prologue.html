<h2>Prologue: Chitose Saku</h2>


<p>You, bearing a name that obscures the moon, resist being reflected as you truly are.</p>



<p>Although you shine more brilliantly than anyone else, and though you strive to exist more beautifully than anyone else,</p>



<p>──Your heart forever seeks out flaws while turned away from the mirror.</p>



<p>Even as you face the world with more sincerity than anyone else, and aspire to be a hero with more earnestness than anyone else,</p>



<p>──Your heart stubbornly shuns the rewards it deserves.</p>



<p>I longed to be a woman worthy of someone like you, who carries such contradictions.</p>



<p>──I am Nanase Yuzuki.</p>



<p>The pride I hold now is because you saved me on that day.</p>



<p>I’ve held onto this unwavering strength because you gave a name to these feelings.</p>



<p>I stand tall, hoping to endure, praying that it proves Chitose Saku’s righteousness.</p>



<p>Yet, your stubborn aesthetic, so kind to others, causes earnest feelings between two of a kind to pass by each other.</p>



<p>So, if this love, striving to be noble, were to be tainted by falsehood,</p>



<p>If the true love is something that can’t be preserved while remaining beautiful,</p>



<p>──If there comes a night where you can no longer be Chitose Saku,</p>



<p>There’s only one thing I can offer in exchange for Nanase Yuzuki,</p>



<p>──I’m going to give you my moon.</p>
