<h2>Prologue: Touka Himegi &ndash; Reminiscence 1</h2>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-neesan passed away due to illness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She left this world quietly in the dead of night at the end of May.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family shed tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We grieved to mask the directionless anger and unfairness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister lied to us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had declared she’d be fine until her next birthday, but she died before turning twenty-one.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We lied to her as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite promising to work together and support her, we broke that promise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Initially, we all combined our efforts and worked hard to keep our promise to Natsumi-neesan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We tried, but eventually, the situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The impact of losing her was immeasurable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Our family lost its smiles and fell apart; it was no longer a family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We realized we’d lost our sun…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Living in a world without her was a curse for us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only path left for me, having lost my sister, was self-destruction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I lashed out at the maids in the mansion, and in my room, I was always venting my anger on objects.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d forgotten how to control my anger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I didn’t want to be angry, I’d lost all self-control.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I minimized my conversations at school and at home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I stopped having fun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I avoided eye contact.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I refused to face others&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Laughing became painful, and I gradually gave it up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then people began to distance themselves from me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Friends left me one by one. A childhood friend, unable to watch me any longer, gave me advice and cautioned me to improve my attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I rejected it, not listening to his words. And so, we had a falling out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since then, I haven’t spoken a word to that idiot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was never good at socializing, so being alone didn’t bother me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everything felt tedious. Even going to school became a chore.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I knew I was being spoiled at that point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite needing to face the difficulties and stand up, I had no willpower to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Natsumi-neesan saw me at that time, she would be utterly disappointed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, I couldn’t move forward. I couldn’t find a reason to do so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Himegi-san, hello……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…It’s him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once again, this person has appeared before me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it okay if I sit in the seat in front of you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I find this person hard to deal with.&nbsp;I dislike this person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I find myself strangely annoyed by this smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe this smile reminds me of my sister and makes me irritated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without showing any sign of understanding how I feel, this person sits in the seat in front of me and gazes intently at my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san, you’ve lost weight again, haven’t you? Are you eating properly?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah? Ignored again…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Go away.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“As usual, you’re as cold as ever.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…tsk.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I even got a tsk!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The usual&mdash;&mdash;here to sell you a smile! I’m Smile Ouji!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Did I make a mistake? Totally misread the mood?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahem! By the way, Himegi-san, are you free today? If you are, why not visit our club?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I told you yesterday and the day before. No matter how many times you ask, I won’t show up at your club.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Tsk! Then, I’ll come to invite you again tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’ll be the same answer tomorrow…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Even so, I’ll invite you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The man returns to his seat with a disappointed look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought he was really persistent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I expected, I find him difficult to deal with.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, as I expected, I disliked him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He will probably keep inviting me again tomorrow and the day after. Even so, my resolve won’t change.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nothing good will come if someone like me gets involved with anyone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So this is fine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the right answer, and this is the best option.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It’s the right thing to do.</p>
