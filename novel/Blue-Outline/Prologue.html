<h2 style="text-align: center">Epilogue: The Spring We Welcome Again With You</h2>

<p>“Hey, how long are you going to keep putting on makeup? That’s enough already.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but call out to Nanase, who was seriously facing the mirror with a giant makeup box spread out before her. She turned around, eyebrows raised, glaring at me.</p>
<p>“Not even close! I’m only at the eighth station!”</p>
<p>“Uh… We’re going to be late for the meetup. You’re already good enough as you are…”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not! I appreciate that Sagara-kun thinks I’m cute without makeup, but that’s a different story!”</p>
<p>With that, Nanase turned back to the mirror. Watching her dab some mysterious powder on her face, I sighed, wondering how many more minutes until we could leave.</p>
<p>A month has passed since I confessed to Nanase.</p>
<p>Honestly, if asked whether I’ve been the “wonderful boyfriend” Nanase dreamed of, the answer would be no. I’m still the same old boring guy, consumed with part-time jobs, lacking in money and charm.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of a three-day seminar trip with our classmates. After much deliberation, I decided to join.</p>
<p>Sudo sarcastically said, “I knew you’d come if Haruko asked,” and Houjo laughed, “Nah, Sagara’s surprisingly sociable.”</p>
<p>Ignoring Kinami’s comments about spending all night telling risqué stories, I actually don’t mind spending time with these guys.</p>
<p>It was twenty minutes later when Nanase finally finished her makeup. She came over with bright pink lipstick, the one I gave her, smiling and saying,</p>
<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting!” Realizing it was the lipstick I had presented her made me feel a bit bashful.</p>
<p>“How do I look? Cute?”</p>
<p>Tilting her head, Nanase looked undeniably adorable. I nodded honestly, and she smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>“I’m glad. I always want to be cute, after all.”</p>
<p>Even now that her bare face is known to others, Nanase hasn’t stopped wearing makeup. She wants to always be her cutest self, covering her natural look with makeup as her armor and weapon.</p>
<p>I think that’s when Nanase is the cutest. It’s not so much her facial features but her effort to look cute that shines brightly.</p>
<p>But I’m not the type of guy who can say, “That’s what makes you cute,” with a straight face.</p>
<p>Where did the courage from when I confessed to her go? My reply was indifferent, much to my own annoyance.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m ready! Shall we go?”</p>
<p>After much deliberation over her accessories, Nanase said this and pulled my arm. As we stepped outside, our footsteps echoed down the apartment stairs.</p>
<p>◇◇◇</p>
<p><strong>Haruko’s PoV</strong></p>
<p>The sun shone in the pale sky, casting a soft warmth. Despite being February, today felt like an early taste of spring. I found myself humming and skipping, to which Sagara-kun chuckled wryly.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to the seminar trip! It feels like a real slice of youth!”</p>
<p>“Youth, huh…”</p>
<p>When I said this, Sagara-kun murmured with a bored look. He still has a bit of a mocking attitude towards the idea of “youth.”</p>
<p>Even though he’s (supposedly) moved past his loner ways, he’s still a bit cynical.</p>
<p>Though I can see some signs of change.</p>
<p>“I’ve always dreamed of staying over with friends and talking about love! Hehe, I’m excited.”</p>
<p>“Talking about love, huh? You’re going to talk about me, aren’t you? Sudo’s just going to tear me apart…”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun frowned slightly, looking a bit gloomy. It seems he’s somewhat afraid of Sacchan.</p>
<p>Despite their words, I think they’re quite similar, but mentioning that might just anger Sacchan.</p>
<p>“I’m happy the spring break in college is so long. I’m going on a drive with some seniors from work. Oh, and I’m going to see a movie with a girl I met from the literature department.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got over thirty contacts on LINE now! Ehehe, amazing, right?”</p>
<p>I showed Sagara-kun a peace sign, and he smiled kindly, saying, “You’ve done well.” I’m far from having a hundred friends, and it’s not quite the rosy college life yet, but I think my future is looking pretty bright.</p>
<p>“I want to go to lots of places with Sagara-kun too… Oh, let’s do a tart retry next time!”</p>
<p>Remembering our failed date, Sagara-kun grimaced and clutched his chest. The crepe we ended up eating was delicious, so he shouldn’t worry too much.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll make a proper reservation next time.”</p>
<p>“I want to go to Disneyland too! Let’s wear matching Mickey ears!”</p>
<p>“Uh… I’d rather not…”</p>
<p>He’s still trying to escape, poor sport. Peering at his reluctant face, I spoke up.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, you know…”</p>
<p>◆◆◆</p>
<p><strong>Sagara’s PoV</strong></p>
<p>Nanase smiled brightly, her lips vividly colored.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, I want to live a rosy college life.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Of course, you’ll help me, right?”</p>
<p>…Keeping up with Nanase’s “rosy” life is quite the task. Yet, I never felt it was a bother.</p>
<p>Nanase’s world is gradually expanding, and so is mine, thanks to meeting her. I no longer find it troublesome.</p>
<p>I grabbed Nanase’s left hand and casually intertwined our fingers, speaking quickly while facing forward.</p>
<p>“I’ll help, but… just so you know, it’s not just for you.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“It’s because I want to be with you, that’s why I’ll help.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Nanase nodded happily and gripped my hand tightly. Her soft, small hand was warmer and more comforting than mine.</p>
<p>Just then, Nanase glanced at her watch and exclaimed, “Oh no! We’ll miss the next bus if we don’t hurry, and we won’t make it on time!”</p>
<p>“Seriously. It’s because you took your time with makeup…”</p>
<p>Being with Nanase, things never go as planned. Yet, being swept up in her life might be quite enjoyable compared to being alone.</p>
<p>“Let’s hurry, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>“Listen to what I’m saying!”</p>
<p>And so, hand in hand, we ran off.</p>
<p>This is our story; a slice of life far from rosy, but perhaps, more colorful and lively than we ever imagined.</p>
