<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>Hello, this is Hiromu. It’s been a while.</p>



<p>Before we delve in, a quick heads-up: mild spoilers lie ahead, so I suggest diving into this after wrapping up the main story.</p>



<p>Firstly, about the “Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! 2023” that was mentioned in the afterword of Volume 7.</p>



<p>Chiramune narrowly missed the top spot by a small margin. However, at the same time, it achieved a historic entry into the Hall of Fame as an unadapted work!</p>



<p>While missing the third consecutive victory is regrettable, I can proudly say I couldn’t have written Volumes 6, 5, and 7, which were the contenders, in any other way. There’s no lingering regret of wishing I had done this differently or that.</p>



<p>To everyone who supported me, thank you sincerely.</p>



<p>Although this challenge set for KonoRano comes to a close for now, I aim to continue writing Chiramune with unwavering passion while facing the latter half of the series.</p>



<p>Now, those who have read until the end (and those keen enough to notice from just the table of contents) might realize that, for the first time in Chiramune, I’ve structured Volume 8 and 9 as first-part and second-part volumes.</p>



<p>Some may ponder, “Aren’t Volume 5 and 6 the same as the first-part and second-part?” or “Haven’t we completed the first, second, and third parts with Volume 7?” In my mind, there’s a distinct difference.</p>



<p>Volumes 5, 6, and 7 are self-contained works, each with a four-chapter structure leading to a satisfying conclusion. However, as evident in Volume 8, it only covers up to Chapter 2.</p>



<p>Frankly speaking, this surprised me too. Despite planning this volume as a dedicated school festival arc, I found myself questioning why it hadn’t started yet. If I had continued writing, it would have ballooned into an enormous volume. Thus, albeit reluctantly, I split the story I wished to tell in one book into Volumes 8 and 9.</p>



<p>Honestly, there was quite a struggle within me about this decision.</p>



<p>In Volume 7’s afterword, as previously mentioned, Chiramune has consistently prioritized the “sense of satisfaction upon finishing a single volume.” The true satisfaction, in my view, unfolds when readers reach the narrative’s “conclusion,” encompassing the entire journey from exposition to resolution. Consequently, severing it midway posed a significant challenge.</p>



<p>On the flip side, I also harbored concerns as the number of pages continued to grow with each volume. This concern stems from the visual impact on bookstore shelves. A series appearing overly imposing in book thickness raises a barrier for potential new readers.</p>



<p>I believe this is something both I and probably many of you can relate to. When heading to a bookstore with the intention of starting a new series, doesn’t it become a bit daunting as the thickness visibly increases in the latter half of the story?</p>



<p>Volumes 6 and 7, while acknowledged as thick for light novels (I’m aware there are thicker volumes out there, but this concern pertains specifically to Chiramune in the youth romantic comedy genre), if the pages continues to increase without limits, even as someone proud of being a bookworm, I’d still hesitate.</p>



<p>Certainly, I can imagine enthusiastic fans expressing the opinion, “No matter how thick it gets, I want to read it all at once until the end.” However, from around Volume 6, I began hearing voices from readers who love and follow Chiramune, saying, “I bought it, but it’s so thick that I couldn’t bring myself to start it, and it ended up sitting untouched for half a year.”</p>



<p>It’s not my intention for my preferences to distance readers.</p>



<p>Additionally, if a single volume reaches 800 or 1000 pages (this is purely hypothetical, as I don’t know how long Volume 9 will be), there’s a possibility that, at my writing speed, I’d only be able to release a new book once a year.</p>



<p>So, I concluded that dividing it into two books, doubling the illustrations, would ultimately make everyone happier.</p>



<p>Moving forward, I’d like to use the page count of Volume 6, the series’ longest, as a basic guideline. And if it exceeds that, I’ll consider dividing it naturally. Therefore, in my mind, Volumes 8 and 9 compose a single story. When Volume 9 is released, I would be delighted if you could continue reading from Volume 8.</p>



<p>This is entirely speculative, but the latter half of the series might end up adopting an first-part and second-part volume structure (I really have no basis for this since my page count management is quite arbitrary). However, due to the substantial burden it would place on the production team, I don’t intend to release first-part and second-part volumes simultaneously in the future.</p>



<p>I hope you find joy in looking forward to the continuation of the series. Volume 9 should be delivered without keeping you waiting too much this time. Next up is the school festival arc!</p>



<p>Now, let me express my gratitude.</p>



<p>To the illustrator, raemz-san, thank you for breathing life the ideal Nanase Yuzuki I envisioned for this volume! The cover gave me goosebumps, and the illustrations were so precious they almost brought tears to my eyes.</p>



<p>To my editor-in-charge, Iwaasa-san, thank you for supporting the decision to split the volumes. With this, I hope to establish a production system that minimizes strain on the production team’s minds and bodies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, to everyone involved in promotion, proofreading, and all those associated with Chiramune in any way, heartfelt thanks. Most importantly, thank you to the readers who led us to this achievement of entering the Kono Rano Hall of Fame.</p>



<p>May you find the answer you seek within the mirror.</p>
