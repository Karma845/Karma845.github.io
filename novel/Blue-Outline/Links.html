<h2>Epilogue<h2>

<p class="calibre5">“Mhm… Whoa!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, did I startle you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I slowly open my eyelids upon waking, a girl is intently staring at my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah… Good morning, Amane-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Good morning, Kei-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Checking the clock, it’s 9:30 in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today is Sunday.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, may I ask how long you’ve been doing this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh… well…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes dart away, and my lover gives me a vague answer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Not… for too long, I guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I might be lying!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her confession comes quickly, but she never mentions any specific numbers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She says that watching me sleep in the early morning has become an irreplaceable moment in her life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, from what time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, let’s have breakfast now, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s stubborn.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a wry smile at my elusive lover, I get up from bed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The rhythmic sound of chopping fills the air.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even from behind, I can tell Amane-san’s movements are brisk and efficient.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The delicious aroma emanating from the kitchen where she stands reaches all the way to where I’m sitting at the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…By the way, the moment I attempt to stand and offer my help, Amane-san notices right away and smiles as she stops me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her smile resembles that of an immense tree, which makes it clear in just a moment’s touch that ‘no amount of human pushing will make it budge.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for the wait~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Before long, she places the finished dishes on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today’s menu centers on grilled salmon, a traditional Japanese meal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two of us say ‘itadakimasu’ in unison and begin to eat…</p>
<p class="calibre5">A short while later, Amane-san’s smartphone rings on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The screen displays the name ‘Kanon’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I wonder what she wants. I’m sorry, can I talk to her for a minute?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hello, Kanon? Yes… Hehe, yes, good morning from here… Yes, yes… Oh, I don’t think it’s in the luggage you brought to Canada. Yes… Alright, I’ll send it. Huh? Okay-okay, I’ll include that too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems she’s requesting some items to be sent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, anything else? Ask Dad and Shion too… Yes, please… Huh? Right now?… Again?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amane-san briefly glances my way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I understand her intention immediately since this has happened several times before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I nod in agreement, Amane-san switches her phone to speaker mode.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『 Kei-san~ Good morning!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Good morning, Kanon-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『 I knew it! You’re at Onee-chan’s house again today, aren’t you?! I had a feeling! Sorry, she’s such a heavy woman!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, I’m always grateful for her help.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The energetic younger sister, Kanon-san, frequently wants to chat with me, usually while calling her sister, Amane-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『So, well… you see…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">She often seeks advice about her new boyfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps being her sister’s boyfriend makes me someone ideal to talk to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve told her that I’m not particularly well-versed in romantic matters, but she trusts my perspective nonetheless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I see… So that’s how guys are.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, myself and the guys around me are like that. Of course, cultural and age differences come into play.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『No, no, it was very helpful! Thank you!… Oh, by the way, you must come to the All-Japan Junior next time!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Hehe, whether I win or lose doesn’t matter. I’ve put together my best program ever! I’ll deliver my best performance and get my highest score!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, if Kanon-san achieves her personal best score, she will be a strong contender for the championship.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Oh, if by then I’ve broken up with my boyfriend, will you go on a consolation date with me as a reward if I win?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanon-san cheekily continues.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanon.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『 I’m sorry, it was just a joke. I won’t say it again.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">With just a word from Amane-san, she immediately apologized in a serious tone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Amane-san… you shouldn’t tease your sister so much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I just want to scare her. I’d never actually want to do it. She’s my precious cute little sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘I don’t want her to have a trouble with her neck. ‘</p>
<p class="calibre5">Quietly and clearly, that’s what my girlfriend said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t that right, Kanon?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…Kei-san, I’ve asked before, but are you really okay with having such a sh*tty(クソ), heavily bugged sense of ethics girlfriend? It might complicate your life…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanon?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I think I’ll go to bed now! It’s nighttime here! Goodnight!』</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, Kanon quickly ended the call.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Haha, the way you two sisters deceive others is identical.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Are you okay with it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your life… it might get complicated…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ahaha.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To that question, I answered with a laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If it were to be complicated, it was long before I met Amane-san. Everything changed when Amane-san came into my life.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After that, the hospital, the police, and the government got involved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Many adults from various positions got involved with the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It transitioned from the closed room of an apartment complex to a more open environment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Various diagnoses, judgments, and decisions were made… really, many things happened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As a result, now several months later, I’m living in a different place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Living alone… though, I’m dependent on the woman in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just because things have changed doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Amane-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“At that time, Kei-kun made a choice&mdash;no, you were forced to choose. Control, and one thing from that same control.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: Vague, but means choosing one thing or option from within a controlled or limited set of choices. It’s like saying he had choices, but all of those choices were still under some form of control or limitation.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amane-san lowered her head. Her soft hair swayed gently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…You know, the manager thanked me. He said, ‘Thank you for protecting Kei.’ It’s something he should have done, but couldn’t.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I heard this story from my uncle, who is now my legal and financial guardian.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…The store manager couldn’t intervene directly in Kei-kun’s situation. He feared being shunned, afraid they’d take Kei-kun away. Not just in a physical sense, but legally as well.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What Amane-san said was right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At first, my uncle would sternly warn my mother about me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I think there came a point where he was given the ultimatum, ‘If you bother us more, we won’t let you see him.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The rights between a biological mother and an uncle are vastly different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those words weigh heavily on my uncle.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“For Kei-kun, the presence of the manager and the time spent in that store were his lifeline.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… now I can clearly see. If it weren’t for my uncle, if I hadn’t spent time in that store, I probably wouldn’t be in this world anymore. It was that important of an escape for my heart.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because he understood that, the manager couldn’t move. He couldn’t move, but he did everything he could within his limits, and he always supported Kei-kun…right? You see, Kei-kun…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She added, “I didn’t understand it at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Because that’s wrong. The manager always cared for and protected Kei-kun. So why would he thank me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It should be the other way around. I should be the one thanking him. I should say. ‘Thank you for protecting Kei-kun on my behalf before I met him.’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">In fact, it seems Amane-san did say that to my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll never forget the look on his face when he told me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I really mean what I say, and I also genuinely think… I’m not normal, compared to anyone. Even compared to Kei-kun’s mother…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sitting opposite me, Amane-san gently traced the back of my right hand with her finger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That woman cursed you. She cursed you, saying, ‘You have no talent at all.’ She just wanted an ‘excuse’ to lash out…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She lifted her downcast face and looked straight at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I’m also praying. I’ve been praying that ‘you remain without much talent.’…I want an ‘excuse’ to take care of you… between me and your mother, which one is better? I wonder if one is even a little better.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes held an unfathomable depth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In the end, maybe both are the same. Neither is any good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My girlfriend described herself with such harsh words…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, you see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘It’s not that I want you to say things like ‘That’s not true’ to me.’, she continued.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, Kei-kun, please give up. I promise to make you happy, so please give up on leaving me… I’m sorry, so please…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is a woman who does everything she can while being herself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today, just like when we first met, she was dressed in a style called ‘Jirai-kei’ (Landmine type).</p>
<p class="calibre5">But in my eyes, the one with the landmines was me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Inside me, buried deep where most couldn’t see, was an explosive&mdash;&mdash;my mother herself and my foolishness for not cutting ties with her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On that day, Amane literally kicked the landmine far away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re not normal, Amane-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But normal people, being normal, couldn’t have come to that room at that time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The reason she became aware of my situation was due to actions that weren’t legally or ethically right.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Normal people, being normal, couldn’t do what was done to my mother.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I shudder to think what would have happened otherwise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Kei-kun. I might never be normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But I will make you happy. Always. Just trust in that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mhm… like some kind of binding spell to a monster?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, yes, like some kind of binding spell to a monster.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: Monster/supernatural being. Binding spell/contract/ covenant/oath.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that exchange, we resumed our meal that we had inadvertently stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Amane’s cooking was, as always, delicious, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My chopsticks slipped, failing to grasp the side dish.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whenever I made a mistake during a meal, it was a cue for something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, Kei-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amane picked up my portion with her chopsticks and offered it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I ate, and she picked up the next piece.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eat, then the next&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um… Amane, can we skip this rule?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I don’t understand. I still struggle to understand human language…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But you’ve been living in human society for eighteen years, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Have I? Anyway, what do you want to eat next, Kei-kun?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;As days went by, with us calling each other by first names and dropping the formalities, our bond grew deeper.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I realized the things I could do for myself were steadily decreasing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She does everything for me right before my eyes, so I’ve stopped doing this and that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My life keeps getting more comfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Regardless of my will, the brain learns.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It learns that if I don’t have to do things, it’s better if I don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, it even cuts back on the capacity allocated for those skills.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This cycle is progressing slowly but surely. The evolving brain, once changed, never returns to its original state.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know this, but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, I wonder who’s really spoiling whom here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right now, from the outside, it might look like Kei-kun is the one being spoiled, but in a way where I’m allowed to spoil Kei-kun, I feel like Kei-kun is really spoiling me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, our days with Amane began with her wanting to be spoiled and me wanting to spoil her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a way, this might be the most perfect realization of that desire.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000003.png">

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, Kei-kun. I’ll do anything for you in return… though that would mean I’d also be benefiting again.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amane says with a joyous look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t deny that I find immense comfort in her devotion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even now, unexpectedly, there are times when tears start flowing, unstoppable, just like when she once took care of me when I was sick.</p>
<p class="calibre5">….for me, towards her who says she’s being spoiled by spoiling others, I was indeed spoiled by her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This might be some sort of perpetual motion machine; it’s undoubtedly codependency.</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘True partners support each other equally, both being independent’&mdash; surely, proper and upright people would say so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’d argue our mutually melting, dependent relationship is inappropriate and unhealthy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I’d leave the righteous and proper actions to those righteous and proper people.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those who can find happiness that way should pursue it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We who were both twisted in our ways can mend each other’s flaws with a twisted approach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…? Kei-kun? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No… haha, I’m just worried that I’m going to be so dependent on Amane-san so much that I even want her to help me to breathe; that’d be problematic.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I joked, and she blinked a few times.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, about that… hehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She gazed at me with eyes that seemed to trap me in a prison with no way to escape.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehe… hehehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That joke is definitely going too far. It’s a bit much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Without saying anything, she laughed with a long ‘Niiiiii.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: ニイイイ, Niii is a Japanese sound effect that is often used to depict a particular kind of eerie or unsettling laugh or grin.)</p>
