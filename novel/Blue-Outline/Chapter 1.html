<h2>Chapter 1: Moon-Veiled Endline</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>The vivid red, painted like the blossoming spider lilies of late summer, pricked at my heart with the intensity of a firework’s burst. Oh, I see now—that must be the heart of that single-stem vase I offered to you on that day.</p>



<p>Veiling an air of composed indifference, occasionally casting sideways glances like dewy lashes brushing skin.</p>



<p>The transitions were almost frustratingly tender, as pure as a novice’s, yet captivatingly exquisite; I shamelessly smiled.</p>



<p>When did I transform into a plastic bouquet of artificial flowers?</p>



<p>The insolence that paraded through the equinox, the flamboyance resembling counterfeit love, and even the delicate hesitance that seemed liable to snap at the merest touch—each of these elements was meticulously woven into my formerly nameless emotions, forming a tapestry of May patterns that were uniquely mine.</p>



<p>──<em>Rustle, rustle.</em> The loafers echoed the arrival of autumn.</p>



<p>Reluctantly, I conceded.</p>



<p>Our September ended all too quickly, and another’s October began its turn, whether we welcomed it or not.</p>



<p>Glancing around, the restless trees were starting to blush hurriedly where the sun touched them.</p>



<p>Dry leaves adorned the ground, a humble hint of color too delicate to be called a carpet, embellishing the path that wound along the riverbank.</p>



<p>There was no denying it; once again, we were being swept along, much like clusters of clouds gathering in the sky.</p>



<p>Was it the chill of the northern breeze, a trained shepherd dog, or perhaps the moon of a hunter that urged us on?</p>



<p>──Still, it’s not the season for autumn leaves to bloom just yet.</p>



<p>For this stage, what was fitting diverged from those flowers and that girl—instead, it was the beckoning red of a poisoned apple.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p><em>Pluck</em>, my fingertips broke the surface of the thin skin, relieving the tension in my stiffened shoulders.</p>



<p>I must have been lost in concentration for quite a while.</p>



<p>Tapping the smartphone’s display, I saw that it was approaching midnight.</p>



<p>I, Nanase Yuzuki, gently rubbed my left thumb against my other fingers before picking up the basketball resting in a corner of my room. I stroked its surface with a sense of familiarity, a sensation that clung tightly, and I felt a comforting relief.</p>



<p>I noticed my mouth was quite dry, so I gulped down the remaining half of the mineral water from the plastic bottle in a single breath.</p>



<p>Continuing with dribbling and body circles, performing handling exercises with a playful touch, I could effortlessly sense its position, its center of gravity, and even the orientation of the logo, as if the ball had become a part of my own body.</p>



<p>Since that day in the gymnasium where the raindrops echoed, the day I challenged Tōdō to a one-on-one, my basketball game had undeniably shifted.</p>



<p>Of course, convenient things like hidden powers awakening in times of distress didn’t happen in real life. If anything, it was more accurate to say that I had stopped withholding power I unconsciously concealed, and precisely because of that, it was frightening.</p>



<p>I had already bared the depths of Nanase Yuzuki before others.</p>



<p>Still clutching the ball tightly in both arms, I rolled onto the bed and gazed at the ceiling.</p>



<p>After I made that last three-pointer, Tōdō, who always seemed elusive and carefree, radiated an eerie intensity, assessing me like a predator marking its target.</p>



<p>In stark contrast, Umi appeared lost, caught between sorrow, anger, and loneliness, like a child who missed the bus for a school trip. But she’s not just someone who lets things end there; I knew that deep within.</p>



<p>The one-on-one game from the other day was almost like a surprise attack, even for me.</p>



<p>When Tōdō, Umi, both understood the depths of Nanase Yuzuki and came at me head-on to crush me, would I still have cards left to play?</p>



<p>And then, no, even more than that…</p>



<p>I hug the ball tightly again before rolling off the bed and standing up. I opened the window.</p>



<p>The solemn air that snuck in was colder than I imagined. Unconsciously, I rubbed my arms for warmth.</p>



<p>It smelled like an autumn night, I think. Damp like a park after rain, yet dry like a pinecone skittering across the asphalt, it bore a resemblance to a weathered library. A season where something bloomed, only to wither away eventually.</p>



<p>Suddenly, my heart started pounding wildly, and I instinctively pressed my hand to my chest.</p>



<p>The memory of myself drenched on the rooftop flashed through my mind, and I shook my head in exasperation.</p>



<p>Deliberately exhaling, my apprehensions transformed into a pale blossom color, melting into the starlit sky.</p>



<p>Since then, I had been replacing my goodnights with thoughts like this.</p>



<p>──Will my earnestness ever reach that sharpened resolve?<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>It was the first Friday of October. After homeroom ended, none of the students from Class 2-5 left; instead, they remained in the classroom.</p>



<p>The members from the cheering squad, including me, were also asked to join them today, so we had decided to take a break, while those who were interested were holding self-practice sessions.</p>



<p>In the end, the responsibility for our class play at the cultural festival had fallen entirely on Nazuna’s shoulders. We occasionally checked the group chat to see if she needed help, but she seemed to be handling the role of coordinator well while skillfully controlling Uemura.</p>



<p>Of course, I wasn’t particularly surprised; I had realized during our little trip over the summer that she could deftly maneuver and oversee everything if she put her mind to it, even though she wasn’t one to step forward voluntarily.</p>



<p>Lost in such thoughts, I was snapped back to reality when Nazuna clapped her hands. The classmates who had been engaged in light conversation now turned their attention toward the podium.</p>



<p>Nazuna energetically raised her right hand and announced with a vibrant tone, “Okay, everyone, pay attention! Look over here!”</p>



<p>In a tone higher than usual, she uttered a phrase that sounded oddly familiar.</p>



<p>“Hey, who are you imitating?!” Yuuko promptly interjected, and the classmates who caught on burst into laughter.</p>



<p>It was true; the resemblance was uncanny, and I found myself chuckling, hand on my mouth. It was comforting to see that Yuuko hadn’t changed in this regard, still the same as the one I knew well.</p>



<p>Glancing at her profile for a moment, I noticed her semi-long hair swaying gently, which was still unfamiliar to me.</p>



<p>Having successfully warmed up the atmosphere, Nazuna seemed to redirect her focus and began to speak again.</p>



<p>“Putting that joke aside for now,” she said, while simultaneously rummaging through a cardboard box placed at her feet.</p>



<p>After a moment, I heard the sound of plastic being peeled away.</p>



<p>“Ta-da! Look, the class T-shirts are here!”</p>



<p>She held up a refreshing sky-blue T-shirt in front of her chest.</p>



<p>“Wowwwww!!!”</p>



<p>The classmates erupted in cheers.</p>



<p>“……..Umm??”</p>



<p>However, those cheers soon transformed into a questioning tone.</p>



<p>I almost burst into laughter, but I realized that depending on the situation, it might come off as impolite, so I hurriedly covered my mouth.</p>



<p>Nazuna raised the T-shirt in front of her, its fabric adorned prominently with an unmistakable drawing—literally, a “storehouse” (蔵 = Kura)</p>



<p>In Fukui, there was this tourist spot called “Kura no Tsuji” in Echizen City, resembling of those earth-wall storehouses you’d see in period dramas, where corrupt officials or unscrupulous merchants would likely store their wealth.</p>



<p>Near the apex of the triangular roof, within a circular border resembling a family crest, was the inscription “2-5.”</p>



<p>Kaito murmured hesitantly, embodying everyone’s confusion, “Wh-Why a storehouse…?”</p>



<p>Nazuna seemed to anticipate the question as she swiftly turned around, revealing the back of the T-shirt. There, displayed for all to see, were the names of all our classmates and…</p>



<p>“It’s the Class T-shirt for Kurasen’s class, so we decided to call it the Kura-T!”</p>



<p>A stylized illustration of Kurasen.</p>



<p>Though the explanation might have sounded complicated if explained in words, it somehow made perfect sense when depicted visually.</p>



<p><em>Ah, I see</em>, I thought with a wry smile. Then Nazuna winked playfully and continued, “By the way, the one who came up with this idea was Chitose-kun.”</p>



<p>Hearing that seemed to dispel any remaining reservations.</p>



<p>Haru was the first to react. “Seriously, that’s so lame!”</p>



<p>Perhaps everyone shared similar thoughts in the back of their minds. A wave of laughter erupts from the classmates.</p>



<p>While we had initially believed it might be rude to laugh if someone had earnestly designed this, in the case of Chitose’s silly joke, we felt no hesitation to join in.</p>



<p>With an exasperated sigh, Haru continued, “Aren’t you a little too influenced by his lame Dad jokes, Chitose?”</p>



<p>Chitose, unusually embarrassed, averted his eyes and mumbled softly, “…Come on, give me a break. Kura-T sounds good, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing that his uncharacteristic response struck a chord, our classmates began to chatter excitedly.</p>



<p>I hadn’t actually participated in the discussion to decide on the Class T-shirt, but Chitose probably offered this light-hearted suggestion to alleviate the tension when the brainstorming session was reaching a dead end. Turns out, it was more popular than he’d anticipated, and amid the euphoria and momentum of the school festival, it was quickly approved.</p>



<p>Surely, at that moment, Chitose hadn’t been entirely displeased with the outcome. But now, having cooled down, embarrassment was surely washing over him.</p>



<p>As expected, both Yuuko and Nazuna chimed in.</p>



<p>“Eh, it’s fine, isn’t it? I mean, won’t it seem adorably lame if you look at it from different perspectives, especially considering Saku proposed it?”</p>



<p>“So it’s still lame in the end, huh?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. Remember when Chitose-kun was like, ‘Right?’ with that triumphant look? It cracked me up.”</p>



<p>“Weren’t you guys the ones who jumped on board?”</p>



<p>Uchi, who had been listening, interjected with a calm voice. “Well, Saku-kun has that side to him.”</p>



<p>“Yua-chan, are you trying to cover for me!?”</p>



<p>Mizushino flashed a faint, amused smile. “I don’t dislike it. It’s like I can feel the enthusiasm of the person who came up with it.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, maybe it’s better if we just get this over with and finish me off.”</p>



<p>Just then, the door at the front of the classroom swung open.</p>



<p>“Goodness gracious, I’m even more of a fine-looking lad in person.”</p>



<p>Kurasen, wearing the ‘Kura-T,’ casually walked in.</p>



<p>“Hey, old man, you’re all cheerful, huh? Thanks for liking it and all!”</p>



<p>Chitose immediately quipped, and the classroom erupted in laughter once more.</p>



<p>As I watched this exchange with my cheek resting on my hand, the gazes of my classmates naturally shifted toward me. Chitose, giving up somewhat, had a wry smile on his face, a sort of desperate grin. He probably wanted to add a clever punchline to the conversation soon in a typical Nanase Yuzuki fashion.</p>



<p><em>I know</em>, I shrugged. And then, with a calm sentiment, I eased my lips, which had relaxed into a gentle curve.</p>



<p>“I love (it/you)” [*there’s no pronoun in Japanese]<sup data-fn="6a5fe3a5-6e3f-4e08-a238-7bc587ff29ed" class="fn"><a href="#6a5fe3a5-6e3f-4e08-a238-7bc587ff29ed" id="6a5fe3a5-6e3f-4e08-a238-7bc587ff29ed-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Looking into Chitose’s eyes, I said it outright.</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>My reaction seemed to catch him off guard. Chitose froze in a somewhat goofy expression. For some reason, he looked incredibly endearing to me, and my eyes unconsciously softened.</p>



<p>After being in a daze for a moment, Chitose’s lips twitched upwards with a sudden realization.</p>



<p>“Coming from you, Nanase, it sounds like there’s a hidden meaning.”</p>



<p>In a rather lackluster style, he evaded the topic with a simple response.</p>



<p>Too bad, he managed to deflect it.</p>



<p>I hadn’t expected him to be flustered by such a mild statement, but still, he could have come up with something a bit more witty, teasing, or cheeky. Despite usually throwing out snobbish and seemingly cool remarks with abandon, he’s such a dunce.</p>



<p>Well, I’d take it as him grasping the implication. That’s something, at least.</p>



<p>I exhaled and let my shoulders relax, my gaze returning to the ‘Kura-T’ that Nazuna held in her hand.</p>



<p>“I love,” I whispered those same words in the depths of my heart.</p>



<p>Because, the more I looked at the T-shirt, the more it screamed “Chitose.”</p>



<p>At first glance, he might try to look cool, but he’d stumble with his lame jokes. And yet, there were unexpected moments of seriousness, moments where he’d light up like a child during festivals, times when he’d casually solve our classmates’ problems, even taking responsibility for the results. He was loved by everyone, despite everything.</p>



<p>…Wait, was I really showering this ‘Kura-T’ with so much praise?</p>



<p>I pressed my lips with my left fingertips and tightened the cheeks that threatened to loosen if I let my guard down.</p>



<p><em>Even so</em>, I thought with a tinge of self-deprecation. What I just did wasn’t quite like Nanase Yuzuki. Those moments belonged more to the likes of Yuuko or Haru, who could spill their true feelings without calculation.</p>



<p>For someone like me, it took a more deliberate, provocative approach filled with artifice to get through, otherwise it would just be dodged before reaching the heart.</p>



<p>But I had played those games enough.</p>



<p>Between me and Chitose, no matter how far we went, it would always resulted in a a dignified and grand reflection of each other, like a mirror.</p>



<p>So, what did genuine love look like for Nanase Yuzuki?</p>



<p>It was a bit irksome to admit after someone managed to knock the wind out of me. But apart from that drowsy September, I didn’t think I had ever faced him with half-hearted feelings.</p>



<p>I had been striving to choose the best answer as Nanase Yuzuki, to continue being the Nanase Yuzuki that’s suitable for Chitose Saku.</p>



<p>But if that version of me was a fake, and if it couldn’t reach him…</p>



<p>Did detaching myself mean bidding farewell to the Nanase Yuzuki I had been until now?</p>



<p>──Even if it was not beautiful, I could live by your side.</p>



<p>Such thoughts, once I steeled myself, brought out the kind of earnest concerns that might make me seem as inexperienced as Haru. This Nanase Yuzuki, who had finally mustered up the courage, felt quite fresh to me—clumsy, impatient, and just a tad exasperating.</p>



<p>While I pondered, Chitose had quietly moved to stand beside Nazuna at the podium. He retrieved a fresh T-shirt from the cardboard box, cleared his throat, and then began to speak.</p>



<p>“First and foremost, whether it’s on the day itself or during the preparation period, we need to actively wear these. Let’s go around promoting the idea that our class, brimming with originality and flair, will perform a play at the cultural festival.”</p>



<p>“No way, it’s hopelessly lame even after looking at it from different angle.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it more likely to backfire?”</p>



<p>“Do girls need to wear them too?”</p>



<p>“Why does Kurasen look so ecstatic about it…”</p>



<p>“Shut uuuuup!!!”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Chitose lifted the T-shirt high as if it were a championship flag.</p>



<p>“Regardless of what anyone says, this is our Class 2-5 ‘Kura-T’! Boys and girls, we’re gonna make this the best darn festival ever, ya heaaarrrr!!!!!!”</p>



<p>“””YEAAAAHHHH!!”””</p>



<p>Somehow or another, it seemed everyone was on the same page about wanting to join the excitement. As usual, Chitose led the class in the familiar rallying cry, boosting everyone’s spirits.</p>



<p>I had seen his subdued expressions and oddly serene gaze quite a bit lately, which I couldn’t say I disliked it.</p>



<p>But the way you went about being Chitose Saku, that’s what I loved about you.</p>



<p>“Oh! Kenta’s name is missing!!!!!!”</p>



<p>“There’s acceptable jokes and forbidden jokes, you bastard King!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>After distributing Kura-T to our classmates, everyone started their preparations for the cultural festival.</p>



<p>Taking this opportunity, Haru, Mizushino, Kaito, and Yamazaki, who were part of the cheering squad and acting group, began assembling the grand props coordinated by Uemura. Uchi, on the other hand, joined in to assist with the costumes.</p>



<p>Chitose, Yuuko, and I were asked to wait for Nazuna in the classroom.</p>



<p>While I was scanning the surroundings, I noticed some eager ones were already changing into their Kura-T. Watching this, Chitose seemed less indifferent than he’d like to admit. I couldn’t resist poking his slightly loosened cheek, only to see him feigned composure with a sudden startle.</p>



<p>I never really worried about this guy’s reliability, and sure enough, Yamazaki’s name was neatly etched alongside Kaito’s on the back of T-shirts.</p>



<p>We continued to chat, pulling our desks closer. Before long, Nazuna returned, clutching what appeared to be a booklet.</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry. I couldn’t get the prints ready by after school.”</p>



<p>Seeing her unusually out of breath, I could sense her tireless efforts as the coordinator of the cultural festival.</p>



<p>Nazuna began distributing the booklets. “It took a bit longer than expected, but here’s the script.”</p>



<p>“””Wow!!”””</p>



<p>Without even realizing, the three of us exclaimed in unison.</p>



<p>I had heard that she was struggling quite a bit with it, and although I had thrown in some ideas myself, I hadn’t been informed about how the final script turned out. With a hint of excitement, I accepted the script. Its title, printed on the cover, caught my eye.</p>



<p><em>“Snow White, the Dark Cloud Princess, and the Indecisive Prince”</em></p>



<p>“”──Hey, hold on a second.””</p>



<p>This time, both Chitose and I protested simultaneously. I, extending my palm as if to say ‘go ahead,’ and Chitose began to speak.</p>



<p>“Who’s this indecisive prince supposed to be?”</p>



<p>Nazuna smiled slightly at that and replied. “Well, it’s just a role in the play. Originally, I thought about making the prince a real playboy, which might attract more audience, but the member from the literature club who helped with the script said that was a bit too much.”</p>



<p>“Seriously, we’re not reenacting the Incident at Honnō-ji temple, are we?”</p>



<p>“What’s that, some kind of controversial thing? Your joke’s both hard to understand and not funny at all!”</p>



<p>After their back-and-forth subsided, I joined in. “So, what’s the deal?”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>I sent a pointed glance towards Nazuna, who returned my gaze with an exaggerated tilt of her head and a blink. In response, I mirrored her gesture and continued in an equally exaggerated sweet voice.</p>



<p>“While it’s pretty obvious why you’d want another Princess to contrast Snow White, why did you choose ‘Dark Cloud’ in particular?”</p>



<p>In response to my words, a composed answer came back. “Well, isn’t it because the queen’s position as the most beautiful in the world is being threatened by Snow White? That’s like dark clouds hanging over her. As for the Indecisive Prince… I mean, I guess the title speaks for itself, doesn’t it? So, isn’t it a bit unfair to single me out?”</p>



<p>“Well, uh, yeah, I guess…”</p>



<p>Her argument was unexpectedly solid, leaving me momentarily speechless. I wondered if Nazuna was deliberately adding some hidden meaning, but regardless of her intentions, her logic made sense.</p>



<p>Perhaps our reactions met Nazuna’s expectations, she let out a small “aha” and lightly touched her lips with her hand.</p>



<p>“Well, this time I deliberately chose not to make you a queen. I went with the setting of a princess shrouded in darkness due to the fear of losing her first love prince to Snow White.”</p>



<p>“All right, enough of your chatter, you little missy.”</p>



<p>As I said those words, both Chitose and Yuuko broke into a stifled laughter, as though they couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p>



<p><em>Honestly, this girl…</em> even I found myself chuckling along.</p>



<p>Considering the circumstances, it was quite a daring topic, yet when it came out of Nazuna’s mouth, the edges of the issue somehow softened.</p>



<p>“Putting that aside,” I changed the topic, “If the script’s ready, why don’t you just distribute it to everyone?”</p>



<p>With the cultural festival just around the corner, there was hardly any time to spare. At the very least, it would be wise to involve the members of the cheering squad who were entrusted with acting roles… but…</p>



<p>While I pondered this, Nazuna awkwardly scratched her cheek and averted her gaze.</p>



<p>“Oh, um, about that, I actually want the three of you to read it first and give me your thoughts. You’ll understand why once you do.”</p>



<p>Chitose, Yuuko, and I exchanged puzzled glances before we started flipping through the pages.</p>



<p>By the time the three of us finished reading and closed the script, a sense of embarrassment mingled with awkwardness seemed to fill the air, more than just contagious discomfort emanating from Nazuna.</p>



<p>In sequence, Chitose, Yuuko, and I voiced our thoughts.</p>



<p>“Frankly, it was really intriguing.”</p>



<p>“I mean, isn’t this pretty much…”</p>



<p>“…about us?”</p>



<p>“──Sorryyyyyy!”</p>



<p>Seeing our reactions, Nazuna clasped her hands in front of her face and bowed dramatically.</p>



<p>“I mentioned this before, but adapting Snow White unexpectedly turned out to be quite difficult. So, I thought, since the main characters are Chitose-kun, Yuuko, and Yuzuki, who are quite well-known around school, maybe it would be fun to base the characters on your personalities…”</p>



<p>Yes, both Snow White and the Dark Cloud Princess, as well as the Indecisive Prince, despite some alterations, naturally mirrored our personalities, actions, and behaviors.</p>



<p>Nervously raising her face, Nazuna continued, “And then, I got a bit carried away and added my two cents, but it somehow ended up with Yuuko and Yuzuki making a conclusive resolve about Chitose-kun… Yeah, meta-wise, it’s kind of an uncomfortable narrative.”</p>



<p>Before I could fully grasp the implications of her explanation,</p>



<p>──Pffft.</p>



<p>The three of us burst into simultaneous laughter. Myself, Chitose, and Yuuko echoed each other.</p>



<p>“Are you for real?”</p>



<p>“I can already imagine the audience throwing stones at me.”</p>



<p>“Seriously, you silly!”</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing that our reactions weren’t pure anger, Nazuna visibly relaxed, releasing a breath she seemed to be holding.</p>



<p>“Well, honestly, I think I might have gone a bit overboard. I even considered scrapping the script without showing anyone, but then…” she said, her words pausing before she continued in a more sincere tone, “For some reason, I feel like I shouldn’t be the one making this decision.”</p>



<p>A surprising display of modesty, her words caused me to narrow my eyes slightly. While it might be true that she had gotten carried away in the excitement of the school festival, it was clear that she hadn’t just handed it over without any thought.</p>



<p>Yuuko’s friend, my friend.</p>



<p>A decade from now, we might be sharing stories over a drink in August. There was a sense of honesty in that sentiment.</p>



<p>Nazuna looked at us as if she were probing for something.</p>



<p>While those around us might have already figured it out long ago, at least I hadn’t openly admitted my feelings to anyone yet, not even to Umi. If that was the case, there was no reason for Nanase Yuzuki to reject this script on the surface.</p>



<p>If anything, what should matter more now was…</p>



<p>Surely, Nazuna must have been thinking along the same lines. She appeared to be stealing glances at Yuuko, waiting for her reaction with her eyes downcast.</p>



<p>Even if the answer was a gentle postponement, the reality was that, as Yuuko herself had put it, this summer marked the end of her love. Even if it was all part of the cultural festival performance, portraying this with us who were knowing the whole story, seemed a bit cruel.</p>



<p>And then, of course, there was Chitose. As the one who had turned down the confession, he might be feeling even more uncomfortable than the rest of us. However, even if Nazuna’s mischief was the trigger, it wouldn’t be easy for him to bring up the subject given the remaining days.</p>



<p>If I were to consider the two of them, wouldn’t it be kinder for me to reject the script on my end?</p>



<p>As I pondered these thoughts, my gaze shifted toward Chitose and Yuuko────</p>



<p>Ah, again. I was captivated by the way their hearts seemed to draw close to each other. In a hushed tranquility, they fluttered about, as if they had stepped ahead into a fairytale world, becoming prince and princess.</p>



<p>Their eyes met in a surrendering dance, and amidst the interplay of their gazes, something seemed to fall and settle,</p>



<p>──it was the pure white snow, untouched by a single footprint, meant only for the two of them.</p>



<p>As if they were about to embark on a journey from here once again.</p>



<p>As if they wouldn’t mind being engulfed in this whiteness forever.</p>



<p>As if they were aware that moments like these would eventually melt away and vanish.</p>



<p>“I’m fine with it. How about you, Saku?”</p>



<p>“If Yuuko’s okay with it, so am I.”</p>



<p>“You’re not forcing yourselves, are you?”</p>



<p>“Not in the slightest.”</p>



<p>“Alright then, shall we do it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s do it.”</p>



<p>“Good luck, Indecisive Prince.”</p>



<p>“Cut me some slack, Snow White.”</p>



<p>Their gentle, synchronized blinking seemed to touch their lips together, and I discreetly dropped my gaze, feeling somewhat left behind.</p>



<p>Watching their shadows sway in the evening sunlight streaming through the window, I absentmindedly raised my hand and slipped between them. It was as though a tiny bit of my pride had been nicked.</p>



<p>“What about you, Nanase?”</p>



<p>So finally, after stealing Chitose’s lips when he turned to me, I answered;</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m in.”</p>



<p>Then, Yuuko and I exchanged glances, and like the princess I wasn’t, I smiled.</p>



<p>Nazuna, who had been silently listening to our conversation, lowered the corner of her eyes with a relieved half-smile.</p>



<p>“Really?! I’m so glad I asked!”</p>



<p>“”But, one more thing…””</p>



<p>Since my words ended up overlapping with Chitose’s again, I offered my palm once more, passing on the conversation. After all, the question we wanted to ask would most likely be the same.</p>



<p>Chitose nodded, and as expected, his voice echoing the same question that was on my mind.</p>



<p>“Is it okay for the ending to still be undecided?”</p>



<p>Setting aside the embarrassment of the characters being modeled after ourselves, the script was undeniably intriguing. While it was based on the well-known Snow White, it cleverly incorporated elements from other fairy tales with original twists and turns.</p>



<p>However, a significant piece was missing—namely, the conclusion.</p>



<p>Given the two princesses as opposing characters, the narrative naturally led to a climax where the prince had to choose between them. Yet, that critical turning point was entirely blank.</p>



<p>Like Chitose, I had been wondering if it was because they hadn’t managed to figure it out yet or if they were waiting for our approval before proceeding…</p>



<p>“Oh, that.”</p>



<p>Nazuna placed a hand near her mouth and mischievously narrowed her eyes, her expression filled with a sense of playfulness.</p>



<p>“Improvise.”</p>



<p>“”Wha—?!?!?””</p>



<p>Once again, Chitose’s and my voices overlapped in disbelief.</p>



<p>Ignoring our shock, Nazuna continued on. “Well, you see, I’m friends with both Yuuko and Yuzuki, so I can’t decide which one should be happy. That’s the prince’s role, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>This girl, she’s saying the most outrageous things. Beyond disbelief or anger, I felt the urge to laugh.</p>



<p>“You’re seriously passing this off as a joke?! If you can’t do it, then have the literary club kids who helped out decide,” Naturally, Chitose interjected.</p>



<p>With a somewhat wicked grin, Nazuna narrowed her eyes.</p>



<p>“Nope,” She swiftly dismissed that suggestion with an overly sweet tone.</p>



<p>“Where did that admirable attitude from earlier go?!” Chitose scratched his head, clearly frustrated.</p>



<p>Nazuna countered nonchalantly. “The earlier apology was simply for using the three of you as models. The issue of what to do with the script’s climax is a separate matter. And above all…”</p>



<p>Pausing for a moment, she leaned in closer to Chitose’s face and continued;</p>



<p>“It’s not like I don’t have some thoughts about your attitude, Chitose-kun.”</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>He was sharp enough to catch on. Certainly, he must noticed that Nazuna had heard about the events of that August from Yuuko.</p>



<p>With a look akin to having bitten into a bitter bug, he gestured for her to continue.</p>



<p>“Of course, I’m not suggesting that you should determine who you romantically prefer onstage. Besides, that would be too cruel for the one not chosen.”</p>



<p>“That’s why,” Nazuna clapped her hands together in front of her chest, “How about we let Chitose-kun decide the Best Leading Actress for that day?”</p>



<p>“Best Leading Actress…?”</p>



<p><em>Ah, I see</em>. I understood a bit quicker than Chitose did. In other words, this seemed to be a playful form of mild punishment, a point of resolution for situation that could be comprehended intellectually but were still hard to fully accept.</p>



<p>Nazuna raised her finger and spoke up. “Although the play is Snow White, I’m treating it as a story with dual heroines. At the cultural festival’s stage, Chitose-kun will choose the actress who performs better between Yuuko and Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>Chitose seemed to want to interject, but Nazuna continued her explanation;</p>



<p>“On the flip side, it means that evaluations will be based solely on acting. Personal emotions like love, friendship, or sympathy won’t be part of the judging criteria. This rule applies not only to Chitose-kun, but Yuuko and Yuzuki should understand this as well. It’s fine if they feel frustrated about losing in acting, but it’d be troublesome if they take it to heart and relate it to reality.”</p>



<p>In moments like these, her cunningness was well-thought-out. I couldn’t help but chuckle. With this much preamble, it wouldn’t be wise to put on a solemn face just because they weren’t chosen. If I were to do that, Nazuna would definitely seize the opportunity to tease me relentlessly.</p>



<p><em>Besides</em>, I secretly glanced at Yuuko’s expression.</p>



<p>The girl who had matured beyond that August wouldn’t likely be hurt by a decision like this. Nazuna probably realized this and was confident enough to initiate this matter after observing the exchange between Chitose and Yuuko a while ago.</p>



<p>So, this was nothing more than a playacting game during a festive occasion.</p>



<p>A moment behind, Chitose seemed to reach the same conclusion. He let out an exaggerated sigh that seemed like a surrender before speaking.</p>



<p>“Got it. But, even if you say that, I don’t really know much about judging acting skills.”</p>



<p>Nazuna chuckled lightly, her shoulders shaking. “It’s not that complicated. Whether it’s a line that resonates with your heart, confidence in the acting, or even just not stumbling over their lines—it’s all fair game for your criteria, Chitose-kun.”</p>



<p>Chitose offered a vague smile. “Is that okay with you, Yuuko, Nanase?”</p>



<p>For some reason, his voice carried a tinge of loneliness.</p>



<p>I wanted to brush away that unintentional tinge of emotion that had seeped into his words, so I replied with a light-hearted quip, much like him.</p>



<p>“It must be nice, being a prince who gets to choose between such lovely ladies for your first night.”</p>



<p>“Cut out the innuendos from the get-go.”</p>



<p>His reaction regained a bit of his usual demeanor, and I gently eased my cheeks.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” I turned to my dear friend, “I’m good at playing Nanase Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>Yuuko looked a little surprised for a moment, then smiled lightly, like a flurry of snowflakes.</p>



<p>“I’m good at loving the Prince.”</p>



<p><em>Honestly</em>, I shrugged my shoulders. If it were the Yuuko from before summer break, I wouldn’t have felt like losing in in such a game. But now, finding a way to win didn’t seem as easy.</p>



<p>Since when did I start to do nothing but watch someone’s back as they overtook me? Even though there was certainly a time when I was the princess protected by the prince…</p>



<p>I lowered the corners of my eyes with a self-mocking sigh.</p>



<p>It seemed like we had reached an agreement with our conversation.</p>



<p>Nazuna clapped her hands together as if to wrap up the discussion. “Alright then, we’ll leave the climax to the ad-lib performances of you three!”</p>



<p>Chitose lifted the corner of his mouth. “So, it’s not just about choosing, but all the lines that come after that, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, go with the flow! Whether it’s a happy ending or a bad ending.”</p>



<p>“Well, it should be a straightforward happy ending, right…”</p>



<p>“Well, if the one not chosen ends up eating a poisoned apple and dying, you never know…”</p>



<p>“Please don’t even joke about that, it might make Saku-kun cry!”</p>



<p>As Chitose said that, he glanced at Yuuko and me, and the three of us burst into laughter.</p>



<p>Continuing to chuckle softly, I suddenly noticed Nazuna looking at us with an expression that seemed somewhat detached, troubled, yet endlessly gentle. When our eyes met, she turned her face away as if nothing had happened, directing her gaze back to Chitose.</p>



<p>“So,” she said, “Why not do a rehearsal?”</p>



<p>Chitose tilted his head in bewilderment at the seemingly random remark. “A rehearsal? For an ad-lib?”</p>



<p>Ah, I see. Those words from Nazuna were meant for me.</p>



<p>Until just a moment ago, I had been boldly considering Yuuko’s feelings. But eventually, one would confess, be confessed to, choose, not choose, be chosen, or not be chosen.</p>



<p>Among the three of us, the only one who hadn’t prepared for any of that…</p>



<p>──It was me who needed a rehearsal.</p>



<p>Someone once told me;</p>



<p><em>“Sorry, but I can’t just side with you.”</em></p>



<p>In other words, just like how she stood by Yuuko’s side, she was willing to stand by Nanase Yuzuki too. While saying that eating a poisoned apple and dying was certainly exaggerated, it might not be entirely wrong to say that I could lose something precious within myself.</p>



<p>Snow White knew the taste of the poisoned apple.</p>



<p>Snow White knew the taste of the prince’s kiss.</p>



<p>Would the magic mirror reveal something to me?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>It was a Saturday during the weekend. </p>



<p>After finishing my morning club activities, I walked in front of Fukui Station while pushing my Bianchi crossbike.</p>



<p>When I lifted my gaze, I saw clouds in the clear autumn sky that seemed to have been swept by a brush, creating a fleeting image. The gentle sunlight reflected off the glass screen of Happyring Mall was casting flickering reflections, while the nostalgic sound of the tram echoed—<em>clang, clang, squeak</em>—as it passed me by.</p>



<p>It had been a while since I made a weekend date promise, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit tickled by the thought. The nervousness that made me want to see my date’s face quickly, and the sudden shyness that made me want to turn back—it was just like back then.</p>



<p>Walking into the arched Galleria Motomachi shopping street, the exterior of the cafe “su_mu,” a place I hadn’t visited in quite some time, came into view. The blue heart painted at the entrance looked like the uncolored sketch of a heart, and for a moment, I envied the version of me who stood here at the beginning of May.</p>



<p>I parked my crossbike in front of the shop and paused in front of the door.</p>



<p>What kind of expression should I wear when we met? Just as I casually thought about it, my heart skipped a beat.</p>



<p>When I brushed my hair behind my left ear, the scent of the shampoo was pleasantly ticklish.</p>



<p>I had taken a shower once I got home. After changing into casual clothes and applying makeup, I reapplied nail polish and even dabbed perfume on my waist.</p>



<p>──It’s alright, even if I were to be stripped bare, I’m still the Nanase Yuzuki.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I stepped into the café. I caught sight of my waiting date sitting at a table by the back window. That person seemed to have noticed me too and waved cheerfully.</p>



<p>That day, Chitose sat across from this seat.</p>



<p>That day, it was the seat where I was sitting.</p>



<p>I shrugged my shoulders slightly and approached, lifting my hand lightly.</p>



<p>“Hey there.”</p>



<p>My date partner widened their eyes in surprise and then responded with a slightly teasing echo.</p>



<p>“Hey there.”</p>



<p>Then, as if they couldn’t contain their excitement any longer, they stood up with a delighted expression.</p>



<p>“Welcome, Yuzuki-san!”</p>



<p>Nozomi Kureha burst into a spirited and radiant smile.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/i-0049_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>Seated across from Kureha, I handed her the menu.</p>



<p>“I already know what I want, so take your time choosing.”</p>



<p>My kouhai’s innocent eyes gleamed as she glanced around the interior of the café. Once she received the menu, she began to ponder it with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“Is the signature menu the Eggs Benedict then?”</p>



<p>“Mostly, yes, but the Massan Curry is quite popular too.”</p>



<p>“By the way, what are you ordering, Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>“I’ll have the Smoked Salmon &amp; Avocado and Elderflower Cordial.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, then how about Senpai?”</p>



<p>Her unexpected usage of “senpai” caught me off guard, making me tense momentarily. I attempted to feign nonchalance and suppress my surprise, but realizing the futility, I let out a deliberately exaggerated sigh.</p>



<p>“I believe it was the Bacon &amp; Onion and an Iced Coffee.”</p>



<p>“Alright, then I’ll go with that!”</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>“But, I want to taste the same flavors as Senpai!”</p>



<p>“By the way, didn’t I recommend the Elderflower Cordial as an addition?”</p>



<p>“An extra one, please!”</p>



<p>“Listen…”</p>



<p>She was completely unfazed, or rather, entirely composed.</p>



<p>I raised my hand to summon the server and placed the orders for both of us. Then, propping my chin up with my hand, I gazed intently at my still-enthusiastic kouhai, who was engrossed in the menu across from me, with an air of exasperation.</p>



<p>It was a given since it was a weekend, but Kureha was also dressed casually today.</p>



<p>She wore white short shorts that allowed some room around her thighs, exhibiting the supple agility honed from short-distance track training, all while maintaining a feminine softness. The cropped navy blue knit cardigan, with its elegant Prussian blue hues, draped over her shoulders, revealing the skin above her high waist and the area around her ample chest due to its loose-fitting style.</p>



<p>As a girl, I couldn’t help but be mesmerized. A thought like “she’s so stunning” crossed my mind. Despite being aware of and deliberately owning my proportions until now, her figure was so well-balanced that even I, looking at her, found it captivating.</p>



<p>──It’s a sculpted beauty.</p>



<p>This was all subjective and personal preference, so I wouldn’t pass judgment on what’s good or bad. For instance, Yuuko, who naturally maintained that figure, or Uchi who kept up with healthy meals, possessed a bit more of that feminine allure. In contrast, Haru’s lean frame lacked excess fat, and Nishino-senpai’s physique stood as a neutral ground, neither too prominently feminine nor masculine.</p>



<p>And what I had held onto as my ideal is a strength that embodied both the grace of woman curves and the robustness of a creature’s physique. To accentuate where it should be accentuated and tone where it should be toned. To maintain the softness on the surface while fortifying within.</p>



<p>That sounded straightforward when put into words, yet I was well aware that simply living wasn’t enough to achieve it. If you went about your life without awareness, your body inevitably took on a feminine form. Conversely, if you trained relentlessly, you would become more sculpted.</p>



<p>However, when you were seriously dedicated to a sport, there was no compromise, which left no choice but to strike a balance during other times. That’s why it was all the more evident to me that Kureha’s appearance was finely tuned under a similar sense of aesthetics to my own, which irked me to acknowledge, albeit involuntarily.</p>



<p>Perhaps she sensed my gaze wandering in such contemplation. She glanced at me, her head tilting in surprise.</p>



<p>With a wry smile, I opened my mouth, “During training camp or when we gather as the cheer squad, you opt for a sportier look, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes! I thought if I looked too feminine, Senpai might get suspicious.”</p>



<p>“Yet you went for that bold sports bra?”</p>



<p>“Yes! Still, I figured it’s essential to catch his little attention to some extent, to avoid complications later on. Using track and field as an excuse works, and besides…”</p>



<p>Kureha paused mid-sentence, her eyes narrowing playfully.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it surprisingly thrilling? Like when a girl you saw as just a junior unexpectedly bares her vulnerable skin, or when her chest, which you never consciously noticed before, swells beneath her slightly baggy clothes?”</p>



<p>“Well, I suppose I understand,” I answered, averting my gaze almost instinctively.</p>



<p>Reflecting on similar past situations, a peculiar sense of embarrassment washed over me.</p>



<p>“What about you, Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>Unable to gauge the intention behind the question, I returned her gaze, only to find Kureha intently observing my attire.</p>



<p>“With such a great body, why do you always go for boyish outfits?”</p>



<p><em>Ah</em>, I exhaled a short sigh of understanding.</p>



<p>“It’s a form of arrogant self-defense, I suppose.”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed to have easily grasped the meaning behind my somewhat indirect words.</p>



<p>“I understand that. I wouldn’t wear these clothes either if I were in a place with nosy girls or boys I’m not interested in.”</p>



<p>I chuckled dryly, knowing she was right. With this appearance, she must have experienced similar situations, big or small. She could probably breeze through it with a little acting, but she must be well aware that the realms of female envy and male lust weren’t exactly genteel enough to be dismissed by acting alone.</p>



<p>“However,” Kureha continued, “If it were due to my circumstances, it’d make sense, but why don’t you even use your woman charm in front of Senpai?”</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>Caught off guard by the unexpected question, I was suddenly put on the spot. Whether she sensed something from my expression or not, Kureha quickly waved her hands.</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry. I didn’t mean to pick a fight just now.”</p>



<p>Her words prompted a wry smile from me, and I playfully repeated her provocation, “…So, that wasn’t you starting a fight yet?”</p>



<p>Kureha replied unabashedly, “Yes! It wasn’t, yet!”</p>



<p>Just then, the Eggs Benedict and drinks we’d ordered were brought over, conveniently shifting the conversation. Perhaps Kureha had sensed it was a touchy topic and took a step back on her end.</p>



<p>Lifting my gaze, I noticed Kureha gently placing her hand near the neckline of her cardigan.</p>



<p>“If I were Yuzuki-san…”</p>



<p>She murmured, almost like a soliloquy she had no intention of sharing with anyone.</p>



<p>Captivated by her fleeting expression, I tightened my grip on my chest,</p>



<p><em>If I were Kureha…</em></p>



<p>I let out a whisper of longing that seemed like a plea for someone to listen.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>There was no need for me to demonstrate<sup data-fn="1da86c56-1401-4ea4-b814-4125e44739de" class="fn"><a href="#1da86c56-1401-4ea4-b814-4125e44739de" id="1da86c56-1401-4ea4-b814-4125e44739de-link">1</a></sup>, Kureha deftly split the Eggs Benedict in half from its center, skillfully handled fork and knife, cut it into manageable pieces, and carried the poached egg yolk to her mouth with expertise.</p>



<p>“Mmm, this is incredibly delicious!”</p>



<p>Her innocent reaction remained true to her junior-like nature, and her delight brought a smile to my lips.</p>



<p>“Indeed.”</p>



<p>“I’ve never had Elderflower Cordial before, but I’m definitely ordering it again!”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it great?”</p>



<p>“Yes! This is the taste that holds memories for you and Senpai!”</p>



<p>“That’s what you mean, huh?”</p>



<p>“Well, listen,” I shrugged my shoulders dramatically. “Just so you know, Chitose have brought Haru and Yuuko here too.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really?! Senpai is surprisingly insensitive.”</p>



<p>I chuckled softly and nodded slightly. “Well, that’s true, but I did say I wouldn’t get hurt by something like that.”</p>



<p>Kureha set down the fork with the Eggs Benedict and tilted her head curiously.</p>



<p>“But if someone you like took another girl to a place you recommended, wouldn’t that be annoying?”</p>



<p>A simple question, handled without pretense.</p>



<p>“Because it’s me.”</p>



<p>Kureha wore an ambiguous smile, akin to the way one might divert attention from a forgotten homework assignment.</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>Her slight confusion was oddly comforting, so I continued as if extending my notebook toward her.</p>



<p>“We’re similar, so we understand each other. What I want to leave behind in this place isn’t records, but memories alone.”</p>



<p>Listening silently, Kureha’s eyes narrowed with a somewhat mature expression.</p>



<p>“It seems I shouldn’t underestimate you, Nana-san.”</p>



<p>The charade had its limit, and I took the cue to move forward.</p>



<p>“──So, what’s the reason for this?”</p>



<p>Kureha, with a touch of allure in her gaze, responded. “What else? I’m inviting you on a date, of course.”</p>



<p>She offered a playful, impish grin, responding with a light-hearted tone.</p>



<p>──From that day, from the incident on that rooftop.</p>



<p>Kureha continued to blend into our cheer squad, as if nothing had changed. Rarely could an analogy be as fitting as one comparing her to a borrowed cat<sup data-fn="0b0a3281-db00-434b-a874-9273bee6e03c" class="fn"><a href="#0b0a3281-db00-434b-a874-9273bee6e03c" id="0b0a3281-db00-434b-a874-9273bee6e03c-link">2</a></sup>, quietly obedient.</p>



<p>Her behavior toward Chitose and the others still made sense.</p>



<p>However, for her, who had so audaciously bared her fangs, to innocently call out to me the next day with a cheerful “Yuzuki-saaan!”—that was truly surprising.</p>



<p>Honestly, while I spent the entire night cooling my head after getting heated up in the showdown with Tōdō, thoughts of Kureha had been swirling in my mind. Thanks to that, maintaining composure without arousing suspicion from those around us was quite a challenge.</p>



<p>And so, except for those few days, our September remained calm, even in stagnation.</p>



<p>I had mistakenly thought that the confession on the rooftop would act as the starting pistol, propelling us to shorten the distance between Chitose and us, much like a short sprint. As such, my expectations had left me disappointed.</p>



<p>Yesterday was when Kureha finally made a move.</p>



<p><em>“Yuzuki-san, would you like to go on a date?”</em></p>



<p>Why did I feel relieved seeing that message arrive late at night?</p>



<p>Regardless, today was the day I had specified for our meeting.</p>



<p>While Kureha still wore that façade of the docile cat, she seemed unwilling to press the issue too early, probably to avoid getting on my nerves. So, for a while, we engaged in a teasing back-and-forth between senpai and kouhai.</p>



<p>The fact that she addressed me by my court name clearly signaled that the real conversation was about to begin.</p>



<p>Kureha seemed to be waiting for my reaction, so I decided to tease her a little.</p>



<p>“Well then, how about dropping the suspicious kouhai act and go on a date with just the two of us?”</p>



<p>My words seemed to catch her off guard. She blinked in surprise, then quickly opened her mouth, seemingly offended.</p>



<p>“Hey! Don’t talk about me like I’m some conniving, two-faced villain!”</p>



<p>“Are you suggesting otherwise?”</p>



<p>“Why are you taking this so seriously!?”</p>



<p>Kureha pouted while looking at her own palm. It almost seemed like it had sunken in, and I felt a twinge of guilt. I couldn’t help but mock myself for thinking it was all just a senior-junior charade.</p>



<p>However, she should have known this by now.</p>



<p>“Both are part of me.”</p>



<p>As expected, Kureha elegantly turned the conversation around.</p>



<p>“Both as everyone’s kouhai and as the one who provoked the fight… they both show the true colors of Nozomi Kureha. Whether you flip it this way or that, it’s still the same me.”</p>



<p>I wondered why.</p>



<p>Different from the carefree Yuuko of the past, or the matured girl who had emerged after August, distinct from the ever-supportive Uchi, or the relentless determination of Haru, and entirely different from the kind yet unattainable Nishino-senpai…</p>



<p>──Why did this kouhai, who probably clashed with all of them, leave such beautiful thorns in my heart?</p>



<p>Praying that my words didn’t come off as mere childish banter, I couldn’t ignore the question that had piqued my curiosity.</p>



<p>“After all that grandstanding, isn’t the crouching start right up your alley?”</p>



<p>Whether my meaning was correctly conveyed or not, Kureha answered with her beguiling gaze.</p>



<p>“It’s just a little thank you from me to you, Nana-san.”</p>



<p>I furrowed my brow, failing to grasp the meaning. “A thank you…?”</p>



<p>Kureha, for some reason, lowered the corners of her eyes as if she found something endearing, and then she softly shrugged her shoulders.</p>



<p>“I had a feeling, but you never told anyone, did you, Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>I understood what she was referring to, naturally.</p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate me,” I smiled slightly in response.</p>



<p>Kureha’s earnest feelings, her determination, her love… I had accepted them so thoroughly that I didn’t want to become the kind of woman who would broadcast them in some unrefined retaliation.</p>



<p>Moreover, I didn’t want to drag Chitose, who had made it through August and arrived peacefully in September, into this. The exchange we had on the rooftop was something I wanted to keep hidden in my heart.</p>



<p>Kureha seemed exasperated, but also strangely amused as she spoke.</p>



<p>“If it were me, I’d definitely run straight to Senpai’s house on the way home.”</p>



<p>“I’m sure you would,” I replied without hesitation.</p>



<p>“And then, while warning Senpai about what kind of woman Nozomi Kureha is, I’d cry my heart out on his chest. I’m sure he’d comfort me,” She continued with a mischievous tilt of her head.</p>



<p>I chuckled wistfully before answering. “Even if those words came from my mouth, he wouldn’t judge someone’s character solely based on hearsay.”</p>



<p>“Oh?”</p>



<p>Finally, Kureha showed a slightly surprised reaction.</p>



<p>“Just so you know, even in such a situation, he wouldn’t just kindly embrace you. Well, getting slapped and receiving a lecture is a possibility, though,” I shrugged my shoulders with a sense of nostalgia.</p>



<p>For some reason, Kureha looked at me with envy and said in a somewhat melancholic tone, “My, what a harsh prince he is.”</p>



<p>“Agreed.”</p>



<p>With that, the two of us looked at each other and burst into laughter.</p>



<p>She’s such a peculiar girl, I thought. Even though we had clashed so fiercely, I couldn’t bring myself to dislike this junior of mine.</p>



<p>“In any case,” Kureha spoke up, taking a moment to breathe. “Out of respect for your aesthetics, Yuzuki-san, I decided to be quiet for a while.”</p>



<p>I let out a brief sigh, somewhat embarrassed that my kouhai had been considering my feelings.</p>



<p>Kureha smiled with relief and continued, “But, you truly are the Yuzuki-san I’ve always admired. I was actually a bit scared to ask you out today because I didn’t want to be disappointed if you turned me down.”</p>



<p>If it wasn’t a sudden one-on-one confrontation, there’s always a way to approach it. </p>



<p>Either way, I had steeled myself to face this girl head-on.</p>



<p>So, I spoke the words I had been saving for <em>him</em> someday.</p>



<p>“I’m the type who gives my all to someone I acknowledge.”</p>



<p>For a split second, Kureha looked like she was about to cry, biting her lip, then she sheepishly scratched her cheek.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki-san, you’ve become even more beautiful lately, and it’s quite mesmerizing.”</p>



<p>“You flatter me.”</p>



<p>With that, I spoke boldly, making sure not to be swayed by her fleeting vulnerability.</p>



<p>“So, is this your way of declaring war again today?”</p>



<p>“Yes! I won’t hold back anymore!” Kureha answered without hesitation, then suddenly cast her eyes downward. “If we stand still forever, we’ll be left behind by the seasons, after all.”</p>



<p><em>Thump</em>. My heartbeats grew louder.</p>



<p><em>“Everyone just continues on without moving forward or wanting to step back.”</em></p>



<p><em>“──Holding hands, forming a circle, content in your stagnation.”</em></p>



<p>So, even with the point of a sword held to my throat, I was still incapable of taking that step forward. </p>



<p>Ever since that day when I revealed my weakness in front of Kureha, I had believed I’d faced the earnestness of Nanase Yuzuki, and the earnestness of love. Even if I hadn’t taken any significant outward actions, my mind had been consumed by it all.</p>



<p>However, for Kureha, this time must have looked like nothing more than an extension of stagnation. Maybe this way, I could never reach her.</p>



<p>The words “earnestness of love” became cheaper every time I repeated them in my head. Could I truly find the correct answer? Would Nanase Yuzuki’s right answer lead to the same place?</p>



<p>Lost in these thoughts, I suddenly turned my gaze to Kureha.</p>



<p>“Can I ask you something?”</p>



<p>“Of course! I’m all ears!”</p>



<p>“What would you have done if I had been completely honest with Chitose?”</p>



<p>Considering my personality, it wasn’t impossible for me to have told him, even though the chances were slim. But I also didn’t believe that a girl who had approached Chitose with such determination would casually reveal her colour without thinking ahead.</p>



<p>As expected, Kureha didn’t even seem to hesitate and said firmly,</p>



<p>“──That would be convenient, I suppose.”</p>



<p>“Convenient…?”</p>



<p>Surprised by her unexpected answer, I looked at Kureha, who continued matter-of-factly;</p>



<p>“Either way, I would have eventually expressed my feelings. As long as Yuzuki-san doesn’t twist the truth, there’s nothing I would have needed to hide from Senpai.”</p>



<p>Her gaze was strong, and I felt like I was being overwhelmed.</p>



<p>“<em>Both are part of me</em>,” Kureha had said this.</p>



<p>Surely, that was her heartfelt truth, not an exaggeration, embellishment, or falsehood. Both were genuine, so there was no need to be ashamed if the person you loved saw them.</p>



<p>How many girls could confidently declare such a thing in this situation?</p>



<p>“Furthermore,” Kureha softened her expression. “Yuzuki-san mentioned it earlier, but we’re talking about that kind-hearted senpai. I’m sure he’ll listen to my side of the story too. Just because he knows how I feel, it doesn’t mean he’ll coldly push me away, right?”</p>



<p>I responded with a wry smile of agreement.</p>



<p>“If it were some superficial confession from a girl he’s never talked to, maybe. But with you, Kureha, I highly doubt it. He’ll likely take it seriously and think through everything.”</p>



<p>Pausing briefly for emphasis, I continued with emotions that hovered between surrender and admiration.</p>



<p>“He can’t disregard someone’s earnest prayers, after all. He’s a hero.”</p>



<p>“I understand,” Kureha said, lowering her eyes affectionately. “In that case, isn’t this a chance to break free from being just a kouhai and be seen as a woman?”</p>



<p>The loneliness in her voice sounded like a prayer, and I spoke up.</p>



<p>“Do you still have room for dessert?”</p>



<p>Kureha raised her face, wearing a puzzled expression as she replied, “I do, but…?”</p>



<p>I casually pointed my thumb towards the counter. “This place has amazing canelés.”</p>



<p>“Canelés!”</p>



<p>“The outside is crispy, the inside is moist. These canelés are like a benchmark.”</p>



<p>“Did Senpai try them too?”</p>



<p><em>Honestly, this girl…</em></p>



<p>“He doesn’t eat many sweet things. Besides…” I lightly tapped the table with my finger. “Today, you’re on a date with me, Kureha.”</p>



<p>There was such a wonderful girl right in front of her, and yet, she had been distracted. She needed to pay more attention.</p>



<p>“Take home at least one of my memories that Chitose doesn’t know about.”</p>



<p>“Yuzu, Nana-san…” Kureha’s eyes sparkled briefly, then she bit her lip with a slightly troubled expression. “I told you, we can’t be friends…”</p>



<p>“But right now, you’re my girlfriend, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>I replied nonchalantly, and this time she loosened up her cheeks with a grin.</p>



<p>“Well then, just for today, I’ll be your company!”</p>



<p>She winked at me impishly.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>As we finished our canelés, Kureha opened her mouth with a look of pure contentment.</p>



<p>“These were soooo delicious! I used to think canelés were dry and would suck all the moisture from your mouth.”</p>



<p>“Right?”</p>



<p>When I first tried them, I was amazed by how different they could be depending on the shop.</p>



<p>Next time, I might even try Massan Curry. Some places never go wrong, no matter what you ordered, thanks to the sense of the person behind the recipes or because it simply aligned with your taste buds. The atmosphere might be entirely different, but ‘Takokyu’ was one of those places too.</p>



<p>When you had a few such places jotted down in the notebook of your heart, every day became bit more enjoyable.</p>



<p>As I entertained these thoughts aimlessly, I suddenly noticed Kureha’s serious gaze. She seemed to be waiting for the right moment to bring something up, so I tilted my head slightly to encourage her to speak.</p>



<p>Kureha tightly grasped her hand resting on her shorts and began, “Nana-san, may I ask you something?”</p>



<p>“Are you thinking to pick a fight now that you’re full?”</p>



<p>I teased her lightly, but her response was more somber than I expected.</p>



<p>“It might come across that way, but it’s different in my mind,” she said, with a somewhat self-deprecating tone. “I don’t want to owe anyone anything just to fulfill my desires fairly and squarely.”</p>



<p>“I don’t recall saying I’d treat you, though?”</p>



<p>This was probably one of his bad influences, I thought suddenly, finding it oddly amusing that I wanted to interject light-hearted banter before a serious conversation.</p>



<p>“So, what do you want to know?” I asked.</p>



<p>Kureha, who had been chuckling, withdrew her laughter, straightened her posture, and took a short breath. Then, as if she were gripping the hilt of a sword at her waist, she narrowed her eyes.</p>



<p>“──How long do you intend to continue being Nanase Yuzuki?”</p>



<p>It was a swift, decisive strike.</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>I was hit by palpitations that were no illusion or hallucination this time.</p>



<p>Kureha continued as if she were returning a drawn sword.</p>



<p>“You haven’t tattled to him about what happened on the rooftop, nor have you gone crying to him. Despite all the provocations, all the waiting, it doesn’t seem like you’ve taken any action. You’re not using the woman charm you’ve so carefully honed in front of him. And now, you’re even being sweet to me…”</p>



<p>“I told you, didn’t I?” She said, as if to remind me, “I won’t lose to a woman who can’t even commit herself wholeheartedly.”</p>



<p>She spoke the same words she had said to me on that day.</p>



<p>“I’ll repeat it as many times as needed. If I were you, Yuzuki-san, I wouldn’t hesitate to run to his house. I wouldn’t resort to anything underhanded, but I would tell him the truth. I would lean on him, the guy who couldn’t leave a crying girl alone, and cry my heart out. If circumstances didn’t lead to a gentle embrace, I would create the situation and forcefully make him embrace me. All of my love would be reserved for him; I wouldn’t waste my time sending salt on a rival.”</p>



<p>Ah, I see, I thought as I bit my lip. Right before me, I had an example of love in all its earnestness.</p>



<p>Kureha, this beautiful girl, had staked everything she had. She was determined to run through this spring with all of herself, with a heart laid bare like a solitary vase.</p>



<p>“In the end,” Kureha said, her tone almost exasperated, “Nanase Yuzuki seems to value aesthetics more than Senpai does.”</p>



<p>When confronted with my own self-awareness, my breath threatened to halt.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump</em>, my heart pounded painfully in my chest.</p>



<p>On that day, in the gymnasium with the echoing rain, I had pledged. That I wouldn’t fear hurting anyone, just like the girl standing before me…</p>



<p>“I’m not afraid of a woman who can’t change for the man she loves,” Kureha declared, drawing her metaphorical sword just before sheathed it again, “I heard it from my friends on the basketball team. You beat Ashi High’s ace, didn’t you, Nana-san?”</p>



<p>With that, almost like concluding the conversation,</p>



<p>“Still, compared to Nanase Yuzuki, it seems like Nana is the more formidable opponent.”</p>



<p>She lowered the corners of her eyes and smiled sadly.</p>



<p>Facing this girl, I couldn’t find any words to respond. She handed over her share of the meal cost, and she rose from her seat gracefully.</p>



<p>“Thank you for accompanying me on our date today,” she said, bowing politely. She looked straight at me and added, “Nana-san, that’s a thank you for the canelés.”</p>



<p>As she walked away, I couldn’t help but think her back, tall and unwavering, was simply beautiful.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>“…If possible, please, just come to hate me.”<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*</p>



<p>Honestly, long before you said that, I had already realized.</p>



<p><em>“As long as Nanase Yuzuki continues to be Nanase Yuzuki, I’ll keep repeating the same regrets.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Surely, I’ll make a choice that seems unquestionably correct to anyone, a choice that even Nanase Yuzuki believes is beautiful, but it may not be right or beautiful to me.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But Nanase Yuzuki… she simply won’t throw everything away to fulfill her love.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Certainly, as long as I remain Nanase Yuzuki, you can only be Chitose Saku.”</em></p>



<p>──Very well, if that’s what you desire, I’ll become Nana or even the Mirror Witch.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>On the following Saturday afternoon, just before the onset of twilight, our group of female basketball players had gathered in Fuji High’s gymnasium, forming a circle around Misaki-chan.</p>



<p>As part of our final preparations for the upcoming Winter Cup qualifiers, this month had been filled with practice matches against formidable high schools from both within and outside our prefecture.</p>



<p>Today marked the first of these matches, against the formidable Oboro High School from Kanazawa. They were regular contenders in the Winter Cup and Inter-High, boasting an impressive track record. With the exception of Fuji High, which clinched victory two years ago when Aki-san and Suzu-san were on the team, Ashi High had reigned supreme for as long as I could remember. So, it was likely that they saw this as a mere formality.</p>



<p>It suited us just fine. Regardless, if we were to advance to the nationals, we had to defeat Ashi High. We couldn’t afford to lose just because they were considered superior. I didn’t intend to get carried away just because I managed to pull off an unexpected 1-on-1 victory over Tōdō. That alone wouldn’t make me think I had surpassed her.</p>



<p>That’s why I wanted to put it to the test.</p>



<p>──With the team that had caught Umi’s passion this summer, how far could I lead us?</p>



<p>Misaki-chan slowly scanned everyone’s faces before speaking. “This team has changed.”</p>



<p>“”‘YES!”””</p>



<p>“Do you think it’s a pipe dream for Fuji High to beat Oboro?”</p>



<p>“””NO!””” replied Haru, Yō, and Sen, unwavering in their response.</p>



<p>“It’s a prelude to facing Ashi High. Make this winter burn with your summer, everyone.”</p>



<p>“””YESSS!”””</p>



<p>Afterward, Misaki-chan turned her gaze toward me. “Nana, I’ll leave the game-making to you. Play as you see fit.”</p>



<p>“I will.”</p>



<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Umi clenching her fists tightly, her lips pressed together in frustration.</p>



<p>──I’m sorry, Umi. Right now, it’s just not possible.</p>



<p>Pretending not to notice my partner’s demeanor, I focused on the match unfolding before me.</p>



<p>Fuji High, up until now, had been a team centered around Umi, for better or for worse.</p>



<p>Of course, I was the one orchestrating the plays as the team’s guard, but at its core, our strategy had always revolved around how to maximize the potential of my partner, who was undeniably the team’s ace and scorer. So, when Umi was tactically guarded, even if I did my best with three-pointers, our team’s scoring power noticeably dwindled, and that had become one glaring weakness.</p>



<p>But from now on, it’s different.</p>



<p>──I’ll seize victories with my own hands.</p>



<p>“All right, huddle up!”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan clapped her hands together, and we put our arms around each other’s shoulders.</p>



<p>Umi, as expected of our captain, seemed to have shifted her focus, returning to the demeanor of someone ready for the match.</p>



<p>I let out a small sigh of relief; it had to be this way.</p>



<p>Umi, with a glance in our direction, furrowed her brow and firmly stomped the floor.</p>



<p>“DO YOU LOVE THEM?”</p>



<p>“””I LOVE THEM!”””</p>



<p>Sen, Yō, everyone, together, we stomped the floor.</p>



<p>“IS YOUR LOVE REAL?”</p>



<p>“””I LOVE THEM TO THE BONE!”””</p>



<p>“THEN LIGHT YOUR HEART ON FIRE!”</p>



<p>“””WE ARE NOT GIRLS WHO JUST WAIT!”””</p>



<p>“THE MAN WE WANT—”</p>



<p>“””HOLD HIM CLOSE!”””</p>



<p>“IF HE IGNORES—”</p>



<p>“””SHOOT HIM DOWN!”””</p>



<p>“WE ARE—”</p>



<p>“””FIGHTING GIRLS!!”””</p>



<p>With a thunderous roar, we stomped the floor like war drums.</p>



<p>And thus, separated by the center circle, both teams lined up.</p>



<p>──<em>Mirror, mirror.</em></p>



<p>With a hair tie held gently between my lips, I gathered my hair, reciting a sort of self-affirming charm that had become my routine since that day.</p>



<p>This match was like a litmus test for myself.</p>



<p>I still hadn’t fully grasped it, feeling like I’d been smoothly carried along. Yet, what had been thrust upon me by Kureha was one answer I had been avoiding all along.</p>



<p>I decided to unlock the door and go meet the real Nanase Yuzuki.</p>



<p>But if even that, no, especially that, would push the man I loved away….</p>



<p>Leaving behind friendship, pity, compassion, and even Nanase Yuzuki herself,</p>



<p>──I would simply become just Nana.</p>
</div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>The ball soared upward with a “<em>shwoosh</em>,” and both Yō and the opponent’s center leaped simultaneously.</p>



<p>In the clear, serene vision that followed, I calmly surveyed the surrounding situation. While their heights were evenly matched, the opponent had a slight edge in reaching the ball.</p>



<p>──<em>Thunk.</em></p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>In that case, it was only fitting to have the ace make the first move.</p>



<p>With almost no sound, I swiftly cut in like concealing the ball with my body, immediately launching a fast break. </p>



<p>Where the ball would land after a jump ball was partly a matter of luck, but to maximize our chances, I had positioned myself next to Oboro High’s small forward, the ace.</p>



<p>Our opponents were a formidable team that regularly made it to the nationals. If there was enough room to adjust the direction after the jump, the likely recipients of the ball would be the point guard or the team’s top scorer. The rest was a matter of predicting the trajectory based on the jumper’s arm movement and cutting in as soon as they tapped the ball.</p>



<p>Well, this was somewhat like a lottery, a matter of luck if it hit. Nonetheless, it was a valuable opening point that could sway the course of the game.</p>



<p>As I deftly evaded the promptly closing defense with a series of agile steps, I checked Umi’s position.</p>



<p>“That fool…”</p>



<p>Seeing my partner confidently poised beyond the three-point line, I muttered lightly in frustration. I understood the eagerness to show off, but what’s the use of revealing our trump card so early?</p>



<p>Despite being considered the underdogs, our opponents had acknowledged us enough to come all the way from another prefecture. They had probably been researching us a bit too. They didn’t know a thing about your three-pointers or my inside game yet.</p>



<p>First, etch our usual playing style into their minds, then…</p>



<p>“──That’s not it.”</p>



<p><em>Squeak</em>, I accelerated.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, I left the first defender behind, heading straight for the goal.</p>



<p>By now, Tōdō, as well as Ashi High, had long since figured us out. Even if we had been saving our strategies for the qualifiers final, once we advanced to the nationals, it was a given that we’d be studied extensively. So, even if I tried to catch Oboro High off guard with a one-time trick, it would be meaningless.</p>



<p>We’re going to plow through Ashi High.</p>



<p>I lowered my stance just before the three-point line, facing off against Oboro’s ace, who was poised defensively. I altered my rhythm, lightly skipping about three meters away from my opponent.</p>



<p>The defender, wary of my drive, took one, then two steps back, crossing the three-point line.</p>



<p>The distance was about two meters.</p>



<p>“Too bad, it’s already within my range.”</p>



<p>From the landing of my skip-step, I smoothly transitioned into my shooting motion.</p>



<p>──<em>Swish</em>.</p>



<p>The ball, tracing a high arc, passed through the net, following the trajectory I had envisioned.</p>



<p>A transition three-pointer, released with the flow of the fast break.</p>



<p>In the past, I might have hesitated due to the low accuracy, but strangely, now I felt like I couldn’t miss. It was a bonus stage where the opponent willingly stepped back, letting me shoot from my favorite spot.</p>



<p>──Reveal everything and still emerge victorious.</p>



<p>──I’ll go along with your rules, you cheeky girl.</p>



<p>As I returned to our defensive end,</p>



<p>“After all, isn’t it the ace’s job to declare the start of the battle?”</p>



<p>I left these words for Umi, who was running nearby, like a message she could interpret in her own way.</p>



<p>“N-Nana──”</p>



<p>Sorry, but we didn’t have time for a leisurely conversation.</p>



<p>I had hoped that this one shot would give us the upper hand, but as expected of a regular at the Inter-High. Without panicking, they calmly played the ball.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the opponent’s ace seemed somewhat dejected. With an intense gaze, she urged me to pass the ball.</p>



<p>That’s how an ace should be—<em>bring it on.</em></p>



<p>“The Mirror Witch, huh?”</p>



<p>I elevated my focus one step further. The ace, having received the pass from the point guard, was charging toward me.</p>



<p>Tit for tat, right?</p>



<p>Using a heavy step, she landed her opposite foot from the one she was dribbling with, creating a brief pause in rhythm.</p>



<p>──Here it comes.</p>



<p>She launched a sharp drive from my left side. She was fast, impressively sharp like Tōdō.</p>



<p>However, this level was within my expectations. I lowered my stance and firmly held my ground.</p>



<p>Perhaps realizing she couldn’t break through in one move, she changed direction with a leg-change, passing the ball to the left under her open legs, almost like resetting. Continuing toward my right side, she dribbled the ball like a beginner.</p>



<p>Even though Umi and Yō were nearby…</p>



<p>──That’s clearly a fake.</p>



<p>While keeping my weight on my heels, I pretended to fall for the bait, lightly moving only my right foot. As expected, she immediately attempted the ball with her right hand and tried to pass me from the opposite side.</p>



<p>It was certainly impressive to pull off such a move in a real match, but…</p>



<p>Sorry, not this time. I swiped the ball from her grasp.</p>



<p>“No way!”</p>



<p>After reading the initial fake, reacting to it wouldn’t be that difficult. If you wanted to execute the Shammgod<sup data-fn="701614e2-d07e-4346-b4a5-a0e628cbc2b7" class="fn"><a href="#701614e2-d07e-4346-b4a5-a0e628cbc2b7" id="701614e2-d07e-4346-b4a5-a0e628cbc2b7-link">1</a></sup> perfectly, just watch your opponent’s feet. Compared to Tōdō, her <em>zanshin</em><sup data-fn="8ef7816a-6e60-4b21-a85c-cfcab05c6a86" class="fn"><a href="#8ef7816a-6e60-4b21-a85c-cfcab05c6a86" id="8ef7816a-6e60-4b21-a85c-cfcab05c6a86-link">2</a></sup> was lacking.</p>



<p>I immediately transitioned to a fast break.</p>



<p>Leading the charge from the right rear on our side was Umi.</p>



<p>“Alright, well done.”</p>



<p>It seems like they were wary of my previous three-pointer; the opponents’ defense sticks close without giving me much space.</p>



<p>With a heavy step just before the three-point line, I created a brief moment for Umi to pass me by. Continuing in the direction where my teammates were positioned, I shifted the ball significantly, and the defense reacted with a cross step.</p>



<p>In that instant, I swiftly recovered the ball with my left hand and initiated a drive from the opposite side.</p>



<p><em>Swoosh</em>, and the free layup effortlessly found its mark.</p>



<p>When I looked back, the ace of Oboro High had a glare in her eyes, now tinged with anger. Well, it was only natural since she was skillfully countered with the skills she thought would stop me.</p>



<p>To truly execute a fake, you have to deceive not only the body but also the mind, Oboro’s ace-<em>san</em>.</p>



<p>As I retreated on defense, I pondered.</p>



<p>In the past, I would have primarily relied on Umi. Not only for the sake of showing respect to an acknowledged ace, but also because my philosophy as a point guard was to control the game’s flow with passes and make crucial plays when needed, like a secret weapon.</p>



<p>Forcibly driving inside went against that aesthetic. I didn’t usually engage in provocative behavior, flaunting the skills I thwarted as if to taunt the opponent. It might be effective in toying with their emotions, but it didn’t feel elegant, or rather, I hadn’t felt that way about myself until now.</p>



<p>“<em>The Mirror Witch</em>,” Tōdō had playfully uttered those words.</p>



<p>If that’s the case, who should I reflect first?</p>



<p>To win, one must chose the means without fear of being hurt or hurting others, sprinting single-mindedly toward the goal. Perhaps that very way of life was what made it beautiful.</p>



<p>──Ah, I see, this is what the crimson that crushed me felt like.</p>



<p>If it took a hidden moon, Nana, to bring down a man who wouldn’t turn around, then so be it.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>──Terrifying.</p>



<p>At the end of the third quarter, during the interval, I, Aomi Haru, found my shoulders quivering unconsciously as I glanced at the score.</p>



<p>Forty-two to fifty-five. The former being Oboro, and the latter, Fuji High.</p>



<p>It was blatantly evident to anyone watching that we, the underdogs, were overwhelming the perennial powerhouse of the Inter-High.</p>



<p>No, that’s not quite it.</p>



<p>It was blatantly evident to anyone watching that Nana was overwhelming the perennial powerhouse of the Inter-High.</p>



<p>I’ve pondered something not long ago.</p>



<p><em>“I don’t think growth follows a smooth curve. Of course, day by day, your skills and physical fitness improve slowly. However, there inevitably comes a time when you feel like you’re stuck on a landing of stairs, despite giving it your all in practice—both in terms of quality and quantity. You’re pushing your limits, yet your body can’t catch up with the ideal plays running ahead of you.</em></p>



<p><em>But one day, it happens. You effortlessly leap up the stairs as if breaking through the ceiling, you bound up two or three steps in a single jump. Your body feels lighter, like you’ve shed your former self overnight, and you catch up to the plays you envisioned, eventually syncing perfectly.”</em></p>



<p>Certainly, after the matches with Suzu-san and Aki-san, I had felt that sensation. But Nana, especially after her one-on-one with Mai, was on another level of extraordinary.</p>



<p>Unlike my dogged self, I knew Nana had a natural talent.</p>



<p>I didn’t think I was any less talented in terms of athletic ability, but, for example, she could effortlessly replicate dribbling skills that would take me days of practice to master with just a single glance. Once she learned it, she’d calmly demonstrate variations and improvises inventive plays on the spot.</p>



<p>But until now, those skills were just for fun for Nana. She’d try them out in a one-on-one against me, but when it came to actual matches, her sense and creativity were concentrated in her game-making, passing, and three-point shooting as a point guard.</p>



<p>However, after the match against Mai, Nana’s scoring abilities blossomed─or rather, she unleashed the scoring talent she had hidden all along.</p>



<p>Until now, there was an unspoken agreement that the inside was my domain, while passes and the outside belong to Nana. But after the games with Suzu-san and Aki-san, I was the one who ventured into my partner’s territory first, so I had no right to complain.</p>



<p>And Nana’s game-making, now armed with the option to score on her own, was nothing short of divine, sending chills down my spine. Controlling the flow of the game was no small feat.</p>



<p>──Yet, Nana was dominating the court.</p>



<p>I never thought that a point guard with overwhelming scoring ability could be such a formidable presence. Whether tearing the defense apart from the outside or the inside, whenever they tried desperately to shut Nana down by adding more defenders, she promptly utilized me and Yō as her weapons.</p>



<p><em>Utilize</em>, I clenched my uniform tightly.</p>



<p>In reality, whether it was scoring herself or making passes leading to goals, Nana was involved in most of the points. I hadn’t counted precisely, but I wouldn’t be surprised if out of the 55 points, she contributed about 45.</p>



<p>Of course, I had made a few shots myself, but I didn’t feel like I was fulfilling the role of a scorer. Taking just one drive, or receiving passes in situations where I couldn’t possibly miss – these plays, which result in points one way or another, essentially contribute to Nana’s score.</p>



<p>From Oboro’s perspective, it probably looked like a one-man team ruled by an absolute ace. Today, I was more like a piece carefully positioned by Nana to accomplish the objective of putting points on the board.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t like she was acting independently, ignoring team play. If anything, she was surveying the situation with sharper eyes than ever. So, if it appeared to be a one-man show, it was our own fault.</p>



<p>It was just that there were many scenes where it was more certain for Nana to go for it herself.</p>



<p>It was just that she was dishing out passes that our teammates could undoubtedly convert.</p>



<p>──It was just that the gap between us and her was too significant, making it seem that way.</p>



<p>We weren’t adapting to Nana’s play. That’s why she had no choice but to utilize us.</p>



<p>──<em>Preeepp!</em></p>



<p>The whistle heralding the start of the fourth quarter cut through the air, leaving an unresolved sense of helplessness.</p>



<p><em>Damn it. </em>I roughly removed the towel I had draped around my neck.</p>



<p><em>“After all, isn’t it the ace’s job to declare the start of the battle?</em>“</p>



<p>Suddenly, the words thrown at me during the first quarter resurfaced in my mind. I knew that was Nana’s way of spurring me on.</p>



<p>The first shot wasn’t about sealing the deal with me; it was a high-handed declaration of war, saying that she was the ace now.</p>



<p>Normally, I’d rise to the challenge, but in this state…</p>



<p>I searched for a glimpse of my partner, almost desperately.</p>



<p>Nana, who had been sitting alone in a folding chair, was intensely focused and quietly standing up. Her gaze wasn’t directed at her teammates or menacing the opponents, it was a straight line to the goal.</p>



<p>──<em>It’s frustrating, Nana.</em></p>



<p>I bit my lip tightly as I headed towards the court.</p>



<p>When I first faced off against Mai in middle-school Basketball, she was already a well-known player in the prefecture, so it was natural for me to chase after her. No matter how many times I got knocked down, I could always stand up to fight again.</p>



<p>But Nana…</p>



<p>Was it this frightening to watch the back of the partner I’d always thought was by my side drift farther away, to be powerless and simply watch it happen?</p>



<p>Since the first quarter, I hadn’t exchanged any words with Nana outside of in-game instructions. It was the first time something like this had happened since I joined the team. Whenever there was an interval or halftime, we would usually praise each other’s play, point out areas for improvement, discuss our approach for the next quarter, or together, we’d rally and encourage the entire team…</p>



<p>But today, I didn’t have any words for Nana, and it seemed like she didn’t seek my words either.</p>



<p>As if she was having a dialogue with herself, battling against the reflection of someone on the other side.</p>



<p>──<em>Look over here, Nana.</em></p>



<p>The solitary cry faded into the gym floor, bouncing back in a helpless, senseless dance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>


<p>The fourth quarter was winding down. The score stood at 51 to 62. Despite the strong opponent’s efforts to close the gap, Nana continued to dominate. There were less than thirty seconds left.</p>



<p>I had practiced my two-handed three-point shot relentlessly for a month, determined to show some backbone this quarter. But perhaps due to the anxiety welling up within me, my form was all over the place. Every shot felt like it wouldn’t go in the moment the ball left my hand.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but feel sorry for Nana, who spent so much time accommodating me. Yet, she just casually raised her hand, as if telling me not to worry without even glancing at me, instantly shifting her focus to the next play. It was as though she’s saying, ‘<em>Don’t sweat it; I’ll make up for any mistakes quickly, so pass me the ball</em>.’</p>



<p>While Nana might intend it as her way of reassuring me, to me, it felt like being pushed away, like I was never part of her equation. It was the loneliness of being left behind, I think.</p>



<p>When I saw Kureha, whom I had considered a cute junior, throwing the ball better than me, when Mai, whom I regarded as a rival, got so fired up against Nana, and even when Nana, whom I thought was my equal, overwhelmed Mai, it had always been me who’s been left behind.</p>



<p>I had nothing; not their height, talent, good looks, or feminine charm. My only strong suit was this relentless and unrefined basketball.</p>



<p>“Damn it all!”</p>



<p>I mustered every last bit of determination and sprinted towards the basket. Before I knew it, only fifteen seconds remained. This was probably going to be the last play.</p>



<p>Nana, who initiated the fast break after stealing the opponent’s ball, faced two defenders about two meters from the three-point line. Further back, near the goal, there was one more defender.</p>



<p>Perhaps they were wary after repeatedly facing similar fast breaks, as their retreat was swift. Even during the game, my legs momentarily froze in awe of Nana’s brilliant steal, and it seemed like the others were struggling to catch up with the fast-paced play as well.</p>



<p>“Nana!!!” I shouted as I dashed past my partner.</p>



<p>Inside one-on-one situation was my domain. For this last, crucial moment, I must be her support.</p>



<p>With a quick step, I positioned myself and looked at Nana. In response, Nana dribbled, taking a step back from the defense. There was a moment, a split second, that felt like our eyes met for the first time in this game.</p>



<p><em>—She’s coming.</em></p>



<p>I surrendered to my familiar instincts and headed towards the basket. If my partner passed the ball to me, I could transition seamlessly into a drive, just a couple of steps or even three ahead, with a low pass.</p>



<p>Nana changed the rhythm of her dribble and sharply stepped toward the opposite side of where I was. One of the two defenders reacted to it. This was a fake, and then the ball would flow this way with a no-look pass—</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>Seeing the other defender get baited by the pass motion, Nana gracefully lowered her stance. Just a meter and a step from the three-point line.</p>



<p>The setting sun, casting its slanted rays, created a shimmering shoreline reflection on the court. Nana’s elongated shadow slid quietly over it, like a sculpture. Then, from her artistically perfect form, the ball arched high in a graceful parabola.</p>



<p><em>—Swish.</em></p>



<p>The ball passed through the net as softly as being enveloped.</p>



<p><em>—Beeeep.</em></p>



<p>The merciless buzzer signaling the end of the game sounded.</p>



<p>Ah, I see. My shouting was just another one of your fakes at this moment, wasn’t it?<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>And so, after cooling down, cleaning up, and bidding farewell to Oboro High, we once again formed a circle around Misaki-chan. Our teammates were still in high spirits, talking excitedly.</p>



<p>“Wasn’t Nana-san amazing today!?”</p>



<p>“Seriously, did we really beat Oboro!?”</p>



<p>“Looks like Misaki-chan’s summer training paid off!”</p>



<p>“We really pushed ourselves to the limit!”</p>



<p><em>No</em>, I thought, gripping my uniform tightly in frustration. There certainly were results from our summer training. Everyone ran without getting exhausted until the end, and the determination not to back down against tough opponents was overflowing. It was miles apart from the summer when they had given up before even drawing a limit.</p>



<p><em>But, this… </em></p>



<p>As I clenched my fist tightly, Yō held Nana’s shoulder firmly. “Our combination with Nana was on point, right?”</p>



<p>Nana tilted her head with an innocent smile. “Indeed.”</p>



<p><em>Don’t play dumb</em>, I bit my lip desperately, not wanting to dampen the post-victory atmosphere. </p>



<p>Then, Sen chimed in, “With the way we are now, it doesn’t feel impossible to reach the nationals, right?”</p>



<p>Nana lowered her eyes gently. “That’s why we’ve been practicing, isn’t it?”</p>



<p><em>It’s not us</em>, I couldn’t bear it any longer and averted my gaze.</p>



<p>Why… how could everyone celebrate like this? Was I the only one feeling this maddening, unbearable despair?</p>



<p>Then, as if perfectly timed, Misaki-chan’s hand rested on my shoulder. When I looked up, she subtly shook her head, a message meant for just me. After scanning everyone again, Misaki-chan spoke;</p>



<p>“Good job, have you all felt a bit of your growth?”</p>



<p>“””Yes!”””</p>



<p>“The Winter Cup is approaching. You can be proud of beating Oboro, but Ashi High this year is even stronger. Keep practicing without getting complacent.”</p>



<p>“””Yes!”””</p>



<p>“And Nana.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Is this your answer?”</p>



<p>To that question, Nana replied calmly, without a hint of hesitation. “At least for now, I believe I’m the only edge we have that can reach Ashi High.”</p>



<p>“Understood,” Misaki-chan said, lowering her eyes gently. “That’s it for today. Take some time to rest.”</p>



<p>“””Thank you for your hard work!”””</p>



<p>With that, Nana and everyone else began heading towards the clubroom. Somehow, I didn’t feel like changing together with them, so I stood there alone. Then, Misaki-chan directed a warm gaze in my direction.</p>



<p>“Umi, do you have time after this?”</p>



<p>I nodded absentmindedly, like a lost child who didn’t understand the meaning.</p>



<p>“In that case, how about joining me for a drink?”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8</strong></p>


<p>After waiting for everyone to leave and locking the clubroom, the surroundings had fallen completely dark. I found myself in an old Land Cruiser with its distinct round headlights, driven by Misaki-chan, heading towards Fukui Station.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan parked the car in a suitable spot and I followed her, who led the way without explanation. Amidst the neon lights and familiar red lanterns, a well-known logo caught my eye.</p>



<p>“Wait, you brought a student to <em>Akiyoshi</em> (yakitori restaurant)!?” I blurted out involuntarily.</p>



<p>Misaki playfully winked at me. “When it’s about having drinks in Fukui, it has to be here.”</p>



<p>As we passed through the automatic door, one of the staff greeted us with the usual line, “Welcome, ladies!”</p>



<p>We followed their lead, taking seats at the counter. I sighed. “Misaki-chan, I’m in a school uniform, you know.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, they’ll think we’re sisters.”</p>



<p>“More like a mother and child!”</p>



<p>Before I could see her reaction, I received a sudden flick to my forehead. </p>



<p>Just then, a male waiter wearing a twisted headband and a revealing chest area in his uniform appeared to take our orders.</p>



<p>“A draft beer for me, and would you like some umeshu (Japanese liqueur), Umi?”</p>



<p>When Misaki-chan glanced at me, I sighed in exasperation and said, “Could you not suddenly sound like Kurasen?”</p>



<p>“Hey, cut it out with that comparison.”</p>



<p>Her reaction seemed even more displeased than I’d imagined, and I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Well then, I’ll have a cider.”</p>



<p>The waiter confirmed my order and Misaki-chan continued, “For now, I’ll have ten <em>shiro</em> skewers (chicken small intestine), ten <em>junkei</em> skewers (charcoal grilled chicken), ten <em>wakadori</em> skewers (young chicken), ten <em>pietro</em> (fatty porks), ten <em>kushikatsu</em> skewers (deep-fried skewered meat and vegetables), onion fries, grated daikon, cucumber, cabbage sauce, and…”</p>



<p>She paused briefly and looked at me.</p>



<p>“I’ll have a mix.”</p>



<p>“Got it!” The waiter replied cheerfully and relayed our order to the chefs behind the counter.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I secretly stole a glance at Misaki-chan’s profile. We’d celebrated together after official matches at Hachiban before, or on days off from club activities, she’d take Nana and me out, but taking me to Akiyoshi’s like this was a first.</p>



<p>To make things even more intriguing, she hadn’t invited anyone else, just me. I’d been worried that she’d scold me for my performance during the recent practice match, but the atmosphere didn’t seem like that at all.</p>



<p>Without much time to ponder, the waiter promptly arrived with our beer and cider. Misaki-chan raised her glass with a grin. “All right, let’s toast.”</p>



<p>I hesitated for a moment before reluctantly following suit. For some reason, Misaki-chan’s eyes softened as she spoke;</p>



<p>“It’s over, the summer is. We’ve changed, and it’s autumn now.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it about today’s victory…?”</p>



<p>“You’re not in the mood for that, are you?”</p>



<p><em>She always sees through everything, doesn’t she?</em> I smiled and shrugged. I felt a bit more at ease and took a sip. The fizzy cider tasted like the summer that had come to an end.</p>



<p>“Phew, this is amazing!!”</p>



<p>“You’re really Kurasen, after all!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t resist teasing the teacher with foam on her lips. Misaki-chan, on the other hand, downed half of her drink in one go, then slammed the glass onto the table.</p>



<p>“I told you to drop that comparison.”</p>



<p>“Maybe you should drop the behavior first.” Even as I said that, I found myself propping my elbows on the table and raising my glass for a toast.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the pickled cucumbers arrived, and Misaki-chan was eagerly munching on them. I followed suit, picking up one myself. While cabbage was the most popular choice for a vegetable starter, these cucumbers had just the right balance of saltiness and were endlessly enjoyable.</p>



<p>As we continued, more dishes arrived, including cabbage and yakitori skewers.</p>



<p>“It’s just the way it goes,” Misaki-chan muttered softly as she picked up a junkei skewer. “It can be pretty disheartening when your partner’s back keeps getting farther away, right?”</p>



<p>Startled, I instinctively turned to look at her profile. Misaki-chan, nibbling on the meat, had a distant look in her eyes. Could it be that she invited me here to discuss this?</p>



<p>I clenched my fist tightly on my skirt and hesitantly spoke, my voice trembling. “Sen and Yō, they both seemed genuinely happy… Am I the only one who felt frustrated after today’s match?”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan chuckled softly, taking a sip of her beer. “Sen and the others don’t have any ill intentions. They just haven’t reached that level yet.”</p>



<p>She picked up a shiro skewer this time. “They should simply take pride in beating a strong opponent today.”</p>



<p>However, I couldn’t hold back and interjected, “We didn’t win against Oboro. It was Nana who won on her own.”</p>



<p>As I spoke, the frustration welled up within me once more. I had always thought of Nana as my partner, someone I’d run side by side with. When I said I’d defeat Ashi High, it was meant to be with Nana, with everyone together. I had assumed Nana felt the same way, but…</p>



<p>“It’s just the way it goes,” Misaki-chan muttered again as she dipped her shiro skewer into the sauce. “I’ve been waiting for Nana to face her true self for a long time.”</p>



<p>She glanced at me, a somewhat troubled smile on her face. “You’ve seen those moments when her shackles come off, right?”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement. For instance, during the practice match in May when Chitose found her lost shoes. There had been times when Nana displayed unbelievable plays.</p>



<p>“I don’t think I need to explain this to you, Umi, but there’s no such thing as a convenient plot device in sports that magically brings out more power when it’s needed most. Regardless of the trigger, the performance on display in those critical moments is nothing more than the result of one’s true abilities,” Misaki-chan commented, taking a bite of shiro and reaching for the kushikatsu.</p>



<p>“Except for exceptions like Todo, most people don’t know how to unlock their full potential. So, they have no choice but to rely on these accidental triggers, like going all out in a pinch or getting into the zone.”</p>



<p>I could relate to that. Like during the practice match with Ashi High or our match against Suzu-san and the others. There had been moments when I truly felt I was performing beyond my usual capabilities.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan took a hearty bite of kushikatsu and let out an exasperated sigh. “Nana’s case is even trickier. She’s had a tendency to hold herself back.”</p>



<p>As I dipped a garlic clove into the meat sauce, I tilted my head in confusion. “Hold herself back…?”</p>



<p>“Just to clarify, I don’t mean she’s deliberately slacking off,” Misaki-chan emphasized, requesting a refill of her beer and resting her chin on her hand. “It’s like… Nana has her own sense of aesthetics.”</p>



<p><em>Aesthetics</em> – the word didn’t quite sit right with me. For some reason, Chitose’s face flashed through my mind, but I shook my head to clear it.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan continued poking at her cabbage as she explained further, “She believes that living by her own rules and self-regulating is a beautiful way of life. It’s not a bad thing, and that’s probably why she is who she is now. But within those complicated rules, there’s probably an unconscious element that says, ‘<em>Don’t reveal your limits to others</em>.’ To be more precise, it’s like, ‘<em>if you’re going to show your limits, create limits beyond that first, then do it’</em>“. she concluded, taking a sip of beer.</p>



<p>It was so typically her. As someone who always believed in giving everything I had, I couldn’t quite wrap my head around it. It felt like a form of cheating.</p>



<p>Bitter thoughts welled up inside me. Misaki-chan seemed to understand, but I couldn’t help but wonder – how was holding back different from slacking off?</p>



<p>It would be inconvenient to say, “Here, this is my full power,” all of a sudden. But I had nothing to pull out of my sleeve in the first place.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing my inner turmoil, Misaki-chan’s voice softened. “Come on, eat up.”</p>



<p>I obediently took a bite of the junkei, something I usually loved, but it tasted as if I was chewing on rubber.</p>



<p>──An invisible ceiling.</p>



<p>When I played basketball with Mai, I occasionally felt this way. There was an invisible ceiling between me and the person high above. I’d leap with all my might, desperately trying to knock the door that should be somewhere up there. Yet, I could never gain entry, no matter how long I knocked.</p>



<p>Mai, crouched on the other side, would playfully tease me. But in reality, she was in a much larger room beyond, flying freely. I started to doubt if there was even a door, but I continued knocking persistently, hoping that the ceiling might eventually break and let me in.</p>



<p>But then, before I realized it, Nana was already in that other side. She actually knew where the door was. She had the key all along.</p>



<p>So why didn’t she tell me? I felt miserable thinking about how I had believed we were equals, side by side.</p>



<p><em>Talent</em>, that detestable word, almost slipped from my lips, but I stopped myself in time. I might not possess any sense of aesthetics, but that was crossing the line. Even if Nana hid her potential, I knew, deep down, that she, and of course, Mai, worked harder and with more passion than anyone else. To simplify it with just one word would mean I no longer had the right to stand before them.</p>



<p>I gulped down some cider to wash away the frustration. Then, with a slightly cool mind, I voiced a question that had been bothering me. “But why did Nana suddenly…?”</p>



<p>Whether it was conscious or unconscious, I didn’t know, and I couldn’t understand it either. But I somehow grasped that she had been hiding her true abilities. So, why did she start flaunting them now?</p>



<p>Misaki-chan’s eyes seemed to glimmer with nostalgia as she spoke;</p>



<p>“──Nana must have discovered the beauty in not holding back.” she said, tracing that distant memory with her fingertip.</p>



<p>“The beauty in not holding back…” I echoed vaguely, and her brows furrowed with a hint of sadness.</p>



<p>“I wish we could have been the ones to tell you that, though,” Misaki-chan continued. “I’ve been hoping for the day when Nana could freely unleash her true potential. She mentioned it herself; that way, she could become a blade capable of reaching Ashi High and Tōdō.”</p>



<p>Bitterness welled up within me again at those words, causing me to lower my gaze.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan let out an exasperated sigh. “Then, the next thing I know, the ace who was left behind is moping around. It’s really frustrating.”</p>



<p>I answered weakly, my voice barely audible. “Misaki-chan, you were expecting that from Nana, right? So, the ace is…”</p>



<p>Oh, how pathetic. This was such a cowardly way to say it. A childish, clumsy plea for comfort.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan frowned, and her hand gently approached my head. “You fool!”</p>



<p>“Ouch!”</p>



<p>She delivered a stronger forehead flick than before. My brain shook a bit. If I got any dumber from this, how would she ever handle it?</p>



<p>With a sigh of exasperation, Misaki-chan said, “I had a dream.”</p>



<p>I looked at her profile, her tone more languid than I had expected. Perhaps she was a little tipsy. Her cheeks were subtly flushed, and her eyes were slightly glossy.</p>



<p>“Do you remember the first day when you and Nana joined the club?”</p>



<p>I smirked faintly, no need to really dig up the memory. “After you gave everyone their court names, you told us to choose a first-year leader. That’s when Nana and I had that heated argument, right?”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan took a big gulp of beer and smiled. “It was the very first day, before practice even began. I just meant to be like a messenger or something for everyone.”</p>



<p>“That was all Nana’s fault,” I said, taking a sip of the cider that Misaki-chan had kindly ordered for me. “She said ‘<em>I’ll do it</em>‘ with a face that made it seem like it was the most natural thing in the world.”</p>



<p>I could sense Misaki-chan shrugging beside me. “She must have understood my intentions correctly. That’s just how Nana is. She wanted to take on the trouble herself, but you took it personally.”</p>



<p>As I thought about it now, that must have been the case. But I continued, “But back then, I had no idea about Nana’s complicated personality. I’m the type that reflexively thinks the best basketball player should be the leader if someone mentions it. So I said, ‘<em>Huh? Why? I’m better than her.’</em>“</p>



<p>Misaki-chan chuckled, remembering it vividly. “Nana was a masterpiece at that time. I thought she’d be this cool, composed player, but she made it so obvious by scrunching up her eyebrows.”</p>



<p>Ah, yes, that’s right…</p>



<p><em>“Why? I’m better than her.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Hmm? What’s that supposed to mean?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Because, you know, in middle school, in the prefectural semifinals, I defeated you.”</em></p>



<p><em>“My team lost to yours. Don’t get any funny ideas, it’s not like Nanase Yuzuki lost to a little kid.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oh, you’ve done it now! You’ve really done it! If you’ve said it, then we’ll settle it right here, one on one, Nana!!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Fine, challenging me to a one-on-one with a court name means it’s a serious match, right, Umi?</em>“</p>



<p>As I traced our exchanges from those days, Misaki-chan couldn’t contain her laughter any longer and clutched her stomach as she laughed heartily.</p>



<p>“Haha, it really was unheard of. On the first day of joining the club, you two decided to have a one-on-one showdown, ignoring your classmates, seniors, and even the advisor.”</p>



<p>“Come on, it was you, Misaki-chan, who allowed it because you found it fun.”</p>



<p>It felt nostalgic, like a distant memory now. After that, both our classmates and senpais watched as we battled it out fiercely. Looking back, we were quite the unusual freshmen. Kei-san, in particular, cheered us on energetically from the sidelines.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan had instructed us to keep going until one of us surrendered or couldn’t move anymore, without setting a score limit. When I made three consecutive drives to the basket, Nana would calmly sink two three-pointers. We continued like that until dusk, but at some point, everyone grew tired of keeping score, and in the end, the two of us collapsed together on the court.</p>



<p><em>“I scored more points than you.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I made more three-pointers.”</em></p>



<p>I wondered who had actually won back then. I hoped it was a tie.</p>



<p>Finally, after our laughter subsided, Misaki-chan, holding a pitro skewer, spoke up;</p>



<p>“I thought you two were interesting. Nana, who calmly analyzed the situation and steadily scored goals, and Umi, who played with raw intensity and a burning desire, snatching goals forcefully. Your styles were polar opposites, but both brought an unique charm to your basketball, and you never backed down from each other. I thought you two would make a great combo. Above all…”</p>



<p>She paused, locking her eyes onto me before continuing.</p>



<p>“──Your hearts were strikingly similar.”</p>



<p>“Hearts,” I murmured, instinctively placing my hand over my left chest.</p>



<p>“As if they’re burning through to their very marrow, as if they’re trying to squeeze out every last drop, projecting their way of life and dedicating themselves to their first love.” Misaki-chan mumbled softly, looking somewhat fond. “That’s the shape of your hearts.”</p>



<p>Without waiting for my reaction, she continued, “That’s why I had a dream.”</p>



<p>Somewhere along the line, the <em>shochu</em> rocks glass that Misaki-chan had ordered clinked with a gentle sound.</p>



<p>“With you two, not just us, but Suzu and Aki too, and even Ashi High with Tōdō, we have yet to fulfill a dream…”</p>



<p>“Misaki-chan, are you saying…”</p>



<p>When I questioned her, she spoke with a determined glint in her misty gaze. “National championship.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/i-0125_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>Hearing those words from Misaki-chan’s lips was a first for me. Our immediate goal was to conquer Ashi High, and in Fukui, that meant securing a spot at the national tournament. Naturally, I was born with a competitive spirit. To say I hadn’t considered what lay beyond would be a lie.</p>



<p>──No, my heart had always been set on the beyond.</p>



<p>Rising from scratch in a school not known for its basketball, all the way to a national championship. To those who’d never put everything on the line for sports, it might sound like an absurd fantasy. But in my opinion, how could you call yourself a sportsman if you couldn’t even dream of reaching the pinnacle?</p>



<p>Of course, I understood that the reality wasn’t so sweet. Even Ashi High, even Mai, hadn’t been able to seize that prize. To stand up to elite private schools that scouted talented players from all over the country, or even abroad, with a makeshift team from a regular high school – we’d be mocked for our audacity.</p>



<p>Nevertheless…</p>



<p>──If we didn’t aim for first place, what was the point of dedicating our youth to it?</p>



<p>“See, that’s where you two are so similar,” Misaki-chan said.</p>



<p>Ah, I finally got it. It wasn’t complicated at all. She, Nana, a woman named Nanase Yuzuki,</p>



<p>──She was determined to claim first place, no matter what.</p>



<p>Even if it meant discarding her past self, leaving behind her previous partner, and forsaking her old aesthetics.</p>



<p>──All for the sake of the man she wanted to shoot down.</p>



<p>Her wholehearted commitment left me astonished. She was way more serious than I was, who was endlessly clinging to her past with regret.</p>



<p>Summer had ended. Autumn had brought change. And yet, here I was, feeling left behind.</p>



<p>“Besides,” Misaki-chan continued, “It’s not just Nana that I’ve been waiting for.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?” I blinked in surprise.</p>



<p>The ice in her glass clinked softly as it rolled. “I’ve told you before, I had a dream about you two.”</p>



<p>“You mean…” I stammered, clenching my fist unknowingly. “There’s still a future for me?”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan’s eyes softened, and she lowered the corner of her mouth. “Of course. You’re the ace of Fuji High that I’ve recognized after all.”</p>



<p>She giggled, almost like a teenage girl. I sipped my cider, fearing my emotions might overflow. The carbonation that passed through my throat seemed to cry in my place.</p>



<p>Yet, the vulnerability I couldn’t swallow completely escaped in a soft, uncertain murmur. “But I don’t have any hidden power like Nana…”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan’s hand reached out to my head once again. I closed my eyes tightly, expecting another flick on the forehead.</p>



<p>“It’s okay. You’re not Nana,” This time, she gently petted me. “You have your unique strengths. But, like Nana did, you’ll have to discover it on your own. This is your basketball.”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan gazed at her palm, her expression reminiscent of someone in love, wearing a tender smile. “I was like that too.”</p>



<p>Ah, right. Suddenly, it hit me. This person, who was my teacher, advisor, and an adult that I respected, had once been a seventeen-year-old girl too. How had Misaki-chan faced her youth and basketball?</p>



<p>Thinking about it, I had a lingering question I wanted to ask. “Misaki-chan, earlier, when you said we…”</p>



<p>Though I had been taken aback by the mention of dominating the nationals, I recalled her words.</p>



<p><em>“With you two, not just us, but Suzu and Aki too, and even Ashi High with Tōdō, we have yet to fulfill a dream…”</em></p>



<p>Misaki-chan had indeed said that. And considering her usual precise coaching and the performance she displayed against Suzu-san and Aki-san, I knew she must have been quite the player in her day.</p>



<p>However, when I thought about it, I realized that I had never asked her about her past in detail.</p>



<p>Maybe she’s feeling a bit tipsy, I thought.</p>



<p>Misaki-chan seemed somewhat embarrassed as she averted her gaze and said, “I had someone I could call a partner too, just like you and Nana.”</p>



<p>“Really!?” My voice leaped in excitement.</p>



<p>She calmly took another sip of her shochu and continued, “You’ve met her too, haven’t you?”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>“You know, the club advisor at Ashi High, Tominaga.”</p>



<p>“Huh, Tominaga-sensei!?”</p>



<p>It was true that they had a certain familiarity, but I hadn’t realized they were former teammates. So, the feeling would be like if Nana and I became teachers at different high schools and coached basketball, wouldn’t it?</p>



<p>If I were in Misaki-chan’s position as the club advisor at Fuji High, I’d probably feel a bit frustrated. Perhaps she secretly seethed each time we lost to Ashi High? Feeling a bit apologetic, I stole a glance at her profile. Oddly enough, she blushed slightly and chuckled as if she were being shy.</p>



<p>“I had an experience similar to yours as well. My partner, who I thought was equal to me, one day… without any warning, left me behind and went to the other side.”</p>



<p>Her words made my eyes widen in realization.</p>



<p><em>“It can be pretty disheartening when your partner’s back keeps getting farther away, right?”</em></p>



<p>I see. Her words weren’t mere comfort or sympathy; Misaki-chan genuinely understood how I felt.</p>



<p>“Ah, this is just drunken ramblings. Just forget about it by tomorrow.”</p>



<p>Even without being told, I had no intention of prying further. I figured our situations, abilities, and personalities were too different, and delving into it might just make me feel even worse. In the end, I knew I had to struggle in my own way.</p>



<p>But there was just one thing I needed, one small glimmer of hope to keep me going.</p>



<p>“Being able to talk like this means you managed to pass it, right?”</p>



<p>I didn’t need specific advice or cheap, instant comfort that would be complete once hot water was added. I just wanted one thing: a single word from the person I respected, a senpai who had experienced something similar, saying, <em>“I did it.”</em></p>



<p>“In my case…” Misaki-chan’s expression turned somewhat bitter, yet there was a fondness in the way she furrowed her brows. “It all started with a few words from a no-good senpai who wasn’t even part of the basketball club.”</p>



<p>She then sheepishly bit her lip and continued, “He was truly a hopeless, pretentious, and complicated guy.”</p>



<p>She chuckled with a hint of embarrassment. Hearing this, I felt a slight tickle of curiosity. Misaki-chan must had her own share of longing for someone. </p>



<p>I wished I could hear more, but it seemed like she thought she’d been talking too much under the influence of alcohol. She cleared her throat and returned to her usual self.</p>



<p>Then, she turned to me as if concluding her story. “I’m not the only one waiting for you, Umi.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?” I replied, puzzled by her sudden words.</p>



<p>“──Your partner, Nana, is waiting for you.”</p>



<p>“Her…?” I put down my half-eaten grated fish to the plate and cast my gaze downward. “Right now, Nana doesn’t need me. She intends to face Ashi High and beyond all on her own.”</p>



<p>“Well…” Misaki-chan shrugged dramatically. “Do you remember what Nana said during the after-game briefing?”</p>



<p>I bit my lip in thought, “She said that the way she controlled the game by herself, like today, is the only edge that can reach Ashi High.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s not,” Misaki-chan shook her head. “At least, not in the current circumstances. I’m sure you haven’t forgotten the message she left behind unconsciously. Right now, mastering her new self might be the only thing on her mind, but…”</p>



<p>With those words, she gently placed her hand on my shoulder. “Nana is waiting for you.”</p>



<p>“If she’s waiting,” My emotions stirred, and I felt like my voice might break. “Then why did she push me away like that?”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan, suddenly wearing a provocative smile, retorted, “What’s wrong, do you want her to stop and wait until you catch up?”</p>



<p>Startled, I raised my head this time. Yes, I remembered being told something like that during one of our playful interactions.</p>



<p><em>“Haru, are you fine with just staying like this? I’ll tell you, I won’t hold back. If you can’t catch up, I won’t pass the ball.”</em></p>



<p>No matter how much things seemed to change, Nana was still Nana.</p>



<p><em>“Hey, Haru-san?”</em></p>



<p><em>“What would you do if you had to compete with someone important for a first prize?”</em></p>



<p>When Kureha asked me that, what was my response?</p>



<p><em>“I’d challenge them head-on and settle it fair and square.”</em></p>



<p><em>“──That’s our way, isn’t it?”</em></p>



<p><em>Geez</em>, talking so big in front of a kouhai and all.</p>



<p>No matter how far we went, I was still me.</p>



<p>No matter how far we went, Nana was still Nana.</p>



<p>No matter how far we went, we were still us.</p>



<p>And it seemed like, no matter how far we went, you were still you.</p>



<p>“Has the fire ignited in your heart?”</p>



<p>Misaki-chan’s words made me chuckle in response. “I forgot, I’m not the kind of girl who’ll just keep waiting.”</p>



<p>I won’t yield the first prize, Nana.</p>



<p>“A man who won’t turn back will be shoot down by this own hand.”</p>



<p>Because this love is as real as it gets, right down to the core.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9</strong></p>


<p>──It was a play devoid of aesthetics.</p>



<p>I, Nanase Yuzuki, leaned my head against the edge of the bathtub, closing my eyes. As usual, the lights were off, replaced by aromatic candles.</p>



<p>On days when there was a match, I would immerse myself in the bath like this, holding a solitary self-reflection session.</p>



<p>Starting from the first quarter, I would replay the game in my mind. Were there plays I could have executed more skillfully? Were there points I had conceded due to my own faults? Did I manage to bring out the best in my partner and the rest of the team…?</p>



<p>The match against Oboro was, in a way, the best and yet, in another way, the worst.</p>



<p>No matter how calmly and critically I assessed myself, today’s play was the optimal solution for everything. The fact that we emerged victorious against Oboro with such a significant lead validated the correctness of our strategies on paper.</p>



<p>In reality, my initial assessment, made before the one-on-one against Tōdō, indicated that even with our usual style of centering around Umi, we would be evenly matched at best, or more likely, they would have a slight advantage, especially with the changed Fuji High beyond the summer.</p>



<p>So, today’s outcome could be seen as the moment when beating Ashi High ceased to be just a goal and turned into a grounded objective.</p>



<p><em>Not one of my choices had been wrong. </em>I wish I could say those words with unwavering conviction…</p>



<p>In my pursuit of victory, I treated my teammates as nothing more than pawns and decoys to secure a goal. Such methods were far from beautiful, and the Nanase Yuzuki of the past would have firmly denounced them. Therefore, this might be closer to self-examination rather than a mere self-reflection.</p>



<p>I sprinted single-mindedly toward the one and only goal I desired. I embraced the man I wanted. Yet, my heart was swirling with a weighty sense of remorse that resembled regret.</p>



<p>Sen and Yō had rejoiced genuinely, but that’s precisely what made my heart ache. During the match, I couldn’t bring myself to meet Umi’s gaze beyond the feints, consumed by guilt and self-loathing.</p>



<p>Was this truly my earnest self? Did I really become the woman that was madly in love? Was this the Nanase Yuzuki who wanted to enchant everyone?</p>



<p><em>“The woman named Nanase Yuzuki values aesthetics more than Senpai, doesn’t she?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’m not afraid of becoming someone who can’t change for the man she loves.”</em></p>



<p>Kureha’s words flashed back, and I abruptly opened my eyes. Right, it was the vow I made to confront that sharpened determination.</p>



<p><em>“Leaving behind friendship, sympathy, compassion, and even Nanase Yuzuki…</em></p>



<p>──<em>I chose to become just Nana.”</em></p>



<p>Because being Nanase Yuzuki wasn’t enough to reach, to obtain, I decided to change.</p>



<p>Would the day ever come when I could consider this version of myself beautiful?</p>



<p>That summer, in the twilight classroom…</p>



<p>When I saw Uchi, who left a weeping Yuuko behind and ran off without hesitation. I thought that a kind-hearted girl who could decisively choose her number one was beautiful.</p>



<p>That day, on the rooftop…</p>



<p>I was undeniably overwhelmed by Kureha’s powerful desire. A beauty of life where she could cast aside everything for the man she loved.</p>



<p>So, this choice shouldn’t be wrong.</p>



<p>But why did I feel so uncertain when I replace it with Nanase Yuzuki? Was it weakness, attachment, or simply confusion?</p>



<p>Only when I layered it upon myself did I understand the weight of this choice. Leaving behind my previous self, my partner, my comrades, and sprinting away alone wasn’t as easy as it sounded. I admitted, it was frightening.</p>



<p>Because when, even after all this, I still couldn’t reach, there wouldn’t be anything left for me.</p>



<p>With a heart turned into an empty shell, would I wander through the long-passed spring forever?</p>



<p>──Was Kureha making this kind of commitment in her pursuit of love?</p>



<p><em>Don’t hesitate</em>, I told myself as I stepped out of the bath and stood before the mirror.</p>



<p>While gazing at the exposed woman I had polished over time, I thought to myself.</p>



<p>No more stagnation, no more procrastination. I was tired of yearning for someone else’s back as they moved ahead.</p>



<p>Even if it meant sharing a poisoned apple and falling asleep together.</p>



<p>Mirror, mirror on the wall…</p>



<p>──Who is reflected in that person’s heart?</p>
