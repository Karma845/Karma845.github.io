<h2>Chapter 1: Me, Princess's Sister, and a Bunny Suit</h2>

<p class="calibre5">The morning classes had ended.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Normally, the moment the teacher leaves the classroom, lively chatter among the students fills the air.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, a strange atmosphere had settled over my classroom&mdash;Class 2-3 for the past few days.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t exactly hostile or tense, just different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This change wasn’t entirely unexpected, given the current buzz sweeping through the school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The hot topic was&mdash;Pitiful Prince has become romantically involved with Touka Himegi, the most beautiful girl in school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The news spread like wildfire.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, not only the students but also the school staff were aware that Hakuba Ouji was dating Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Some male students lamented this fact, while some female students were perplexed by it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Frankly, even I would be shocked to hear that the serious Himegi-san was dating anyone in the school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s even more surprising that it’s me, Hakuba Ouji.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The news was indeed unexpected for all the students.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite being the talk of the school, I was surprisingly unfazed and went on living my life as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I do aspire to become a professional magician, after all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m used to being looked at with curious eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That being said, it’s not as if nothing has changed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve received jealous glares from those who had feelings for Himegi-san and even a little harassment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The fact that an unimpressive guy like me is dating the most beautiful girl in the school must be unsettling for the other guys.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I’ll just consider it a ‘happiness tax’ and let it be for now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But why did Himegi-san decide to date me? What about me did she find attractive?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm, no matter how much I ponder, I can’t come up with a good answer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I reported this to my future wife, Touka, she responded casually, ‘Hmm, I see,’ as if she had no interest in the matter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could this be a predestined situation?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, whatever. For now, I’ll just enjoy my romance with my beloved Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Speaking of Himegi-san, she had forgotten her lunch at home today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As soon as the class ended, she went to the entrance to receive the lunch box delivered by her maid.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I stayed in my seat, quietly waiting for her to return.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My seat, incidentally, is the last one by the window, and the one in front of me belongs to Kanako.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My childhood friend Kanako was busy preparing her lunch, pulling a pink bento out of her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is perfect; I’ll kill time by chatting with her until Himegi-san returns.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that in mind, I decided to strike up a conversation with Kanako.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, I stepped on dog poop in front of my house yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Don’t you realize what I’m holding? I’m about to eat my lunch!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako was furious when I said that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, her reaction was understandable; it’s not the sort of topic anyone wants to hear before eating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;And it was on my brand-new sneakers. Normally, I would find the dog’s owner and rub the soiled shoe on their face just to feel satisfied.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh… you’re ignoring what others are saying and going off on your own tangent…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It must be the work of someone jealous of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, do you understand what I’m trying to tell you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“??? You’re harassing me, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wronggg!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I abruptly stand up, loudly telling Kanako that she’s wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, don’t raise your voice all of a sudden!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, what I want to tell you is about love!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never seen anyone start talking about love by talking about dog poop!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You got lectured by Teacher Nakayama in class earlier.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So what?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course, it’s all Kanako’s fault for dozing off.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-well, I hate to admit it, but yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Still, for people our age, getting lectured publicly in front of classmates would make anyone a bit resentful, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course it was embarrassing, and I didn’t enjoy it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako makes a disgruntled face, perhaps remembering what happened earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To my irritable childhood friend, I decided to offer some kind words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Forgive with love.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, what exactly do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When I stepped in dog poop, I was really irritated. But then I realized something: getting angry over such trivial things is stupid.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I, I see?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right now, I’m dating Touka Himegi. That basically means it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that I’m the happiest person in the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, you’re saying that your love for Himegi-san has helped you overcome your hatred and anger?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly! I am now a messenger of love, free from negative emotions.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, today, right from the morning, I could sincerely thank my parents for bringing me into this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s how filled with love I am now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow! Even though there’s only a wall behind you, there’s a halo shining from Hakuba! What is that, a magic trick?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s the power of love that’s creating this halo. But that is not important. Look, Kanako, at your beloved Takakyun. Once you see someone you deeply care about, wouldn’t your irritations just vanish? Wouldn’t you think the issue we were discussing earlier is trivial compared to love?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I point to Takakyun, who’s looking at us sadly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Kanako gazes at Takakyun and says,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… You’re right. Seeing the face of my beloved Takakyun did make my irritation go away…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“See? In the face of love, anger is powerless, isn’t it? When you’re happy, don’t you want to share that love with others?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hakuba, you do say something worthwhile every now and then…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess so.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can I test you to see if you’ve really overcome your negative emotions?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right now, I am a man who has transcended hatred. A mere test wouldn’t shake my emotions!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. Hakuba, I’m gonna come out and say the one who left that dog poop was&mdash;&mdash;me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…what!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, the poop you stepped in yesterday was from my dog, Tsubuan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, “Tsubuan” is the name of the dog that Kanako owns. But that’s irrelevant now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did she just say something unbelievable?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, you do know that if a pet has an accident, the owner is responsible for cleaning it up, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Tsubuan is not a pet, he’s my family.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;That’s not the point. Are you the type to leave your dog’s poop lying around?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, she’s not fit to own a pet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t make fun of me. I usually do pick up after him with a bag. But I forgot the bag and scoop yesterday…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You forgot??”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was in trouble, but mom said she’d take care of the poop for me, so I took her up on the offer. &mdash;&mdash;Teehee!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako sticks out her tongue and lightly taps her own head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As always, she has a face I’d like to punch…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mom must’ve forgotten to clean it up, and you, unluckily, stepped on it. You really have bad luck, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Those sneakers cost me ten thousand yen!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I thought you overcame your anger?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Grrrrr.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I never thought the day would come when she’d out-argue me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ha! Whatever, I’m the happiest person in the world right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll forgive this idiot for not cleaning up the poop, all thanks to the power of love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are we done with this stupid conversation? I want to eat my lunch now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, I never told you, but now I can say it sincerely… congratulations on becoming Takakyun’s girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’m going.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she said that and was about to head towards Takakyun, I grabbed Kanako’s wrist tightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Ow, ow, ow! Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, congratulations.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank~you! Now, can you let go of my hand?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, congratulations. I think you and Takakyun are the second most compatible couple in the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, congratulations to you too. Aren’t you and Himegi-san a perfect match?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Hearing words of blessing from a childhood friend makes me happy.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having received words of blessing from Kanako, I decided to release my childhood friend with a warm smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Grumbling a bit, Kanako headed towards her boyfriend, Takashi Harukawa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the record, I force those two to say words of blessing to us every day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, they are the only ones who recognize us in this school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san and I have become a couple. There couldn’t be anything more wonderful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If possible, I’d like not just my childhood friend but everyone to celebrate this with us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that thought, I spoke to the bespectacled male student eating his lunch next to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Nakajima-kun. How are you doing today?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His name is Nakajima-kun, a high school baseball player affiliated with this school’s baseball club. He clearly looked displeased.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems he doesn’t like me very much.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is baseball fun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, practice is hard, but… it’s fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s great to hear… I’m praying you get to compete against Isono in Koshien.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, stop making that joke just because my name is Nakajima.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?! You’re going to win against Isono and propose to his sister Wakame, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;As if!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: I don’t get this reference.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what he said. It seems this Nakajima is not the Nakajima I know very well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, you don’t look so good. Are you sick? You’ve hardly touched your lunch…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I had to listen to you talk about poop next to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m kidding. I just don’t have an appetite because I didn’t get enough sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Lack of sleep?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, we’re supposed to have a practice match at this school today, and the opponents are regulars at Koshien. It’s embarrassing, but I’m feeling a bit intimidated.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. You couldn’t sleep because you were thinking about the game…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, something like that. To think I’ll have to stand on the mound in this condition&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Ah! it’s Himegi-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Hey, listen to me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ignoring the infuriated Nakajima-kun, I returned to the classroom and waved at my beloved honey.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our eyes met and she rushed over to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry I kept you waiting.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This sparkling beauty with black hair&mdash;Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s one of the most stylish people in the school, and amazingly, she’s my girlfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In Himegi-san’s hands are two lunch boxes. One of them is mine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Actually, After school yesterday, she made me an offer that I couldn’t believe my ears: ‘Tomorrow, I’ll make a lunch for you, Ouji-kun.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, I accepted the proposal with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but drown in happiness just imagining that I’m eating a homemade lunch filled with love from her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is precisely the couple-like event I had been looking forward to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps she might even feed me a bite saying, “Aaah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, where shall we eat this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why not here?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I move Kanako’s desk and chair closer to mine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please, go ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Himegi-san takes a seat on Kanako’s chair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also sit down in my chair, eagerly awaiting Himegi-san’s homemade lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, the students in the classroom are all staring at us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, we’re the center of attention.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t be in such a hurry; the bento isn’t going anywhere.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… I was so excited; I only got seven hours of sleep last night.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For context, I usually only sleep eight hours.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see. I hope it suits your taste.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Huh? Was there a pause just now?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh well, it doesn’t matter. Then I received a black bento from Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can I open it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having received Himegi-san’s permission, I opened the bento lid.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow&mdash;! This looks incredibly delicious!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The contents of the bento were… apart from one particular item, all very appetizing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Two rice balls wrapped in seaweed, bright red sausages, fried chicken, mini tomatoes, and broccoli.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Up to this point, everything seemed perfectly normal and very delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The problem was this turquoise-colored food. …Wait, is this even a food???</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, what is this Hatsune Miku-hair-colored food, Himegi-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nervously, I pointed to the oddly vibrant object in the bento and asked its creator what it was.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah? Oh, that’s tamagoyaki.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Tamagoyaki…you say…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, this ominous object is called tamagoyaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If this is tamagoyaki, then what was that delicious yellow thing I ate this morning?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…it’s not a macaron?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You think this looks like a macaron? You say some funny things sometimes, Ouji-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, what the heck… it must contain matcha or perhaps some green to light blue food coloring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yeah, let’s go with that explanation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himegi-san, may I?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With permission granted, I put my hands together and said, ‘itadakimasu,’ then picked up my chopsticks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I’m starting to doubt Himegi-san’s cooking skills.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, turquoise tamagoyaki? How do you even make an egg roll that color?</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I’ve been eating the cooking of Touka Himegi, who is sitting right in front of me but six years into the future every day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, every dish Touka-san makes is of a high level, always impressing the palate of the Ouji family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The girl in front of me is the same person as that Touka-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Six years may have passed, but it’s hard to believe her skill would change that much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Therefore, this bento has to be delicious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Convincing myself of this, I picked up the relatively normal-looking red sausage with my chopsticks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With resolve, I popped it into my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Crunch, crunch, crunch… gulp.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, is it good?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Y-yeah. It’s really… delicious… incredibly delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I lied. My parents always told me never to become a liar, but this time I blatantly went against their advice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I concluded that lying was the best way to make everyone else happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let me be honest. This bento is beyond the level of ‘bad taste.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to explain how dangerous this lunch is, even eating surströmming&mdash;the world’s smelliest fish, which Kanako once bought on a whim in middle school&mdash;wasn’t as bad as this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s how bad the food in this bento is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, can we even classify this red devil as food?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What world produces a wiener with such a crunchy texture?</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is my first time encountering such a badly textured object. And to make matters worse, the taste was neither good nor bad; it tasted like banana for some reason…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I’m glad it suits your taste, Ouji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to praise myself for maintaining a poker face this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to put any more of this bento’s contents into my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d rather eat a milk-soaked rag than consume this object.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I think I’ll eat some too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san said this as she opened the lid of another bento.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himegi-san, that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I point to her bento with trembling hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hm? Oh, this one is made by our regular maid.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s unfair! I want that bento too…</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I can’t say that. Not with her looking so happy and content.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could never ask her to swap bento; it would be like killing myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Besides, everyone in the classroom is watching us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I refuse this bento now, I’ll make Himegi-san lose face. As her boyfriend, that’s the last thing I want to do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I am Himegi-san’s boyfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s my responsibility as her boyfriend to deal with this object!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if it kills me, I’m going to eliminate this thing&mdash;with all my body and soul!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why are you taking a fighting stance?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It’s out of respect for the opponent I must defeat.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Let’s begin this endless battle between light and darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, I am both the sorrowful Ouji and the angry Ouji.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Having made up my mind, I eagerly stuffed the dishes from the bento box into my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, I faced them all with love and courage: the onigiri with its squishy texture like warabi mochi, the chicken karaage flavored like watermelon, the broccoli that popped and sizzled in my mouth, and the mini tomatoes that were as hard as rocks and smelled like ginkgo.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Doing my best not to chew, I intentionally increased the amount in each bite and washed down all the dishes with tea.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, with every bite, sweat poured out of every single pore, unpleasantly streaming down my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Weird! Despite all the sweating… my body started shivering from the cold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s still April, right? Why is it so cold today?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why is my body shivering so much???</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, after a hard-fought battle, I finished all the dishes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I emerged victorious. I had perfectly vanquished the embodiment of evil from this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a boyfriend, I had perfectly cleared one trial!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Cough, cough… cough”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, that was close, too close.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I almost unleashed the sealed demons into the world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, I don’t like it when you eat too fast.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, I couldn’t stop myself because it was so delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">True to my words, both of my arms were shivering uncontrollably.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…it was so delicious that you’re shaking?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I’m so overcome with emotion that I can’t stop shaking. Thank you for the meal, Himegi-san&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;There’s still some tamagoyaki left.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san points at the turquoise-colored tamagoyaki with a bright smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Damn it! I thought I could gloss over this with enthusiasm. Seems like I can’t escape this final boss.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Is that tamagoyaki made with matcha?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Matcha? No, it just has mentaiko rolled in the middle.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mentaiko, you say…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No matter how I interpret it, that color doesn’t come from adding mentaiko.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Takashi also likes this. Right, Takashi?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san seeks agreement from Takashi, who is sitting at a distant seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….Yeah. …I really like Touka’s tamagoyaki…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You liar! Your eyes are darting around!</p>
<p class="calibre5">And Your face has gone pale with fear! You look completely traumatized!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…is that so? If you like it that much, Takakyun, would you like to eat this tamagoyaki?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah! Sorry, I have a date with Kanako today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Takakyun shook his head vehemently, rejecting my offer with all his might.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that eating this tamagoyaki would make it impossible to have any plans after school&mdash;it’s that dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, my instincts are telling me that this tamagoyaki is very risky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, what to do with this tamagoyaki…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I gaze at the two slices of tamagoyaki in the bento.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Two slices, huh… One slice is already too much to handle, and there are two…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, my eyes met those of a male student.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakajima-kun, do you want a slice?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my sudden suggestion, Nakajima-kun is greatly surprised and flustered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He clearly hadn’t considered that he’d be roped into this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, no, no! I… I’m not hungry right now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, is that so? If you’re not hungry, all the more reason you should eat this tamagoyaki.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t believe Himegi-san herself is recommending it to Nakajima-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The proposal of an innocent beauty cornered him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, it seems that eating this tamagoyaki will improve your appetite, according to Himegi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What principle causes this improvement in appetite?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, ah, aah… No, I’d feel bad taking it from Ouji…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about him. Here, go ahead.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san grabs the turquoise-colored tamagoyaki with blue chopsticks and gently places it in Nakajima-kun’s bento.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s delicious, you know.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san smiles warmly at Nakajima-kun.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When the most beautiful girl in the school smiles at you, most guys can’t rudely decline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Clearly, Nakajima-kun couldn’t say no, resigned himself, and accepted the mysterious object A.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, he probably didn’t want such an angelic smile in this kind of situation anyway.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Itadakimasu…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps having steeled his resolve, Nakajima-kun hesitantly, yet confusedly, puts the turquoise-colored tamagoyaki into his mouth with trembling chopsticks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sound of Nakajima-kun chewing reaches my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He swallows with a gulp.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, he drops the chopsticks he was holding onto the floor as if he’s a toy that’s run out of batteries, becoming completely motionless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Na-Nakajima-kun???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After a few seconds of silence, he slowly opens his mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s…it’s delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what he says. Despite its appearance, it seems to be delicious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh? It’s delicious?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. It’s really delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really? Even with such a creepy color, it’s actually tasty???</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isono, you should try it too…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He said this while staring intently at my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? I-Isono???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, Isono, you should try it too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m Ouji, though?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Isono, this tamagoyaki is really good!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The personality of the male student who had been earnestly dedicated to baseball seems to have broken down. I think this because his eyes were extremely wide.</p>
<p class="calibre5">W-w-wwhat should I do! Will I end up like him too?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, if you don’t eat it soon, lunch break will be over.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indeed, just as Himegi-san said, little time was left for lunch break.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, say ‘ahh.’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying this, Himegi-san skillfully picks up the tamagoyaki with her chopsticks and offers it to my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Normally this would be a touching moment, but right now, I’m not happy about it at all…</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">That said, no fool would refuse to be fed by their lover with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m that sort of man too&mdash;if my beloved girlfriend feeds me, I would gladly open my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You don’t want it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing me hesitate, Himegi-san looks sad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Please don’t make such a sorrowful face, my honey.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m the guy who loves your smile more than anything in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d do anything to see you smile!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san, thank you for the lunch today…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, she smiles warmly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, I love that smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just seeing it makes me genuinely happy. I’m really glad I could see this smile in the end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hah! My destiny is right here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mom and Dad, I’m sorry for being an unfilial child.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Please forgive Hakuba for leaving before his parents!</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s because of love that Hakuba suffers; it’s because of love that Hakuba grieves!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, Hakuba will&mdash;neither retreat, nor fawn, nor look back!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;I entrust myself to the Three Jewels!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: ─南無三っ. Refer to the Three Jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. cmiiw.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Determined, I popped the turquoise-colored tamagoyaki into my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;At that moment, something mysterious happened to my body!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? What? Where am I? Right, I’m a person with the glittering name Hakuba Ouji.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just a moment ago, I was eating lunch with Himegi-san…</p>
<p class="calibre5">When did I lose consciousness?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I look around. This appears to be classroom 2-3, and for some reason, I’m standing in front of the blackboard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Beside me, the math teacher, Tsuchiura-sensei, was smiling and clapping his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why does this old man look so pleased?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Bravo, bravo! Never did I imagine that a student capable of solving such a complex problem would come from this school…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? A problem???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tsuchiura-sensei points dramatically to the blackboard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are some very complicated numbers on it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What is this? I don’t understand the problem at all…</p>
<p class="calibre5">One thing is certain. It’s a math problem that I definitely can’t solve.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Even students from Tokyo University would struggle with this problem, and you solved it in mere seconds… I thought Ouji was a dumb student, but you’re actually a genius, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? I’m a genius???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I just realized that I’m holding a white chalk in my hand. Could it be…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did I solve this problem? Uhh, the writing on the blackboard is unmistakably mine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Everyone, learn from Ouji and strive in your studies.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Confused, I returned to my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unbelievably, it seems I’ve solved that difficult math problem.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Was that a side effect of the tamagoyaki?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I look back at the blackboard, staring at the problem once more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Yeah, it’s too hard; my head is starting to hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I sit down at my desk and turn to my puzzled childhood friend in the seat in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, did I really solve that problem?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You kept mumbling to the broom, so Tsuchiura-sensei got angry and gave you that difficult math problem to solve.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? I was talking to a broom???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, yeah. You were screaming things like ‘I am the Holy Emperor!’ at the broom.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“O-Oh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pr-Probably…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I imagine myself speaking to the broom, and the image gives me chills.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I were a police officer, I’d definitely question ‘that guy’ for suspicious behavior…</p>
<p class="calibre5">What on earth was I doing while I was unconscious?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m too scared to ask any more questions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, let’s just be grateful that I can still stand on this earth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s the conclusion I reached, so I decided to keep quiet until after school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, on a side note, Nakajima-kun threw a bunch of 160 km/h fastballs today and pitched a perfect game against a strong team.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Then, after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At Himegi-san’s request, I found myself in a rather unusual place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had initially hoped for a date invitation, but unfortunately, it wasn’t a date.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san apparently has someone she wants me to meet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So here I am, in an elevator at a certain hospital.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry for making you miss your club activities.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about it. The president, who usually skips, attended today, so it’s fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It might be good for that truant to show up at the club once in a while.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, I couldn’t care less about that truant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never expected that Himegi-san would bring me to&mdash;a hospital.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Given the location, the person she wants me to meet must be either hospital staff or a patient.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And judging from her somber expression, I can guess that the person is likely the latter…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Who is this person that wants to meet me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…My Onē-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Your Onē-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, my sister…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see… What about her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you remember performing a magic trick at Harune’s birthday party?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I do.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My Onē-san seems to have something she wants to say to you about that trick.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hearing those words, my head spun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Most likely, what Himegi-san’s sister wants to ask me is about the final magic trick I performed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I’m certain it’s a question about the trick where I made two Touka Himegis appear on stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From the perspective of the Himegi family, it’s quite an astonishing feat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, two identical-looking people were standing side by side, even though they’re not twins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If the roles were reversed, I’d be just as shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, the unfortunate truth is that it wasn’t a trick that one can call ‘magic.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was no secret, no trickery, just the same person standing next to herself&mdash;a simple, crude mechanism.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, even if I’m asked to explain how the trick works, as a magician, I’d be too embarrassed to say. And I have no intention of lying about it either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, even if I were to tell the unvarnished truth, no one would believe me anyway…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m also curious about it, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sure you do…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I won’t ask now, but I’d like you to explain it someday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Understood. You might not believe it, but I will explain it properly someday.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, the elevator doors opened, and we arrived at our intended floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This way.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I follow Himegi-san, feeling quite uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We finally arrive in front of a hospital room door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, the door is of the sliding type and is bigger than the ones at school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A nameplate under the room number reads Natsumi Himegi.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It appears that the private room belongs to Himegi-san’s older sister, named ‘Natsumi.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">At a time like this, I find myself reminiscing about my grandfather who passed away when I was in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s been a long time since I last visited a hospital room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, the room where my grandfather passed wasn’t a private one; it was a shared room…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi-neesan, we’re coming in.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san knocks gently on the door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From the other side, a soft female voice says, ‘Come in.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having received permission from the room’s occupant, we enter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The private room is far more spacious and luxurious than I had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My idea of a hospital room was limited to a bed, a small TV, and thin curtains.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This room is entirely different.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First of all, the furniture in the room is clearly not cheap; it’s high-quality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not just the furniture; even the electronics in the room are extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A gaming PC, a high-end refrigerator, a microwave, an electric kettle…</p>
<p class="calibre5">The TV is about twice the size of the one in my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels like a suite in a luxury hotel.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the presence of multiple medical devices near the bed, along with an IV stand and a wheelchair, forcefully remind me that this is, clearly, a hospital room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My gaze meets that of a frail, white-haired woman sitting on the bed. I recognize this bespectacled figure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was the one who appeared in a video message during Harune’s birthday party.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I knew it, this was Harune and Himegi-san’s sister after all…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite her frail appearance, she glares at me with a sharp look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems she has quite a few grievances against me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it about that? Does she want to know the secret behind the magic trick I performed?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or is she going to say that her sister and I don’t make a good match?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, I should be prepared for some flak.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you… Hakuba Ouji?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, I am Hakuba Ouji.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I have a complaint against you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A, a complaint?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. I’m very dissatisfied with you, and that’s why I had Touka-chan bring you here today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I swallow hard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is the sister of someone very important to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if she slings mud at me, or uses harsh language… I’ll take it with an open mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I firm up my resolve and meet her gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She crosses her arms and slowly opens her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Why… are you using tights?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Excuse me? T, tights???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What is she talking about? Is she referring to those tights?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why did you make the bunny girl wear tights?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tights on a bunny girl?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, she’s talking about the time I had Touka dress up as a bunny girl for the birthday party…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s because… she’s a bunny girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon hearing my words, Himegi-san’s sister clearly shows an expression of disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What exactly is she trying to tell me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is this some philosophical question? Like why people eat when they’re hungry, or why a bunny girl wears tights because she’s a bunny girl?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You fool&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m startled. I wish she wouldn’t raise her voice so suddenly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">More to the point, despite her frail appearance, this woman is a total eccentric!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, I can tell because I’ve encountered all kinds of quirky people before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without a doubt, she is an S-rank eccentric.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I feel nauseous around idiots who have stopped thinking. Take another good look at my sister’s thighs with those eyes of yours.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Given permission by her sister, I focus on Himegi-san’s treasured pair of thighs, which are currently blocked by her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As always, they are magnificent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whoever coined the term “absolute territory” for the area between knee socks and a mini skirt is almost as genius as me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Words are unnecessary for something so splendid. Simply put, they’re the best.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe. Yes, the thighs of my angel surpass even Aphrodite.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…And what does this have to do with the bunny girl’s tights?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah… you still haven’t realized, you sinner? Why did you make her cover such splendid bare legs with tights? Why didn’t you think of a bare-legged bunny to maximize Touka Himegi’s allure?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m struck as if by lightning at her words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like scales have fallen from my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, her beautiful legs call for a bare-legged bunny!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Overwhelmed by my own stupidity, I slump on the spot. What a grave sin I have committed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Bare-legged bunny… why did I overlook that? It’s no wonder that Onē-san is disappointed in me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems you’ve come to reappreciate the greatness of a bare-legged bunny.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“As much as it pains me to admit it, I have no choice but to agree. You’re right; the tights were a mistake. I’ve made the biggest mistake in human history!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To think I’d missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, if only I could turn back time, I would go back to the birthday party and tear those bunny tights to shreds.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad you understand. However, getting my stubborn sister to dress up as a bunny girl is quite commendable. I’d like you to use that skill again next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…does that mean Onē-san forgives a sinner like me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Everyone makes mistakes. Next time you get Touka-chan to dress as a bunny girl, please make it a bare-legged bunny or a reverse bunny.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! As soon as I get home today, I’ll tear up those tights and throw them in the trash. Then, from next time, she’ll be a bare-legged bunny on stage.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?! You two, a reverse bunny!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Considering it’s a sensitive issue, maybe let’s not do it in public…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. Well, as long as it happens in front of both of us, it should be fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then there’s no issue.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mm-hm, that’s what I’d expect from Touka-chan’s boyfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Hey, you perverts, enough is enough! There’s not going to be a next time! And what’s a reverse bunny??”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san vehemently protests our blossoming discussion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nē-san, is what you wanted to talk to Ouji-kun about the tights on the bunny girl?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s part of it, but the real issue is yet to come.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her expression suddenly becomes serious, a complete shift from before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems the important discussion starts now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have something I want to show you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“To me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, if you are Touka-chan’s boyfriend, I want you to see this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Wha&mdash;!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onē-san pulls out something astonishing from under the quilt and shows it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good grief, this Onē-san is… quite an extraordinary person…</p>

<p class="calibre5">What Onē-san pulled out was a body pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it wasn’t just any body pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The pillow cover was… Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, Himegi-san on the cover was not dressed in a school uniform or casual clothes; she was in a revealing female knight’s attire…</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, upon seeing the body pillow cover, Himegi-san was holding her head in her hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How about that! Aren’t you jealous?! It’s a one-of-a-kind body pillow that I had the maids make! “</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a proud expression, Onē-san boasts about the body pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The quality is amazing too! The breasts are inflated to the same size as the real thing, and on that shelf over there, I have Maid Touka, Gym Shorts Touka, Nurse Touka, Nude Touka, et cetera, et cetera… There are pillow covers featuring Touka-chan and Harune-tan in a multitude of outfits, all sealed away!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Wow, that’s amazing. By the way, what’s on the back of the body pillow?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s Harune-tan dressed as a wizard!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onē-san flipped the pillow to reveal Harune-chan dressed as a wizard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“O-ohh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No matter how much you act like Touka-chan’s boyfriend, the one who understands and loves my sisters the most is me, Natsumi Himegi! Mwah, mwah, mwah!”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000006.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">Onē-san declared me a rival while repeatedly kissing the face of the female knight on the body pillow and fondling the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What a sight to behold…</p>

<p class="calibre5">If it was her brother, they’d probably have a family meeting about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, even if it was a sister, it was still out of bounds…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I’m just glad Onē-san’s complaint wasn’t about that magic trick.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s a really high-quality body pillow… It would probably sell like hotcakes if it were on the market.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What? You want to touch this female knight Touka-chan’s chest too?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onē-san said as she skillfully fondled the pillow’s chest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, I nodded my head repeatedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No! This Touka-chan is only for Onē-san! Mwah, mwah!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“H-hey! Nē-san, stop it! Also, Ouji-kun, don’t get carried away!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t care! I want Touka-chan to always be Natsumi’s Touka-chan&mdash;cough, cough, cough…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onē-san coughed painfully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san, with a worried expression, rushed over to her and gently patted her back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, you got too excited…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Cough, cough… haa, haaah… I overdid it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A-Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine. It happens all the time… and I’m used to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">All the time?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…There were many picture books and novels on a bookshelf deep inside the room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the wall was a painting, possibly done in acrylic, depicting a scene.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A little black-haired girl, next to her a girl with long black hair in a dress, a man who looked like their father, a woman who seemed like their mother, and a bespectacled woman wearing a medical hat, all holding hands in a sunflower field.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone in the painting had bright, smiling faces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was a date on the painting: May 7th of the previous year.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps the little girl in the picture painted it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Judging from the art style, it was probably done by someone in the early grades of elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And based on the date, it’s possible that Himegi-san’s Onē-san had been hospitalized since well before last summer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A long-term hospital stay… That means…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The artist’s name is Harune Himegi.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I noticed you staring intently at the painting, so I thought I’d tell you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Feeling like Onē-san had seen right through me, I felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, so Harune-chan drew this picture…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I shouldn’t judge, but Harune-chan doesn’t seem to be particularly talented at drawing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s pretty bad, right? But it’s one of my most treasured possessions.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess it brings back memories.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. I was allowed a day out from the hospital, and on my insistence, we went to a sunflower field that wasn’t even in bloom…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From the story, it seemed that last year during Golden Week, the family of five went to play in the sunflower field.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, sunflowers wouldn’t be blooming in May.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But the sunflower field in the painting is in full bloom.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s the charm of it. It was Harune’s thoughtful touch.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She must have painted it thinking of her sister, putting her heart into a skill she wasn’t particularly good at.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If hypothetically, I were to receive such a painting as a gift, I would probably also frame it and put it on display.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you like sunflowers?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They’re my favorite flower…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“More importantly, how long have you two been dating?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He confessed to me right after we moved up a grade.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If my memory serves me right, I was the one who was being confessed to last week.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, my first confession was rejected by Himegi-san…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Heheheh I see. So you’re a brand-new couple.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, Natsumi-san grinned and smiled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, what does Touka-chan like about Hakuba-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I like that he’s good at magic tricks and that he’s surprisingly dependable.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe! So, what are you two planning to do for Golden Week?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san was surprised by the unexpected question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re a couple, so you’ll go on a date or something, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Certainly, if we’re a couple, we’d probably go on a date during Golden Week.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But coming to this hospital room&mdash;and seeing Natsumi-san’s condition&mdash;something I had been wondering about seems to make a bit more sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps Himegi-san’s proposal to date me has something to do with her Onē-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Of course we will go on a date. Right, Ouji-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, we’ll go on a date during Golden Week.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I haven’t made any plans, but I went along with Himegi-san’s story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san falls silent at Onē-san’s question.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that Himegi-san is not the type of person who can think on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’re planning to go to Crown World.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I decided to throw her a lifeline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Crown World is an entertainment facility with hot springs and heated pools.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Incidentally, its catchphrase is “24 hours of feeling like a king.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We got some discount coupons from my dad, so we were discussing going there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I lied. Each time I lie, I see fleeting images of my parents’ faces, but helping the frozen girl beside me is my current priority.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I lied.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While it’s true that I received discount coupons from my dad, Himegi-san and I have never discussed going on a date.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I made up a spur-of-the-moment lie because I thought Natsumi-san would get suspicious if we didn’t give her some explanation about going out somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I take a quick glance at Himegi-san. She looks apologetic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I remember going there once with the Harukawa family when it first opened.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it’s true. I wanted to go again, but with my condition, there’s not much I can do.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You both have fun, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, we will.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mm-hm. With this, I have one less regret. Ah, joy, joy.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had no words to respond to that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even without any medical expertise, I could tell that the woman in front of me was not doing well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking at her, who has lost a lot of weight, I’m reminded of my grandfather who passed away from cancer when I was in elementary school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While I’m lost in thought, the door to the hospital room opens, and a little girl around the age of five enters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s wearing pink pajamas and hugging a picture book to her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems she came to this room wanting Onē-san to read to her. The girl in pajamas eyes me with evident caution.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi Onē-chan, read the picture book…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right, I promised to read it to you, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At those words, the girl’s face lights up with a smile, and she scampers over to the bed, occupying the space next to Onē-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But you know, today, there’s something even more fun than reading a picture book, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Something more fun than reading a picture book?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that cute onī-chan over there will show you some magic tricks, Anna-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t believe she just put me on the spot like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nevertheless, my pride won’t allow me to say that I can’t do it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I performed some magic tricks for the little girl using a coin and a deck of cards&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">After leaving the hospital room, we sat on a bench in a nearby park, feeling the cool air of the spring evening.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Neither of us could head home just yet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had to address the questions I’d been harboring.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thanks for the magic tricks.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad Anna-chan enjoyed them.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re really amazing. Despite being on her guard at first, she actually warmed up to you in the end. I’m a little envious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as Himegi-san said, by the time we left, the girl had opened up to me enough to ask, ‘Show me magic tricks again sometime.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Himegi-san, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bowed my head to Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Why are you apologizing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Today, after meeting Onē-san, I understood one thing. Why Himegi-san doesn’t date anyone.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If a family member is going through a tough medical battle, you can’t possibly be lost in romance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If my family were sick, I’d be reacting the same way as Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In such a situation, I selfishly confessed my feelings to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The more I think about it, the more I wish I could go back to that day and punch my thoughtless self.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If it’s about the confession, you shouldn’t worry. After all, you didn’t know anything back then…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Hearing you say that lightens my heart a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I also owe you an apology.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that about the current relationship between us?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She nods slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, Himegi-san’s confession at that time was…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“As you might have guessed, Ouji-kun, I had no intention of dating anyone until my sister got better. But now, I am dating you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, the reason we’re dating has something to do with your sister?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Today, after meeting with Nē-san, I think you understand that she doesn’t have much time left.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a trembling voice, she spoke about her sister’s condition.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I knew it, but I couldn’t easily accept the fact.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite all the laughter, to think she had so little time left…</p>
<p class="calibre5">There couldn’t be a more painful reality for Himegi-san, her family member.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’ve tried various treatments, but none have worked. The doctor has announced she won’t make it to the fall…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tears were brimming in Himegi-san’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing her grief-stricken expression, a sharp pain pierced my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It must be incredibly difficult, knowing her beloved sister doesn’t have long to live.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took a handkerchief from my pocket and gently handed it to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If it’s painful, you don’t have to talk about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san shook her head,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. I’ll be fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then she let out a sigh, staring intently at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“She said she wanted to see who I’d be dating before she dies…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, you picked me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…After watching the video of Harune’s birthday party, she took a liking to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, the reason we became a couple was for Natsumi Himegi…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Strangely, I didn’t feel angry about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Some people might scream, ‘Are you mocking me?’ but instead, I felt somewhat relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, it would be a lie to say it’s not a bit sad…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that the only reason I was chosen?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m happy she liked me after watching the birthday party video, but if that’s the only reason, anyone could have sufficed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There are three reasons why I chose you. The first is that my sister liked you. The second is that I thought you wouldn’t say no. And the third is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The third reason?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That…I’m sorry. There were only two reasons.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So that means Himegi-san isn’t dating me because she’s in love with me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I knew it, but it’s still a bit disappointing.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><br class="chapter-warning" />
<br class="chapter-warning" />
<br class="chapter-warning" />
</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, the real disappointment will come later. What matters now is what to do next.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Do we continue to pretend to be a couple in front of her sister, or do we break off the relationship here?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can understand Himegi-san wanting to minimize her sister’s regrets with the little time she has left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The method may be incredibly clumsy, but it’s filled with love for her sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, even putting aside my romantic feelings for Himegi-san, I want to continue supporting her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, it’s also true that my sense of ethics is questioning whether this is really the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it truly correct to keep lying to someone with such a limited time left?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either choice seems like it would leave a bad taste in my mouth…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Should I ask Touka-san, who knows the future, for the best answer?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, that’s… probably wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is my life. Making decisions and taking responsibility for my chosen path has to come from me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To be honest, I wish you had consulted me sooner.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. I couldn’t bring myself to say it because I imagined you might reject me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I won’t say no. After all, if I do, you’ll probably try to find another guy to play the boyfriend role, right? If it comes to that, I’d rather pretend to be a couple.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if it’s fake, I don’t want any other man standing next to Himegi-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I wish you had been honest…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, she bowed deeply, apologizing once again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay. We’ll be a couple for as long as your sister is alive. …Let’s go with that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I chose for us to move forward together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I chose to pretend to be her lover.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even knowing that it might not be the right thing to do&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you sure? I’m asking something really terrible of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You chose me when you go down that hard road. That’s enough for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No problem.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, we decided to part ways on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san gets into the luxury car she had been waiting in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shall I give you a ride?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka Himegi should be at home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s probably not good for the two of them to bump into each other.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’ve decided to go home alone today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that judgment, I declined her offer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My words seemed to sadden her a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe she thinks I’m angry and that’s why I’m refusing her offer?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see. Ouji-kun, thank you so much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about it, I’m really not mad. I just want to walk alone for a bit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Alright, Ouji-kun. See you tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She lightly raised her hand and said “goodbye” through the window of the car.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Normally, such a gesture from her would have sent me over the moon, but I wasn’t happy at all this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And with that, Himegi-san left the scene.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Time to go home…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Honestly, I was pretty down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if I go home, there’s another Touka Himegi there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now that I know the Himegi family situation, how should I face her?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I got home, I couldn’t believe my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My father and mother were hurriedly loading a lot of stuff into our old, run-down compact car.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Huh? Could it be that they’re running away in the middle of the night?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is this what they call “midnight runaway” in common terms?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, the day has finally come…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, selling used bikes isn’t going to be profitable in this day and age.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I said we should be selling gaming PCs instead!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I approached my parents, who were busy carrying things.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How much is the debt?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? That’s the first thing you ask???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a midnight runaway, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Midnight flight? …you, it’s not even seven o’clock yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I heard that people don’t run away in the middle of the night anymore these days.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ha-chan, we’re going to visit my parents’ home on short notice.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? To grandma’s place?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your grandma hurt her back. We’re going to report about the new grandchild and take care of her while we’re there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Only my grandmother lives at my father’s family home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My grandfather passed away from cancer several years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite my father’s casual tone, I’m sure he’s deeply concerned about my grandmother who lives alone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see, so these bags are for the trip back home.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’ll probably stay there until Golden Week is over.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’d like to bring you along, but you should stay by Touka-chan’s side.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san has her own things to take care of, so I can’t drag her along for the trip, nor can I leave her alone in this house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In that case, it’s best for me to stay.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was thinking this, I was patted on the back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Father-in-law, is this trunk the last piece of luggage?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Turning around, I saw a beautiful woman with black hair standing there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, Touka-chan. Sorry to ask this, but can you take care of this idiot?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Both of you, take care.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, my father and mother headed off to my grandmother’s house in the neighboring prefecture.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So it’s just the two of us now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Normally, this would be a scene to jump for joy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But honestly, I didn’t want to be alone with her right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san. Today, I went to see Natsumi-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, she didn’t react at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As if she knew everything from the start…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Could it be, Touka-san, that you met Natsumi-san today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why do you think that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, you mentioned leaving this morning, so I wondered if maybe&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s a free spirit, but in this time, she should have only a handful of people she could meet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s correct. Today, we watched a movie together.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…The one we saw recently?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I intercepted the film that the present Me was originally supposed to watch with my Nē-san in this timeline.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps when Touka-san was crying in the theater that day, she wasn’t moved by the movie but was instead reminiscing about the past.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, it seems that history has been changed again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Does Natsumi-san know about your true identity, Touka-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. She was delighted to meet someone from the future…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, like me, Natsumi-san is also someone who knows about the future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But why did Touka-san intercept what her past self was supposed to do?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what are your thoughts after meeting Natsumi-neesan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I wish I could’ve met her when she was well.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I honestly voiced what I was thinking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. In the world I came from, Ha-kun and Natsumi-neesan never met.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her words implied that history had been altered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, so in the original timeline, Natsumi-san and I were never supposed to cross paths…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is your goal to have me and Natsumi-san meet, Touka-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s part of it, but… it’s all a&mdash;secret!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, Touka-san winked cutely and dodged my question.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems she has no intention of revealing anything until the very end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ha-kun, I want you to do what you wish to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What I want to do…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What could that be?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t come up with an answer immediately, which was pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All I knew was that I didn’t want to have any regrets.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did you announce your marriage?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, and we were thoroughly congratulated.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the way, it was us who orchestrated you two becoming a fake couple!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So it was you after all…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you think, caught in the scheme of me and Natsumi-neesan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From Natsumi-san’s perspective, her sister appeared from six years in the future to announce her marriage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, she would want to meet the Me on this timeline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She adores her sisters so much, she’d be intensely curious about what kind of man I am.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! I get it now!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, this is a challenge from Natsumi Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m being tested to see if Hakuba Ouji truly deserves Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why they made Himegi-san and me appear as lovers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It all makes sense now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like I’ve been played, which is a little annoying, but I have to accept Natsumi-san’s challenge.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“However, this is a roundabout way of doing things…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nonetheless, it clears up some uncertainties I had.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, Natsumi-san is the mastermind behind this setup.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now I won’t feel guilty acting as a fake couple in front of her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll just have to do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I’d be happy if I could earn Natsumi-san’s approval.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-san, I’m hungry…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I suddenly felt hungry after the relief washed over me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, all I want is to eat some of Touka-san’s warm food.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m making some rice; let’s eat together.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thus began our life together in this house, just the two of us.</p>

<h2>Touka Himegi: Reminiscence 2</h2>

<p class="calibre5">That day, I was standing in front of Ouji-kun’s desk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, unusually&mdash;or rather, for the first time, I had something to ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On his desk were cards from a game that my sister often plays.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I spoke to him as he was messing around on his smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, do you have a moment?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait a sec, just a sec… I’m almost done figuring out a deck recipe to beat Harune-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s about my sister.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Himegi-san, you have a cute little sister…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah. Thank you for taking care of her.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems like it’s her second time running away from home.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He set down his smartphone and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I wasn’t mistaken, there was a definite anger in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He probably knew most of the situation from Harune, and he was silently blaming us, who had hurt Harune.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t it troublesome for you? I’ll take her home today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister Harune had run away from home for the second time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason she ran away was because she couldn’t stand watching our parents fight every day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, everyone in the house searched for Harune.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also sought help from my childhood friend, Takashi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That childhood friend asked for assistance from both his girlfriend Chikada-san and Ouji-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, Ouji-kun found Harune.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, he took her into his care when he found her crying in a convenience store parking lot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And currently, she is being looked after at Ouji-kun’s home.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…If it’s about troubling us, don’t worry. Harune-chan also says she doesn’t want to go home right now…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t blame Harune this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason my sister ran away was entirely because we were not good enough for her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking back, I was always focused on myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one suffering the most was my sister. And yet, I neglected her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m a truly pathetic sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve failed as an older sibling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I heard from Chikada-san, Ouji-kun, you have a newborn baby at home, don’t you? I can’t possibly bother your family at such a busy time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about that. Winter break starts the day after tomorrow, and I’ll help look after my siblings and Harune-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I didn’t know how to face Harune.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I knew my parents were arguing every day, I chose to turn a blind eye.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was fed up with everything, and I thought nothing mattered anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But when my sister ran away, I finally woke up to what I should be doing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t mean to pry into your family affairs, but according to what Harune-chan told me, you don’t have relatives who could take her in besides your family, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, our situation is a bit unique…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The only family you have, your grandmother, lives in another country, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes, that’s right. My grandmother lives in a distant country.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To begin with, we don’t even know where my grandmother lives.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if she lived nearby, her house would undoubtedly be a dangerous place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Rather than sending my sister to such a place…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Then I’ll beg you. Could you please take care of my sister during the winter break?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bowed deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt foolish.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t the act of bowing my head that bothered me. It was realizing that he, whom I had looked down upon as ignorant, was far more mature than I was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After my sister died, I thought I was the most unfortunate person in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had been playing the role of a tragic heroine somewhere in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that wasn’t the case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Many people lent their strength for the sake of my little sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite us rejecting various things, they reached out to us without showing any discomfort.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Neither my sister nor I were lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had forgotten such simple facts&mdash;that people can’t live alone; we live by cooperating with others.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In reality, the one who knew nothing about the world was me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The one who hadn’t learned anything from my sister’s death was also me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know I’m repeating myself, but you don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In any case, I must now intervene between my parents and mediate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With Natsumi-nēsan gone, I am the only one who can hold my estranged parents together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what I must do now. Otherwise, I can’t face my sister.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“More importantly, Himegi-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I never had the chance to say this… My condolences for your Onē-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, he stood up and bowed to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Let me know how I can help. I’m here for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, reconciling your parents is important, but you should also make up with him…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, he pointed at Takashi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Upon being pointed at by Ouji-kun, Takashi made an awkward face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, he had been eavesdropping on our conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“He’s your childhood friend, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I often fight with Kanako too, but we’ve never been awkward with each other for half a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He was desperately looking for Harune-chan too. I think you have a good childhood friend, Himegi-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We still hadn’t reconciled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I was the one in the wrong, my foolish pride kept me from apologizing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…would you like to hold my twins sometime? You may think I’m an overly doting brother, but every day, seeing these tiny lives trying so hard to live makes me think about the preciousness of life.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He scratched his head awkwardly, clearly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, they still have faces like monkeys.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…alright. I would love to hold them too if it’s okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And a few days later, I held his siblings in my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just as he had said, they were wrinkled and had their eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They weren’t the babies I had imagined, but I found these tiny beings to be precious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Somehow, my tears flowed, my tears spilled out before I knew it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It reminded me of the time I was allowed to hold my newborn sister, Harune, from my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Back then, I swore with my sister to cherish Harune no matter what.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I had promised to protect her, no matter what happened…</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really am a fool. Out of self-concern, I’ve turned away from what matters most.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time I’ll keep the promise from that day.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve made nothing but mistakes, but I should still be able to start over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That vow from that day hasn’t disappeared yet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On this day, I pledged once more to my late older sister and my living little sister.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll reclaim it. Even though we’ve fallen apart, we should be able to start from zero again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll restore the bonds of our family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…This year was a year for me to learn about life and death.</p>
