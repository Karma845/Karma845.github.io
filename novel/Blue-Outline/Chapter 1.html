<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Art is not a pleasure trip; it is a battle</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have always been fighting against an overwhelming force called talent.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Utako moved away, I had been with the “genius”, Kashiwazaki Yuri ever since.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that incident back in the sixth grade, she had lost the will to draw. In the past four years, she has only completed a few pictures, none of which by her own will. Despite my efforts, my paintings were still nowhere near as good as hers. Didn’t matter whether it’s competition results, acknowledgements, or anything, she was always better. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to be popular&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri suddenly muttered in the six tatami mat sized room – Yuri Kashiwazaki, “genius” who now completely betrayed both expectation and envy from others, looked at Seino and me in exasperation. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:6 tatami mats = 9.72 square meters, 104.6 square feet]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s Sunday, and I can’t stand the thought of sitting in Marina’s room reading manga. Really, I want to go on a date with a handsome man that will make everyone envious.” complained Yuri. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re insulting me, aren’t you?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino, the owner of this room and the one who offered Yuri the manga, replied as she raised her eyebrows. Despite that, Yuri continued reading the manga with a nonchalant look on her face, completely disregarding Seino’s angry voice. She was an artistic genius, but that didn’t stop her from being eccentric. As far as memory serves, she has been called “unique” and “weird” by many people. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the one who said the earlier remark was Marina Seino. She was a friend who started hanging out with Yuri in high school and became close to me as a byproduct. She was a self-proclaimed gal who likes to dress in flashy outfits despite her innocent sounding name. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in reality, she was just an ordinary girl in this rural town, just a little flashy looking and trendy…No, maybe a bit unconventional. The fact that after being pushed around by Yuri, she still chooses to hang out with her was a peculiarity. Perhaps she was a masochist of some sort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she had finished venting her anger on Yuri, Seino said a parting remark. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the very least, I can tell you that a woman who comes to someone’s house and just starts reading manga couldn’t be popular.” said Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hoh? You say? Well then, let’s go outside. We’re going to do a reverse pickup.” said Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She grinned and raised the corner of her mouth as if to say that she had come up with an interesting activity. She snapped the manga close and stood up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!? Reverse pickup!? Wait! We can’t just go and call out a random guy.” shouted Marina</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s lower the level of difficulty. Attack the guys who are on their way home from club practice.” suggested yuri </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was common  for Yuri to make ridiculous suggestions to the reluctant Seino. But with the word “attack”, it didn’t sound like a pickup to me anymore…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s even worse if they’re guys who know us!  They’ll think you’re either a freak or a pervert if you suddenly try to pick them up!&#8221; reprimanded Seino</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve got no guts at all. Who will even work for you?” said Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s the guy closest to you?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them turned their gaze towards me at the same time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Komiya is acceptable, and he should fit the definition of a pickup, wouldn’t he?” suggested Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not Sousuke. By the way, why are you even here?” inquired Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are the one who called me here?!” I shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the way Yuri treated me. And I didn’t treat her like a woman either, which was fine. But I didn’t think I’d be able to stand straight again if it was Utako who said something like that to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t even feel the slightest attraction towards him, But he can be a good training ground. Come on, get up and try being useful for a change.” said Yuri.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really think I’m just going to go along after just being told that?” I rebuked ferociously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, I already know that you are annoying. Well, I’m postponing the reverse pickup for a time being. For now, I must study the minds of men. I’m sure you have some shojo manga for reference.” complained Yuri</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sigh escaped my lips when I saw Yuri rummaging through the manga in the bookshelf. What a waste of talent. If only I could use this time to be in front of a canvas, I was sure I would be able to create a decent painting. God of art, please give me the same talent you gave this young missy. I would definitely put it to good use. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going home now. I’m starting to have a headache.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Oh, Sosuke. I called you here today to give you this, here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Yuri handed me was a ticket to Shohei Kawabe’s solo exhibition at the Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art. He was a famous oil painter from Hokkaido. And since the exhibition was being held nearby, I had already considered visiting at least once. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? I can have it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It was a gift from the director, but I’m not interested at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure you do understand, the director gave you this ticket because he wanted you to come. Is it really something you can just give me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri completely ignored my words and started reading the manga in her hand. It was a bad habit of hers to run away at the first sign of any unpleasant or troublesome things. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, why don’t you just give it to him at school tomorrow? Do you really have to come all the way to my house on Sunday just for this?”said Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you know, Marina. Sosuke here has been our obedient errand boy all along.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, it all made sense. It was true that all these snacks and juices that these guys were feasting on were things that I bought from the convenience store, all by Yuri’s order.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see… Or rather, it was so subtle that I didn’t notice. I’m sorry, Komiya. I know you are a good guy, but you can’t keep being Yuri’s slave forever, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep that in mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not that I was a person who couldn’t say no when asked to do something, but rather I didn’t notice that I was being used in the first place. I had never been good at swimming with the tide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I had worked hard and diligently on not just what I wanted to do, But also what I didn’t want to do, and what I had to do. It’s not that I was looking for any return, but if I were allowed to ask for one thing, I&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what kind of pictures I draw, it was just a painting of an ordinary person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to become an even better painter than Kashiwazaki Yuri herself.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri and I used to play together since we were little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing how much I loved to draw even as a preschooler, my parents started sending me to the only art class in the city when I entered elementary school. It wasn’t because they wanted me to become a painter in the future or anything like that, but out of pure parental love for their son to do what he loved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first time I saw art materials, the first time I was taught how to draw by a kind and skilled teacher. I was getting better and better at drawing as time passed. I still now remembered how much I looked forward to the weekly class day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Yuri’s mother, who was worried about her restless child, decided to send Yuri to class too after hearing from my mother. She seemed to have been considering sending Yuri to art classes for a while, since Yuri’s drawings were better than average, but decided against it because of her fickle nature. But then she seemed to change her mind once again when she heard that I also went to art class. Perhaps it was because she thought that having a friend could be a reason for Yuri to keep on drawing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When her mother forced her to come to the school for the trial class, she had been fuming that she didn’t want to learn anything. But when she saw the oil painting book in the instructor’s waiting room, she immediately became entranced. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, despite having no experience with oil painting, Yuri had painted a better apple than anyone else in the classroom, even better than me who had been taking the class three months prior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still remembered the look of astonishment on the teacher’s face at that moment. The look of excitement and anticipation in her eyes, as if she had found a treasure trove. A look of admiration that she never showed to any of us.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:The teacher’s gender isn’t mentioned, only referred to as teacher. ‘She’ here is just an assumption]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri seemed to enjoy the class and soon decided to enroll. After that day, the two of us drew countless pictures. When my teacher saw my drawings, she would say, “You’re very good at staying true to the basics, good job”. In fact, I was confident that I was better than other kids my age, and I even won prizes when I submitted my work to competitions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was always Yuri who drew the pictures of higher appraisal, and it was Yuri who drew the pictures that people would remember, pictures that stuck in people’s minds. Whenever people tried to describe her talent in words, “genius” was the only fitting expression. It was used to a point of being a cliché, a common, yet inevitable expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten years had passed since then, and I had changed my class to the exam course for art school. While I was still going to painting classes, Yuri quitted right when she graduated from junior high school. But even now that she’s gone, the teacher’s eyes continue to follow her. Maybe this feeling of inferiority had been there since that day, her first day at the art class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I was reminiscing about the past on a weekday morning must be because the steam rising from my cup of hot cocoa, soothing me, bringing forth those memories. It was as if the cocoa was trying to lure me back into the world of sleep. With effort, I got up and opened the door, saying, “I’m off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I left the house, I was driven awake by the piercing coldness. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was November, and the first snowfall had already been confirmed. For a high school boy living in a snow country, there was a famous trick to get a hairdo without waxing; just put a little water on your hair and go to school as it was. However, what kind of hairdo you get depends solely on the direction of the wind that day, and furthermore, the effect wears off once you go indoors. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked the long way to school, along the large sidewalk that had been cleared of snow. Then I was called out when I was passing the front of the staff room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Komiya, is Kashiwazaki coming to club activities today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who called me was Hiiragi-sensei, the advisor of the art club that we belong to. The school we attend, Maiei High School, was said to be one of the top three schools in Hokkaido, with a high rate of students entering former imperial universities and famous private universities every year. There were also classes called the “Advanced Course” where the top students were gathered, but unfortunately, there was none for the art department. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite this, the art club that Hiiragi-sensei advised had many members, coming from all over Hokkaido, and ranging from students who simply like to draw to those who were serious about pursuing a career in the field of art.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because Hiiragi-sensei was a renowned painter in the art world, a heretic who had been painting in Paris since graduating from art school because he despised the Japanese competition system. He only came back to his hometown, Maimori City ten years ago to take care of his parents. It was no wonder why so many people wanted to join the Maiei High School Art Club, so that they could be taught by such a great painter. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, oil painting was Hiiragi-sensei’s specialty. Many of his students had won prizes in various competitions of this theme… Besides Yuri, who refused to draw any pictures and thus didn’t contribute to the statistics. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter the students’ enthusiasm, Hiiragi-sensei had a reputation for his ability to develop their personalities and teach them to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. However, when it came to Yuri, he left all the decision making to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know. And why do you have to ask me every time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered without hiding my displeasure, only for him to laugh at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, because you’re her boyfriend, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You already know that I’m not. Aren’t you an advisor, why not just try advicing something to her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I gave her the wrong advice, it would only make the matter worse. You should know that. If anything, you’re my best shot at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed, then said “Got it. You want me to ask her about the Koji Competition right? I’ll tell her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Koji Exhibition Competition, a famous open competition accepting high school students and older. There were no restrictions in terms of theme and technique used, as long as it was two-dimensional. It was said that anyone who wanted to become a painter, to go to art school, or just wanted to test their own ability should try it at least once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The oil painting that I submitted last year didn’t win any prizes, it wasn’t even nominated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thanks a lot. Hmm… since she didn’t participate last year, I really want her to this year… Well then, Komiya, I’m counting on you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiiragi-sensei patted me on the shoulder and left. I let out a sigh as I watched his back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the past few years, Yuri had no enthusiasm or whatsoever for creative activities. Only in the second and third years of junior high school did she really try her hand on summer school assignments, but that was just to get into Maiei High School, the closest and the most convenient for commuting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a well-planned crime. As if on schedule, she won the grand prize in the student art competition for two year in a row and was accepted into the high school by that merit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was one thing she miscalculated. She must have planned to just screw around, but because she was accepted by her art portfolio, she had no choice but to enter the art club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was only natural, wasn’t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, it’s not like Yuri had any admiration for Hiiragi-sensei nor wanted to be taught by him. Every time I remembered that there were people who had been in tears when they knew they weren’t accepted, a childhood friend or not, there was no way I wasn’t indignant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than anything, she had been willing to break her promise with Utako without any reluctance. That was unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the classroom, Yuri was merrilly chatting away with Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino had auburn hair and piercings, a combo clearly violating school regulations, and a layer of makeup to add. And besides her was Yuri, with her long hair she kept because of her laziness to go to the hair salon, her big catlike eyes, and the corners of her mouth that would twerk up mockingly. Two opposite styles, yet oddly fitted together. The ability of humans to adapt and get used to their environment was frightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, Hiiragi-sensei wants to know whether you will participate in the Koji Competition. He really wants you to enter this year, since last year you didn’t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just acting as a messenger, yet Yuri didn’t spare me from that look of complete disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Oh, it’s okay, not that I mind. I’d like to go to a mixer too, Marina. Take me,” said Yuri, completely disregarding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A mixer?! Don’t tell me you seriously think that you know how to be popular just because you spent yesterday reading shoujo manga?” I interjected. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino let out an exasperated sigh. “Mixer? Hmm… I think there’s one upcoming… Usually I wouldn’t invite someone prettier, but if it’s Yuri… No, especially someone as eccentric as Yuri. There’s no way you’d not sour the mood,” she mumbled.</span></p>

<p>“Haha, are you envious of me? I won’t blame you, Marina. You and I are of different levels of femininity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where does that confidence come from?! Whatever, I give up. I’m going to a karaoke with the guys from Wada Technical High around next month, tag along if you want to”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised to see that Seino had backed down. I didn’t expect her to actually take Yuri with her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you all right? You’re really taking her with you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just too much trouble telling her not to. I’m not in the mood to argue. And it would be quicker to just show Yuri the reality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once Yuri had made up her mind, she wouldn’t budge, leaving no room for compromise. That was a fact that I, who have known her for a long time or anyone who knew her enough, understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During a summer break when she was ten years old, she once decided that she wanted to live a “self-sufficient life”, so she camped out in a nearby mountain. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone, including me, thought that she would get bored within a day and would return, but she never came back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Panicked, her parents went into the mountain to search for her, only to find her enjoying fishing with her makeshift fishing rod. In the end, Yuri enjoyed a life of survival for four whole days until she finally gave in to the cries and begging of her parents. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: A bizarre girl indeed…]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the winter when she was fourteen, Yuri planned to hitchhike to Tokyo and actually carried it out. She didn’t tell anyone about the plan, knowing well that we would definitely disapprove. Consequently, it led to a huge commotion, even involving the police. The fiasco came to an end when Yuri was found ravenously devouring Nama Yatsuhashi samples at a tourist spot in Kyoto. Yuri’s energy and recklessness brought her not only to Tokyo but even to Kyoto. It even became a hot topic nationwide at that time.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Wait, she did what now?!]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: Nama Yatsuhashi, one of Kyoto’s famous mochi-like souvenir snack]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was amazed and tired of this stupid, stubborn and crazy Yuri, but I find her interesting and… stimulating… to be with her, although it was true that it was taxing, it wasn’t something I cannot handle. It was probably the same story for Seino, which was why they hang out together even though they are of different types.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I really felt sorry for Seino when I thought about the amount of mental suffering she needed to endure at the mixer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I’m still concerned…It’s as if I’m throwing a wild uncontrollable beast into a crowd of people… Yuri, I can’t make you behave properly, I have already given up on that… But still, at least don’t pick fights or use any violence. Do you understand? There are some guys from Wada High who are interested in me, so at least please behave for my sake, will you?” Seino warned with a strong tone, looking into Yuri’s eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I know. I’m going to spend that day as a graceful Yu-chan, no need to fret about it.” She said, seemingly in a very good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never seen Yuri this relaxed before, and I did not think I ever would. My eyes met with Seino. We both shrugged, probably thinking the same thing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You surely don’t know how to choose your man, Marina. I can teach you a thing or two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why are you suddenly acting so high and mighty? You say I don’t know how to choose my man, but you don’t even know a single thing about my lovelife!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know, but I have some guesses. It could be a flirtatious, neutral looking guy, or a guy who looks a little badass but has good manners and says his hobby is dancing, or a band member who’s obviously gobbling up his fans.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can you be so malicious in your predictions? I’ve been crushing on the tough looking guy from “The Fishmen” lately.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Fishmen” was a young comedian duo that was currently on the rise, and I had heard that they’re rapidly gaining popularity among women. The world seemed a smaller place than you might have thought when you found out that someone close to you was one of the world’s influencers. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: In the original version, the duo was called “フィッシュマン” which was treansliteration of “Fisherman”, but for the sake of grammar I changed it to “The Fishermen”]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: It seems that The Fishermen lives in Maimori, and will be a relevant character later]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are funny and I don’t hate them or anything, but&#8230; you’re following the trend. Next year you’ll have forgotten their name.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, shut up! I think they are cool, so don’t judge me, will you?! Then what about you, what kind of guy is your type, Yuri?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have the slightest bit of romantic feelings towards Yuri, but I was genuinely curious to know what kind of man this eccentric woman would prefer as we had never talked about such things before. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Seino’s question, Yuri merely interjected, “Hmm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like someone who doesn’t complain about what I do&#8230; and gives me lots of money when I ask for it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s just an ATM! I don’t think you’re capable of loving someone!” I said. That kind of answer deserved a retort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way… Since they say they’re coming in three, I want to take another girl with me… I wonder who I should invite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grinning, Yuri caught Seino’s hand as she reached for her phone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine with any girl. I don’t care who you bring, they won’t steal any attention from me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is your eyesight bad or something? Go look at yourself in the mirror!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered that when Yuri won a prize in a realistic painting competition, she was described as having extremely observative eyesight. However, that excellent eyesight seemed to only be effective when she was painting, so I couldn’t say for sure… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, objectively speaking, Yuri might be more attractive than average. But because we had been together for so long, my judgment would not be accurate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yuri. I know it’s your first, but you’ll be disappointed if you get carried away by that enthusiasm of yours, you know?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t be swayed even with that ‘I know it all’ tone, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teasing people and sticking tongue out at people like a kid, no one would have believed if we were to introduce her as a genius painter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh as I looked at Yuri. Smiling happily and wasting her life away, her talent deserved better than this.</span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri and I used to play together since we were little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing how much I loved to draw even as a preschooler, my parents started sending me to the only art class in the city when I entered elementary school. It wasn’t because they wanted me to become a painter in the future or anything like that, but out of pure parental love for their son to do what he loved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first time I saw art materials, the first time I was taught how to draw by a kind and skilled teacher. I was getting better and better at drawing as time passed. I still now remembered how much I looked forward to the weekly class day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Yuri’s mother, who was worried about her restless child, decided to send Yuri to class too after hearing from my mother. She seemed to have been considering sending Yuri to art classes for a while, since Yuri’s drawings were better than average, but decided against it because of her fickle nature. But then she seemed to change her mind once again when she heard that I also went to art class. Perhaps it was because she thought that having a friend could be a reason for Yuri to keep on drawing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When her mother forced her to come to the school for the trial class, she had been fuming that she didn’t want to learn anything. But when she saw the oil painting book in the instructor’s waiting room, she immediately became entranced. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, despite having no experience with oil painting, Yuri had painted a better apple than anyone else in the classroom, even better than me who had been taking the class three months prior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still remembered the look of astonishment on the teacher’s face at that moment. The look of excitement and anticipation in her eyes, as if she had found a treasure trove. A look of admiration that she never showed to any of us.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:The teacher’s gender isn’t mentioned, only referred to as teacher. ‘She’ here is just an assumption]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri seemed to enjoy the class and soon decided to enroll. After that day, the two of us drew countless pictures. When my teacher saw my drawings, she would say, “You’re very good at staying true to the basics, good job”. In fact, I was confident that I was better than other kids my age, and I even won prizes when I submitted my work to competitions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was always Yuri who drew the pictures of higher appraisal, and it was Yuri who drew the pictures that people would remember, pictures that stuck in people’s minds. Whenever people tried to describe her talent in words, “genius” was the only fitting expression. It was used to a point of being a cliché, a common, yet inevitable expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten years had passed since then, and I had changed my class to the exam course for art school. While I was still going to painting classes, Yuri quitted right when she graduated from junior high school. But even now that she’s gone, the teacher’s eyes continue to follow her. Maybe this feeling of inferiority had been there since that day, her first day at the art class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I was reminiscing about the past on a weekday morning must be because the steam rising from my cup of hot cocoa, soothing me, bringing forth those memories. It was as if the cocoa was trying to lure me back into the world of sleep. With effort, I got up and opened the door, saying, “I’m off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I left the house, I was driven awake by the piercing coldness. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was November, and the first snowfall had already been confirmed. For a high school boy living in a snow country, there was a famous trick to get a hairdo without waxing; just put a little water on your hair and go to school as it was. However, what kind of hairdo you get depends solely on the direction of the wind that day, and furthermore, the effect wears off once you go indoors. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked the long way to school, along the large sidewalk that had been cleared of snow. Then I was called out when I was passing the front of the staff room. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Komiya, is Kashiwazaki coming to club activities today?”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who called me was Hiiragi-sensei, the advisor of the art club that we belong to. The school we attend, Maiei High School, was said to be one of the top three schools in Hokkaido, with a high rate of students entering former imperial universities and famous private universities every year. There were also classes called the “Advanced Course” where the top students were gathered, but unfortunately, there was none for the art department. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite this, the art club that Hiiragi-sensei advised had many members, coming from all over Hokkaido, and ranging from students who simply like to draw to those who were serious about pursuing a career in the field of art.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because Hiiragi-sensei was a renowned painter in the art world, a heretic who had been painting in Paris since graduating from art school because he despised the Japanese competition system. He only came back to his hometown, Maimori City ten years ago to take care of his parents. It was no wonder why so many people wanted to join the Maiei High School Art Club, so that they could be taught by such a great painter. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, oil painting was Hiiragi-sensei’s specialty. Many of his students had won prizes in various competitions of this theme… Besides Yuri, who refused to draw any pictures and thus didn’t contribute to the statistics. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter the students’ enthusiasm, Hiiragi-sensei had a reputation for his ability to develop their personalities and teach them to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. However, when it came to Yuri, he left all the decision making to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know. And why do you have to ask me every time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered without hiding my displeasure, only for him to laugh at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, because you’re her boyfriend, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You already know that I’m not. Aren’t you an advisor, why not just try advicing something to her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I gave her the wrong advice, it would only make the matter worse. You should know that. If anything, you’re my best shot at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed, then said “Got it. You want me to ask her about the Koji Competition right? I’ll tell her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Koji Exhibition Competition, a famous open competition accepting high school students and older. There were no restrictions in terms of theme and technique used, as long as it was two-dimensional. It was said that anyone who wanted to become a painter, to go to art school, or just wanted to test their own ability should try it at least once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The oil painting that I submitted last year didn’t win any prizes, it wasn’t even nominated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thanks a lot. Hmm… since she didn’t participate last year, I really want her to this year… Well then, Komiya, I’m counting on you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiiragi-sensei patted me on the shoulder and left. I let out a sigh as I watched his back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the past few years, Yuri had no enthusiasm or whatsoever for creative activities. Only in the second and third years of junior high school did she really try her hand on summer school assignments, but that was just to get into Maiei High School, the closest and the most convenient for commuting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a well-planned crime. As if on schedule, she won the grand prize in the student art competition for two year in a row and was accepted into the high school by that merit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was one thing she miscalculated. She must have planned to just screw around, but because she was accepted by her art portfolio, she had no choice but to enter the art club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was only natural, wasn’t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, it’s not like Yuri had any admiration for Hiiragi-sensei nor wanted to be taught by him. Every time I remembered that there were people who had been in tears when they knew they weren’t accepted, a childhood friend or not, there was no way I wasn’t indignant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than anything, she had been willing to break her promise with Utako without any reluctance. That was unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the classroom, Yuri was merrilly chatting away with Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino had auburn hair and piercings, a combo clearly violating school regulations, and a layer of makeup to add. And besides her was Yuri, with her long hair she kept because of her laziness to go to the hair salon, her big catlike eyes, and the corners of her mouth that would twerk up mockingly. Two opposite styles, yet oddly fitted together. The ability of humans to adapt and get used to their environment was frightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, Hiiragi-sensei wants to know whether you will participate in the Koji Competition. He really wants you to enter this year, since last year you didn’t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just acting as a messenger, yet Yuri didn’t spare me from that look of complete disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Oh, it’s okay, not that I mind. I’d like to go to a mixer too, Marina. Take me,” said Yuri, completely disregarding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A mixer?! Don’t tell me you seriously think that you know how to be popular just because you spent yesterday reading shoujo manga?” I interjected. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino let out an exasperated sigh. “Mixer? Hmm… I think there’s one upcoming… Usually I wouldn’t invite someone prettier, but if it’s Yuri… No, especially someone as eccentric as Yuri. There’s no way you’d not sour the mood,” she mumbled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, are you envious of me? I won’t blame you, Marina. You and I are of different levels of femininity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where does that confidence come from?! Whatever, I give up. I’m going to a karaoke with the guys from Wada Technical High around next month, tag along if you want to”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised to see that Seino had backed down. I didn’t expect her to actually take Yuri with her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you all right? You’re really taking her with you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just too much trouble telling her not to. I’m not in the mood to argue. And it would be quicker to just show Yuri the reality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once Yuri had made up her mind, she wouldn’t budge, leaving no room for compromise. That was a fact that I, who have known her for a long time or anyone who knew her enough, understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During a summer break when she was ten years old, she once decided that she wanted to live a “self-sufficient life”, so she camped out in a nearby mountain. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone, including me, thought that she would get bored within a day and would return, but she never came back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Panicked, her parents went into the mountain to search for her, only to find her enjoying fishing with her makeshift fishing rod. In the end, Yuri enjoyed a life of survival for four whole days until she finally gave in to the cries and begging of her parents. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: A bizarre girl indeed…]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the winter when she was fourteen, Yuri planned to hitchhike to Tokyo and actually carried it out. She didn’t tell anyone about the plan, knowing well that we would definitely disapprove. Consequently, it led to a huge commotion, even involving the police. The fiasco came to an end when Yuri was found ravenously devouring Nama Yatsuhashi samples at a tourist spot in Kyoto. Yuri’s energy and recklessness brought her not only to Tokyo but even to Kyoto. It even became a hot topic nationwide at that time.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Wait, she did what now?!]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: Nama Yatsuhashi, one of Kyoto’s famous mochi-like souvenir snack]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was amazed and tired of this stupid, stubborn and crazy Yuri, but I find her interesting and… stimulating… to be with her, although it was true that it was taxing, it wasn’t something I cannot handle. It was probably the same story for Seino, which was why they hang out together even though they are of different types.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I really felt sorry for Seino when I thought about the amount of mental suffering she needed to endure at the mixer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I’m still concerned…It’s as if I’m throwing a wild uncontrollable beast into a crowd of people… Yuri, I can’t make you behave properly, I have already given up on that… But still, at least don’t pick fights or use any violence. Do you understand? There are some guys from Wada High who are interested in me, so at least please behave for my sake, will you?” Seino warned with a strong tone, looking into Yuri’s eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I know. I’m going to spend that day as a graceful Yu-chan, no need to fret about it.” She said, seemingly in a very good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never seen Yuri this relaxed before, and I did not think I ever would. My eyes met with Seino. We both shrugged, probably thinking the same thing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You surely don’t know how to choose your man, Marina. I can teach you a thing or two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why are you suddenly acting so high and mighty? You say I don’t know how to choose my man, but you don’t even know a single thing about my lovelife!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know, but I have some guesses. It could be a flirtatious, neutral looking guy, or a guy who looks a little badass but has good manners and says his hobby is dancing, or a band member who’s obviously gobbling up his fans.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can you be so malicious in your predictions? I’ve been crushing on the tough looking guy from “The Fishmen” lately.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Fishmen” was a young comedian duo that was currently on the rise, and I had heard that they’re rapidly gaining popularity among women. The world seemed a smaller place than you might have thought when you found out that someone close to you was one of the world’s influencers. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: In the original version, the duo was called “フィッシュマン” which was treansliteration of “Fisherman”, but for the sake of grammar I changed it to “The Fishermen”]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: It seems that The Fishermen lives in Maimori, and will be a relevant character later]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are funny and I don’t hate them or anything, but&#8230; you’re following the trend. Next year you’ll have forgotten their name.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, shut up! I think they are cool, so don’t judge me, will you?! Then what about you, what kind of guy is your type, Yuri?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have the slightest bit of romantic feelings towards Yuri, but I was genuinely curious to know what kind of man this eccentric woman would prefer as we had never talked about such things before. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Seino’s question, Yuri merely interjected, “Hmm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like someone who doesn’t complain about what I do&#8230; and gives me lots of money when I ask for it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s just an ATM! I don’t think you’re capable of loving someone!” I said. That kind of answer deserved a retort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way… Since they say they’re coming in three, I want to take another girl with me… I wonder who I should invite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grinning, Yuri caught Seino’s hand as she reached for her phone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine with any girl. I don’t care who you bring, they won’t steal any attention from me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is your eyesight bad or something? Go look at yourself in the mirror!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered that when Yuri won a prize in a realistic painting competition, she was described as having extremely observative eyesight. However, that excellent eyesight seemed to only be effective when she was painting, so I couldn’t say for sure… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, objectively speaking, Yuri might be more attractive than average. But because we had been together for so long, my judgment would not be accurate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yuri. I know it’s your first, but you’ll be disappointed if you get carried away by that enthusiasm of yours, you know?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t be swayed even with that ‘I know it all’ tone, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teasing people and sticking tongue out at people like a kid, no one would have believed if we were to introduce her as a genius painter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh as I looked at Yuri. Smiling happily and wasting her life away, her talent deserved better than this.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Komiya-senpai–, otsukaresama–!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Otsukare. Be careful not to hit the canvas bag!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed politely and watched the first-year students leave the art room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Komiya-kun, can you tell Hiiragi-sensei to order some turpentine for me? We’re running out of stock.”</span></p>

<p><b>[TN: Turpentine is used to loosen up paint, as well as to thin paint for under paintings, and it helps to smooth out the brush stroke.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, thanks for noticing. I’ll check and see if there’s anything else that needs ordering and I’ll let him know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said a quick goodbye to a club member of the same grade. He seemed to always notice every detail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Otsukare–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Otsukare. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the head of the club, it was my daily routine to see the members off, one by one, all the while working on my painting. Whether painting a picture or carving a sculpture, art was usually a solitary activity. While we were not that close, the atmosphere was not that bad, and we could get along well enough. I had no complaints to the art club, if you would excuse the problem child, Yuri, and Hiiragi-sensei’s policy of leaving that matter to me… But that did not excuse the headaches they caused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Komiya. The art club won’t be participating in the snow festival this year, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Igarashi asked me as she prepared to leave, her long, almond-shaped eyes peeking out from her wise looking glasses moved to focus on me. She was a girl with a willowy frame that seemed to tumble at the slightest of wind. In contrast to her physique, she was unimaginably willful and headstrong. That characteristic should have created a lot of enemies, but I supposed that her caring and compassionate nature made up for it. I even heard that many of her friends and kouhais adore her.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Kouhai, a word used to refer to </b><b>a younger, more novice or inexperienced person.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven’t heard anything from Hiiragi-sensei as of yet, but I don’t think we will… I’m praying that we don’t have to,” I let out a dry laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Maimori Snow Festival, the biggest event in Maimori. An event to look forward to as a spectator, but no laughing matter when you were involved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Maiei High School art club gathered volunteers to participate in the event every year, at the request of the event director. But volunteers were scarce when the activity involved molding snow outdoors for at least three days in a temperature well below freezing point. It would not be a problem if there were members who were interested in making snow sculptures, but unfortunately, we were all occupied with our own work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the pleas of the club members, Hiiragi-sensei was in the process of asking the director to cancel the compulsory participation in the snow festival this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s good to hear. Well, I’ll be leaving soon. It seems that you’ll be the last one again. I’m sorry, but please take care of the keys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Otsukare, Igarashi. It’s already dark, so take care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too, Komiya. Don’t be too late. Bye–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the empty art room, the temperature dropped. Finally alone, I let my shoulder relax and let out a deep breath in the chilly room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The art club members tended to stay in the art room until late, but since many of them lived far away, I, who lived in this neighborhood, were always the last one remaining. But I still needed to spare some time to return the key to the staff room too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, standing alone in the art room with the irreplaceably unique scent of oil painting wafting in the air, I felt my frustration and anger boil, emotions that could not be good for my mental health. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked away from the canvas I was working on, even for a moment, I found my sight gravitating towards Yuri’s painting at the far end of the room. It was a painting that she had been working on according to the rules of the art club, which required at least one work to be completed in a year. It wasn’t going to be submitted to any competition, worse, to her, it was merely a pastime. No matter how I looked at it, it was an art of great finesse. In front of that astonishing, magnificent, overwhelming picture, whispers slipped my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being so wrapped up by the mixer that she can’t even spare a thought about the art club nor the Koji Competition. That girl…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what I did, I could not help but compare it to my own paintings. Jealousy and inferiority blended together made my heart throb. Making an excuse to myself that I didn’t want it to get dusty, I covered it with a piece of fabric.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does she really think that things could continue like this…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri Kashiwazaki, seventeen years old. A girl with an arrogant and self-centered personality. However, she was nowhere less than the title “genius” when it came to her artistic talent in painting. She had been regarded as a child prodigy for as long as I could remember. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even the towering genius who refused to draw could be triumphed over if you worked hard enough, I believed. And I would be the one who surpassed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was one concern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it came to that, what would I do if Yuri decided to never paint again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell was with her?! How could you be so complicated?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I curled, clutching my head in anguish. I had always wanted to become an even better painter than Yuri, but at the same time, I did not want Yuri to stop painting. Torn between two contradicting wishes, I guessed I was just as complicated as her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To encourage myself, I dug for my phone, snapped a shot of the canvas in front of me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">[In progress. I’ll send it again when it’s finished.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recipient was Utako Kashii. She was finally allowed to have a cell phone at long last when she entered high school. Exchanging messages with her was my only source of solace and revitalization.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was now studying at a prep school in Tokyo. The school was so famous that even I knew its name. To pursue her dream, she was busy with cram school and English conversation classes. And it was no small feat to be continuously ranked first in her grade in such a prestigious school. Those achievements were a testimony of her efforts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was usually quiet and not very self-assured, but she kept true to her words with an immeasurable determination. This was why I fell in love with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She once said, “Studying here is hard, but thanks to this school, my mother was reluctant to move, so that’s good.” It seemed that she moved a few more times even after she moved from Maimori. And she would say ‘It’s my mother’s decision, it couldn’t be helped’ to me, even if it was for work reasons, wasn’t that too much? But I still had yet to know about the details. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, her mother was rigorous, and that value was imprinted into Utako’s mind. To her, what her mother said was absolute, so she obediently followed the rule of not using cellphones in the house. On top of that, her mother didn’t seem to be fond of her time in Maimori, and was somewhat against Utako contacting me or Yuri. So I wasn’t able to have much exchange with her. Few though it was, being able to talk with her strengthened my resolve, it was as if she was here, encouraging me to go on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rolled up my sleeves, letting the chilled air restore my vigilance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The size of the canvases to be submitted to the Koji Exhibition Competition had to be within F20 and F100. The painting I was going to summit was a F30 sized Yezo spruce. I was aiming to create a sharp contrast between the stark white snow and the saturated spruce green. I wasn’t bad at drawing plants, and I thought the judges would appreciate it better if I drew something from Hokkaido.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head, surprised to find myself unintentionally thinking about appealing the judges. Wasn’t it insincere to try to win an award without drawing what you want to draw?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri would never think like this. I was losing to her at this point, weren’t I?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand that reached for the oil paints froze. No. This was not the time to stop. If I stopped now, I would only be farther left behind. My teeth grinded. I wasn’t a genius. No…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart began to trum with frustration, bottled emotions gushing forth–</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Creak.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Startled by the sound of the door opening, my head snapped to the direction of the sound. When I looked up and saw the person who had appeared, I was beyond surprised. Rendered speechless, my troubled mind instantly went blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the rumor that you are always the last one here was true…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, the familiar art room instantly became glamorous the moment she stepped inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was just opening the door and entered the room normally, yet I became agitated, my heart quickening at an unprecedented rate. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sugawara-senpai!? W-why are you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long golden hair, paralleling double eyelids, and slightly drooping eyes. Prominent nose and well-shaped lips. Sleek and slender limbs with a small face. Appearance that screamed that she was from the entertainment industry. Unlike Seino, she wore her makeup gracefully, harmonizing her natural beauty and enhancing her beauty. Thin ornate bracelets on her arm further amplified her allure, giving her a full blown feminine charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner of this dominating presence was Kaede Sugawara Senpai, a highschool third year student, the said “Miracle of Maimori”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino, a fan of hers, told me that Senpai was scouted in Harajuku on a school trip in the second year of middle school, and quickly became a fashion model. She often appeared on the covers of fashion magazines, and was said to be a well-known figure, especially among teenage girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we were from the same school, our school years were different, and on top of that, she was constantly absent from school due to her work in Sapporo and Tokyo, so the chance of us meeting was practically zero. She was a person worthy of the expression “captivating”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there must be no one here, else there’s bound to be misunderstandings. You know, I’m famous.”</span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7jpx9ch/S-12271619.jpg" height="500" width="350" /></>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her statements and mannerisms were brimmed with confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So… you have something to do with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing how carried away I must have seemed, I burned with embarrassment. However, Senpai just smiled at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I’m offering myself to be a model for your painting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I resented my brain’s slow processing speed. All I could do was tilt my head in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? But why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was bewildered, Senpai studied me, then shifted her gaze to the canvas in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to be a model for Yuri.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was caught off guard by this unexpected blow. For a moment, my breath caught. Even someone who seemed to have nothing to do with her mentioned her name?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If that’s so, why don’t you just ask Yuri yourself from the beginning? Yuri painting was a rare phenomenon, it would surely increase your reputation if she suddenly drew you. I think that’s the quickest way to raise your popularity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had planned to inform her rationally, but the next thing I knew, words laden with bitterness spewed. Once lit, the fire of resentment was not something easily extinguished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Popularity? Hmm, I didn’t want to become a model for Yuri Kashiwazaki for such a cheap reason.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai closed the distance then asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m beautiful, aren’t I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I think you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I frankly answered, Senpai nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad you’re so honest. But you know, I’m beautiful and my mother is half Finnish, so I stand out in rural areas like Maimori. Because of that, I was bullied a lot in elementary school. But when I was in the sixth grade, I went on a field trip to an art gallery in Sapporo, and when I saw Yuri’s picture on display, I felt a shiver of excitement. I can’t explain it well… but it made me realize that I should not be ashamed of my individuality, but to use it to my advantage and improve myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the pictures that Yuri drew were awarded and exhibited, so even though I had been drawing with her for a long time, it was difficult to identify which picture she saw. It may seem like a lie or exaggerated story to some, I had no slightest doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most important feature of Yuri’s paintings was that they evoked some kinds of emotions in the viewer, whether it was excitement, shock, anger, sadness, and much more, communicating on a spiritual level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it’s a picture drawn by Yuri.” That was all the explanation needed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just recently found out that the artist who drew such a picture; Yuri, is in this high school. And I didn’t find out until I was about to graduate! I was such an idiot! I’m very thrilled. But…” she trailed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow fell on her bright face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri isn’t drawing anymore, she isn’t even trying to. I can’t let someone who changed me regress like that. She told me to be myself, yet she isn’t true to herself anymore. That’s why I want her to properly draw again… But she’s pretty stubborn, isn’t she. My words haven’t reached her at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… Getting her to draw isn’t that easy. If there’s a secret to get her to draw, I will do anything to know it,” I sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During our years together, for countless times, I had been trying to convince her, but to no avail. So what were the chances of Yuri listening to Senpai?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, I was considering how to get her to draw, that was when I overheard that you’re also trying to get her to draw, aren’t you? If that’s the case, why don’t you draw a picture of me and show it to her to provoke her, litting that fire of passion again? If she sees me as her model, she’ll definitely want to draw me,” Senpai suggested confidently. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could she be that reassured? I became dizzy at the astonishingly egotistical suggestion. She didn’t even consider my willingness nor my circumstances; there was no way Yuri would change her mind with this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’d rather do this alone, I won’t team up with you,” I declined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sure that I was worth no more than a potato to her, and even I had my own pride. No matter how beautiful, or no matter how much she would stare at me, there was no way I would agree on this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? That’s fine for now. But keep in mind that I hate losing. I’ll definitely win you over sooner or later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, I don’t think this is about winning or losing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was expecting for her to either give up or even be angry at my refusal or anything that would leave me alone, yet she just simply backed down for a time being, the fire of determination in her eyes was still aflame. Since I did not want any grudge between us, perhaps waiting for her to give up was the best choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, why did Yuri stop drawing? Did she find something more interesting than drawing or something?” asked Senpai, ever again peering at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… She’s just playing around and doing stupid things. She’s going to a mixer for the first time this Saturday and so she’s unusually excited and apprehensive. She’s a curious being. I think she’s more into the prospect of experiencing new things than getting a boyfriend,” I scoffed, failing to contain the derision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I noticed that what I said was a mistake, for Senpai’s eyes gleamed. It was now too late to take that back, it seemed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s going to a mixer? I’m really curious to see what that genius looks like in front of a guy! Let’s trail after her!” she declared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words of refusal never had a chance to leave my mouth as my cheeks were squashed between Senpai’s hands.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:The fact that there’s no illustration for this scene is a crime]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Senpai, why ask when you’re forcing me anyway…’ I complained silently. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I was forced to stalk Yuri to the mixer.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the day arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, November 24th. Today was the day of the mixer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, here they are! Somehow, I’m starting to get nervous too!” exclaimed Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai… Could you keep your voice down? You’re already conspicuous just as you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the rendezvous, in front of a station, Yuri and Seino stood, and not far behind were us, trailing after them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Seino was covered in makeup like usual, she did not wear her usual flashy dress. Instead, she wore knitted one piece with black tights, an outfit specialized in attracting men. On the other hand, Yuri was dressed in her everyday clothes, her usual down jacket and jeans. If I were to judge from her outfit, her enthusiasm to get a boyfriend was non-existent. Worry crept in. She wouldn’t go ballistic if she didn’t get attention from them, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri’s as dull as ever, and Seino’s really into this, isn’t she?” I mumbled “By the way, isn’t there supposed to be another person? Who did Seino invite…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, maybe it’s a last minute cancellation? Seino-chan seems to be raging on the phone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even from a distance, it was clear that Seino was fuming. She then lowered the phone, then turned to talk with Yuri, all the while pouting. It was almost time but the third member still hadn’t showed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to jump in. For the sake of my cute juniors!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please stop, Senpai! The guys will undoubtedly be overjoyed, but definitely not the girls. Seino might even cry, and Yuri would be in a sour mood for days!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they would be taking it out on me. So please spare me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m joking,” Senpai grinned. “Yuri, what a waste… What kind of shirt is she even wearing–. Seeing her makes me want to lecture her on fashion! Hmm, what kind of clothes do you want your date to wear?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Well… ‘Anything she wants to’ is too honorable an answer… I’ll go with clothes with a fluffy feeling. If it’s a date, then I definitely want her to wear a skirt…What’s that look on your face, Senpai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you like that kind of simple girlish clothes, then why didn’t you just say so when we met up,” she accused sulkily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai was dressed in simple black skinny pants and a white coat, probably aiming to be indistinct, for her original style could be recognized from a mile away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do I still have to remind you that you’re beautiful no matter what you wear?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case couldn’t you just say sooo— Ah, I think those guys are here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the distance, three men called out to Seino. They were thin, handsome, and stylish, with refreshing smiles to add to their charm. As a person of the same sex, I could sense an aura of “These guys are definitely popular with women.” radiating. When I heard that they were from a technical high school, I imagined that they would be more unfamiliar with women. Oh, how the tables had turned.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Sousuke, you know, as a technical highschool student, I’m quite offended]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have known that these guys were handsome. Afterall, the ikemen obsessed Seino said she was interested in them, there was no way they were not handsome.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: “Ikemen”, Japanese slang for attractive men.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a quick chat, the five of them started walking to a karaoke bar near the station. As I watched them enjoying themselves and laughing on the way, I began to feel like an idiot. Why did I have to chase after Yuri like this, even for something other than painting? Why didn’t I just paint while she frolicked? Why was the sight of her enjoying herself so, so irritating?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Senpai. I’m… going home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! Wait! Wait a minute! Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I hurried away, the bustle of the city faded into nothing, nothing but me and this frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring came late in Hokkaido.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time I was annoyed. Before, I hadn’t really paid attention to it before, thinking it was normal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was snowing on the day I said goodbye to her, in the silvery white world. I couldn’t help but feel that it would be better if I could see her off in the midst of the blooming cherry blossoms. But because of that promise, I was able to contain this suffocating feeling of being without her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so began my sixth grade without Utakoko. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being elected as the president of the student council, my schedule became occupied, but I always made sure that I had time to draw. However, it was obvious that Yuri was spending less and less time drawing. When she found something that she wanted to paint, she would forget about everything. But now, she tended to take a break from painting classes, and she even seems to be avoiding drawing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, you are low on motivation lately, aren’t you? What’s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really. I just draw whenever and whatever I want to, is that wrong?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I had said something wrong, and she wouldn’t talk to me that day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard through my mother that there are lots of people who have been actively urging Yuri to enter competitions lately. When It came to this, Yuri was quite defiant, refusing to bend to even art gallery directors or any big names. But the more stubborn she was, the more stubborn they became. I was sure she would be stressed out by all the adults pestering her with their demands in all kinds of ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart fluttered with anxiety. Maybe because I was her childhood friend who understands her more than most, I had a hunch that this would all turn wrong.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the winter break of my sixth-grade year, we entered the “Children’s Future Painting Contest”, a contest aimed for elementary school students. I didn’t qualify, while; Yuri got the first prize. </span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though disqualified, I was taken to the Sapporo Art Museum as Yuri’s friend. I couldn’t help but mutter “Wow” when I saw Yuri’s painting, which stood out among the numerous outstanding entries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri’s F20 canvas was displayed in a noticeable area of the museum. No, I don’t think it was just the location that made it stand out. The fact that the piece was also eye-catching was a testament to Yuri’s ability again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the artist who drew such a touching picture seemed to be in a very sour mood. She was being photographed by a lot of cameramen, and even though she was dressed in beautiful garments, she had an impassive look on her face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My stomach began to churn with worry as I wondered if there was something wrong, but then I heard our painting teacher talking to a very high-profile old man. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He smiled at Yuri, but I found his smile strangely physiologically unpleasant. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The next thing I want you to do is to draw a picture of a marine creature for the Environmental Art Exhibition at the end of the year. and also emphasize the concept of ’freedom’. You know, the head judge, Mr. Takashima loves marine life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might be the only one who noticed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last glimmer of light disappeared from Yuri’s eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in that moment, the carefree Yuri noticed the irony of the chain of so-called “freedom”.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> My suspicions had come true. From that day on, Yuri wouldn’t pick up the paintbrush by herself anymore. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why aren’t you painting? Are you saying you’re tired of painting? What about the promise you made to Utako?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it would be counterproductive if people nagged her to draw because of her carefree and self-centered personality, so at first, I just kept an eye on her. But after two months without drawing a single picture, I had to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do I need to tell you, Sousuke? Do you want that promise to become chains that further bind me?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sneered at me; her expression colder than I had ever seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep telling you to draw no matter what you’ll think of me. And I’ll do this until you can enjoy drawing again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri left without replying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even now, I was still chasing after the look of pure joy she used to have when she’s drawing, and the brilliant paintings she breathed life into. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the letters I regularly received from Utako, she wrote that she was studying hard to make her dreams a reality. Every time I heard from her, I became irritated by the fact that Yuri had tried to break her promise. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so frustrated that while I’m trying to get better at painting every day, I still got less appreciation than Yuri who refused to even hold a paintbrush.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our relationship had become strained by our complicated emotions, and our relationship stayed that way all the way to our second year of junior high school.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I got home, flipped open my sketchbook in hope of shaking off the lingering frustration in my heart. Alas, my brain seemed to refuse to work, so I tried to let my hands guide me, yet the pictures drawn were unsatisfactory. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to grab a drink from the refrigerator in need of refreshing myself when I felt my phone vibrating. Normally, I would ignore an incoming call from an unknown number, yet my chest was filled with a foreboding sense as my fingertip pressed the answer button. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Hi, it’s Kaede. I’m sorry for calling so suddenly. I got your number from Seino-chan. Are you available?”&#8211;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sugawara-senpai!? What happened!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a quick glance at the clock. It was 2 p.m., just two hours since Yuri and Seino met the guys from Wada Technical High. According to the schedule, they should be at the karaoke by now. I wonder if there was any trouble… No, please don’t. But it was too late, with that thought, the feeling of unease had set in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Actually…”&#8211;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From Senpai’s summary, it appeared that during the karaoke, Yuri upset the guys and got into a fight with Seino. Then Senpai who had seen the situation decided to jump in and dial an SOS to me.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing the call with Senpai, I headed to a family restaurant near the karaoke bar. When I arrived at the restaurant, Yuri was not there, and the only person I could see was Seino, who was red-eyed while holding her cheek in a grimace, and Senpai, who shot me a troubled smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry for being so sudden. I just happened to find these cute juniors in a tight spot, there’s no way I would leave them, right? But I’m hardly someone who could settle this matter, so I thought I’d ask you, a good friend of theirs, to help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai shot me a look, probably for me to keep silent about trailing them. Hmm…So that was the story she told Seino…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about Yuri?” I asked Seino, trying to get a better grasp of the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She went back… I don’t know, I don’t care about her anymore,” she sniffled, her eyes fixed at the table. The area below her eyes was streaked black with eyeliner. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This was going to be complicated,’ I sigh inwardly as I took a seat beside Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino fell into silence and dejectedly stirred her melon soda with the straw. I wouldn’t lose in this contest of end</span><span style="font-weight: 400">urance. Even </span><span style="font-weight: 400">if she swore or ignored</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> me, I w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould keep asking her until she answered. If she really wished to be alone, then she could leave anytime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve always liked Touma-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there was no way I would know, right? Yet Seino glared at me..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The guy with yaeba teeth who organized the mixer today with me! You know, I’m more of the flashy type than girly… But Touma-kun treated me like a girl. He’s always ladies first, his manners are also gentlemanly.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Yaeba teeth are considered attractive in Japan.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the mention of Touma-kun, Seino’s expression softened for a moment, then tensed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Yuri… She beated up Touma-kun and the others,” said Seino. Casting her eyes down while squeezing the straw, her voice trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?&#8230; Really!?” It was as if blood drained from my veins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Touma-kun’s group left in anger… And when I asked Yuri why she hit them, she just said, ‘They were annoying, that’s all’. Could you believe that!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice grew louder and more heads turned to our direction, but Seino paid no heed and went on. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why was she always like that!? Why couldn’t she care about any of my concerns? Why couldn’t she support her friend’s love at all!?” she wailed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I listened quietly, I noticed something wrong. It was true that Yuri was self-centered and impulsive, but there was no way she would hurt her friend’s emotion without a good reason. If Seino considered it logically, I was sure she would have also noticed this, but I guessed it was her right to feel devastated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a reason for Yuri’s actions, this was not wishful thinking, but a logical conclusion drawn from our long relationship. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, could you accompany Seino? I don’t want to leave her alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure got some nerve, ordering me like that… But well, yeah. Remember you owe me one this time,” replied Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood. I’ll definitely repay later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai’s lips formed a grin. A favor, money, whatever was fine by me. I was just going to do what I was supposed to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no use in staying here and comforting Seino, my words wouldn’t reach her anyway, not like this. I couldn’t relate to her, I couldn’t give her the words she needed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I,&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to go talk to Yuri. I’m sure there’s a reason for this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I rose, Seino said in a low voice, “Tell her… Tell her I don’t know her anymore! This is the end of our friendship, you idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vocabulary was poor, but her cold tone sent shivers down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll tell her. She is really an idiot.”</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the family restaurant, I tried to call Yuri a few times, but she did not respond. I also sent her a message asking, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where are you?”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, which was also ignored. And when I checked at her house, she was not there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What on earth was she doing? Deciding to search the shopping district again, I once again headed to the station. On my way, I saw a lone girl walking. Since we were going in opposite directions, the distance between us shortened. The moment I could clearly identify her outline, colors drained from my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri!? Hey, are you okay!?” I gasped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fresh bruises dotted her face and limbs, especially on the back of her right hand, which was disturbingly swollen. Driven by panic, I reached for her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The guys from Wada High?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but it’s no big deal. I’m not the kind of person who gets beaten up by those little bastards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino said that Yuri was beating the guys one sidedly, but apparently it turned out to be a fistfight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those guys, they were nothing but a bunch of cowards. When I hit them one by one at karaoke, they acted like they were the victims and quickly left, but as soon as I left Marina, the three of them tried to beat me up. There was no weapon involved and they were just a bunch of scrawny brats who weren’t even used to fighting. Well, I did have a hard time, but in the end, they were just as injured as me, so I guess I didn’t lose!” she claimed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why… Why do you have to be that hasty!? How many times do I have to tell you to think before you go around, causing all sorts of trouble!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph! So you are just like Marina. Yes, yes, I’m sorry, I promise I’ll behaveee,” said Yuri mockingly, “Are you satisfied now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What’s with that sarcasm! I was worried about you–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” she cut in, “What you are worried about is my hand, isn’t it? You are worrying about it being a permanent damage that would hinder my drawing ability. It would be boring if your oh-so-mighty opponent became handicapped, wouldn’t it?” she scoffed, “Sousuke, all you ever cared about was my talent, not me. Isn’t that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell was that? Really? That was not true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that I was concerned with her right hand, but after all, it was her dominant hand. It was also true that I had been complicating the matter by keeping urging her to draw. But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was not how I felt right then. It was something genuine, a sincere feeling from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, how did I convey it to her? If I were a baby, I would probably cry and try to get her to understand me, but unfortunately, I was not a baby anymore. I wanted to make her understand, but I was too frustrated to convey it to her properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I seized her shoulders, and in the middle of the road, uncaring of the stares, I shouted. </span></p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vZFTrpx/S-12869635.jpg" height="500" width="350" /></>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m begging you, stop putting yourself in danger! No matter what, you’re still a girl!” I cried. I knew she hated those words, but still, I just couldn’t let her throw herself into danger. “What were you even thinking, picking a fight with three men!? Promise me you won’t do this again. I’m so worried, Yuri, I’m so worried&#8230; Could you please think about my feelings a little?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri might not understand how I felt, but that did not matter. I might need to be more watchful of her later on, but if that could keep her from danger, then so be it. As long as something like this would not happen in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I heard was an unexpected word. When I blinked in surprise, Yuri looked away sheepishly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What did you just say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said I’m sorry! I’m done with fights… No, I’m done with anything that would make you worry… Uh, Sousuke, aren’t these kinds of lines said with gender reversed? Isn’t the girl supposed to cry? Why are you on the verge of tears?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That sheepish attitude lasted only a moment. In an eyeblink, she was back to her mischievous self. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-shut up, you idiot! It’s good that you finally understand!&#8230;But I’m not here to lecture you, I want you to know that… I just want you to make up with Seino. Can you tell me what happened at the karaoke?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing. Really,” she insisted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, before that, we need to get you to the hospital.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled her by the hand and took her to a local orthopedic clinic, but it was closed on Saturday afternoons. If I let her home, I was sure her mom would be horrified, so I decided to give her first aid at my place. I wouldn’t consider it cool to remember the procedures by rote from years of patching up Yuri. At this point, I might just as well become a field medic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cool those swollen monstrosities on your right hand and left cheek with the cooling pack in the fridge. Since you are talking normally… at least by your standards… there shouldn’t be any concussions,” I joked, solely for calming myself, “But we are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">going to the hospital later. Understood?” I stressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, I understanddd.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say thank you.” I poked her lightly on the head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh! I’m dying!” She fell down on the bed in an exaggerated manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;An hour after we reached the karaoke… When I came out of the bathroom, I saw the yaeba guy and guy with piercings in the other room smoking cigarettes,” she bagan, her eyes wandered the ceiling, focusing on nothing, “I thought they were so tone-deaf or something so they booked a separate room to practice before singing in front of us, so I tried to sneak in and make fun of them, but… karaoke rooms are supposed to be soundproofed, right? But these guys were talking so loud that you can still hear their voices even with the door just slightly open.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did they say?”</span></p>l

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Wasn’t there s’posed to be another girl coming, what a bummer.’ ’Might as well find another girl.’ ‘Yeah. That Yuri’s definitely a pass, her face’s pretty’n all, but she’s no woman. Did you hear her grumble? She could just as well be my grandma. When I said she’s no woman, I meant she just wouldn’t do it.’,” quoted Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? What’s wrong with them!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then they just talked like they are going to do it with Marina instead,” recalled Yuri. She continued without wavering, but from her tone, she was definitely seething. “’When I tried her out, could you believe it, she’s definitely a virgin! Virgins sure are exhilarating, but well, there’s little mess cleaning up, they sure are clingy.’ Then they laughed. They </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">laughed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. When they start planning about getting her drunk and then… And then I barged in and beated the hell out of those scumbags, one by one. They were surprised, so beating them was super easy. Then they acted like a victim, showered us with their lame curses and left. That was it. See? Just some crappy story.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a surprise that she couldn’t control her temper. Even I myself felt infuriated at their vulgar behavior, but that didn’t mean retaliation was good either. If I were in that situation, making sure no harm would befall Yuri and Seino would be my top priority, not revenge. But since things were at it was now, with Yuri in the wrong for punching them first, we were clearly at a disadvantage if the matter were to complicate further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With fists clenched, controlling my anger, I asked Yuri, “Yuri, what are you going to do now? If you want to go make up with Seino, I’ll go with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, there’s no getting back together. I don’t feel the slightest regret hitting those guys. I’m not going to apologize to Marina. You know I hate apologizing,” said Yuri, bringing her gaze to me, “That one earlier was the first and the last time I’m going to say sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Regret that to your dying day that you didn’t record it,” she added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apologizing was definitely not a matter of liking or hating. This girl was all about living a carefree and unrestrained life, but she wouldn’t talk about her true feelings when it mattered most. How could she be so twisted?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that what you want? Like this? Seino’s cutting you off, you know?” I repeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Marina’s fond of that yaeba guy right? What’s the point of disillusioning? What’s the point of telling her that her crush was actually planning to feed her alcohol and make her do it?” Yuri let out a mirthless laugh, dropping her gaze. “She surely has no eye for choosing boys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she surely has an eye for choosing friends. Isn’t that true?” I asked the door for its approval.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did not approve of her use of violence, but the care and her willingness to protect her friend was praiseworthy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Yuri’s eyes snapped, the corners of my mouth lifted. Wearing her trademark “devil’s smile”, I revealed, “’Regret that to your dying day that you didn’t record it.’, wasn’t it? Well it was a shame that I didn’t… But I’m recording something even more embarrassing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What are you talking about, Sosuke?” A hint of impatience fell on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well? What do you two think?” I repeated to the door again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri sprang up, eyes wide with surprise as the door opened, revealing Sugawara-senpai and Seino. “Seriously!?” she whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri had been unwilling to tell Seino about the yaeba guy, but it was all laid bare. Before I left the family restaurant, I had told Seino that there was more to Yuri’s action. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Afterall, you can’t be honest in front of Seino, can you? That’s why I sent Seino a message to come here and called her just before you began your confession.” I patted the lump of my phone in the breast pocket. “What a timely appearance, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this plan would have been impossible if Seino didn’t really want to make up with Yuri, for she could just not come here. To add, from the family restaurant to here was quite a distance, but she took the trouble to come here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unbelievable… I hate it when I’m the one to be fooled,” she whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeated, Yuri once again fell onto the bed, staring at the ceiling blankly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, um… I… You are right, I don’t know how to choose a man!” Admitted Seino, taking a few steps towards Yuri. “I’m planning to watch some romance movies as a future reference… Want to join me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino was definitely trying to get back with Yuri. C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">urious, I wondered wha</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t would the stubborn Yuri do? Would she accept it, would she refuse? Nervously, I stood there, anticipating her answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll choose the movie. Marina’s movie choices are always boring.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Yuri turned to face Seino, her white teeth shining.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino went straight from my house to crash at Yuri’s house, so I took the responsibility of taking Sugawara-senpai to the station. I was not their parents nor their guardian, but what was this crushing worry when they got caught in trouble?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Matching Senpai’s pace, I accompanied her along the darkened footpath. The November sun had long since retreated, and countless stars twinkled in its stead. My mind wandered to Utako every time my gaze fell upon those glittering stars. Her clear eyes when she eagerly told tales about how the countless stars existed in the universe, and how only four thousand could be observed from the best spot on Earth.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like stars? You’ve been staring at it for a while.” Senpai poked my cheek, tugging me back to reality.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? I like stars?&#8230; Yeah, I like them… Senpai, let me apologize one more time; I’m sorry for involving you with this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seino-chan’s maidenly expression, Yuri’s loyalty, and… how you can be counted on in times of need. Personally, it was a bunch of interesting discoveries! So you don’t need to apologize–. But professionally, that was kind of a waste of my valuable time, so be sure to repay me later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It appeared that Senpai didn’t seem to mind this mess of a mixer. As I breathed out a sigh of relief, the traffic light turned red. As I came to a halt, Senpai leaned in and softly whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On top of that… you seem to like Yuri a lot more than I imagined. Well, I’ll be teasing you with this for a while, okay?” teased Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait, Senpai. You’re misunderstanding something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! The signal turned green. Let’s cross!” Said senpai, disregarding me. She hopped across nimbly, her long golden hair flowing after her. As I worried about the troubles this misunderstanding could bring, as if to blow away my worries, Senpai flashed me a jubilant grin. “Until now, I only cared about Yuri…‘Let’s use him to get Yuri to draw!’ was my impression of you… but now I want to get to know you a little bit better!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came to a stop at the ticket gate, then turned to me, her sight fixed at my eyes. “Sousuke, after all, let me be a model for your painting. I’m curious to see how you would paint me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing myself reflected in her eyes, I realized that now, I was more than a mere stranger to her.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As do I, through today, I had learned more about her as a person. The urge to draw her, to capture her beauty, her personality, to depict a person named Sugawara-senpai onto the canvas, sprouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, I would like to make a formal offer…Please be a model for my painting. We are taking down Yuri.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thrusted out my fist, Senpai cheerfully bumped hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never once have I failed in achieving the goals I set. And this time is no exception; I’ll definitely get Yuri painting again!” affirmed Senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I owe you one today, Senpai. I’m going to make Yuri draw whatever you want in return.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah–, nope. That was for another occasion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had always been fighting in this battle alone… until now. “I’ll definitely get Yuri drawing”– At that word, the burden I carried lessened. The stubborn Senpai would be my comrade in this battle. Little though it was, she took a weight off my shoulders.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Komiya, is Kashiwazaki coming to today’s club activity?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know. Why do you have to always ask me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During lunch break, on my way back from the canteen, I was stopped by Hiiragi-sansei again. In response, I gave him a full display of my grumpy face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to confirm her intention to participate in the Kouji Exhibit… But that could be done later. Today, I want to inform you about the art club’s participation in the Maimori Snow Festival,” he confessed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!? We are participating!? I thought we already agreed not to participate this year! You know how much of a chore it is, and you promised us that you would talk to the director!” I complained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiiragi-sensei heastated, then began, “I know it sounds like an excuse, but I did talk to the director about it. It was the biggest event in Maimori, so no, it’s impossible… Well, since there is nothing we could do about it, let’s do our best together! So you’ll attend the raffle drawing in December, discuss and submit the proposal, and participate in the technical training session. That’s your duty, club leader.” With that, Sensei quickly left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again? Yuri’s matter, the Kouji Exhibition, and now the Snow Festival?</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathed out a tired sigh as I returned to the classroom, noting Yuri and Seino vociferously eating their lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Marina, I heard that people who snore a lot often have problems with nasal cavities, so why don’t you sleep with a nose hook? You know, there are all kinds of choices on the Internet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you not say that I snore with that volume!? And in the middle of the class of all places!? Also, I just don’t think that snoring would just magically disappear with a nose hook!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled up a chair right beside them while retorting ’You’re just as loud, Seino,’ silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“High school girls who talk proudly about snoring? I could already foretell how your next mixer’s going to turn out.” I chimed in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m tired of that mixer stuff. I’m beloved by everyone like “Monomon” anyway. I realized that I don’t need to go to any mixer, I’m busy accepting the outpouring love from everyone just as I am,” puffed Yuri. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To equate herself with “Monomon”, a cute two-headed animal character with round eyes and a heart-shaped tail…How ridiculous could she be?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You dare compare yourself to that super famous anime mascot? That statement alone could cause a crusade, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my gibe, Yuri was in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s still fine if I’m not loved nationwide. Afterall, wide and shallow affection is no match for profound and passionate love. Yeah, I’m more of this type,” she nodded to herself.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did the mixer bestow you with some peculiar sense of confidence? How did you even gain confidence from that disaster of a mixer?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? At least you’re passionate about me, right?” she cocked her head, seemingly genuinely surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I choked on my bread at that statement. What have I just done? By that reaction, Yuri would just get even more carried away. Seino’s sympathetic gaze that stung me from the side also didn’t help. I would probably get teased for the rest of my life for my frantic follow up after the mixer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Should I tell Utako about this? But she always likes me more than Sousuke. I’m sure she’d say something like, ‘I’m so happy that my two favorite people got together.’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slurped the strawberry milk Yuri offered, flushing the choking bread down along with it. I could finally breathe again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! You’re not doing that! Hmph! I’ll sent a message to Utako, so that she wouldn’t misunderstand that fantasy of yours” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But a message from Utako had already appeared on my phone’s screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I like your drawings. Looking forward to seeing the finished version!]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri, whose painting guarantees acclamation, would never understand how much encouragement this short message had given me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The world was unfair. Talent, something people who yearned for would never be granted, and something those who wielded it never know its true worth. But it was not entirely bad, being an ordinary person did have its own perks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri, Hiiragi-sensei’s asking you about today’s club activity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Hey. Don’t pretend to be calm. I know you’re embarrassed. Be prepared, I’ll tease you with this embarrassing piece of information.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Yuri teased me, no matter how you looked at her, she seemed forever free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even now, her painting at the art club room was still covered.</span></p>
