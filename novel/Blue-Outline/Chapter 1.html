<h1>Chapter 1: Our September</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Autumn spoke, “Even though they are right next to each other, they can’t touch.”</p>



<p>Summer chuckled and said, “It’s because September, the lonely one, is being mean again.”</p>



<p>No, that’s not quite right.</p>



<p>──Actually, it’s about trying to rewind Spring, before Winter giving an answer.</p>



<p>When crossing the threshold of September, everyone becomes a little lost. It was while I was dressed in my school uniform after a long time that this thought occurred to me.</p>



<p>Just like how Summer ended like a deflated paper balloon that was launched repeatedly with small palms, Autumn wouldn’t begin immediately by picking it up and inflating it again.</p>



<p>It was like being on a see-saw alone.</p>



<p>Everyone secretly spreads their arms while riding the board of uncertainty between August and October. It was like a temporary rest period where we tried to bridge the gap or brace ourselves to avoid taking sides and find a compromise.</p>



<p>That colorless moment was just right for me now.</p>



<p>As if squeezing out several vibrant colors of paint onto a palette, and wondering which one to use with a heart full of excitement or hesitation.</p>



<p>In the midst of the constantly changing seasons, it’s nice to have a moment to stop and take a deep breath.</p>



<p><em>Knock, clack.</em></p>



<p><em>Knock, clack.</em></p>



<p>Even so, a sound that should not be heard echoed in the distance.</p>



<p>Surely, it was someone who still didn’t want things to end or be dyed.</p>



<p>──In order to ambiguously reconsider.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>I strolled along the riverbank, admiring the glistening water’s refreshing allure, which was reminiscent of an album’s pages. The soft, short-sleeved shirts of the passersby fluttered in the breeze.</p>



<p>The lush greenery and the slightly sticky morning sun, accompanied by the persistent buzz of cicadas, created an unchanging scenery that seemed to mistake yesterday’s end-of-July ceremony for today’s. However, in the distance, the sky had shifted slightly, and the light footsteps of the first-years, who were comfortably strolling in their well-worn loafers, provided an undeniable reminder of the passage of time.</p>



<p>As I placed my hand on my mouth to stifle a yawn, a voice called out to me from behind.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>I felt a tap on my shoulder from behind.</p>



<p>Without turning around to check, I simply turned my head towards my right shoulder and responded.</p>



<p>“Morning, Yua.”</p>



<p>As if gently accepting my greeting with both hands, Yua’s calm profile lined up next to me.</p>



<p>“You let out a big yawn. Are you sleep deprived from the first day?”</p>



<p>“Nah, I slept like a log. My body’s still in summer vacation mode, though.”</p>



<p>“Did you finish your homework?”</p>



<p>“Of course, I even looked up the weather for my diary entry.”</p>



<p>“You’re still the same old Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>While chopping up a conversation that felt like a warm-up exercise for the second semester, I couldn’t help but feel restless. I looked over to Yua who had been fidgeting with her hair at the edge of my vision since earlier.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry too much, your hair looks fine. There’s no bedhead.”</p>



<p>When I teased her, she finally turned to face me and pouted, “Of course not. I make sure to check myself in the mirror before leaving home.”</p>



<p>We both knew there was an awkwardness lingering between us. Meeting each other’s gaze made us inexplicably shy, and we tried to compensate by being overly talkative. Yet, our interactions were as innocuous as the softest cotton that could be blown away with a single breath. There was a sense of impatience in the pauses between our exchanges too.</p>



<p>I was more than aware of the reason behind it.</p>



<p>Yua, who had regained her composure, continued, “Did you have breakfast?”</p>



<p><em>However…</em></p>



<p>“I grilled the dried fish you picked out at the market.”</p>



<p>“O-oh, really? Was it good?”</p>



<p>I felt a twinge of guilt as she stuttered her words. </p>



<p>“Yeah, thanks to you, I’ve actually started to like fish a little more recently.”</p>



<p>I didn’t want to be unaware of her feelings, so I gave her an honest answer.</p>



<p>I couldn’t forget the time that this girl had given me. In order to face someone’s feelings, as well as my own, I didn’t want to be oblivious.</p>



<p>Yua’s lips curved into a bashful smile as she lowered her gaze, “I guess we have to go grocery shopping again soon.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, we should. Let’s get more meat next time.”</p>



<p>“You’re already saying that…”</p>



<p>It felt good to walk down this familiar path with her again, side by side. In my heart, I silently whispered ‘thank you’ to the person next to me, which I couldn’t put into words. </p>



<p>As we walked slowly together, I felt like I could hear the soft sound of saxophones drifting in from afar, melding together into a seamless harmony.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>As soon as we passed through the school gate, we saw a group of three standing in front of the stairs.</p>



<p>Yua and I exchanged glances before approaching them. It seemed they spotted us too, as Kaito was the first to greet us.</p>



<p>“Yo!”</p>



<p>Kazuki, who was standing beside him, greeted us with a nod, and Kenta casually spoke up.</p>



<p>“Good morning, King and Uchida-san!”</p>



<p>We joined their circle and responded.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Asano-kun, Mizushino-kun, Yamazaki-kun.”</p>



<p>I also slightly raised my hand in response, “Yo, what’s up with you guys? Did you all go to school in a group?”</p>



<p>“No way!” After saying that, Kaito slung his arm around my shoulder, “I just happened to see Kazuki and Kenta on the way and called out to them.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not like I’m particularly happy about this coincidence.”</p>



<p>“What’s the matter, Saku? Are you jealous?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say something that sounds so disgusting, even as a joke.”</p>



<p>As I brushed off his sweaty arm, I couldn’t help but smile wryly, thinking that Kaito was probably trying to be considerate in his own way. Perhaps this level of liveliness was just what we needed for a fresh start after we’ve each landed a punch on each other.</p>



<p>Kazuki, who was watching us from the side, had a provocative smile on his face.</p>



<p>“Well, well. Looks like you two don’t mind showing off this morning, despite what happened.”</p>



<p>Before I could even retort, Yua smiled sweetly and replied, “Oh, is there any problem, Mizushino-kun?”</p>



<p>Her voice was so icy that even Kazuki seemed taken aback, he was fidgeting uncomfortably and avoiding her gaze as he scratched his cheek.</p>



<p>“Well, uh, from a couple of guys perspective like us, it’s envy-worthy, right, Kenta?”</p>



<p>“I don’t want that kind of bombshell thrown at me, personally,” Kenta deadpanned, earning a chorus of laughter from the group.</p>



<p>“Hoo boy, you really messed up early in the new school term, Kazuki,” Kaito laughed, clutching his stomach.</p>



<p>“Don’t upset Uchida-san, Mizushino. She can be scary,” Kenta added with a weary expression.</p>



<p>Yua blinked in surprise this time, “Um, Yamazaki-kun, is that how you really see me?”</p>



<p>Kenta waved his hands in a panic, explaining quickly, “N-no, I didn’t mean it in a weird way! It’s just that, even though you’re always calm and gentle, Uchida-san, even King can’t raise his head when you get serious, so I figured you must be the type who’s really strict when it counts…”</p>



<p>“Enough! That’s not helping at all!” </p>



<p>I couldn’t help but smile at their amusing banter.</p>



<p>“That’s right, Kenta. You better be careful not to upset Yua,” I chimed in.</p>



<p>“Saku-kun?”</p>



<p>“…Because you might end up getting squeezed tight like this,” I imitated the motion with my hands, and everyone burst out laughing again.</p>



<p>It was a familiar sight, yet somehow refreshing all the same.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>We headed to the classroom together as a group.</p>



<p>That door, which I passed through like running away from everyone on that evening, somehow felt nostalgic now.</p>



<p><em>“Bye, everyone. See you next semester.”</em></p>



<p>I left behind those words that I knew I could never take back and left them here.</p>



<p><em>“──Bye, Saku. See you next semester,” </em></p>



<p>Yuuko picked them up and returned them to me before the end of the summer vacation.</p>



<p>If she hadn’t overwritten them with warm colors, my step into the classroom would have been tangled with somewhat complex emotions.</p>



<p>“Good morning,” I said, slightly hopeful that she might have arrived already.</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s Chitose-kun. Morning!”</p>



<p>The voice that answered me wasn’t quite what I had expected. Nazuna, who was in the middle of the classroom, waved her hands cheerfully.</p>



<p>“Good morning, guys!”</p>



<p>Even though we hadn’t seen each other since the end of last term, it didn’t feel like it had been so long as we had just video-called each other recently.</p>



<p>Yua and the others returned the greetings casually and made their way to their seats.</p>



<p>I stopped for a moment and said again, “…Hey, good morning.”</p>



<p>Nazuna, who had approached me by then, tilted her head mischievously, </p>



<p>“Huh? Chitose-kun, did you mistake me for Yuuko?”</p>



<p>“Why would I?”</p>



<p>“Wow, your reaction was too quick. It doesn’t seem genuine.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t think that.”</p>



<p>“Aw, if that’s the case, your lack of reaction is just disappointing.”</p>



<p>“Okay, okay, Saku-kun is happy to see you again, Nazuna-chan.”</p>



<p>“Is it just me, or have you become more indifferent towards me after the summer vacation?”</p>



<p>I smiled wryly. <em>That’s right.</em></p>



<p>Nazuna had helped out with baseball practice and even came to watch my game. And more than anything, she had laughed with Yuuko and Nanase the other day.</p>



<p>I couldn’t just treat her like any other classmate now.</p>



<p>Nazuna seemed to have said what she wanted to say and was about to end the conversation, but then she narrowed her eyes as if she suddenly remembered something.</p>



<p>“I think Yuuko will be a little late today.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t ask, though,” I replied, causing Nazuna to give a short chuckle and leave, looking satisfied.</p>



<p>As I watched her slender figure walk away, I called out to Atomu’s bored-looking back.</p>



<p>“Yo, Atomu!”</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>Oi, at least look over here.</p>



<p>Atomu just lifted his hand lightly without even turning around, so I shrugged my shoulders lightly.</p>



<p>Well, at least he gave me a response.</p>



<p>As I was hanging Gregory’s backpack on the side of my desk,</p>



<p>“Good morning!”</p>



<p>“Morning.”</p>



<p>I recognized the familiar two voices that reached my ears. The short ponytail in front of me bounced up and down.</p>



<p>“Yo, Mister!”</p>



<p>I recalled a few days ago when Tōdō Mai had called me from Haru’s phone for some reason. The call got cut off midway and I didn’t bother to contact her afterwards.</p>



<p>“So, did you win against the alumni in the end?”</p>



<p>“Nope, I lost.”</p>



<p>Haru’s face was unexpectedly relieved, as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.” I nodded in understanding, but she continued with a mischievous grin.</p>



<p>“But I’ve gotten stronger.”</p>



<p>I was worried about her strange behavior during our phone call, but it seemed like she had figured something out.</p>



<p>Watching her move forward like this, I couldn’t help but feel a little frustrated with myself.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, Tōdō sent a message after that,” I suddenly remembered.</p>



<p>Haru’s eyes widened in surprise, “What? Why?”</p>



<p>“I was hoping you could tell me…”</p>



<p>Judging by her reaction, it seemed like Tōdō had memorized my number and contacted me on her own.</p>



<p>Haru grimaced in annoyance, “So what did she say?”</p>



<p>It wasn’t anything worth hiding, so I read the message out loud.</p>



<p>“‘<em>Hold the man you desire tightly. If he doesn’t turn around, shoot him down♡’</em>“</p>



<p>Before I could even finish, Haru’s eyebrows shot up, “Alright, Haru-chan is going to head over to Ashi High now ♡”</p>



<p>“I don’t really get it, but calm down.”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Is Chitose-kun protecting the beautiful and slender Mai from me?”</p>



<p>“Hey, stop firing randomly like that.”</p>



<p>As we exchanged those words,</p>



<p>“You talk a lot!”</p>



<p>Nanase, who was behind Haru, tugged on her short ponytail. Haru turned around and complained.</p>



<p>“It’s because of you, Nana! You were carelessly off on a trip to Kanazawa so our home court is being run amok by Mai!”</p>



<p>“Blaming your incompetence on me, Ace? How rude.”</p>



<p>“Shut up! We had a good match towards the end!”</p>



<p>“Just stick to getting easily beaten in basketball, okay?”</p>



<p>“Hmph! I’ll beat you before Mai!”</p>



<p>“Well, now that we’ve finished the usual banter…”</p>



<p>Nanase smiled dismissively and turned towards me.</p>



<p>“Hey there.”</p>



<p>“‘Sup.”</p>



<p>I recalled the video call we had during her trip with Nazuna and Yuuko, and how I messed up a little. Nanase had asked me for my thoughts on her kimono, and I made a flippant remark that ended up angering her.</p>



<p>I guess I still struggle with finding the right balance in situations like this.</p>



<p>I hadn’t forgotten what Yua and Yuuko told me on the night of the summer festival.</p>



<p><em>“You know, Yuuko-chan, I bet Saku-kun was thinking something like this: if he casually compliments a girl, he might accidentally make her fall in love with him, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I mean, seriously, you’re underestimating girls. Do you really think that you can make a girl fall for you just by giving her a little compliment?”</em></p>



<p><em>“You need to make a move and decide on someone soon while getting along with everyone!”</em></p>



<p>I understood the logic. Unless I exposed myself and faced my emotions, I wouldn’t be able to give a name to these feelings, no matter how much time passes.</p>



<p>As I laughed awkwardly at the embarrassment that rose within me, Nanase peeked at me teasingly.</p>



<p>“Do you happen to be thinking about me in a kimono?”</p>



<p>“…..Well, yeah,” I answered honestly, not wanting to make the same mistake twice.</p>



<p>Nanase looked surprised, then grinned and continued in a dramatic, exaggerated tone.</p>



<p>“Hmph, it’s too late to repent now. If you want to make amends, there are proper ways to do it, you know?”</p>



<p>“I know, I’ll make it right.”</p>



<p>“Good. So when can I expect <em>that</em> from you?”</p>



<p>“Don’t rush me. There’s a certain order to things. Like crossing yourself and saying a prayer before pulling the trigger on a gun.”</p>



<p>“Or taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of a time before acting on it.”</p>



<p>We looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>



<p>Honestly, I wasn’t sure what I was even saying anymore, especially during the latter part of our exchange. It had been a while since we’ve had this kind of banter.</p>



<p>When I had made Nanase angry over the kimono incident, I had promised to cook her something she had never tasted before. That’s what she’s referring to, I think.</p>



<p>Haru, who had been silently listening beside us, frowned and looked at us with disgust.</p>



<p>“Your exchange seriously gives me the creeps.”</p>



<p>“Please refrain from making unsophisticated comments,” Nanase replied provocatively, “It’s a secret, so no one else can find out, okay?”</p>



<p>Haru quickly jumped on the bandwagon, grabbing the lapel of my shirt with a smile that barely masked her anger.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose? Let’s have a secret talk with Haru-chan ♡” </p>



<p>“I’m not going to be coerced into that.”</p>



<p>Despite how cool the two of them were when they played basketball, I couldn’t help but be tickled by their playful banter, which was both captivating and exasperating at the same time.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>As we all gathered together again, chatting and laughing, I glanced at the clock. There was about ten minutes left until homeroom started.</p>



<p>I realized I had been looking towards the entrance a lot, almost impatiently. The door, which some serious-looking guy had closed firmly, had maintained its silence since a while ago.</p>



<p>I was surprised that I found myself so restless and uneasy without the cheerful voice of my friend, who always arrived at the classroom earlier than me and greeted me with a colorful smile that bloomed in the center of our group during the past year and a half.</p>



<p>I swallowed my saliva unintentionally, as if a crumpled test paper with a failing grade was stuck in my throat, causing discomfort. </p>



<p>This summer, I couldn’t accept the feelings that my irreplaceable friend offered to me. I looked away from the night sky and sank to the bottom of the bottle, feeling unworthy.</p>



<p>But I learned that the girl didn’t confess her feelings to start something new, but to end everything, not for herself but for us.</p>



<p>And there was another friend, like a second family member, who found us when we were trying to be alone and held our hands.</p>



<p>So let’s try again, just once more, </p>



<p>This time…</p>



<p>──Each of us will face our own love for ourselves.</p>



<p>The hands that were intertwined held the same warmth.</p>



<p>When I received a video call from Nazuna in Kanazawa and saw <em>her</em> face on my phone’s screen, it would be a lie to say that I wasn’t shaken.</p>



<p>However, the conversation that followed was hardly one I could call a conversation.</p>



<p>It was a humble exchange, so modest and understated that it was almost awkward, full of clumsy cats cradles and gestures that were uncharacteristic of the two of us.</p>



<p>Yet, for me, it was incredibly comfortable.</p>



<p>The accumulated time gradually enveloped me like a hand-knitted sweater, making me feel like I was about to start an early and impulsive wardrobe change.</p>



<p>And because of this reason, I felt anxious about this lackluster morning classroom.</p>



<p>Was I the only one who interpreted it as a gentle fresh start?</p>



<p>Was that ending just that – an ending?</p>



<p><em>“I don’t want to pretend this never happened.”</em></p>



<p>I clearly remember making that promise to myself.</p>



<p>But as I pathetically dwelled on these thoughts,</p>



<p><em> ──Slide.</em></p>



<p>Like a song, the sound of the door opening echoed.</p>



<p>“Good morning!”</p>



<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, my heart eagerly turned towards the voice.</p>



<p>“──────────”</p>



<p>Suddenly, the entire classroom fell into an unnatural silence, as if everyone was holding their breath. Yua, Yuzuki, Haru, Kazuki, Kaito, and even Kenta, they all opened their eyes wide and awkwardly hung their mouths open.</p>



<p>At the edge of my vision, I noticed Nazuna was looking at us, her shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.</p>



<p>“…Huh? Good morning?”</p>



<p>Finally, time began to move again with her puzzled voice.</p>



<p>“EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?!?!?!”</p>



<p>Everyone’s shock and surprise exploded like a burst water balloon. No one could fully grasp the situation yet. They were looking at each other’s faces, then glancing at the door, their gazes wandering around in confusion.</p>



<p>Of course, I was no exception.</p>



<p>After all, this sight was too surreal to accept easily.</p>



<p>The person I had just imagined a moment ago, the one whose face I was so familiar with…</p>



<p>Yuuko had cut off her beloved long hair.</p>



<p>As I realized this, a twinge of sadness passed through me.</p>



<p>I knew that long hair was her trademark and that she loved to style it in different ways. I also knew that she took great care of it more than anyone else.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a casual exchange from long ago popped into my mind.</p>



<p><em>“Hey, Saku, do you like long hair?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I think it looks great on you, Yuuko.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Hehe, thanks! Then I’ll keep it like this!”</em></p>



<p>Back then, it seemed like Yuuko was more delighted by the compliment she received about her beloved hair than by the fact that it came from me.</p>



<p>No one could have possibly imagined that a day like this would come.</p>



<p>Amidst the lingering confusion, Yuuko approached us with a cheerful greeting.</p>



<p>“Good morning, everyone! Let’s have a great second semester!”</p>



<p>We exchanged glances, and it was Nanase who hesitantly spoke up first.</p>



<p>“Uh, good morning. Um, is that…?”</p>



<p>In response to Nanase’s unusually timid question, Yuuko answered nonchalantly.</p>



<p>“Yep! I wanted to try something new!”</p>



<p>As Yuuko tilted her head slightly, her hair, which had been lightened and trimmed, flowed down in a gentle cascade.</p>



<p>It was like watching the first snowfall of the year at midnight, and I couldn’t help but be entranced by it.</p>



<p>Nanase looked at her with an admiring gaze, “…Impressive.”</p>



<p>She shook her head slightly before chuckling.</p>



<p>Yua, who had watched the two of them interact, seemed to have regained her composure and nodded gently.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-chan, you look so beautiful.”</p>



<p>“Thanks Uchi!”</p>



<p>Haru raised her hand in agreement, “It’s amazing! I might even prefer that look.”</p>



<p>“Really!?” Yuuko exclaimed, her and Haru high-fived each other.</p>



<p>“WHOOOOOAAAAA!!!” Kaito couldn’t contain his enthusiasm any longer and shouted out, “I used to think that Yuuko could only pull off long hair, but now, my mind is blown! Who wouldn’t fall for her when she looks like this?! It’s impossibleeeeeee!”</p>



<p>Kaito was practically giving a speech to the entire class, but Yuuko just giggled at him.</p>



<p>“Kaito, you’re always so dramatic,” She paused for a moment before continuing with a soft smile, “But it makes me happy.”</p>



<p>Kaito suddenly looked bashful and turned his face away, covering his face with his arm.</p>



<p>Kazuki shrugged his shoulders and opened his mouth, “I don’t mind it either, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“Eek! Kazuki being honest is scary!”</p>



<p>As if making up his mind, Kenta spoke up, “Yuuko, um, that was, like, really hot!”</p>



<p>“What do you mean by hot?!”</p>



<p>No one bothered to ask, “Why?”,  but that’s just how they were.</p>



<p>After talking to everyone, Yuuko turned around and stood in front of me.</p>



<p>──<em>Thump.</em></p>



<p>Just like that, my heart suddenly started to flutter.</p>



<p>I stiffened up, unsure if it was due to nerves or the discomfort of speaking face to face after such a long time. Was it the uncertainty of our still undefined relationship, or something else entirely?</p>



<p>With her eyes cast downward, Yuuko’s long lashes took about five blinks before slowly rising to meet mine, her flickering gaze eventually locking straight onto me.</p>



<p>Tilting her head slightly, she offered a delicate smile like that of a fine watercolor painting.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Saku,” She said softly and gracefully.</p>



<p>At a time like this, with Yuuko right in front of me…</p>



<p>How should I react?</p>



<p>If it were the two of us before, Yuuko would have leaned in with an anxious and expectant look, asking me, “How is it? How is it?” and I would have blurted out exaggerated words of praise to hide my embarrassment.</p>



<p>So, maybe it’s okay to make a light joke and change the subject, or pretend I didn’t notice anything to avoid feeling awkward with each other, or even intentionally poke fun at it.</p>



<p>…But all of those options seemed too crude now.</p>



<p>I quietly mocked myself in my mind.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>I just needed to answer naturally.</p>



<p>There was something I felt when I talked to Yuuko through the screen the other day. I didn’t think we needed many words anymore.</p>



<p>Although some kind of preamble might be necessary, I felt that I could understand what she wanted to say without asking. I also felt that I didn’t need to know everything I wanted to know.</p>



<p>I gently narrowed my eyes, thinking that what I wanted to convey should already have reached her before I said it.</p>



<p>With gratitude rather than apology in mind,</p>



<p>“I think it suits the current you.”</p>



<p>I spoke the words I wanted to overwrite.</p>



<p>As if she had seen through my thoughts from the beginning,</p>



<p>“──Then, please keep looking at me just like this.”</p>



<p>She chuckled.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>“…Ah, and one more thing. We need to start deciding on what our class will present for the upcoming Fuji High Festival next month. There will be some free time during homeroom soon, so make sure to think about what you want to do.”</p>



<p>After enduring Kurasen’s ecstatic but pointless chatter, the jealousy and envy directed at high school students that had become a customary part of high school life after the break, and the tedious administrative announcements, the first day of the second term had come to an end.</p>



<p>I tidied up my desk, thinking about how it was that time of year again.</p>



<p>The Fuji High Festival was a three-day event held in October that could be considered a school festival of sorts.</p>



<p>On the first day, there was an “Off-Campus Festival,” where the cultural clubs performed in the large hall of a complex near Fuji High School. The second day was the “Sports Festival,” and the third day was the “Cultural Festival.”</p>



<p>Last year, I had just quit baseball and wasn’t in the mood to enjoy the festival. I hardly remember how I spent the preparation period while the whole school was buzzing with excitement, nor how I celebrated it on the day itself.</p>



<p>As I slung Gregory’s backpack over my shoulder, Kaito called out to me, “Hey, Saku, want to go to Takokyu?”</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I hadn’t shown my face to Oba-chan since the end of the first term. I was probably going to get a scolding or two, I thought with a wry smile.</p>



<p>“Sure, but is everyone else okay with it?”</p>



<p>In response to my question, Haru replied, “The girls basketball team has self-practice today, so there’s time to eat lunch.”</p>



<p>Kazuki followed up, “I’m the same. Why don’t we talk about what we’ll do for the school festival while we’re at it?”</p>



<p>By “what we’ll do”, he probably meant whether we’d have a performance as Class 2-5 or do something with this group separately.</p>



<p>Even though the school festival was mainly a platform for cultural clubs to showcase their works, we could actively participate in both the sports festival and cultural festival in various ways.</p>



<p>“Well, well, looks like the quiet one has said something unusual for once.” I teased him, and Kazuki responded by shrugging his shoulders in exasperation.</p>



<p>“Last year, nobody said anything because they were all being considerate of a certain someone.”</p>



<p>“…Sorry.”</p>



<p>Nanase walked over to us, her shoulders shaking in amusement, “Is Mizushino the type to be proactive about something like this? That’s a little surprising.”</p>



<p>Kazuki narrowed his eyes ever so slightly and looked out the window.</p>



<p>“It’s like the fireworks festival. We don’t know if we’ll be able to have the same fun next year.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing his words, Kenta, Yua, and Yuuko, who had gathered around us after getting ready to go home, nodded in agreement.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>


<p>As soon as I opened the door of Takokyū…</p>



<p>“You’re such heartless kids, you didn’t show up even once during summer break!”</p>



<p>We were immediately greeted with the expected scolding.</p>



<p>While trying to comfort <em>Oba-chan</em>, we ordered various snacks like <em>yakisoba</em>, <em>takoyaki</em>, and <em>karaage</em> to make up for our absence.</p>



<p>Once the food arrived, Kazuki was the first to speak up.</p>



<p>“So, are we doing anything for the cultural festival?”</p>



<p>It was Kaito who eagerly responded, as he devoured the generously-upgraded jumbo <em>yakisoba</em> that the owner had kindly given us.</p>



<p>“Don’t we decide the class performance in the homeroom or something? Or are you talking about something else?”</p>



<p>Kazuki nodded, “Yeah, like the executive committee or the free participation slot.”</p>



<p>While I didn’t know how it worked in other schools, at Fuji High, all students were assigned to some kind of committee or group for the festival.</p>



<p>The executive committees for the sports festival and cultural festival were the most prominent, and surprisingly, there was a high competition rate among students who wanted to enjoy the festival to the fullest. Conversely, there were also relatively less time-consuming options for less proactive students, such as the beautification committee or the record-keeping committee.</p>



<p>Then there were the class performances for the cultural festival that Kaito had mentioned. These ranged from food stalls and shops to interactive experiences such as haunted houses, as well as stage performances such as plays and comedy skits.</p>



<p>Finally, there was the free participation slot for the cultural festival, where individuals or groups of friends could apply. The most popular options tend to be live band performances and a cappella contests.</p>



<p>In other words, if we wanted to do something together beyond the class performance, we’d either have to join the same committee or apply for the free participation slot.</p>



<p>Nanase casually picked up some fried potatoes and said, “I always wanted to try playing in a band at the cultural festival, at least once in my life.”</p>



<p>I stopped mid-bite of my <em>takoyaki</em> and responded.</p>



<p>“Oh, really? That’s unexpected.”</p>



<p>“Is it? I’m not really an expert in music or anything, but I just think it’s cool, you know? I’ve always been into sports since I was little, so I guess I admire fields where you can perform on stage in front of audiences like in bands or brass bands. Doesn’t it look glamorous?”</p>



<p>I could understand Nanase’s feelings.</p>



<p>Of course, even baseball and basketball could draw a considerable audience if you made it to the national level, and in that sense, they were similar.</p>



<p>However, as non-professionals, we’re not playing to get someone fired up. We’re just competing against our opponents, and as a result, the people watching us get excited.</p>



<p>In that regard, I think that bands’ live performances or brass bands’ concerts were fundamentally aimed at playing for the audience.</p>



<p>It must be nice to receive direct reactions to your performance from the people right in front of you. I imagined it must feel good.</p>



<p>After thinking for a while, I spoke up, “If it were you, Nanase, you could easily play some simple songs on the guitar or bass with some practice.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t uncommon to form a band with a few beginner friends for the school festival.</p>



<p>After all, she was naturally skilled at everything. It would be a different story if she had to sell tickets and perform at a live house. However, since this was for the school festival, even if her performance was a bit awkward, it would still be enough to get the crowd excited.</p>



<p>Nanase waved her hand lightly in front of her face.</p>



<p>“Oh, I’m not really serious about it. It might be possible to play one song, but practicing multiple songs while preparing for the festival and doing club activities would be tough.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>



<p>Haru looked somewhat disappointed, “The girls basketball team also has the qualifiers for the Winter Cup next month. We want to enjoy the school festival, but if we’re going to do something, it might be helpful if it’s organized by the class or committee.”</p>



<p>Nanase also scratched her cheek apologetically.</p>



<p>“Yeah, sorry everyone.”</p>



<p>Fuji High put a lot of effort into the school festival, so all club activities were suspended until the day of the festival. But if it overlapped with a tournament like with Haru and others, they couldn’t afford to neglect practice for that. They’d be busy with both their class and committee duties.</p>



<p>As if anticipating their reactions, Kazuki opened his mouth, “Well, that’s only natural. Then let’s just skip the cultural festival’s free slots. Although it’s enough to focus on our class events, are there any committees you guys would like to try?”</p>



<p>“Yeeeesss, me, me!” Yuuko eagerly raised her hand, “How about being part of the cheer squad for the sports festival?”</p>



<p>“AHH…!!”</p>



<p>Our voices overlapped; mine, Kazuki’s, Kaito’s, Nanase’s, and Haru’s. Yua and Kenta, on the other hand, were stunned and stared at Yuuko.</p>



<p>Basically, our sports festival was a typical interclass competition divided into five teams, Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, and Black, where each grade competed to win based on the results of relay races, tug-of-war, and other games. By the way, it seemed like our class was on the Blue team.</p>



<p>However, there were two special events at the sports festival aside from the usual competitions, such as the “creation” and the “cheering squad.”</p>



<p>The former referred to giant objects made for each team, designed to match their team colors. </p>



<p>For instance, if you were on the red team, you might make a giant Lupin on a red jacket, while the green team might make a Yoshi. These characters, about five meters tall, were made from skeleton frames and placed with background panels in each camp on the ground. During performance time, a small skit might be performed as well.</p>



<p>The latter referred to the role of cheering on your team. During the competition, you would lead the crowd by shouting first, waving flags, and even singing chants or songs. </p>



<p>However, the cheer squad’s main showcase was their performance, just like the creations. They would wear handmade costumes and perform an original dance choreographed to music on the field.</p>



<p>The creations and the cheer squads would both be ranked according to their performance quality, which added up to a considerable number of points, so it could be said that they were the stars of the sports festival.</p>



<p>Haru was the first to respond, “Sounds great! I’m good at moving my body!”</p>



<p>“Haru, can you even dance?” I teased her.</p>



<p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Haru shook her index finger left and right in front of her face, “Don’t underestimate me, Mister. Basketball players with good rhythm tend to be good at dancing too. This is my theory.” </p>



<p>“Wow, that sounds legit. So, Kaito, you can dance too?”</p>



<p>In response to my question, Kaito flexed his muscles.</p>



<p>“Heck yeah! I don’t know if having good rhythm in basketball applies to dancing, but I can move my body better than my head! I can wave flags like nobody’s business!”</p>



<p>He’s oddly convincing, I thought with a wry smile.</p>



<p>I looked over at Kazuki and Nanase. Well, those two could probably do anything.</p>



<p>Kazuki grinned sheepishly, “I’m also inexperienced, but I have no reason to fall behind Kaito.”</p>



<p>Nanase also smiled mischievously, “I won’t lag behind Haru either.”</p>



<p>“Hey, that’s going too far!”</p>



<p>“Oi, that’s enough!”</p>



<p>Well, I wasn’t worried about the hardcore sports club members from the beginning.</p>



<p>The problem was…</p>



<p>I looked at the two people who hadn’t participated in the conversation until now.</p>



<p>As I thought, Yua raised her hand looking somewhat troubled.</p>



<p>“I-I might be a bit uneasy.”</p>



<p>The first one to react was Yuuko, “Eh, you’ve been doing music since you were little, so you can definitely do it, Uchi!” </p>



<p>“Well, it’s just that, it’s embarrassing…” </p>



<p>“But, Uchi, you’ll be performing on the stage with the band club on the first day of the school festival, right? In front of everyone? Isn’t it the same thing?” </p>



<p>“Well, when you put it that way, I guess so…” </p>



<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t laugh even if your right hand and right foot move together!”</p>



<p>“Ugh, I’m not that bad at sports!”</p>



<p>I watched as the two of them giggled, and Yua’s cheeks became relaxed.</p>



<p>And just like that, everyone’s attention was naturally drawn to one spot.</p>



<p>“Impossible, impossible, it’s absolutely impossible!!!!” </p>



<p>Kenta stood up, frantically waving his hands.</p>



<p>“Are you saying you want to drag a deep-sea fish out onto a scorching beach and dance samba like it’s a jolly good time?! You’re a monster! Do you really think I can just blend in with a bunch of cheerful, flamboyant tropical fish at the sports festival’s cheer squad? Don’t underestimate a former shut-in otaku, damn it!”</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, calm down Kenta. Even tropical fish can’t dance samba on a beach,” I said, although I agreed with him to some extent.</p>



<p>It was easy to separate those who were willing from those who weren’t when it came to these things. That’s why, even though it was one of the highlights of the sports festival, if someone volunteered themselves, it usually went smoothly without any problems.</p>



<p>It was all down to individual personalities, and it wasn’t something you could force.</p>



<p>However, it wouldn’t be fair to leave Kenta out like this.</p>



<p>As I thought about reconsidering things like the creations or other committees, Kazuki stood up.</p>



<p>“Kenta, can I talk to you for a sec?”</p>



<p>Kenta already looked like he was going to refuse before Kazuki even said anything.</p>



<p>“No matter how much you try to persuade me, it’s not going to happen! I’ll just join an easier committee and you guys can handle the cheering squad without me!”</p>



<p>Ignoring his protests, Kazuki gently placed his hand on Kenta’s shoulder, “Listen to me, Kenta.”</p>



<p>“I can’t even imagine dancing! It’ll kill me!”</p>



<p>I chuckled to myself; convincing Kenta at this point is going to be a real headache.</p>



<p>I have to hand it to Kazuki for his persuasiveness.</p>



<p>“Kenta, you like anime, right?”</p>



<p>“What’s with the sudden topic? Just so you know, the school festival in anime is bullshit!”</p>



<p>Despite calling himself an otaku, he spoke so bluntly.</p>



<p>Kazuki calmly continued, “When it comes to dancing, in anime, characters sometimes dance in the opening or ending credits, right? I wonder who enjoys that kind of thing. It feels like an inside joke. Wouldn’t it be better if they showed visuals that matched the world of the story?”</p>



<p>Kenta opened his eyes wide in surprise and responded with a dry voice, “Huh? That’s a reward for the fans, isn’t it? And it’s mandatory to perform the dance perfectly, right?” </p>



<p>Kazuki smiled slightly, “By the way, at voice actor live events, don’t they do <em>otagei</em> (otaku dance) and stuff like that?”</p>



<p>Kenta sighed heavily, and with palms facing the ceiling, responded incredulously.</p>



<p>“Geez, you fake-otaku who pretend to understand are such a pain. Nowadays, people don’t do that kind of thing at concerts because it’s annoying to those who actually want to see the performance. Besides, I’m not a voice actor otaku, so technically speaking, using the term “voice actor concert” is not accurate. If you want to talk about it, go do some research and come back.”</p>



<p>Wow, Kazuki was really able to brush off Kenta’s irritating face so calmly. If it were me, I would have definitely given him a lesson or two.</p>



<p>“Well then, I guess you can’t even do one <em>otagei</em> dance, huh?”</p>



<p>“What? I can do it, why do you ask?”</p>



<p>“But isn’t it not popular these days?” </p>



<p>“You don’t get it, Mizushino. Doing it at a venue would be a nuisance to others, but it’s fine to do it in your own room. You could dance your heart out in front of the screen with a live concert video playing after all. Thanks to the training I learned from King, I’m at my peak now.”</p>



<p>Looking closely, I could see that Kazuki was trying hard to suppress his laughter as his shoulders trembled slightly.</p>



<p>At this point, even I could see what he was trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>Kazuki tried his best to speak calmly, “Really? I’m actually kind of interested, but isn’t it embarrassing to do it in public?”</p>



<p>Kenta responded proudly, puffing out his chest, “Hmph, as King said, ‘If you can be proud of yourself, that’s all that matters.’ There’s no need to be ashamed of what you love.”</p>



<p>Hey, don’t go quoting my words like that, you make it sound cringe!</p>



<p>Kazuki began to wrap up the conversation.</p>



<p>“How about you try dancing for us next time? It would be great to see some new moves you’ve learned.”</p>



<p>Kenta tightened his face and replied, “Challenge accepted.”</p>



<p>“Taking into consideration the practice period, we’ll have the performance ready next month on the school grounds.”</p>



<p>“If we have that much time, I can show you three or four different moves.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s focus on the details too, starting with the costumes.”</p>



<p>“Hmph, I’ve never cosplayed before, but I don’t hate the idea.”</p>



<p>“And that’s settled.”</p>



<p>Kazuki flashed a smirk and looked around at everyone.</p>



<p>“Kenta will join our cheering squad.” </p>



<p>“──What? Wait, what?!”</p>



<p>We had reached our limit and burst out laughing at their exchange.</p>



<p>Kaito clutched his stomach, looking pained as he spoke, </p>



<p>“What the hell, Kenta! You’re the most experienced among us, huh?”</p>



<p>Haru wiped her eyes dramatically, “I can’t wait to see your sharp dance moves, Yamazaki!”</p>



<p>Nanase chimed in smoothly, “Don’t worry, we’re all going to dance together, so no one will stick out too much.”</p>



<p>Yuuko stood up, her face lighting up. “Let’s make a lot of memories, Kentacchi!” </p>



<p>Yua looked up at Kenta and smiled gently, “Let’s do our best together, Yamazaki-kun.”</p>



<p>Finally, I spoke up. </p>



<p>“Well, that’s the plan. Let’s make the most of our youth together!”</p>



<p>Kenta muttered under his breath, looking like a deer caught in headlights. “N-No way….”</p>



<p>As we all laughed together once again, I thought about that one summer that we could never go back to – when we were all seventeen.</p>



<p>Passing through that blue tunnel, something had definitely changed.</p>



<p>I had bid farewell to last year’s summer with Haru, and welcomed a new one.</p>



<p>Yuuko had faced me.</p>



<p>Yua had faced both Yuuko and me.</p>



<p>In reality, things had already begun to change long before, thanks to Nanase and Asu-nee.</p>



<p>Kazuki and Kaito remained Kazuki and Kaito, through and through.</p>



<p>And Kenta had become Kenta.</p>



<p>──We had all put an end to this year’s summer together, and I didn’t intend to forget any of it.</p>



<p>Yet, even so…</p>



<p>This small, ordinary everyday life I returned to, it was precious to me beyond measure.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8</strong></p>


<p>I walked along the same riverbank path as this morning, but in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>We had all parted ways at Takokyu. Nanase, Haru, Kaito, and Kazuki headed straight to club activities. Yua and Yuuko planned to shop near the station, while Kenta tagged along as he had some business at Animate.</p>



<p>With no specific plans, I took my time walking home, enjoying the beautiful scenery and daydreaming about spending a relaxing afternoon with a stray cat. It was a leisurely afternoon where I could do anything or nothing at all.</p>



<p>The wind chimes, which had served their purpose and finished their duties in August, chimed ever so softly in the background. There was a sweet aroma that wafted through the air, it might be from someone hastily boiling leftover corn.</p>



<p>As I strolled, a figure sitting by a small watergate caught my eye. I quickened my pace, consciously making my steps gentler, and walked down the narrow path in the middle of the embankment. It was as if I were wishing for the girl’s face, looking pouty with a wet, pristine dress, to light up.</p>



<p>I hoped my voice would ring out like lively festival music when I called out to her.</p>



<p>“Asu-nee.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee lifted her head from the paperback she was holding, and her face broke into a relieved smile, as if a father who was running late for a parent-teacher conference had finally arrived. Then, she turned her head away from me with a pout.</p>



<p>“I thought I wouldn’t be able to see you today.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry. I was eating with everyone,” I said, chuckling under my breath as I sat down beside her.</p>



<p>I caught a glimpse of the cover of her book, titled “Me and Our Summer”<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. I hadn’t read it before, but perhaps it was something like reminiscing about a past season that had gone by too quickly.</p>



<p>Asu-nee giggled and shrugged her shoulders, looking tickled.</p>



<p>“Just kidding. It’s such a pleasant afternoon that it would be a shame to go home right away. It’s not a lie that I was hoping we could meet, though.”</p>



<p>I felt a small sense of joy that she was thinking something similar to me.</p>



<p>When we visited URALA together, I was worried that I had unintentionally hurt her, but it seemed like she had already moved past it.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way…” I suddenly remembered something and asked, “Asu-nee, what color are you?”</p>



<p>She looked back at me with a confused expression, so I added some clarification.</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry. I meant for the sports festival teams.”</p>



<p>She seemed to understand my question, but her reaction was still unclear, “I don’t think I’ve heard about it yet. Why do you ask?”</p>



<p>“Well, we were just talking about forming a cheering squad with everyone earlier.”</p>



<p>Generally, the school festival committee and sports festival team divisions were organized by class year, meaning that apart from club activities, it was one of the few opportunities for students from different grades to work together.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing my unintentional sweet anticipation, Asu-nee turned her face away in embarrassment.</p>



<p>“And what color are you?”</p>



<p>“I’m in the Blue group.”</p>



<p>“I see, you’re part of the sports festival cheering squad…”</p>



<p>As I looked at her troubled expression, I quickly added, “Well, I don’t think wearing colorful costumes and dancing in front of everyone is really your thing, Asu-nee.”</p>



<p>Though I meant it as a light-hearted follow-up, Asu-nee pursed her lips in annoyance.</p>



<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>



<p>Her reaction amused me, and I couldn’t resist teasing her.</p>



<p>“I mean that you would look better in a white dress, reading a book.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee puffed out her cheeks, “You think I can’t dance, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“…..To be honest, all I see is a future where you shout, ‘Wait! Don’t leave me behind!’ like you did that one time.”</p>



<p>“I mean, I’m not saying I’m really good at sports or anything, but it’s not like I’m terrible either.”</p>



<p>“The problem is that you tend to become a total klutz when you encounter something unfamiliar.”</p>



<p>“I know exactly what you think of me now!”</p>



<p>I chuckled and said, “I was just kidding. I just wanted to let you know that you don’t have to force yourself to match me.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee let out a short sigh and slumped her shoulders, “I know, it’s just not in my nature.”</p>



<p>“You didn’t even sing at karaoke.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, you always bring that up!”</p>



<p>“This is just my nature.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee turned to me, looking exasperated. Her expression was more melancholic than I expected, and more fleeting than I hoped.</p>



<p>Asu-nee began to say something but then stopped herself, eventually murmuring quietly, “This is the last school festival, huh…”</p>



<p>A sudden loneliness seemed to infect us both, and I replied solemnly, “I hope we can at least be the same color.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, the same blue as you.” </p>



<p>And so we sat there, watching a red bike parked on the side of the road, a yellow shirt swaying on a balcony, green leaves rustling in the wind, and black crows flying effortlessly across the sky.</p>



<p>We gazed up at the blue sky together for a while.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9</strong></p>


<p><em>──Swish.</em></p>



<p>After my two-handed three-point shot passing through the ring for the hundredth time, I, Aomi Haru, finally relaxed my shoulders and let out a deep breath.</p>



<p>Ever since we splitted at Takokyu, our self-practice sessions had lasted until nearly 7 pm. Sen, Yo, and the first-years had all been practicing diligently without showing any signs of leaving, so I had even forgotten to tell them they could call it a day whenever they wanted.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but feel proud of how much we had all changed.</p>



<p>As I was wiping the sweat with the hem of my t-shirt, I turned to my partner, who had helped me with passing drills.</p>



<p>“Thanks, let’s call it a day here.”</p>



<p>Even though Nana had also just hit her hundredth shot, she remained calm.</p>



<p>“Your accuracy has definitely improved with practice.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, but you’re one to talk.”</p>



<p>Although I hadn’t counted properly, Nana had probably only hit around 120 or 130 shots to reach her hundred, whereas I had easily exceeded 200, and might be even close to 300 shots.</p>



<p>As if sensing my thoughts, Nana smiled and turned her back, giving everyone clear instructions on cleaning up.</p>



<p>Actually, I was scolded by my teammates when I confessed that I had been secretly practicing my three-pointer without them.</p>



<p><em>“Why didn’t you talk to us about it?!” </em></p>



<p><em>“Well, I thought it would be confusing if I hadn’t gotten the basics down first. I didn’t want to drag you into extra practice.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Are you serious? The three-point shot is something that you can only get a sense of by hitting it repeatedly in real-game situations. Even if you make eight out of ten in practice, you might not even make four out of ten in a game. Especially if you’re just practicing shooting from a fixed position without even having passes. Though it’s better than nothing, it’s incredibly inefficient!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Uh, sorry about that.”</em></p>



<p>In reality, just receiving Nana’s random passes already significantly lowered my shooting accuracy. It wasn’t even worth considering what would happen if it were a real game situation with a defense.</p>



<p>I often asked Nana, “Why didn’t you go for a three-pointer just now!?” and while I didn’t think that’s entirely wrong, I now realized how amazing it was to have a partner who could calmly make these shots in a game.</p>



<p>However…</p>



<p>I hugged the basketball tightly. </p>



<p><em>“I’ve gotten stronger.”</em></p>



<p>My words towards him were not a lie.</p>



<p>Ever since the game with Aki-san and Kei-san, my play has been improving at an almost joke-like pace. For those who had played sports for a long time, there were moments like this.</p>



<p>In my opinion, the so-called growth was not a smooth curve. </p>



<p>Of course, my skills and stamina were improving day by day, but there were times when I felt stagnant, unable to move forward.</p>



<p>Even though I pushed myself to the limit during practice, both in quality and quantity, my body was unable to keep up with the ideal plays that were always racing through my head.</p>



<p>However, one day, it happened.</p>



<p>I suddenly leap up two or three stairs at once, as if the ceiling had opened up above me. My body felt as light as if I had shed my former self and caught up to the plays I had envisioned, eventually merging with them perfectly.</p>



<p>It was like breaking out of a shell, surpassing a wall, or grabbing hold of something.</p>



<p>There were certainly moments like that, and for me, I think it was during the game the other day, more specifically when I heard Misaki-chan’s words.</p>



<p><em>“──You’re not warriors, you’re fighting girls.”</em></p>



<p>Those words blew away all of my doubts.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the promise I made with everyone at Takokyu came to mind.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the thought of me being a cheerleader at the sports festival.</p>



<p>There were many ways to participate in the school festival, but without a doubt, preparing for the dance performance was one of the most time-consuming and challenging tasks.</p>



<p>From choosing the theme to selecting the costumes, music, and choreography, we had to come up with everything ourselves and put in a lot of effort to learn and perform it.</p>



<p>Last year, I probably would have ignored it because it would have interfered with my basketball practice.</p>



<p>I would have said, “If I have time for something like that, I’ll just practice instead.”</p>



<p>But now, as I thought about the man I love, I realized that the more I devoted myself to basketball, the more I yearned for him.</p>



<p>And the more I yearned for him, the sharper my basketball skills became.</p>



<p>That’s why I made my decision without hesitation.</p>



<p>Even if I lost the excuse of accompanying him to baseball practice and the privilege of spending summer vacation together, I could still be by his side.</p>



<p>I wonder what we’d talk about, what kind of moments we’d share, and what kind of memories we’d leave behind.</p>



<p>I would embrace all of them and turn them into my strength.</p>



<p>Maybe, just maybe…</p>



<p>I might not need an answer, I didn’t even have to take a serious gamble.</p>



<p>I think… I must be the happiest right now.</p>



<p>If just thinking about him could fill me with so much joy, did I really need to wish for anything more?</p>



<p>The truth was, I knew it all too well.</p>



<p>I had irretrievably linked him and basketball together. For that reason alone, I knew I could become stronger, but also know why I knew fear.</p>



<p>Because everything had two sides, I would think about it from time to time.</p>



<p>If this love were to end, would I still be able to stand on the court, staring at the hoop with the same gaze?</p>



<p>…No, it’s impossible.</p>



<p>I didn’t know if I could let go and focus solely on basketball again, or lose the will to fight and never came back to this place.</p>



<p>But one thing was certain.</p>



<p>If this love ends, so will I.</p>



<p>In that case…</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but grab my chest.</p>



<p>Rather than ask for something selfish like wanting him to look at me, it’d be enough as long as I could keep looking at him.</p>



<p>If losing both was inevitable, then I’d rather keep holding onto both.</p>



<p>…I hope we could continue this kind of relationship forever.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10</strong></p>


<p>As usual, I, Uchida Yua, was preparing dinner. Tonight’s main dish was rolled mackerel with plum and shiso leaves.</p>



<p>My dad and little brother weren’t big fans of fish dishes, but this one was a staple menu that they enjoyed, probably because the sour taste of the pickled plum went well with rice.</p>



<p>First, I cut the mackerel into bite-sized pieces after thawing it in the fridge and lightly sprinkled some salt on it. While waiting for it to rest, I took out some large pickled plums and pounded them with a knife until they became paste-like after removing the seeds.</p>



<p>I also prepared the shiso leaves that I had bought in bulk when they were on sale, and stored them in a container filled with water.</p>



<p>Then, I spread the plum paste on the cut-up mackerel and rolled them with shiso leaves, and lightly coated them with potato starch to complete the preparation.</p>



<p>Before starting the frying process, I checked the pot that I had previously heated. Inside it, the potatoes and onions were boiled in advance, along with some ordinary miso soup ingredients. Since it was a weekday, I used instant dashi (broth) granules instead of making a dashi from scratch.</p>



<p>Once I confirmed that the potatoes were cooked through, I turned off the heat and dissolved the miso. Finally, I added dried wakame seaweed and the soup was ready.</p>



<p>Next, I heated up a frying pan and used rice oil instead of salad oil that we normally used at home. I fried half of the cut-up mackerel, placed them on a plate once fully cooked, and arranged the remaining half on the frying pan.</p>



<p>I believed that salt and pickled plums alone were delicious enough, but because my brother liked strong flavors, I always changed the flavor by adding some mentsuyu sauce on top.</p>



<p>Today, Yuuko-chan brought some “ishirudashi” from Kanazawa as a souvenir, so I poured it over the dish.</p>



<p>As the pleasant aroma of fish sauce filled the room, I was reminded of this morning.</p>



<p>──The summer ended, and my best friend cut her hair short.</p>



<p>It might seem like a trivial event when put into words, but I never imagined such a day would come.</p>



<p>I remembered how much she took care of her long hair, and how she always happily reported to me when she found a new hairstyle that made the most of its length.</p>



<p>And most of all, she was a girl who looked so good with long hair.</p>



<p>Ever since the day my mother left until I entered high school, I always had a short, unremarkable haircut.</p>



<p>I didn’t care about having a stylish haircut or wanting to be seen as cute. All I wanted was to blend in without standing out.</p>



<p>But when I met Yuuko-chan and that boy, for the first time, I wished to become more like a girl.</p>



<p>My new friend’s long hair swayed gently every time she laughed, bounced cutely when she was angry, and left a lingering impression like a wedding veil when she ran up to me.</p>



<p>It was like looking at the very embodiment of the lovely girl I had always imagined.</p>



<p>I think I was drawn to Yuuko-chan just as much as I was to that boy I couldn’t stand.</p>



<p>I never had the courage to tell her, but the truth was I had been admiring her since last year, unwaveringly.</p>



<p>I wanted to be like that girl.</p>



<p>My hair, which I grew out like I was making a wish, had become quite long now.</p>



<p>──I thought I was getting a little closer, but it seemed like I’d drifted away again.</p>



<p>The sound of oil sizzling filled the kitchen, I quickly flipped the cutlet with chopsticks.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but smile at how ridiculous I looked like this.</p>



<p>Yuuko-chan was truly amazing. Even I, who had no interest in love until high school, could see that.</p>



<p>Cutting one’s hair after something like that happened, well, it was a well-known cliché, but there wasn’t even a hint of sadness or regret in her eyes.</p>



<p>Despite cutting off her long hair that I had admired as if they were an angel’s wings, why did she still exuded a certain lightness that made me feel like she could fly out the window at any moment if she kicked the ground hard enough?</p>



<p>It was the same feeling I had when we were shopping together in front of the station after school.</p>



<p>One moment I felt like I was with the usual Yuuko-chan, but the next moment, I caught a glimpse of a different side of Yuuko-chan I didn’t know, someone who seemed more mature and delicate, as if she would disappear if I touched her, yet with a heart that was firmly present here, emanating an indescribable aura unlike anything else.</p>



<p>It made me a little lonely, but also dazzled me.</p>



<p>I turned off the stove and moved the cutlet onto a plate, then gently placed my hand on my chest with relief.</p>



<p>I was glad we didn’t leave things unresolved and were able to hold hands again.</p>



<p>However…</p>



<p>As I looked at the stool in the kitchen, I couldn’t help but think of the words I had said that evening,</p>



<p><em>“Until the day we’re ready to face our own love.”</em></p>



<p>For Saku-kun and Yuuko-chan, that “someday” wasn’t now. It was the words I wove together for those who were precious to me.</p>



<p>In that case—</p>



<p>When will my “someday” come?</p>



<p>Yuuko-chan had always been moving forward in her own way, and Saku-kun, having listened to every word I said, surely created a place in that house for us to face each other.</p>



<p>But despite knowing that I wanted to be special, and that I had decided to be a bit more selfish, somewhere, I was still clinging on to something.</p>



<p>Facing love for my own sake didn’t mean everything had to fall apart.</p>



<p>However, this summer…</p>



<p>I felt as though I could see through Saku-kun and Yuuko-chan’s hearts.</p>



<p>The tears that fell endlessly, the pain that made me want to tear my chest apart, the suffering that made me unable to be myself, the sadness that felt like drowning, the regret so strong that I wanted to erase all memories────</p>



<p>All because I learned the end of love.</p>



<p>After all, the Yuuko-chan from that day was me. The only difference was whether we had confessed our feelings or kept them hidden.</p>



<p>If I had been the one to confess in that dimly lit classroom, I would have been rejected with the same words. Even if there was a place for me in his heart, there were other girls by his side.</p>



<p>I accepted this outcome without having the courage or the determination to step forward, and was only slightly hurt without being deeply wounded in the end.</p>



<p>That’s why I think, on the surface, I wanted to immerse myself in this happiness that hadn’t truly ended yet.</p>



<p>To be able to go out with Yuuko-chan again, making plans for grocery shopping with Saku-kun as if it was the most natural thing to do, and even though I was still a little hesitant about being in the cheering squad, it would unmistakably be an unforgettable memory.</p>



<p>I found myself hoping, even if it was just a fleeting wish. </p>



<p>Not just for myself, but for everyone…</p>



<p>To cherish this September that we arrived at after leaving behind that August.</p>



<p> ──I wish I can keep surrendering myself to this ordinary forever.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>11</strong></p>


<p><em>“Asu-nee, what color are you?”</em></p>



<p>You were like a postman from a remote island. Showing up when I least expect it, delivering letters that filled me with joy.</p>



<p>Even though I mockingly told myself that I should get used to the same routine, I found myself eagerly anticipating if you’d come today, wondering about tomorrow.</p>



<p>I had repeated the charade of pretending not to notice, pretending not to look, but deep down I always thought about it.</p>



<p>The summer was soaked in melancholy, like a faded painting left outside.</p>



<p>A summer that passed by quietly, all alone.</p>



<p>Our date felt like an extension of those innocent seven days, and when we spent time together during summer camp, even for a short while, it was like we became classmates.</p>



<p>In the midst of those trivial moments, elated, giddy, and falling in love──</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, you were hurting deeply, and I, who was nothing but an outsider, couldn’t even wipe away the tears that surely flowed.</p>



<p>Even so, I wanted to at least be your senpai.</p>



<p>That’s why I invited you to grandma’s nostalgic house, facing your feelings, though I didn’t know how much I could help.</p>



<p>And then, the night of the festival finally arrived.</p>



<p>I wasn’t surprised anymore that you had rekindled your bonds with those girls and come back. I knew it would happen ever since I received that phone call the day before.</p>



<p>It was that kind-hearted girl who made omelette rice for you while you were crying, and it conveyed to me how she had been there for you all along.</p>



<p>Certainly, this summer.</p>



<p>With Hiiragi-san, Uchida-san, Nanase-san, Aomi-san, Mizushino-kun, Asano-kun, Yamazaki-kun, and of course, you…</p>



<p>There were shared worries, pains, and irreplaceable stories that everyone had all experienced together, yet no matter how many pages I turned, my name was not there.</p>



<p>I had resigned myself to the fact that it had been like that until now, and it would probably be the same in the future, and that’s why…</p>



<p>──Your casual words made me almost burst into tears of happiness.</p>



<p>I tried not to consciously expect anything, because thinking about it made me hopeful.</p>



<p>Because of that, I couldn’t immediately grasp the true meaning behind your words.</p>



<p>If by some chance we ended up in the same committee for the Fuji High Festival, if we ended up wearing the same color at the sports festival…</p>



<p>I had been envisioning that possibility long before you.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, the retro radio placed at the edge of the desk was playing BUMP OF CHICKEN’s “Stage of the ground”.</p>



<p>It reminded me of the cheer squad for the sports festival, I thought, and unconsciously let out a soft smile.</p>



<p>It’s so like all of you.</p>



<p>I was sure everyone was excitedly preparing for the festival, putting in their earnest efforts that were almost embarrassing, and showcasing performances that made the audience thrilled with excitement.</p>



<p>If only I could join that circle…</p>



<p>Cheering loudly, wearing costumes, dancing – I couldn’t really imagine myself doing any of that, but maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to try something new for a change.</p>



<p>Because you always took me to places I’ve never been before.</p>



<p>Or perhaps, I wonder…</p>



<p>What I was really yearning for was exactly that kind of time. Not just with you, but with you and everyone else. </p>



<p>I wanted my name to be written alongside yours in this story.</p>



<p>I think there were things I didn’t notice because we were senpai and kouhai. And those must not all be wonderful things.</p>



<p>So far, I had only been listening to your stories through the soft filter of you. The depth of your bonds, the gazes you directed at someone, the gestures everyone exchanged in passing, the expressions I had never seen before that spilled out of you…</p>



<p>There must also be times when everyone got hurt, felt confused, or were in pain. </p>



<p>Yet, strangely enough, I envied even that pain.</p>



<p><em>“I hope we can at least be the same color.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah, the same blue as you.” </em></p>



<p>I wished I could be dyed with that color too.</p>



<p>Lately, there were moments when I found myself lost in thought.</p>



<p>If I were to go to Tokyo, would my love truly come to an end?</p>



<p>I had prepared myself for that possibility.</p>



<p>Leaving this town to chase my dreams meant I wouldn’t have those stolen moments of secretly waiting for Saku-kun, who would become a third-year, at our usual riverside spot, or impulsively asking him out on a date, or even becoming his bride.</p>



<p>That’s why I’ve been trying my best to fully embrace the time we have left.</p>



<p>And yet, sometimes I was tempted by sweet escape routes.</p>



<p>I recalled the year that had passed since we reunited.</p>



<p>We were never the type to see each other every day, and until recently, we didn’t exchange phone calls or text messages, let alone make any promises.</p>



<p>Could it be that we weren’t able to stay the way we were now?</p>



<p>If I worked hard at my part-time job over there, maybe I could come back home once a month. I’d secretly wait for you at the usual riverside spot after classes, reading a book.</p>



<p>And when I’ve had my fill of seeing the surprise on your face, I might even take you out on a date.</p>



<p>It might be a bit old-fashioned, but even our future paths could be done over the phone. </p>



<p>With video calls, we could even walk around the streets of Tokyo together on holidays.</p>



<p>Would that be any different from this fleeting year that had passed?</p>



<p>On the day we went on a workplace tour and had dinner together…</p>



<p>What kind of conversations did you have with Hiiragi-san and Uchida-san before you returned to that summer festival, and how did it end?</p>



<p>Perhaps you carefully told me only the parts that were okay for me to hear.</p>



<p>It was a story that seemed so beautiful I could cry, yet so cruel that it made me want to run away…</p>



<p>The lone moonlight shone down.</p>



<p>Your love has yet to begin.</p>



<p>You, who were always sincere to everyone else but so complicated with yourself, I wonder if it’s possible for you to easily choose just one person.</p>



<p>From now on, facing each and every girl in your heart, I secretly hoped to be there, to be at least on the fringes of it. Perhaps you would take your time, like writing a novel, carefully picking and choosing each word as you slowly give a name to your feelings.</p>



<p>And in the meantime, maybe, just maybe…</p>



<p>Could the year between us be filled?</p>



<p>For instance, if you started considering going to Tokyo for college… Once you become a university student, the difference in our years wouldn’t matter. </p>



<p>But I knew, it was overly convenient, wishful thinking.</p>



<p>If it could come true, even after I graduate…</p>



<p>──It would be nice if we could keep this distance forever.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>12</strong></p>


<p>With a splash and the sound of droplets falling, I, Nanase Yuzuki, gently opened my eyes.</p>



<p>Regardless of the season, I always enjoyed taking my time soaking in the bath like this. I turned off the bathroom lights and lit an aromatic candle in its place.</p>



<p>Sometimes I would just gaze absentmindedly at the flickering flames, while other times I would rest my head against the edge of the tub and let my mind wander.</p>



<p>Thoughts about basketball, my partner, my friends, and the boy I liked.</p>



<p>Today, I was thinking about September.</p>



<p>Or more precisely, about us before we crossed the threshold from one summer to the arrival of autumn.</p>



<p>About Chitose.</p>



<p><em>──And yet, there were other girls in his heart.</em></p>



<p>He had apparently said that with a pained expression after prefacing with “Yuuko is also in my heart”.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at what a clumsy guy he was.</p>



<p>Why couldn’t he just say, “Please wait a little longer for my answer”?</p>



<p>I could pretty much guess which girls he was referring to.</p>



<p>Yuuko, Uchi, Haru, Nishino-senpai,</p>



<p>──and then, me.</p>



<p>It might be a bit presumptuous, but I wasn’t so naive or cowardly as to exclude myself here. Right now, I think there were five girls in Chitose’s heart, including me.</p>



<p>So, even if I were to show some signs of happiness, it’s not something I could wholeheartedly celebrate because I understand his internal struggle.</p>



<p>It was undeniable that he had different feelings towards us compared to his other classmates. But that could only be considered a friendship, or partnership, or admiration…</p>



<p>It was still a form that’s different from love, at least, for now.</p>



<p>He had been tossed around too much by illusions and disillusionments. Naming it “love” could wait until the very end.</p>



<p>I used to think that way before I truly met the real Chitose.</p>



<p>For example, someone you talked to the most at school, someone you could spend time with like family, someone who ran alongside you with the same passion, someone who recognized your true self without pretense.</p>



<p>I had seen so many people who plastered the label of “love” on such trivial reasons, only to peel it off just as easily and get carried away on their own.</p>



<p>To use love as an excuse to hurt someone without taking responsibility.</p>



<p>My past self, and maybe even you now. I’m sure we both thought that way.</p>



<p>Because you didn’t want to hurt the people you cared about even more, you just didn’t know which of these feelings should be called “love.”</p>



<p>In other words—</p>



<p>I scooped up the hot water absentmindedly. As I gazed at Nanase Yuzuki, who floated and swayed in the palm of my hand, I couldn’t help but think.</p>



<p>The feelings Chitose had for me could easily be labeled as “birds of a feather”. It was honestly annoying, and I let out a wry smile as I sighed.</p>



<p>I thought about Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>Honestly, I still didn’t quite understand her. But it was impossible not to see that Chitose admired her, and that he held a special place in her heart as well.</p>



<p>Since their trip to Tokyo, where I pushed their relationship forward, the air of mystery between them seemed to have faded, but at the same time, it felt like they were weaving an even more elusive bond.</p>



<p>Above all, Nishino-senpai would be going far away soon.</p>



<p>I wonder if one of them will find an answer by then.</p>



<p>I thought about Haru.</p>



<p>Ever since the match against Ashi High in July, I’d noticed my partner’s smoldering emotions. It’s like her feelings were spinning in circles, but at the same time, she didn’t seem to be neglecting her practice or losing sight of her goals. I had been watching with frustration, feeling like I couldn’t do anything concrete to help.</p>



<p>However, on the day of the match against Aki-san and Suzu-san, the senpais we both admired, something changed.</p>



<p>Umi, in particular, seemed to have grasped something. </p>



<p>I was surprised to find out that she was secretly practicing her threes, but if she mastered it, there was no doubt she’d become an even more formidable opponent.</p>



<p>For both her opponents and for me.</p>



<p>Most likely, Umi’s slump was related to her feelings for Chitose. Breaking free from that means she had come to terms with it within herself.</p>



<p>It was both reassuring and challenging to have her on my side as an ally, and yet formidable as an enemy. </p>



<p>I thought about Uchi.</p>



<p>When I thought of her, my chest tightened.</p>



<p>I wanted to understand Chitose more than anyone else, but I couldn’t uncover the hidden feelings he kept inside.</p>



<p>It was her, not me, who understood him the most.</p>



<p>With her strength to run without hesitation for the sake of the person most precious to her, and her kindness that brought everyone together in the end, what was she thinking now?</p>



<p>And then, I thought about Yuuko.</p>



<p>Though I hate to admit it, honestly, right now…</p>



<p>I felt like Chitose’s heart was torn between Uchi and Yuuko.</p>



<p>It wasn’t some cliché story where you became conscious of someone once they confessed their feelings to you, but something else entirely.</p>



<p>──This summer, Yuuko has become remarkably beautiful.</p>



<p>I felt that way during our trip to Kanazawa, and this morning, I was once again struck by it.</p>



<p>I struggled to find the right words to describe the changes that had taken place within her. She seemed more mature, her inner self had grown, and she exuded a modesty that was simply enchanting…</p>



<p>But none of these descriptions seemed quite accurate.</p>



<p>Like the gentle gaze she would give him out of the blue.</p>



<p>Like the soft smiles she reserved only for him.</p>



<p>Like the tender voice with which she called his name, brimming with affection.</p>



<p>It drew me in, leaving me spellbound.</p>



<p>And I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same way too…</p>



<p>Finally, I turned my gaze inward, trying to observe myself as a bystander, with a sense of detachment.</p>



<p>Unlike Nishino-senpai, whose parting was imminent, or unlike Haru, who had formed a strong bond through sports, or unlike Uchi and Yuuko, who had revealed their true feelings…</p>



<p>I, as a girl, should have been able to bridge the gap of emotional distance between us, more seamlessly than anyone else.</p>



<p>Moments that felt more like those of lovers had gradually increased, surpassing the time when we were just pretending to be a couple.</p>



<p><em>Is this really okay?</em> I wondered. But at the same time, I realized that it was indeed acceptable.</p>



<p>After all, the absence of a special bond could also be seen as the flip side of being able to be close to someone without any special reason.</p>



<p>I stepped out of the bathtub and looked at myself in the mirror.</p>



<p>Despite all the ups and downs this summer, we had finally settled into a calmer state as September arrived. Yuuko’s confession and its aftermath should push us into a brief moment of stagnation, for better or for worse.</p>



<p>I obtained Yuuko’s permission to explain the situation to Haru, and Nishino-senpai probably heard from Chitose by now.</p>



<p>But I doubt anyone could honestly say, after hearing all that, “If it were me, his answer would have been different.”</p>



<p>We still needed to take some more time to confront this love that’s not yet concluded.</p>



<p>But at least for now…..</p>



<p>As I surrendered myself to the distant sounds of the next festival’s music, maybe I could enjoy the days spent with everyone.</p>



<p>So until the day you give your feelings a name,</p>



<p>──It would be nice if this facade could continue forever.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>13</strong></p>


<p>A few days after the opening ceremony.</p>



<p>In Class 2-5, we were having a homeroom during seventh period to discuss the overall school festival committee, including the off-campus festival, sports festival, and cultural festival, as well as decide on our class performance for the festival.</p>



<p>As the class president, I, Chitose Saku, was standing at the podium, serving as the moderator, while Yuuko, the vice president, was in charge of taking notes at the blackboard behind me.</p>



<p>For the committee assignments, we decided to have those interested raise their hands, and if there were more applicants than slots available, we would decide through discussion or rock-paper-scissors. </p>



<p>We had discussed in advance that if we all raise our hands for the cheering squad, it would be difficult for others to express their desires, so we planned to wait and see for a while. However, since there were no volunteers, all of Team Chitose successfully joined the cheering squad.</p>



<p>By the way, although we exceeded the quota with a total of eight members, it seemed that none of the students from the second year science class that was from the blue group had any volunteers at all, so there was no problem with us providing the whole team members from our class.</p>



<p>I had already confirmed this with Kurasen beforehand, and apparently it was a common occurrence every year so I wasn’t particularly worried.</p>



<p>In fact, there was still one vacant slot each for a boy and a girl, and I had approached Nazuna and Atomu about it. However, they both had an attitude of “I’d rather die than do it”, and chose roles that were said to have relatively less work.</p>



<p>With that settled, the festival committee selection went smoothly, and now we were discussing our class’s contribution to the cultural festival.</p>



<p>Everyone seemed to be quite enthusiastic about it, as various ideas were being thrown around since a while ago.</p>



<p>“Don’t you guys want to do something related to food after all? Yakisoba! Takoyaki! Hot dogs!”</p>



<p>“Crepes and sweet pancakes like desserts would be nice too!”</p>



<p>“How about a haunted house?”</p>



<p>“Or maybe something like a comedy skit?”</p>



<p><em>Clack, clack, clack, clack.</em></p>



<p>Yuuko wrote down the suggestions on the blackboard in cute rounded letters.</p>



<p>“Yes! Here! Here! Here!”</p>



<p>I looked at the overly enthusiastic guy who stood up, “What is it, Kaito?”</p>



<p>“A maid cafe with cat ears and ‘nyan nyan’ greetings!!!!!!!!!!”</p>



<p>“EEEEHHHHHHH?!”</p>



<p>“Why?!”</p>



<p>Most of the girls voice their opposition.</p>



<p>Haru sighed in exasperation, “Aren’t you watching too much anime because of Yamazaki’s influence?”</p>



<p>Kaito didn’t seem willing to give up easily, “Why not? It will definitely be exciting! Don’t you guys want to hear Yuuko and Uchi saying ‘Welcome home, Master, nyaa~’ or something? Right, Kenta?”</p>



<p>When Kenta was asked, he put his finger on the bridge of his glasses and spoke in a dry voice.</p>



<p>“Asano, fiction is fiction.”</p>



<p>“Kenta, you traitor!”</p>



<p>“It’s time to grow up, you know?”</p>



<p>“Where have those days of passionately talking about cosplay gone?!?!”</p>



<p>The classroom erupted with excitement at their exchange.</p>



<p>The guys secretly looked disappointed that Kaito’s idea seemed to be shot down. There must be some who had already imagined Yuuko and the others in maid outfits.</p>



<p>Of course, I was no exception to this.</p>



<p>At that moment, Kurasen, who had been silently observing the situation from the corner of the classroom, spoke up.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yamazaki.”</p>



<p>Taken aback by his serious tone, Kenta tensed up.</p>



<p>“Y-Yes…?”</p>



<p>Kurasen let out an exaggerated sigh and said with a serious face.</p>



<p>“──Asano is right. Don’t become a boring adult.”</p>



<p>Kenta was caught off guard, not fully grasping what Kurasen was saying and stumbled over his words.</p>



<p>“H-Huh?”</p>



<p>With a needlessly nonchalant expression, Kurasen muttered under his breath.</p>



<p>“I also want to hear ‘Master, welcome home, nyaa.’”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that just sexual harassment, sensei!!!!!!”</p>



<p>Laughter erupted here and there in the classroom. Kenta should have realized by now that Kurasen was this kind of adult.</p>



<p>As I pondered such things, Kazuki shrugged in exasperation.</p>



<p>“You’re so outdated, Kaito.”</p>



<p>Kaito retorted discontentedly, “Well, Kazuki, do you have any good ideas then?”</p>



<p>Kazuki smirked arrogantly, the corner of his mouth quirking up. “How about a daringly captivating cross-dressing cafe?”</p>



<p>Kaito tilted his head in confusion, unable to comprehend. “So, girls dressing up as boys? Who would even be interested in that?”</p>



<p>Kazuki continued with a meaningful smile, “For example, wouldn’t you want to be pinned against the wall and chin-held by Yuzuki who was in a butler uniform?”</p>



<p>“You absolute genius!”</p>



<p>Kazuki, that guy, always came up with outrageous ideas. The classmates who were watching this banter chuckled softly.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nanase, who was usually quick-witted, seemed to be at a loss for words, staring blankly.</p>



<p>It was probably because she wasn’t used to being teased in such a flattering manner by Kazuki. Even I was surprised that he used Nanase as an example.</p>



<p>It seemed like she had been going through some changes herself.</p>



<p>“Me! Me! Me!!”</p>



<p>Next, it was Nazuna who stood up.</p>



<p>“Our class has so many good-looking boys, so how about a cross-dressing maid cafe?”</p>



<p>“YESSS”</p>



<p>“NO WAY!”</p>



<p>The class was divided into two distinct reactions, with the boys and girls responding differently.</p>



<p>Nazuna provocatively placed her index finger on her lower lip, as if enjoying our reactions, and continued teasingly.</p>



<p>“Well, for starters, Chitose-kun could be a frilly maid, right?”</p>



<p>“Hey, cut it out!”</p>



<p>“And Mizushino-kun could do gal-style makeup and wear a girls school uniform, maybe?”</p>



<p>“Spare me, please!”</p>



<p>“And Asano-kun could be, hmm, like a preschooler or something?”</p>



<p>“What kind of humiliation is this?!”</p>



<p>Then, Nazuna directed her gaze to a specific spot in the classroom.</p>



<p>“And Atomu could be a bunny girl!”</p>



<p>“I’ll kill you!!!!!!!!”</p>



<p>At that exchange, our classmates burst into laughter once again.</p>



<p>Once the laughter died down, Nazuna looked over at me, “Jokes aside, what about a drama?” </p>



<p>“Ah, the classic choice.”</p>



<p>Our class activity didn’t have to be limited to the classroom. According to the previous suggestions, for example, if it was a café or a haunted house, we could set it up here, or we could have food stalls like yakisoba or crepes in the parking lot outside. </p>



<p>We could also use the stage if we wished, although it would require coordinating with other classes for time slots.</p>



<p>Nazuna continued, “Depending on what we do, a play could have elements of cosplay for both boys and girls. And depending on everyone’s strengths and weaknesses, the tasks could be easily divided, right?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Those who are comfortable being on stage can act, and those who are not could handle backstage roles like scriptwriting, props, lighting, and costumes, right?”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Preparing for the school festival while simultaneously managing committee activities and class activity was quite labor-intensive. Regardless of what we chose to do, preparations would be demanding, and roles would need to be assigned. </p>



<p>However, having a variety of tasks would make it easier to divide the work.</p>



<p>“Alright then, Yuuko, can you write that down as well?”</p>



<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>



<p>It wasn’t her usual response, and I turned to look at Yuuko. She was writing “drama” on the blackboard, and for some reason, I felt oddly relieved.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>14</strong></p>


<p>In the end, our class held a vote, including joke-like ideas such as “Neko Mimi Nyan Nyan Maid Café,” “GuiguI Crossdressing Café,” and “Cosplay Crossdressing Café.”</p>



<p>We used an anonymous format where we wrote our choices on paper and put them in a box.</p>



<p>Yuuko and I quickly tallied the results, then I spoke up while looking at them.</p>



<p>“Alright, I’m gonna announce the results starting from third place.”</p>



<p>I paused for a moment, clearing my throat.</p>



<p>“In third place, Neko Mimi Nyan Nyan Maid Café!”</p>



<p>“Ehhhhhhhh?!”</p>



<p>The voices of girls and boys mixed together this time.</p>



<p>The girls probably meant, “Who voted for that?” while the boys were disappointed that it didn’t come in first. Looks like quite a few guys took advantage of the anonymity to cast their votes for it.</p>



<p>I felt like I was getting icy stares from the girls in Team Chitose, but I was too scared to look in that direction.</p>



<p>…I wasn’t the only one, right?</p>



<p>I regained my composure and looked at the paper with the results.</p>



<p>“Alright, quiet down, please.”</p>



<p>I double-checked to make sure the rankings were correct, then continued.</p>



<p>“…In second place, we have the Cosplay Crossdressing Cafe.”</p>



<p>“Ehhhhhhh?!”</p>



<p>The voices of both boys and girls were reversed in meaning from third place.</p>



<p>Man, who voted for that? It was a close call.</p>



<p>I glanced at girls from Team Chitose, but none of them met my eyes. Geez, you guys were something else.</p>



<p>Well, if second and third place were like this, then it was a fair trade for both boys and girls.</p>



<p>By the way, Kazuki’s “GuiguI Crossdressing Café” came in fourth place. The idea was a bit niche, and I guess the votes were divided between third and fourth place among the boys.</p>



<p>And so, I looked at my classmates’ faces before making the last announcement.</p>



<p>“And in first place, it’s decided that we’ll do a drama! Let’s give a round of applause!”</p>



<p>“YEAAAAHHH!!!”</p>



<p>Finally, genuine cheers and thunderous applause echoed from both boys and girls.</p>



<p>Well, it was settled in a way that everyone could be happy with. Nazuna’s words had some convincing power.</p>



<p>I looked at the bustling classroom and checked the time on the clock.</p>



<p>The school festival committee and our class’s performance had been decided rather smoothly, leaving us with some extra time during homeroom. I glanced at Yuuko, who smiled and nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“Alright,” I spoke up again. “Although we don’t have to decide today, maybe we should discuss what kind of drama we want to do. Putting aside who will be the actors for now, does anyone have any ideas for something they’d like to see or try?”</p>



<p>After I said that, everyone in the class started buzzing with discussion.</p>



<p>“There are a lot of guys who are good at sports, so maybe something action-oriented?”</p>



<p>“Doing a play based on a popular manga could also be a hit!”</p>



<p>“How about something with a 2.5-dimensional style?”</p>



<p>“Musical-like performances could work too.”</p>



<p>“But wouldn’t that be a huge burden on the actors?”</p>



<p>“It would be better if both guys and girls had their moments on stage, right?”</p>



<p>Amidst the various opinions being thrown around, Nazuna raised her hand.</p>



<p>“How about creating an original piece?”</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek as I responded to her suggestion.</p>



<p>“Well, we’re less than two months away from the main event. By the way, is there anyone here who can write an original script or is interested in trying, even if they haven’t done it before?”</p>



<p>I asked just out of curiosity, but no one raised their hand. I thought it might be possible if someone from the literature club was here, but it seemed like it would be difficult.</p>



<p>Nazuna also quickly gave up after seeing their reactions.</p>



<p>“I see. So maybe we should go with a popular manga or movie, or put our own twist on a classic?” </p>



<p>Hearing that, Kaito immediately chimed in, “If we’re talking about a school festival drama, then Romeo and Juliet, right?”</p>



<p>Nazuna clapped her hands enthusiastically, “Ah, the classic choice! Since everyone probably knows the story, we could set it in modern-day Fukui or something to make it more interesting!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, and all the characters could speak in Fukui dialect!” </p>



<p>“That would be hilarious!” </p>



<p>At that moment, Kurasen, who had been quietly observing the discussion, spoke up.</p>



<p>“Oh, we did Romeo and Juliet last year. And a few years ago, there was a version in Fukui dialect too. It’s not a problem if we do it again, but just wanted to let you guys know.”</p>



<p>Nazuna shrugged disappointedly, “Hmm, knowing that makes me want to do something different now.”</p>



<p>As the moderator for the discussion, I tried to interject, “Well, whether we go for comedy or seriousness, I think the idea of putting a twist on a classic is not a bad direction to consider.”</p>



<p>Looking around the classroom, I could see everyone nodding in agreement.</p>



<p>Nazuna placed a hand on her chin and pondered, “So, the issue is how we’ll handle the source material, right?”</p>



<p>Though it would be rude to say she was rarely proactive in discussions, it seemed like she was genuinely trying to come up with ideas now that her suggestion had been accepted.</p>



<p>Nazuna seemed to be stuck, so she turned to another classmate.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki, do you have any ideas?”</p>



<p>Nanase, who probably hadn’t expected the conversation to turn towards her, widened her eyes slightly before pausing to think.</p>



<p>“Snow White, maybe…?” she mumbled softly.</p>



<p>Her voice had an unusually soft tone, as if her true feelings had slipped out unintentionally.</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s a great idea!” Nazuna exclaimed, standing up and scanning the class.</p>



<p>“It’s quite unique. Unlike Romeo and Juliet, it’s not as mainstream for a high school festival. Plus, isn’t Snow White more stylish than Cinderella, or is it just my bias?”</p>



<p>The whole class burst into laughter at Nazuna’s candid remark.</p>



<p>I was a bit surprised to hear Snow White coming from Nanase, but I agreed with the opinion that it was a perfect choice. Almost everyone was familiar with the story, which made it easier to come up with creative adaptations.</p>



<p>“Ah!” </p>



<p>As if she suddenly came up with something, Nazuna widened her eyes and looked at me.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Chitose-kun, can I take charge for a moment?”</p>



<p>“Sure, go ahead.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing my answer, she walked briskly towards the front. I took a step back and stood next to Yuuko, giving up the podium to Nazuna.</p>



<p>Nazuna raised her right hand lightly and spoke, “To be frank, how many of you actually want to act in the drama?”</p>



<p>The classroom fell silent, and everyone seemed uncomfortable, looking down or glancing at each other. It was hard to tell if they really didn’t want to do it or if they were just too embarrassed to raise their hands.</p>



<p>Before I could interject, Nazuna continued.</p>



<p>“Okay, let’s do this the other way around! Is there anyone who doesn’t want to do it? That’s perfectly normal too. It would be helpful if you could tell me clearly without holding back.”</p>



<p>I let out a short breath. There was no need for me to interrupt.</p>



<p>Without hesitation, Atomu was the first to react with a sluggish hand raised.</p>



<p>That set off a chain reaction, with one after another of our classmates raising their hands until almost everyone had their hand up.</p>



<p>The members of Team Chitose, who were probably trying to be considerate, watched the situation with wry smiles.</p>



<p>“Alright, then let me make a suggestion.” </p>



<p>Nazuna spoke up with an air of ease, as if she had anticipated this.</p>



<p>“The main characters in Snow White are Snow White herself, the queen, the witch disguised as the queen, the prince, and the seven dwarves, making a total of eleven people, right? Why don’t we leave it to Chitose-kun and his cheering squad to take on those roles?”</p>



<p>As if realizing something, Nazuna turned around and clasped her hands in front of her chest.</p>



<p>“Sorry, the order might be off, but what do you guys think, Chitose-kun? I mean, cheerleading preparations can be quite demanding, right? So it might be easier to gather and practice with the same members as well.”</p>



<p>I nodded slightly, as her explanation was just as I had imagined. It was a decent proposal that took into consideration our circumstances.</p>



<p>Yua and Kenta might have some objections, but after all, they would be performing in front of everyone as part of the cheering squad. We could settle those matters at Takokyu.</p>



<p>Nazuna continued, adding more to her proposal.</p>



<p>“If you guys do the backstage work like props and sets, you will have to show your face here often. It’s not like I’m taking your place, but if you guys are willing to take on the roles, I’ll be the class representative and take care of the nitty-gritty details here.”</p>



<p>Indeed, juggling between the cheering squad and the preparations for the drama would be quite challenging. Although I was the class rep in name only, I had been thinking that I couldn’t avoid participating in some way or another.</p>



<p>I looked at everyone’s faces and spoke up, “Personally, I think it’s a good idea.”</p>



<p>Yuuko, who was standing next to me, chimed in, “I agree too!”</p>



<p>Nanase scratched her cheek as she replied, “As actors, we can practice individually for our roles, and the dialogue can be rehearsed during breaks with the cheering squad. It might be more convenient since we have club activities too.”</p>



<p>Haru enthusiastically raised her hand, “I’m in!”</p>



<p>Kazuki glanced at us and nodded lightly, while Kaito gave a thumbs-up.</p>



<p>Even Yua, who had been worried, timidly spoke up, “I-If it’s a role with fewer lines, like a dwarf…”</p>



<p>Kenta also nodded vigorously, “I completely agree.”</p>



<p>Nazuna smiled gratefully and looked at our classmates, “So, is it okay if we leave the acting roles to Chitose-kun and the others?”</p>



<p>“YEAH!” </p>



<p>Everyone in the class responded in unison with enthusiastic applause.</p>



<p>I felt relieved that Nazuna had come up with the idea. It’s not easy for us to propose something like this ourselves.</p>



<p>Then, I suddenly realized something and opened my mouth, “Even if the Queen and Witch roles are played by one person, don’t we still need two more?”</p>



<p>The magic mirror only required a voice, but Snow White, the prince, and the seven dwarfs made at least ten characters while we only had eight people.</p>



<p>Nazuna calmly replied, “No worries, we can have Atomu play the silent dwarf for now, right?”</p>



<p>Before I could even say anything, Atomu’s voice rang out, “There’s no way I’m doing that!”</p>



<p>Nazuna giggled, “Come on, the dwarf’s hat will suit you well.”</p>



<p>“Cut it out already!”</p>



<p>I chuckled softly at their banter. Only Nazuna could treat Atomu like this.</p>



<p>“Alright then, I’ll be the dwarf and you can help with the stage props. Since you’re a go-home club member, help out at least a little.”</p>



<p>Atomu clicked his tongue in response, clearly unhappy.</p>



<p>“…Fine,” he grumbled reluctantly.</p>



<p>He must have realized that arguing further with Nazuna would only make things more complicated. I felt like I was starting to understand the dynamic between the two of them.</p>



<p>Nazuna’s triumphant expression turned towards me, “As for the remaining role, we could just make some adjustments to the script, right?”</p>



<p>I nodded, “It doesn’t have to be strictly faithful to the original anyway.”</p>



<p>Nazuna clapped her hands together excitedly, “Then let’s decide on Snow White, the Queen, and the Prince while we’re at it!”</p>



<p>I checked the time and replied, “That would make it easier to write the script.”</p>



<p>“Exactly!” Nazuna said, before looking at Nanase, “Yuzuki, how about you play Snow White?”</p>



<p>“OOOOHHH!!!”</p>



<p>The class buzzed with excitement at the proposal.</p>



<p>Nanase would definitely make a striking Snow White, not just because she came up with the idea, but also because she had the talent and presence to pull off the lead role.</p>



<p>But Nanase shook her head awkwardly, “I don’t think I’m suited to play Snow White.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?” I raised my eyebrows in surprise.</p>



<p>It was unusual for Nanase to be modest like this. I had expected her to accept the role with a confident smile.</p>



<p>Nazuna also looked slightly taken aback by Nanase’s response.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing the reactions of those around her, Nanase quickly added, “Well, if it’s the role of the queen or the witch, I’ll accept it.”</p>



<p>“Indeed,” Nazuna said, smirking provocatively, “That might suit you better,” </p>



<p>“Hmm? What do you mean, Ayase-san?”</p>



<p>“Well, why don’t you ask the mirror?” </p>



<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at how well they seemed to get along now. It was probably thanks to their trip to Kanazawa the other day.</p>



<p>I glanced at Yuuko’s profile, who was calmly watching their exchange with a smile. It was as if it was only natural for the two of them to make up casually like this.</p>



<p>Well, I shouldn’t be surprised at this point. Yuuko was definitely that kind of girl.</p>



<p>Nanase spoke up, “How about Yuuko as Snow White?”</p>



<p>“Ooooh!?”</p>



<p>The classmates once again buzz with excitement.</p>



<p>Yuuko looks puzzled, pointing at herself with a bewildered expression, “Huh? Me?”</p>



<p>Nazuna laughed in amusement, “Well, Yuuko is probably the only one who can compete with that witch on stage.”</p>



<p>Nanase interjected with a smirk, “It’s the Queen.”</p>



<p>Yuuko responded with a chuckle, her wavy hair swaying softly, “I’m not really confident in acting, though. Are you sure?”</p>



<p>Nanase nodded reassuringly, “No worries, I’ll cover for you even if you forget your lines.”</p>



<p>“In that case…” Yuuko paused, then stood next to Nazuna and declared, “I’m in!”</p>



<p>She raised her hand energetically, shouting with excitement.</p>



<p>“Uooooooohhhhhh!”</p>



<p>The entire classroom buzzed with anticipation, regardless of gender.</p>



<p>Yuuko as Snow White, and Nanase as the Queen. No wonder everyone’s expectations were skyrocketing.</p>



<p>Imaginations were already running wild all around.</p>



<p>“Let’s make a super cute dress for Hiiragi-san!”</p>



<p>“Nanase-san should wear a sexy one!”</p>



<p>“What about the script!?”</p>



<p>“Wow, I want them both to be happy, but…”</p>



<p>“──Wait, what about the prince!?”</p>



<p>Someone’s voice echoed louder than the rest. Nazuna turned around and looked over at me.</p>



<p>“Well, um…?”</p>



<p>With both palms raised towards the ceiling, Kazuki shrugged dramatically, “It’s gotta be Saku, right?”</p>



<p>Kaito glared at me, his face contorted as if he had stepped on a thumbtack, “I’ll let you have it this time.”</p>



<p>Kenta adjusted his glasses with his middle finger, “Just blow yourself.”</p>



<p>Haru, who had been resting her cheek on her hand, smirked, “Mister, you’re good at pompous lines, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>Yua smiled sweetly, but for some reason her voice sounded dry, “Don’t worry, Saku-kun, you’ll look cool.”</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek, “…Well, it’s not like I can refuse, but aren’t you guys pressuring me too much?”</p>



<p>As I said that, the classroom became even more lively with cheers and jeers coming one after another.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose! What do you mean you won’t choose Nanase-san!”</p>



<p>“I don’t know, ask whoever came up with the original.”</p>



<p>“Kidnapping sleeping Hiiragi-san, what kind of twisted plan is this?!”</p>



<p>“It’s not me, it’s the prince!”</p>



<p>“This womanizing prince!!”</p>



<p>“Say that again and I’ll have your head, you insolent fool!!!!!!”</p>



<p>Everyone was excited about the upcoming festival.</p>



<p>If being alone and brooding would only result in spinning wheels, then why not dance together in circles?</p>



<p>Him, her, you, me, and even them.</p>



<p>With a peppy tune on the flute, and the thunderous beat of the drums, we waved our hands and twirled around.</p>



<p>Nazuna beckoned with a playful gesture, and Nanase ascended the podium with grace.</p>



<p>The Queen and Snow White both casted a glance at the inexperienced prince.</p>



<p>Nanase wets her lips with a tantalizing tone and asks,</p>



<p>“Do you like poisoned apples?”</p>



<p>Yuuko narrowed her eyes like a wisp of snow that would disappear at a touch and says,</p>



<p>“Take me with you, Prince.”</p>



<p>If only…</p>



<p>I suddenly thought about this.</p>



<p>If only there was really a magical mirror somewhere, surely, right now, the most pathetic man in the world would be reflected in it.</p>



<p>If only the Queen was truly a Queen.</p>



<p>If only the Prince had only met Snow White.</p>



<p>──And then the two of them would hold hands and live happily ever after, or so the story went.</p>



<p>Conveniently tying up the ends of the tale in such a way.</p>



<p>But what about the hearts that couldn’t be together, left behind on a blank sheet of paper? How do we continue to write the rest of the story?</p>



<p>Perhaps, we were trying to use up the pages until the very end, so that no one ended up alone and lost.</p>



<p>Even knowing it wouldn’t come true, we still found ourselves wishing.</p>



<p>Someday, while bowing our heads on the stage with tears that fell as the curtains closed…</p>



<p>──May everyone be able to clap their hands together and say “and they live happily ever after.”</p>
