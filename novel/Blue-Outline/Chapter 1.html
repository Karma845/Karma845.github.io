<h3>Chapter 1: Tension, Keep it Up!</h3>

<p class="calibre5">“Dinner, huh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On my way home from work, I let out a sigh as I stopped at a supermarket to buy ingredients.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t mind cooking, but when it comes to cooking just for myself, I lose all motivation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though I know I should consider nutritional value, my thoughts stall as if my brain was clouded.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, whatever.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just get some vegetable-like stuff, meat or fish-like stuff, and some carbohydrates should be good enough, probably.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Reaching the same conclusion as always, I picked up a head of lettuce from the display.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When it comes to vegetables, it’s always this: no other options.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Next is…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Wait, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Abruptly, I felt a grip on my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around in surprise, the person standing there was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Konbini/000011.png">

<p class="calibre5">“…Huh? …Uh, what?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry for surprising you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clad in contrasting colors of black and pink, frills with a sweet design, and seductive lace, she stood vivid even under the fluorescent lights.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, she was that girl, wrapped in a fashion style you might call ‘jirai-kei (Landmine)’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her thin, white hand was gripping the arm that I’d been using to put lettuce into my basket.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um …excuse me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t say ‘who are you?’ because I know her face, but it’s not like we’ve had any significant interactions before either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, her eyes were fixated on me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whether it’s because of her attire, her makeup, or just her aura, her eyes strangely lacked any sparkle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They were dark as if it was constantly consuming all the light around them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the first time in my life, I realized there could be a darkness more beautiful than any shining light.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her unique beauty seemed almost out of this world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“About the lettuce…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Lettuce?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“While it’s fine, you’re not getting much nutrition from just that…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt like I heard some words full of the sense of daily life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you’re eating vegetables, try to include some with deep colors. Light-colored vegetables are important too, but ideally, you should have around 120 grams of green and yellow vegetables per day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait, is she seriously talking about this? The gap between her appearance and what she’s saying is too big.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A healthy lifestyle starts with your diet.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She adds, despite the fact that her makeup and fashion scream ‘sickly aesthetic’ or something along those things…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“As for today… ah, tomatoes and eggplants are on sale! Do you like them?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, they’re fine, I guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not a fan of cooking?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I usually just make something simple…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“In that case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Still confused, I ended up answering her questions, and she proceeded to introduce me to various easy recipes using tomatoes and eggplants.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, so you marinate it and then bake it with cheese on top…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s simple but delicious~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe I’ll try that for today then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not sure why she started talking to me, but she doesn’t seem to be someone I should be particularly wary of…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? Hehe, that’s good then…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just when I was starting to let my guard down, alarms rang inside my head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;By all means, please do so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because her smile was so eerily enchanting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eyes that seemed to trap the darkness of the night curved like a bow, and her mouth cracked into a crescent moon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If one were to put it into a sound, ‘(ニイイイ)’ would be the most fitting&mdash;&mdash;it’s an enigmatic way of smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: ニイイイ, Niii is a Japanese sound effect that is often used to depict a particular kind of eerie or unsettling laugh or grin.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her fashion style complemented it; if she were a character in a movie or anime, one hundred out of a hundred people would suspect ‘there’s more to her than meets the eye..’</p>
<p class="calibre5">…No-no, I can’t judge people solely by their appearance!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I was worried because you’re always buying just lettuce.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Wait, always? You’ve been watching me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As if realizing her mistake, she suddenly stops moving.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, I can’t just ignore what she said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, who exactly are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That, um, well, …I, I am…I am so sorry!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, wait…so fast!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wearing shoes that clearly aren’t made for running, she kicked the ground loudly and at high speed, disappearing from sight almost instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Too fast; I can’t even catch up to her even if I tried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wow, she’s full of surprises right until the very end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Somehow, the whole scene feels so surreal that I wonder if I’d hallucinated it because I was tired after my part-time job.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Anyway.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what’s going on anymore, but oh well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Should I buy them… tomatoes and eggplants?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the very least, I think the recommendation seemed somewhat useful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;So, something like that happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The day after, it’s Sunday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Starting my shift in the morning and prepping the store for opening, I told my manager about yesterday’s events.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then he let out a big sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you so calm about? Aren’t you being stalked?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that really what it is?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What else could it be…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Rubbing his temples, the manager shook his head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Be vigilant! You never know what might happen! You should be afraid! The tenacity of girls like that… I, too, back in the day… Ah, just thinking about it gives me chills…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know what you’ve experienced, but could your poor taste in women be the cause?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…We’re getting off-track. Anyway, it’s that girl with the jirai-kei fashion who’s been coming around often, right? I remember her too. Her attire would be unusual even in Tokyo, let alone around here.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This town isn’t so deserted that it feels lonely, but a girl dressed like her would stand out for better or worse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a typical provincial city.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You, You don’t seem to have a sense of urgency, and I’m worried. This is a dangerous situation… Huh? Wait, we’re out of these beans!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I told you that we’re running low and need to reorder, didn’t I?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? You said that? No, you didn’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…There’s a reserve on the third shelf in the back. Please remember it next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, …you’re right! Then it’s all good~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I glare at him, the manager clears his throat with an exaggerated ‘Ahem.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s both have a sense of urgency.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Could it be it’s because of the blood, that we’re both cheerfully careless in similar ways?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Here at work, I use polite language and call him ‘manager,’ but this man is actually my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Incidentally, despite being my relative, he’s a handsome guy with stubble and quite the ladies’ man.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Not sure about that. I think your nonchalance is different from mine.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, it doesn’t matter, just be cautious. Given what I heard from you, she might even know where you live, so especially be careful on your way home.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay, I will. …Ah, it’s already time to open. I’ll go flip the sign outside.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright, thanks.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I step outside, ringing the doorbell as I go.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After flipping the sign to ‘OPEN,’ I notice that there’s already a customer waiting in front of the store.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I apologize for the wait. Welcome.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Y-Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s around my age, probably a high schooler.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With her loosely braided hair swinging, she walks into the shop looking somewhat timid.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That voice sounds familiar somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, never mind. Work is work.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">I go back inside and lead her to a seat, and without even looking at the menu, she orders iced coffee.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Certainly, please wait a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Most people are ordering cold drinks now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s already the end of May, and with the impact of recent global warming, even hot days are being recorded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Before I knew it, nearly two months had passed since I became a senior in high school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Manager, one iced coffee, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…what are you doing, are you an idiot?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I relay the order, my manager reaches over the counter and grabs my head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s the girl, the one with the ‘Jirai-kei’ fashion… It’s not surprising you didn’t recognize her, her clothing and makeup are completely different. …No, her face is pretty much the same, its beauty unchanged by makeup.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah… Yes, the voice! I thought it sounded familiar… Despite the drastically different appearance, you recognized her Manager. Impressive.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Remember this: the most troublesome way a woman can get mad is when you mistake her for someone else. Your ability to recognize people is your lifeline.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I did wonder if relying on that “lifeline” is necessary because he’s juggling relationships with multiple women at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s nothing new, and saying it now would be pointless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, but can I talk to her for a moment?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hold on, hold on, hold on. What if she takes this the wrong way? You’re the type who can’t abandon people, you know. You understand that this could end up really bad, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But I won’t know anything unless I talk to her. I want to thank her for yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I guess you’ve always been that kind of nephew. You’re just like your older brother. Fine, but if she turns out to be really bad news, I’ll kick her out, and then you need stay away from her for good.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Understood.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having received permission from the manager, or rather, my uncle, I head over to her table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Noticing my movement, the girl lifts her downcast face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, it’s definitely her from yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe it’s because her appearance is so different today, but she doesn’t have that bottomless quality in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, her eyes still seem deeply captivating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can I have a word?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having confirmed her reply, I sit across from her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Before she can say anything, I open my mouth to speak.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you for yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The dish you taught me to make was really simple and delicious. I’m going to add it to my regular menu. You really helped me out.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-What?! I… I, uh… I apologize for causing you trouble by stalking you for the past month…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A month!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had no idea…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That means… Ah, before that, may I know your name? My name…I’m Chifuji Kei, a high school senior.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For a moment, I hesitate to give my name to someone who just admitted to stalking me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if I’m going to ask for her name, I feel like I should provide mine as well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m Raihara Amane. I’m also a senior in high school. I go to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The school name she mentions is a well-known, prestigious all-girls school in this area that covers both middle and high school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that place. I’ve heard it’s academically challenging, but they’re pretty lenient with the school rules.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s right. That’s why they didn’t say anything when I dyed my hair like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san points to her hair, which has an inner color dyed pink&mdash;.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right, there was such an obvious clue right here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I must admit it’s a dumb excuse, but her change in fashion made her unrecognizable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, she wears a light-colored dress and an elegant cardigan, topped off with a loose braid.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One could describe her look as that of a ‘gentle and kind older sister’</p>

<p class="calibre5">(the pink in her hair doesn’t clash awkwardly, maybe because her pretty face pulls it off).</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s nice; my school is pretty strict about clothing, but they’re lenient about part-time jobs.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? Which school do you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san abruptly stops her words and shakes her head vigorously.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait, I’m not trying to gather information about you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m not suspicious or anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Though maybe I should be? …Hmm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like yesterday, she doesn’t give off a dangerous vibe when talking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Anyway, why were you following me? I don’t think that we have enough connection to begin with to have a strong attachment to each other.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t be so vain as to think such a beautiful woman fell in love with me at first sight, and turning my memory upside down doesn’t reveal any ‘we actually met before’ kind of moments.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, that is… I’m sorry for this… umm… It might sound strange, but I was simulating.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Simulating?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apologizing with her words, Raihara-san continues.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know how to apologize enough for doing this for my selfish reasons…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Look, there’s been no actual harm, so I don’t really mind. But what do you mean by ‘simulating’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s closely related to why I dress like this. The thing is, I have a dependency, something I wish I could quit but simply can’t. I need to start by explaining that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san leads with such a premise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Facing these strong words about pathological dependency, I braced myself, and then she continued,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I just really, really, really love… taking care of people!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…what?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Taking care? …of people?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I can feel it myself! It’s like a highly concentrated liquid of pleasure is gushing out in my brain when I do that!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, so, you get that when you… take care of people?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but ask,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You said, ‘something I wish I could quit but simply can’t’, but isn’t it fine since it’s a good thing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After that alarming introduction, I had expected something much more dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m puzzled by the discrepancy between what I anticipated and what I’m hearing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, what’s wrong with liking to take care of people?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“People around you would appreciate it, and if Raihara-san enjoys it, isn’t it a win-win situation?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not okay! Because… I’ve actually caused trouble for people by doing it… It’s not good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Causing trouble by taking care of them?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m curious what she means, but her gloomy expression tells me it’s not the best idea to probe further.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fundamentally, all my actions are centered around others, and… I really should be more independent,”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san says, her voice tinged with melancholy as her shoulders slump.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have younger sisters, twins, who are five years younger than me… They’ve been incredibly cute since the day they were born… I clearly remember that even back then, I already had this urge inside me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If her sisters are five years younger, then Raihara-san was five at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking about it, she must have been hardwired with this, perhaps even from birth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When my sisters came into our home, wonderful days began… As I grew older and our parents became busier with work, more responsibilities were given to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Remembering those times, Raihara-san’s cheeks naturally relax.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was overwhelmingly tough, but that’s why it was great… I remember wishing every day, ‘Ah, please Mom and Dad, don’t come home yet.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, back then, Raihara-san was…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“In elementary school. Those were fulfilling days, overly so… Oh, I love my parents! And we get along well.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, she was genuinely praying not to be relieved of her caretaking duties for her sisters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Quite the elementary schooler.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…But then, the twins started growing up. By the time they entered elementary school, they could do more and more things by themselves! Not that it was a problem since they were still at home… But then… but then…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As if smeared in charcoal, Raihara-san’s voice suddenly turns dark.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Last March, upon graduating from elementary school, they both went to Canada to study abroad… They’re into figure skating…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s hand was trembling before my eyes, looked like she was shaking from a withdrawal symptom.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“My father went with my younger sisters, and my mother can perfectly take care of herself. Besides, she’s often too busy with work to come home. So there’s no one, absolutely no one, who lets me take care of them!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve never heard this type of grief before, so I don’t know what to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sometimes, I lose my memory because my days are so colorless… And then, I found myself…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With her eyes wide open, staring into the void, Raihara-san continued in a voice like a scream.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I found myself wandering around! In parks… in shopping malls… Desperately searching for someone, anyone, to take care of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She turned out to be a very unique person, completely different from what I had anticipated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Even though I shouldn’t…My caretaking is a burden on people!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I still don’t understand how being helpful could be a nuisance, but her desperation is clearly coming through.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Large tears are trickling down from her big eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her previous cries were indeed screams of distress.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, um, yes, it must be incredibly hard for you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I&mdash;I’m sorry for losing my composure!…</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s okay. For now, just take deep breaths.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After taking some time to calm down, Raihara-san continued speaking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for my disgraceful appearance. Going back to the beginning of the story… I thought I should practice relying on others. That’s what ‘simulation’ means in this context.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m starting to get the outline of her story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Raihara-san, you’re fixated on taking care of people, but you want to change that. To do so, you’re trying to go in the completely opposite direction by learning how to rely on others. Am I getting it right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly… Simply stopping my desire to care for others didn’t work, as I unconsciously started wandering in search of someone. So, I thought I should try the opposite approach.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Given her situation, it makes sense to feel that she has no other choice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In order to learn how to rely on people, I need to be around someone I can rely on. My family and friends are difficult to approach in that way now. Then, I happened to walk into this shop and saw you, Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m surprised to hear my name, but after all, that was the point of this conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You treat the customers very politely, and you willingly help your troubled coworkers. So, you’re someone people can rely on. I thought that maybe, just maybe, I could rely on you too…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not the type to be relied on, but I’m experienced in working at this shop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And since the manager who should be the most reliable person is the way he is, it’s not surprising she had that impression of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But of course, I can’t just outright ask you to ‘let me be spoiled by you,’ so… umm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san bashfully lowers her face a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I went to an all-girls school, so I have no idea how to approach guys my age…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, so that’s why you mentioned the simulation.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I was wondering what it would be like to act spoiled around someone. That’s why I was observing you and thinking about you in my mind the whole time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So that’s why she was staring at me so intently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It all makes sense now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“At first, I was just watching you in this shop. But then I became curious about how you’d be in other situations. So I started to follow you after work…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Umm, you certainly can take the initiative.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My sisters tell me the same thing. That I’m bold, but in a strange direction.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She may look and seem gentle, but appearances can be deceiving.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So that (Jirai-kei) landmine look of yours is also a symbol of your boldness?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Manager…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The person who probably has been eavesdropping the whole time suddenly joins the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seemingly appearing out of nowhere, the manager places a glass of iced coffee in front of Raihara-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for the wait, here is your order.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, thank you. Umm, about this look…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ‘If I’m going to be the kind of person who relies on others, I thought my appearance should reflect that’, huh? … I guess the ‘landmine’ type is, for better or worse, extreme when it comes to relying on others.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…When I thought about the kind of women who get spoiled the most, this look came to mind. To be honest, I also like how it looks. It’s cute and has a unique worldview.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The ‘landmine look’ equals a woman who can be spoiled?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s an interesting interpretation, and there might be some truth to it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mhm, it really suited you. I see, I’ve got the gist of your story now. Sorry, but may I borrow him for a moment?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh, ah, yes, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, I’ll return him soon.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, the manager grabs my arm and takes me to the end of the counter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Manager, what’s going on? You’re not planning to kick her out, are you? She doesn’t seem dangerous, and from what I heard, it seems like she’s in trouble, so I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I get it, I get it. I figured you’d think that way. So Kei, I’m giving you a manager’s order.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A manager’s order?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. From now on, make plans to go out and have fun with that girl occasionally.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager’s suggestion is something I’d also been thinking about.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there’s a problem with that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d like to, and I’ve been considering how I might be able to do it, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I said it’s a manager’s order, so I’ll cover your pay. On the days you go out, we’ll count it as a regular workday. Your salary won’t be reduced.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since I need to send money home, honestly, I don’t have the time to go out and have fun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I get paid even on days I go out, then that problem is indeed solved, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-Why would you do that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, you’ve been working hard in this shop all this time. I believe the reason this shop was able to achieve this result is because you’ve been supporting the shop. Consider it a bonus.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The manager laughs heartily, then his voice becomes a bit more serious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…This isn’t about me giving you money as your uncle. It’s simply acknowledging a special form of employment as the manager… I’m sure your mother won’t complain.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That…might be true, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then it’s settled! Kei, you want to help that girl out, don’t you? You’re good at taking care of people.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Manager… Thank you… but, will the shop be okay when I’m not here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just pray that it won’t go under.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The slightly serious tone is definitely concerning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, can you write down all the various operational details? There are too many things that only you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll get it done.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a good opportunity to correct the issue of leaving everything up to you. Alright, that settles it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you, Uncle.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s Manager, at least during business hours.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Waving his hand gently, the person who has always been kind to me went back behind the counter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I return to where Raihara-san is waiting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for the wait.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, about that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I told her that I wanted to help address her so-called dependency on taking care of others, and for that, we should frequently meet to try various things together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This isn’t mere simulation; it’s a genuine proposal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, but that would be unfair! I’m extremely grateful, but this only benefits me and doesn’t give anything to Chifuji-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t have much time to hang out with people during my high school life, so it will be a good change of pace for me as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But…to think I’d cause you such trouble!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, if she were the type to easily say ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’ she wouldn’t have this problem of not being able to rely on people in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm… Well then.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright. Would you accompany me in indulging my self-satisfaction since I can’t help but think that I can’t leave you alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? No, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even Raihara-san doesn’t nod to my obviously self-serving phrasing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there’s more to this conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…You mentioned that you want to apologize for stalking me. So, I want you to accept this as a condition of forgiveness.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Doing this should make it difficult for her to decline.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Um, sorry… and thank you for being so considerate…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can I take that as an okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Good, yes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I hope this turns out the way we want it to be.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looks straight into my eyes. And then,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you so much…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s…it’s fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes form an arch, and her mouth curves into a crescent, radiant smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Beautiful, yet somehow eerily unfathomable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…everything is okay, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s not actually a ticking time bomb, is she?</p>

<p class="calibre5">She shouldn’t be…right…?</p>
