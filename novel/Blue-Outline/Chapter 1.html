<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 1: The Spring When I Met You 1</h2>


<p>The day that greatly changed my university life was nothing special; just a very ordinary weekday.</p>
<p>After parking my bicycle in the bicycle parking area, I wiped the sweat off my forehead with the sleeve of my polo shirt.</p>
<p>The weather was nice today, and for mid-May, the temperature was quite high.</p>
<p>After pedaling my bike for thirty minutes, I was drenched in sweat. I’ve heard that the heat in Kyoto is quite harsh due to the high humidity. I can’t help but worry about whether I’ll be able to get through the summer without any trouble.</p>
<p>After the Golden Week holiday, the population on campus significantly decreases. It seems that the freshmen, who had been coming to university diligently since enrollment, gradually learn to skip classes.</p>
<p>There are also a few who catch the so-called May sickness and stop coming to university altogether.</p>
<p>Just as I started walking towards the school building, a loud “Gashan!” sound echoed from behind.</p>
<p>When I turned around, I saw a toppled bicycle and the figure of a female student.</p>
<p>It seemed that the contents of her bag, which she might have put in the bicycle’s basket, were scattered all over, and she was hurriedly picking them up.</p>
<p>Then, something rolled to my feet—a very small cylindrical object, probably a lipstick.</p>
<p>I picked it up and called out to her back</p>
<p>“Um, this…”</p>
<p>She looked up at me with a shock.</p>
<p>The moment I saw her face, I was stunned.</p>
<p>She had curly lashes, impressive double eyelids, large eyes that seemed to draw you in, skin so pale it seemed to stand out, and shiny, peach-colored lips.</p>
<p>She was a glittering beauty that one could inadvertently marvel at for a moment. Uh, I think she’s from the same seminar… What was her name again?</p>
<p>While I was trying to remember, she saw the lipstick in my hand and relaxed her cheeks in relief.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s mine…!”</p>
<p>She took it from me with great care. Her slender white fingers, with pink nails adorned with tiny sparkling stones, were delicate.</p>
<p>“It’s something important to me. Thank you for picking it up, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>She said, smiling. I was surprised that the beauty of our seminar knew my name.</p>
<p>I thought she wouldn’t recognize a plain guy like me. I set her bicycle upright</p>
<p>“Well then,”</p>
<p>I said, and left the spot. I could hear someone saying “Thank you!” from behind, but I didn’t turn around. It’s better not to get involved with such a sparkling beauty.</p>
<p>Crossing the lawn square, I noticed a group of about four boys sitting and frolicking. One of them looked familiar, though I couldn’t remember his name. It seemed he noticed me too as our eyes met, but I just walked past. We weren’t exactly on greeting terms.</p>
<p>After all, I didn’t come to this university to exchange greetings.</p>
<p>When I entered the large lecture hall, I made my way straight to the center of the front row without hesitation.</p>
<p>The Wednesday third-period class is notorious among students as “nap time” because the professor’s voice is so soft and mumbled it’s hard to hear, plus the post-lunch condition doesn’t help.</p>
<p>At the back of the lecture hall, a flashy group of male and female students was talking loudly. From their conversation, they seemed to be from the Faculty of Sociology. Strangely enough, you can somewhat tell the different colors of the students by their faculty.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m from the Faculty of Economics.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more people started coming in, and the seats began to fill up…”</p>
<p>I’ts about to start. There are five more minutes before the class begins.</p>
<p>“……Um. Is it okay if I sit here?”</p>
<p>I heard a whisper-like voice and lifted my face. Bright chestnut-colored long hair swayed smoothly before my eyes, and a sweet, floral scent wafted over, making me involuntarily swallow my saliva.</p>
<p>It was the sparkling beauty I had just picked up the lipstick for. I still couldn’t remember her name.</p>
<p>“Huh?, ah, yeah,”</p>
<p>My voice slightly cracking. Damn, why am I getting nervous, me.</p>
<p>“Excuse me then.”</p>
<p>She said with a smile and hesitantly took a seat next to me.</p>
<p>“Thank you for earlier, Sagara-kun. You’re taking this class too, huh?”</p>
<p>“……Ah.”</p>
<p>“This professor’s voice is really small, right? It’s hard to hear from the back. But the class is interesting, so I thought I’d sit in the front today and listen properly. Sorry for suddenly talking to you.”</p>
<p>“……No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>I gave the bare minimum of responses to her monologue. I can’t come up with, nor do I intend to give, any clever replies.</p>
<p>It was then that I finally remembered her name. It must be ── Nanase Haruko.</p>
<p>I was dreading being chattered at like this for the duration of the class, but when the professor entered the lecture hall, Nanase closed her mouth and began to take notes with a serious expression. Her back was as straight as if she had a ruler stuck behind her.</p>
<p>Even though we’re from the same seminar, there was absolutely no interaction between Nanase and me. I knew nothing about her besides her name. Well, it doesn’t really matter to me anyway.</p>
<p>And yet, while thinking it doesn’t matter, I covertly observed Nanase out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>In our seminar ── no, even looking at the whole university ── I think she’s one of the top beauties. I can understand why the guys in the same seminar make a fuss about how cute she is. Her clothing is something I don’t quite understand, but she seems to dress stylishly. A plain type like me wouldn’t even be on her radar. I have no intention of getting close to her either.</p>
<p>Looking at her perfectly shaped face, earnestly listening to the professor, I felt a sense of nostalgia for some reason.</p>
<p>……This face, I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before. I tried to think where I might have seen her, but no matter how much I searched my memory, I couldn’t recall ever gazing at such a beauty up close.</p>
<p>It must be my imagination, I thought, tearing my gaze away.</p>
<p>When the one hundred and twenty-minute class was over, I shoved my textbook and pencil case into my shoulder bag. That’s when a familiar girl ran up to Nanase.</p>
<p>“Haruko! You were sitting here!”</p>
<p>It was the Kansai dialect, something I’ve grown used to hearing since coming to Kyoto. I don’t know her name, but I think she was probably in the same seminar.</p>
<p>Her slanted eyes were striking, and she seemed like a strong-willed beauty. A friend of the dazzling beauty is dazzling too, I thought.</p>
<p>“Hey Haruko, are you free next Saturday? We’re thinking of having a barbecue with our club members, wanna come?”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so? Um… I’ll check my schedule.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been told by a senior to bring the pretty girl that’s always with you. Please don’t hit on my Haruko! I told him that!”</p>
<p>“Seriously, Sacchan…”</p>
<p>Nanase chuckled, shaking her shoulders, and the gold earrings hanging from her ears sparkled.</p>
<p>“After class, come shopping with me. Let’s also go to the new donut shop.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m going! I also want to buy the new eyeshadow.”</p>
<p>With no intention of eavesdropping on the girls’ conversation, I stood up early. My next language class is in Building Four. I’ll move quickly and do some prep.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun. See you later.”</p>
<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00008-2.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
<p>As I was about to walk away, Nanase called out and waved her hand. “See you,” she said. Surprised by her greeting, I silently gave a slight nod in response.</p>
<p>Just as I was exiting the lecture room, I overheard someone say,</p>
<p>“What’s with that guy? He’s so unfriendly.”</p>
<p>…She said “See you,” but I doubt I’ll have anything to do with Nanase in the future.</p>
<p>Since entering the university, I’ve made a conscious effort to minimize my interaction with others.</p>
<p>I have no interest in joining clubs or extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>After all, a student’s primary duty is to study, so I shouldn’t do anything extra and should focus on attending classes, taking exams, and earning credits.</p>
<p>I’ll engage in conversation if necessary, but I don’t have a single friend. A girlfriend is out of the question.</p>
<p>Some might mock me as a loner, but let them say whatever they want.</p>
<p>I can use my time solely for myself without being disturbed by troublesome social relationships. Being a loner is the best.</p>
<p>A university life of deliberately cutting down on interactions with others has been carefree and comfortable.</p>
<p>After finishing my fifth period class, the sun was already setting. I’ll go home, have dinner, and then it’s straight to my part-time job. The night shift pays well, so I’m grateful for it.</p>


<p>When I straddle my bicycle and start pedaling, I head towards my apartment back home.</p>
<p>I’m from Nagoya, and I’ve been living alone since April.</p>
<p>The reason I chose a private university in Kyoto for my further studies was simply because I wanted to get out of my parent’s house, and I ended up missing the national public university exams due to influenza, leaving me no choice but to attend my backup private university.</p>
<p>At these crossroads in life, I seem to always be plagued by bad luck.</p>
<p>As I make my way through the residential area near the university, I head south on Nishioji Street.</p>
<p>The uphill is tough on the way there, but it’s a breeze on the way back.</p>
<p>There’s a crowd of students in uniforms at the bus stop, likely on a school trip, blocking the way.</p>
<p>Even though it’s a weekday, the buses are packed with tourists. The students who commute by bus must have a hard time.</p>
<p>Continuing south, I reach Sanjo Street and come across the train tracks in the middle of the intersection.</p>
<p>This is where the trams, known as Randen, run. (tln : kyoto electric train)</p>
<p>As I wait for the signal to turn green, I casually glance over the tracks and, oh, I notice her. A girl with her back straight, pedaling a bright red bicycle with her chestnut-brown long hair fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>It’s Nanase, whom I had a conversation with today.</p>
<p>Judging that it would be troublesome if she noticed me, I wait a bit even after the signal turns green, and only start pedaling again after her figure has shrunk in the distance.</p>
<p>However, Nanase’s figure doesn’t disappear no matter how long I wait, which makes me a little anxious.</p>
<p>Maybe she lives quite close? It’s quite far from the university, and I liked that I didn’t run into people I know.</p>
<p>Crossing another intersection, I see Nanase turn west at the corner of the post office.</p>
<p>I slowly turn the corner myself and see that she has just gotten off her bicycle.</p>
<p>As she goes up the stairs of an old apartment building, I’m shocked.</p>
<p>“…Seriously? She lives in the same place…”</p>
<p>I live in an apartment building that’s over forty years old with a unit bath and a single room.</p>
<p>It’s run-down and far from the university, but the rent is incredibly cheap.</p>
<p>Nanase stops in front of a corner room on the second floor. She takes out a key from her bag, unlocks the door, and goes inside. I can’t help but let out an involuntary groan.</p>
<p>Of all places, she lives next door.</p>
<p>Is such a coincidence even allowed? I can’t believe I haven’t noticed for a whole month.</p>
<p>Why would such a beautiful girl live in a run-down apartment like this? It’s so different from what I imagined that it feels strange.</p>
<p>For security reasons, shouldn’t she be living in a newly built apartment with auto-locks?</p>
<p>When I get to the bike parking lot, I park my bicycle as far away from Nanase’s as possible.</p>
<p>As I climb the stairs of the apartment, they make a loud, clanging noise.</p>
<p>I take out my key and enter my room as quietly as possible.</p>
<p>I’ll have to be careful not to let her notice me from now on.</p>
<p>I’ve been living here since April, and the walls of this apartment are thin, so all the living noises go straight through.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve hardly paid attention to it until now, just the thought that Nanase is right there… Okay its okay…</p>
<p>She’s practically a stranger to me.</p>
<p>I shake my head vigorously and flop onto the futon that’s been laid out on the floor. My room doesn’t have a TV or a bed. The only piece of furniture is a small low table.</p>
<p>There’s a fridge, rice cooker, and a microwave, which are barely there, but since I don’t cook, the fridge is almost empty. I seem to remember buying udon for thirty yen at the supermarket.</p>
<p>I’ll just boil that today, add some soy sauce, and eat up.</p>
<p>After eating, I’ll take a nap until it’s time for my part-time job.</p>
<p>As I close my eyes and think about this, that’s when it happened.</p>
<p>“Kyaahhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>A terrible scream echoes from the next room. It’s Nanase’s voice.</p>
<p>I jump up in a panic and dash out of the room, hesitating for a moment before deciding whether to press the intercom…</p>
<p>If I do, she’ll find out I’m living next door.</p>
<p>I mentally slap myself for even thinking that. Idiot, what if it’s an emergency! If it’s nothing, that would be the best outcome!</p>
<p>Just as I resolve myself, something slams into my face with a tremendous impact, causing me to stagger. “Ouch…”</p>
<p>As I realize the door in front of me has opened, at the same time ── something soft jumps into my chest. Reflexively, I end up holding it in an embrace. A sweet scent delicately tickles my nostrils.</p>
<p>“Go, go, go, go,”</p>
<p>the woman pressing her face into my chest is clearly distraught. Trembling, she screams in a high-pitched voice from the back of her throat.</p>
<p>“Cockroach!!”</p>
<p>…Ah, a cockroach. I see.</p>
<p>While enduring the stinging pain in my nose, I let out a sigh of relief. My face might not be in the best shape, but at least it’s nothing serious.</p>
<p>I gently pat Nanase’s back to calm her down, trying my best not to focus on the soft sensation pressed against my stomach, and hiding my inner turmoil.</p>
<p>“Do you have bug spray?”</p>
<p>“Ah? Uh, um, Ughh… no, I don’t…”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>I tightly roll up the old magazine, then step outside again.</p>
<p>Before entering, I call out to Nanase, “I’m coming in,” and then step into her room.</p>
<p>By the way, this is actually the first time I’ve ever entered a girl’s room in my life.</p>
<p>As I search for the cockroach, I take the opportunity to look around the room.</p>


<p>So I realized, entering a girl’s room is actually a first for me in my life.</p>
<p>While I was searching for cockroaches, I took the opportunity to look around the room.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much in the way of decoration inside, but on top of a small TV, there was a cute cactus placed there.</p>
<p>A huge closet and clothes hanging on a rack were taking up quite a bit of space in the small room.</p>
<p>The bookshelf was packed full of reference books. On the low table in the center of the room, there was a large square box with a mirror attached to it—</p>
<p>Probably contains makeup or something. Then, I saw something black creeping out from under the bed.</p>
<p>I raised an old magazine and slammed it down. After crushing it, I collected it with a tissue, and turned back to Nanase who was outside.</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll wipe the floor later.”</p>
<p>“…! Ah, thank you very much!”</p>
<p>Nanase, who had been crouching and trembling, suddenly raised her face.</p>
<p>The moment I saw her face, my brain became confused, not understanding what had just happened…</p>
<p>…Who exactly is this girl in front of me now?</p>
<p>“…Na, Nanase?”</p>
<p>What stood there was not the Nanase Haruko that I knew.</p>
<p>She had a plain, modest face that one might forget the moment they passed by her.</p>
<p>With red-rimmed glasses, dressed in a navy tracksuit, her chestnut-brown long hair casually tied into two.</p>
<p>I saw Nanase’s face blink and turn pale, losing color.</p>
<p>“Sa, Sa, Sa, Sagara-kun…”</p>
<p>She was opening and closing her mouth like an oxygen-deprived goldfish.</p>
<p>The moment I saw her face— A certain memory resurfaced in my mind. I almost let out an “ah,” but I managed to hold it back just in time.</p>
<p>“…Sa, Sagara-kun. Wha, wha, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Upon further reflection, for her, a guy from the same seminar she wasn’t close to suddenly barging into her room must seem like an emergency.</p>
<p>Even if it was an emergency, it wouldn’t be strange for her to mistake me for a stalker.</p>
<p>Before she could call the police, I hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“Ah, no, I… I live next door to you… Then I heard a scream, so that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Ah!? So, that was it? I had no idea…”</p>
<p>“I also only noticed today.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. It must have been loud, right?”</p>
<p>Her voice was weaker and less confident than when I see her at university. Usually, she seems a bit more assertive.</p>
<p>“Ah, um… Thank you for helping me, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase said that and bowed her head deeply. I was taken aback by her straightforward thanks.</p>
<p>Of course, I hadn’t told a single lie, but the way she easily believed my story made me think she was a bit too naive.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should leave this place quickly. I had no intention of getting involved with her any further.</p>
<p>“…Well, I’ll be going then. This apartment seems to get a lot of bugs, so you might want to buy some insecticide.”</p>
<p>With that, we can both go back to pretending not to know each other.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, Nanase and I will continue living our lives as strangers without any interaction.</p>
<p>My comfortable solo life is safe.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>As I was about to leave, the hem of my parka was grabbed.</p>
<p>“Um… Were you surprised?”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00009-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“My no-makeup face… It’s totally different from usual, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase asked anxiously. I thought it would be a lie to deny it, so I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>The woman standing before me now hardly seems like the same glittering beauty from the seminar.</p>
<p>She’s not ugly by any means; each facial feature is well-shaped, but she gives off a plain and simple impression.</p>
<p>She lacks the usual glamour. Makeup sure is powerful.</p>
<p>“…Don’t tell anyone, okay?”</p>
<p>It seems she’s worried that I might blurt out to others how plain she looks without makeup. That’s an unnecessary worry.</p>
<p>“I won’t say a word. I don’t have friends anyway.”</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase’s eyes softened, relieved. She seemed calmer and kinder than when she wore makeup.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Really, I don’t want anyone to know… I was really plain in high school, kind of like I made a debut in college.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>
<p>I blurted out before realizing that I shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>“…Huh. How do you know?”</p>
<p>Nanase looked puzzled as she tilted her head. Resigned to my fate, I decided to reluctantly come clean.</p>
<p>“Nanase… you’re from Koryo High School, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“W-what?!, how, how do you know!?”</p>
<p>“…I, I went to the same high school as you.”</p>
<p>When I saw Nanase’s plain face, what came flooding back into my mind were memories from just a few months ago, from our high school days. A plain and serious librarian sitting at the counter in the library, studying.</p>
<p>Nanase Haruko was my classmate in high school.</p>
<p>However, it’s not like we had the kind of relationship where we could reminisce about the old days, and that wasn’t my intention anyway. After all, from Nanase’s perspective, it might just feel creepy to be remembered by someone she didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Ah!? U-uh, no way!? Is, is that even possible…!? I-I can’t believe it…”</p>
<p>Nanase was astonished. Honestly, I felt the same way. To have attended the same high school, to have gone on to the same university in Kyoto, and to even be in the same seminar and living next door… The odds of such coincidences are astronomical.</p>
<p>“Just to be clear… I’m not a stalker or anything.”</p>
<p>“Uh? U-uhm, I know.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Nanase’s name, and you’ve changed so much I didn’t recognize you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I… I don’t remember you, Sagara-kun…”</p>
<p>Nanase looked down dejectedly. It’s only natural she wouldn’t remember a plain guy who was just always there in the library. So I wish she wouldn’t look so apologetic about it.</p>
<p>“…We never interacted anyway. Plus, I’ve changed my last name since high school. It’s normal not to remember. I won’t bother you at the university, so don’t worry. See ya.”</p>
<p>With that said in a rush, I left without looking back.</p>


<p>I left her room. Immediately returning to my own, I let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>If Nanase wants to keep her high school past a secret from those around her, then she should stop talking to me from now on. It’s a given that she wouldn’t want to associate with someone who knows about her past.</p>
<p>For someone like me who desires solitude, this is a more convenient outcome.</p>
<p>Despite today’s unexpected event, I’m sure tomorrow will bring back the peaceful days. Relieved, I filled a pot with water and set it on the stove to boil some udon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love putting on makeup.</p>
<p>When I apply foundation over my makeup base and add blush, my skin becomes beautifully white and clear, with healthy-looking cheeks. Using double eyelid tape and fake lashes, and drawing on eyeliner transforms me into having big, captivating eyes like an idol.</p>
<p>It’s fun to see my plain and unremarkable face change into something glamorous, like painting on a blank canvas.</p>
<p>Lastly, I apply lipstick and smile brightly at myself in the mirror. Strangely enough, doing this seems to well up a sense of confidence within me.</p>
<p>At that moment, I heard the sound of the door next door closing.</p>
<p>It’s eight in the morning now. He came home at dawn, and it seems he’s already leaving for campus. I wonder when he sleeps; it’s worrying.</p>
<p>…To think that the boy from the same seminar lives next door. And to think he was a classmate from my high school…</p>
<p>I had my first conversation with him— Souhei Sagara-kun—just yesterday. He doesn’t try to mingle with anyone.</p>
<p>He’s always seated at the front of the lecture hall, listening intently to the professor.</p>
<p>Everyone says, “That guy is seriously serious,” but I felt a sense of kinship and positive regard for him.</p>
<p>Seriousness is a virtue. At least, that’s what I believe.</p>
<p>Up until high school, I was a girl whose only redeeming feature was being serious.</p>
<p>I never wore my uniform sloppily, never dyed my hair, and makeup was absolutely out of the question.</p>
<p>I was always punctual and never missed a class, spending my breaks glued to my desk, studying. Thanks to that, my grades were good, but that was all.</p>
<p>It’s not that I was hiding things or being ignored or gossiped about.</p>
<p>However, my classmates were somewhat distant towards me, and during pair work in class, I was always the one left over.</p>
<p>“Nanase-san is serious, so she’s a bit different from us, right?”</p>
<p>The girls in the group I was pityingly included in for the school trip said so without any malice. I, pretending not to be hurt, replied with a smile, “That’s right.” Then, I tried not to be a nuisance, quietly following from a little distance behind.</p>
<p>My memory of the school trip is nothing but the backs of my classmates.</p>
<p>My high school life was empty.</p>
<p>I don’t have a single memory. I just went to school and breathed every day.</p>
<p>I didn’t have anyone I could call a friend. Not to mention a boyfriend, I didn’t even have someone I liked.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a sparkling high school life just like everyone else.</p>
<p>I wanted to dress up, hang out with friends, experience a romance like in shoujo manga, and go on dates with a boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it not too late to start now?”</p>
<p>“You still have plenty of time,” she said, giving me a push on the back.</p>
<p>It was my cousin whom I admired. I called her “Onee-chan” and was as close to her as if she were my real sister.</p>
<p>“But I’m not cute like Onee-chan.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Haruko can become cute from now on.”</p>
<p>My cousin said so and gave me a lipstick as a gift. That was the first cosmetic I had ever received in my life.</p>
<p>After that, I applied to the same university in Kyoto that my cousin had attended. I wanted to start over, away from home, in a place where no one knew about me.</p>
<p>As soon as I received the acceptance notice, I bought a full set of cosmetics, clothes, and accessories.</p>
<p>I went to the hairdresser to change my hairstyle and got my ears pierced.</p>
<p>The New Year’s money I had been saving since elementary school was gone in no time, but I felt refreshed.</p>
<p>I will change. I can definitely change. I will show that I can change!</p>
<p>With that determination, I came to Kyoto, dreaming of a rosy college life.</p>
<p>After applying makeup and zoning out for a while, I realized that five precious minutes of the morning had passed. I had wasted five valuable minutes of the morning.</p>
<p>After choosing clothes from my closet and changing, I tie my hair up high and curl the ends lightly.</p>
<p>Since I’m styling my hair up, I choose larger earrings. I decide to wear the open-toe pumps I bought the other day.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it makes my heart flutter with excitement. It’s fun to think about fashion that suits me.</p>
<p>After applying sunscreen carefully, I step outside my room. The landlord, who is about the age of my grandmother, was watering the flower bed. “Good morning!” I call out to her, and the landlord squints her eyes and replies, “Good mornin’. It’s gonna be hot today, take care.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m off,” I reply, bowing my head before straddling my bicycle.</p>
<p>The landlord, with her back hunched, sends me off with a gentle smile. I wave back at her as she waves to me.</p>
<p>If it were the old me, I would have mumbled a greeting in a mosquito-like voice, then passed by looking down. I take a deep breath and start pedaling with all my might.</p>
<p>It takes about thirty minutes by bike from my apartment to the university.</p>
<p>It’s early in the morning and there aren’t many people, so I park my bike at the bike rack closest to the campus building.</p>
<p>While walking on campus, someone taps me on the shoulder. “Haruko! Good morning!”</p>
<p>It was a beautiful girl in a white shirt and slim, damaged denim who called out to me. With slightly upturned eyes, she had a feline-like appearance. “Ah, Sacchan. Good morning!”</p>
<p>She is Sacchan—Sudo Saki-chan. She was my first friend I made since entering university.</p>
<p>We became friends during a seminar orientation. In the middle of the lecture, Satchan said to me,</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that professor look like a Tibetan sand fox?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but burst out laughing after looking at the professor’s face.</p>
<p>Afterward, we went for tea at a cafe inside the university campus.</p>


<p>After we had tea, we exchanged LINE contacts. It was the first time I had added someone other than family to my brand new smartphone.</p>
<p>“Ever since I first saw you, I definitely wanted to become friends with Haruko.”</p>
<p>While drinking iced tea, Sacchan said this with a laugh.</p>
<p>There are only five girls in our seminar, including me. That a girl as pretty and stylish as Satchan talked to me made me feel happy and proud. If I had still been my former self, she probably wouldn’t have chosen me.</p>
<p>The words of my former classmates, “Nanase-san is different from us,” still cling to me like a black stain deep in my heart.</p>
<p>Walking beside me, Sacchan covered her mouth with her hand and yawned widely.</p>
<p>“Seriously, first period is so tiring. I was playing with my circle friends yesterday too.”</p>
<p>“Sacchan, it must be tough since you live so far.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, even though I took the last train home yesterday, I woke up at six today. My makeup is super slapdash.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, I scrutinized Sacchan’s face. Her slightly slanted eyes were a beautiful shade of grey, and her nose was straight. Even with casual makeup, she was beautiful. And here I am, spending over an hour on makeup.</p>
<p>“Haruko, you come in early. I missed the perfect timing for the Hankyu train and got here too early.”</p>
<p>At Sacchan’s words, I glanced at my wristwatch. The time was 8:45 AM. There are fifteen minutes until class starts, so I don’t think it’s too early. But it seems for most students, “just right” means darting into the classroom right before the lecture starts.</p>
<p>“It must be nice, Haruko, living on your own.”</p>
<p>Sacchan commutes from her parents’ home in Osaka, taking the Hankyu train and city bus. It takes an hour and a half, so waking up early is tough for her, she once complained.</p>
<p>“But the university is far, and it’s not that convenient.”</p>
<p>“If I ever miss the last train, let me stay over. Actually, I want to come over to hang out!”</p>
<p>“Uh, umm… My place is kind of small…”</p>
<p>While saying that, I thought of my six-tatami one-room castle. I’m a bit hesitant to invite friends over. It can’t be helped that I prioritized cheapness over comfort. No key money, no deposit, and a rent of 40,000 yen—it’s a bargain considering the location. I want to spend as much of my living expenses as possible on cosmetics and clothes.</p>
<p>Even though I knew it was run-down, I never expected cockroaches to appear.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun who defeated the cockroach for me was, without exaggeration, a godsend.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for him, I might never have been able to return to my room.</p>
<p>Today, I’ll buy some insecticide at the drug store on my way home.</p>
<p>…Now that I think about it. Inviting a boy into my room was a first for me.</p>
<p>Lost in such thoughts, I arrived in front of the classroom.</p>
<p>Today’s first period is compulsory English. We were sorted into English classes based on our initial test scores at the beginning of university, and I was placed in the top class.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun is also in the same class.</p>
<p>“Let’s have lunch together later. I’ll message you on LINE when it’s over.”</p>
<p>Sacchan said that, then walked away with a light step. I waved goodbye and entered the classroom.</p>
<p>In language classes, unlike other classes, seats are assigned. My seat is at the front by the window.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun’s seat is the second from the back in the middle.</p>
<p>I immediately spotted him, dressed in a black T-shirt and cargo pants, probably having arrived early to study on his own.</p>
<p>He’s always been serious.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, he knows me from high school, the plain and unremarkable me.</p>
<p>He said he wouldn’t tell anyone, and it’s not that I doubt him, but it’s unsettling to have someone unilaterally hold a secret about you.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara-kun. Good morning.”</p>
<p>When I called out to him, Sagara-kun looked up with a start, then frowned as if annoyed.</p>
<p>“…What? I’d rather you didn’t talk to me too much…”</p>
<p>“Um… about yesterday…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I get it. I won’t tell anyone. Not like I have anyone to tell.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun said that and focused back on his textbook. Feeling his strong will to not continue our conversation, I meekly returned to my seat.</p>
<p>…Is it really okay, though? He says he doesn’t have friends, but…</p>
<p>After a while, the American native teacher came into the classroom. With a cheerful “Good morning!” the students returned a sparse and mumbled “Good morning.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Sagara-kun, sitting diagonally behind me, but as usual, he was taking the class seriously and didn’t even try to look my way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The student cafeteria bustles with students during the lunch break. Staring intently at the menu posted above the counter, from top to bottom. Among the offerings of the affordable and hearty No. 2 cafeteria, the cheapest is the plain udon for 100 yen.</p>
<p>I open my wallet with a prayerful heart and check the contents.</p>
<p>All that’s inside are two ten-yen coins. In other words, I have to get through the last day before payday with just 20 yen.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to waste any money, but it seems that the expenses of starting a new life are now catching up with me.</p>
<p>Last month, my part-time job was still in the training period, so the hourly wage was low, which hurt because I hadn’t earned as much as I expected.</p>
<p>For a moment, I considered contacting my mother, but I immediately concluded that I absolutely did not want to.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, I don’t want to rely on my parents.</p>
<p>After all, I haven’t received a single yen in allowances.</p>
<p>…Can’t be helped, I’ll have to endure. I can get through today somehow.</p>


<p>While being pulled by my lingering feelings, I left the school cafeteria and began to wander aimlessly. Today, after classes, I have a part-time job from midnight until morning. I plan to nap somewhere to conserve my energy as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Just then, as my name was called from behind and I stiffened in surprise.</p>
<p>The voice, which I’ve grown accustomed to hearing, was Nanase’s. I tried to ignore it and kept walking, but then I heard “Sagara-kun!” once more.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I stopped and turned around. “Haa, haaa… Wh-why are you ignoring me? You definitely heard me, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase, panting, was glaring up at me with her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Do you need something?”</p>
<p>“Um, it’s not that I need anything, but… Sagara-kun, are you going to have lunch now?”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled cheerfully and peered into my face.</p>
<p>For some reason, even after she had seen my true face, she would frequently talk to me like this.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s worried that I’ll spread her secrets around.</p>
<p>I would never do such a thing, though.</p>
<p>“I don’t have lunch.”</p>
<p>“Huh, why not?”</p>
<p>“…It’s right before payday, I’m broke.”</p>
<p>I muttered my reply, and Nanase’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>She pondered for a moment and then hesitantly made a suggestion.</p>
<p>“Then… would you like to share my bento? The side dish is leftover asparagus pork rolls from yesterday, but I did a great job with the tamagoyaki today. If you’d like, we could share…”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>As I responded, Nanase looked down sadly. The moment I saw her expression, guilt stabbed at my heart.</p>
<p>It’s not like being rejected by someone like me would bother her. Why would she make that face?</p>
<p>Passing male students would glance at Nanase and then away.</p>
<p>They must be wondering why such a beautiful woman is with a plain guy like me.</p>
<p>Nanase, with makeup on, is a radiant beauty. Every time she blinks, her long eyelashes flutter, and her large eyes reflect the sunlight like sparkling jewels.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to get involved with her more than necessary, but I don’t want to hurt her either.</p>
<p>I softened my tone just a bit and added,</p>
<p>“…Sorry. But I really don’t need it. That’s your bento.”</p>
<p>“But you’re hungry, right?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>As I said that, my stomach growled loudly in protest. Nanase’s eyes filled with sympathy for me when she heard the loud rumbling of my stomach.</p>
<p>…Damn, how embarrassing. I clicked my tongue as if to cover it up and started walking quickly again.</p>
<p>Perhaps finally giving up, Nanase didn’t follow me.</p>
<p>After finishing classes and returning home, I lay sprawled on the tatami, blankly staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>I know it’s pointless to waste time like this, but I don’t want to consume any more energy than necessary.</p>
<p>As I closed my eyes and tried to ignore my hunger, the scent of curry wafted through the air.</p>
<p>My stomach growled even louder at the smell.</p>
<p>The source of the aroma was the room next door.</p>
<p>Apparently, Nanase was making curry. The image of the glamorous beauty I saw at the university combined with the plain and modest face of the library committee member.</p>
<p>…No one would normally think they’re the same person.</p>
<p>In high school, Nanase was plain and inconspicuous. I remembered her face because she was a library committee member, and there was a time when I frequented the library.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go home at the time, so I was looking for a place to kill time after school.</p>
<p>I didn’t belong to any clubs or committees, so I ended up in the library in the corner of the old school building.</p>
<p>The librarian at the counter was always the same girl — Nanase.</p>
<p>The high school library wasn’t well-equipped, but it was always clean and tidy. Books that students had carelessly returned to the shelves were promptly put back in their proper places.</p>
<p>The writing on the notice “Return due by ◯ month ◯ day” was beautiful.</p>
<p>I knew it was her handiwork.</p>
<p>The reason I frequented the library was that it was a comfortable place. The plain, serious librarian never showed any irritation towards me, even though I stayed until the last minute of afterschool hours.</p>
<p>I only spoke to her once, just before graduation. After the closing time, as she was locking up, I asked her a question.</p>
<p>—Was I in the way?</p>
<p>She answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>—Not at all.</p>
<p>Surely, to her, it was nothing but a casual remark. However, the moment I heard her answer, I felt as if I had been saved.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had no intention of spreading rumors about her, whether she had made her university debut as a beauty or if her makeup-free face was plain.</p>
<p>In the first place, I didn’t have any friends to tell. If she could live happily without my knowing, that was fine with me… That’s what I thought, and yet.</p>
<p>Why does she bother with me? Now that she’s become beautiful and made her university debut, she should just leave me alone and enjoy her university life to the fullest.</p>
<p>The delicious smell wafts through the open window again.</p>
<p>Just being tantalized by the scent of curry without being able to eat anything is too much to bear.</p>
<p>Damn, if only I had even just plain rice…</p>
<p>I went to the kitchen to at least drink some water when the doorbell rang. Who could it be at a time like this? When I opened the door, there stood Nanase, holding a large pot.</p>
<p>She was wearing her makeup-free glasses and high school track suit.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>I asked in surprise, and Nanase slightly lifted the pot she was holding.</p>
<p>“I made curry, but I made too much. Won’t you eat some? It’s hard to make just one serving.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll refrain.”</p>
<p>I said so out of a desperate show of restraint, but Nanase did not back down.</p>
<p>“I can’t finish all this by myself. I’d be happy if you could help me consume it.”</p>
<p>Nanase lowered her eyebrows and flashed a troubled smile.</p>
<p>My will wasn’t strong enough to keep refusing when faced with such a tempting aroma of delicious curry.</p>
<p>I resigned myself and took the pot.</p>
<p>“…But I don’t have any rice.”</p>
<p>“What, you don’t even have rice!?”</p>


<p>Nanase let out a pained voice. Feeling unbearable under her pitying gaze, I quickly looked away.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll bring some rice too. It’s a good thing I cooked extra. Just wait a little, okay?”</p>
<p>After a short while, Nanase returned carrying a bowl heaped with white rice.</p>
<p>“Will this be enough?”</p>
<p>I nod silently. It’s more than enough.</p>
<p>“Good! After you’ve finished eating, I’ll come to collect the pot and dishes. I hope it’s to your taste.”</p>
<p>With that, Nanase turned on her heel and went back to her room.</p>
<p>I placed the curry pot and the bowl on the low table, took out a curry plate I hadn’t used since moving in, and served myself rice and curry.</p>
<p>After putting my hands together, I took a bite of the curry. I couldn’t help but exclaim,</p>
<p>“Wow… this is… really delicious…”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was partly due to my hunger, but Nanase’s curry was exceptionally good. The vegetables cut into small pieces were plentiful and melted into the thick roux. The right amount of spiciness and flavor soaked into my empty stomach.</p>
<p>In the end, I finished all the curry neatly. No matter how much she had made, the amount she brought over was too much just for a neighborly share.</p>
<p>She must have made the curry especially for me, knowing I was hungry.</p>
<p>…I really have to thank her for this.</p>
<p>After washing the pot and bowl in the sink, I headed to Nanase’s room. When I pressed the doorbell, Nanase soon appeared.</p>
<p>“…Thank you for the meal.”</p>
<p>As I held out the empty pot, Nanase’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“W-What!? You’ve already eaten? All of it!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It was incredibly good.”</p>
<p>I honestly told her how delicious it was. Perhaps saying she could open a curry shop would be overpraising, but she smiled shyly at my words.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it taste good, so I’m happy Sagara-kun got to eat it.”</p>
<p>Though it’s hard to tell when she’s wearing makeup, Nanase has quite droopy eyes. When she smiles brightly, her eyes almost disappear.</p>
<p>She seems self-conscious about her plain face, but even without makeup, she’s quite… not bad at all. There must be guys who like that kind of face.</p>
<p>“…Sorry. It really helped me out. When I get my paycheck, I’ll pay you back.”</p>
<p>“Eh, you don’t have to do that! Making food for one or two people is the same.”</p>
<p>Even so, I know Nanase is living in this run-down apartment, so she probably doesn’t have much spare money either. I won’t feel settled until I make it right.</p>
<p>After a back-and-forth, Nanase finally conceded.</p>
<p>“…Okay. Then, next Friday, after the seminar. Are you free?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you want to have lunch together? I actually, actually have a place I want to go to… I don’t have the courage to go alone, so I’d be happy if you came with me.”</p>
<p>“Wait a second,”</p>
<p>I hastily interjected. Going out for a meal with someone of the opposite sex might be a daily occurrence for Nanase since her university debut, but for me, it’s a big deal.</p>
<p>“No, I’m…”</p>
<p>I started to refuse, then clammed up. I might be able to get away without paying her back, but the curry was really good.</p>
<p>Leaving a debt unpaid would go against my principle of “relying on no one and living in solitude.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, got it…”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I answered, and Nanase joyfully raised both hands in the air. “Yay!” Why she would be so happy about going to lunch with me, I just couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>The seminar I’m belong to meets twice a week, on Tuesdays at third period and Fridays at second period.</p>
<p>There are about twenty freshmen, five of whom are girls. Among them, Nanase Haruko stands out conspicuously.</p>
<p>“Ah, Nanase is so cute. She’s a feast for the eyes.”</p>
<p>The guys in the seminar in front of me whispered among themselves, looking in Nanase’s direction.</p>
<p>The one at the center was a showy, flashy type, rare in our seminar—his name was, I think, Kinami.</p>
<p>I often hear him gossiping with the others about girls—discussing who’s cute, who has a good figure, and other things that shouldn’t be said too loudly.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll ask Nanase out for a meal next time. Hey, does Nanase have a boyfriend, I wonder?”</p>
<p>“Who knows. With looks like that, probably. But I have no idea.”</p>
<p>Kinami held his head in his hands, moaning,</p>
<p>“Ugh, I’m so jealous of the guy who gets to like Nanase,” or something like that. What a vulgar guy.</p>
<p>He should just stub his little toe and die.</p>
<p>“…And so, we’ll start group work from next week. That’s all for today.”</p>
<p>As soon as the professor said that, the bell signaling the end of class rang. I listened to the signal marking the start of the lunch break with the feeling of a prisoner awaiting a death sentence.</p>
<p>Today is Friday. I have a lunch date with Nanase.</p>
<p>In such a crowded place with so many acquaintances, it would be bad to call out to Nanase. It might be better to leave the university and arrange a meeting outside. I’ve (reluctantly) exchanged contact information with her recently, so it should all work out.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to stand up and leave the seminar room first, I heard Nanase’s voice from behind.</p>
<p>“Sacchan, sorry. I’m going out for lunch today.”</p>
<p>I heard the sound of her heels tapping against the floor of the lecture hall. At the same time, a sweet fragrance wafted over as she tapped me on the shoulder. Nanase, with her long hair neatly tied up, looked up at me.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun. Shall we go then?”</p>
<p>At that moment, and probably not by mistake, the seminar room buzzed with noise.</p>


<p>“Why Sagara?”</p>
<p>That’s what the stares of the men seemed to say, piercing my skin.</p>
<p>Kinami, who had been sitting in front of me, was looking this way with his eyes wide as saucers.</p>
<p>Give me a break, I want to stand out as little as possible… Or rather, don’t call out to someone like me in such a place.</p>
<p>“I’m starving! I think I can eat a lot right now.”</p>
<p>Nanase is laughing innocently, unaware of my feelings. Her smile was like the sun, brightening everything around her. It’s too dazzling for me to look at directly.</p>
<p>Resigning myself, I stood up and left the seminar room, looking down.</p>
<p>As we walked and the stares of acquaintances faded, I felt somewhat relieved. Nanase also seemed to relax, letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>While looking at her perfectly arranged profile, I said,</p>
<p>“…You’ve really changed a lot, Nanase.”</p>
<p>“I worked hard, you know. I learned all about makeup and fashion desperately, and even lost five kilos with dieting. My New Year’s money vanished in a flash.”</p>
<p>“Why go to all that effort?”</p>
<p>“I wanted a rosy college life!”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes sparkled as she said that. I responded with a deflated “Huh”…</p>
<p>…A rosy college life, huh.</p>
<p>“I want to make lots of friends and have fun to the fullest! Oh, and maybe get a wonderful boyfriend too!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have absolutely no interest in such things. In fact, I even consider them a nuisance. But for the girl in front of me, those were things worth expending great effort to obtain.</p>
<p>“Then you should’ve joined a club or something.”</p>
<p>As far as I know, Nanase hasn’t joined any clubs or teams. When I think of the glittering, sunny-type people, I imagine them belonging to clubs and spending every night out playing. It’s a total prejudice, though.</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase gave a slightly troubled smile.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, maybe I should’ve, huh?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. Maybe you should.”</p>
<p>What is there to even worry about? If she really wants a rosy college life, she should broaden her horizons.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t be wasting her time with a dull guy like me.</p>
<p>Once we leave the university through the East Gate, we reach a quiet residential area.</p>
<p>After walking for about five minutes while pushing our bicycles, Nanase stopped and said,</p>
<p>“Here it is!”</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw a dark blue noren with “Kaifuutei” written on it. It seemed to be a set meal restaurant.</p>
<p>“You can get a set meal for six hundred yen, and rice and miso soup are all-you-can-eat!”</p>
<p>Nanase said with excitement as we passed under the noren and opened the somewhat ill-fitting sliding door.</p>
<p>The shop was small with only a counter and two two-seater tables. We could see other customers who seemed to be university students like us. An older couple appeared to be running the place.</p>
<p>We sat down facing each other at a two-seater table, and the server came to take our order. I ordered the chicken katsu set meal, and Nanase ordered the daily special, a mackerel miso set meal.</p>
<p>“Do you like chicken katsu?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. If there had been a fried chicken set meal, I would have chosen that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you like fried chicken!”</p>
<p>“Not really…”</p>
<p>“Fried chicken set meals are on Wednesdays. So, let’s come back on Wednesday!”</p>
<p>Nanase said that after looking at the menu, and I was at a loss for a reply. Does she think there will be a next time? As for me, I’d like to decline forever.</p>
<p>While I remained silent, the chicken katsu set meal and the mackerel miso set meal arrived. It came with the main dish, miso soup, rice, and a salad.</p>
<p>The freshly fried chicken katsu was rather delicious. I felt it lacked variety, but for six hundred yen, the cost-performance was excellent.</p>
<p>I’d come again when I have more financial leeway.</p>
<p>After finishing the salad, I alternated between eating the chicken katsu and rice while looking at Nanase across from me. Nanase had a beautiful way of holding her chopsticks.</p>
<p>The way she delicately flaked the mackerel and brought it to her mouth was enchanting, and I found myself staring.</p>
<p>However, the current her felt somewhat out of place in this setting.</p>
<p>“…It’s kind of surprising.”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d take me to a different kind of place. Something more… Instagrammable.”</p>
<p>Although I think this is a good, affordable, delicious restaurant, it’s not the type of place that the glittering girls Nanase admires would choose to go to.</p>
<p>It’s not a stylish cafe or Italian restaurant, which seems more up her alley.</p>
<p>Of course, if she had taken me to such a place, I might have fainted from discomfort.</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase put down her chopsticks and replied,</p>
<p>“I love places that are Instagrammable too. I went to one for the first time after entering university, and it was really fun. But, sometimes… it’s tiring, or something…”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s that I’ve changed, but in the end, I haven’t really changed that much…”</p>
<p>Nanase looked down powerlessly and sighed.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. Earlier, you asked me if I wasn’t going to join any circles, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase continued to stare down into her glass of cold water, and after a moment of silence, she began to speak as if muttering.</p>
<p>“I joined right after enrollment, you know. I tried really hard, thinking I’d make friends at the tennis circle’s welcoming party. …But it was no good,”</p>
<p>Nanase let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“The seniors and my classmates, everyone around was so bright and fun. I felt intimidated… Thinking that I really shouldn’t be there, that i wasn’t able to speak to anyone.”</p>


<p>When you think about it, indeed. From what I’ve seen, Nanase’s circle of friends isn’t that wide.</p>
<p>She’s always with the same members of our seminar, a few other girls, moving as a group.</p>
<p>When guys like Kinami approach her, she always looks somewhat troubled.</p>
<p>Earlier too, she seemed to be forcing herself a bit.</p>
<p>“Being with Sacchan and everyone else is fun, but… sometimes I feel guilty, like I’m not really being myself.”</p>
<p>“…Your true… self?”</p>
<p>“But, I’m scared of showing my true face and having everyone drift away.”</p>
<p>I was startled to see her fists clenched on the table, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>What if she started crying? I peered at Nanase’s face, worried, but her cheeks were dry, and her makeup hadn’t budged at all.</p>
<p>The makeup that covers her plain face is, indeed, Nanase Haruko’s armor.</p>
<p>Nanase lifted her face, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>It was a perfect smile, with the corners of her mouth lifted beautifully.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I said something weird.”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to take a break, I guess. Thanks for going along with it.”</p>
<p>As I listened to her, I wondered what the real Nanase Haruko was like.</p>
<p>The image of her studying seriously in the high school library, the way she sparkles now as a college girl.</p>
<p>How she freaks out over cockroaches, and the way she almost forcefully fed me curry.</p>
<p>The way she eats fish with surprisingly beautiful movements.</p>
<p>The way her eyes shine when she talks about wanting a rosy college life, and how she spills her fear of being known without her disguise.</p>
<p>Aren’t all these just different facets of Nanase Haruko?</p>
<p>“The only one who knows my true face is you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Maybe that’s why I feel at ease with you.”</p>
<p>At that moment, an alarm went off in my head. This girl was threatening to fatally disrupt my solitary and comfortable university life.</p>
<p>Nanase pays attention to me only because I’m the one person who knows her without pretense. There’s no other reason.</p>
<p>After finishing my miso soup, I put the bowl back on the tray and said,</p>
<p>“…Then, I’ll help you out.”</p>
<p>“Eh? With what?”</p>
<p>“To make your university life rosy… I’ll cooperate with you.”</p>
<p>Nanase tilted her head at my words, “Why?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, it’s not just for your sake. If you become a real sparkling girl, you’ll have no need to bother with me.”</p>
<p>Indeed, I owe Nanase a debt of gratitude from high school days. However, my main reason is for my own peace of mind.</p>
<p>If Nanase becomes a true sparkling girl and attains her desired rosy college life, she’ll no longer care about me.</p>
<p>Then, I’ll be able to reclaim my comfortable, solitary university life.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect plan if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>“…Do you dislike being involved with me, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>Nanase asked, looking genuinely sad, which made me panic.</p>
<p>“Ah, no. It’s just that… It’s not just you I don’t want to be involved with.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“…I just don’t want to let anyone into my world. I don’t want to waste my resources on bothersome relationships. So, I try to interact with others as little as possible.”</p>
<p>“It makes me really happy that you’ll help me… but Sagara-kun, you’re being stubborn…”</p>
<p>Nanase gave me a look of exasperation. Ignoring that, I continued,</p>
<p>“That’s what I mean. I’m going to help you for my own sake.”</p>
<p>Nanase seemed to think for a bit and then nodded, “Understood.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best to become a real sparkling girl! Together with Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, okay.”</p>
<p>“So, I’m counting on you from now on.”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled brightly and reached out her right hand to me. Instead of taking her handshake, I put my hands together and said,</p>
<p>“Thank you for the meal.”</p>


<p>“Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>A few days after going to the teishoku-ya (set meal restaurant), during lunch break.</p>
<p>As I was wandering around campus alone, trying to find a place to eat my lunch, Nanase called out to me.</p>
<p>Her makeup was perfectly applied, and she was sparkling as always.</p>
<p>Startled, I quickly looked around in a panic. Fortunately, I didn’t see anyone I knew.</p>
<p>“Are you going to have lunch now? Let’s eat together.”</p>
<p>Ignoring Nanase’s cheerful invitation, I started to walk away quickly.</p>
<p>“Wait up!”</p>
<p>she called after me in a flustered voice. It wasn’t until we were behind the deserted campus buildings that I finally stopped.</p>
<p>“…Why are you talking to me?”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that bad?”</p>
<p>Nanase looked downhearted. Give me a break. With that look on her face, it seems like I’m the bad guy here.</p>
<p>I’m saying this for your sake, though.</p>
<p>“Do you really have any intention of pursuing the so-called rosy college life?”</p>
<p>“I do! I really, really do!”</p>
<p>Nanase clenched her fists in front of her chest, and I glared at her lightly.</p>
<p>“Then it would be better not to talk to me. A real sparkling girl wouldn’t associate with someone like me.”</p>
<p>“Huh, I don’t think that’s true…”</p>
<p>Nanase seemed dissatisfied. I looked around and, feeling uneasy, said,”Come here,” pulling her arm.</p>
<p>I took Nanase to the building no. 6, located at the very edge of the campus. We found an empty lecture room and went inside, where Nanase looked around curiously.</p>
<p>“Fufu. I think this is my first time in building no. 6.”</p>
<p>In our university, the newest building no. 6 building rarely hosts classes for the Economics department. It’s mainly used by the newly established Information Science department from last year. It’s the farthest from our building no 1 where our research labs are, and the chance of running into acquaintances here is almost nil.</p>
<p>For someone like me who wants to be alone, it’s the perfect hideaway.</p>
<p>…I was reluctant to tell Nanase, but desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, I was wondering where you always eat lunch, and it turns out you were here.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter where I eat. Anyway, sit down there.”</p>
<p>When Nanase sat down on the chair, I took the seat in front of her. She straightened her back and looked serious, as if she were facing a job interviewer.</p>
<p>“About that rosy college life you were talking about.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“What does ‘rosy’ even mean? It’s so vague and fluffy, I can’t grasp it.”</p>
<p>To achieve a goal, it’s crucial to have a clear vision first. However, it seemed Nanase hadn’t thought about it concretely either, as she made an obviously troubled face.</p>
<p>“…Like, making a hundred friends?”</p>
<p>Finally, she came up with an answer, and I felt deflated. What’s that? Making a hundred friends isn’t some elementary school class goal. Are you planning to eat onigiri at the top of a mountain or something? (tln : elementari school grade trips usually picnic to nearest mountain or hill in Japan)</p>
<p>However, increasing one’s social connections is certainly a step towards realizing a rosy college life. I pointed at Nanase’s smartphone on the table and asked.</p>
<p>“…How many people do you have in your LINE contacts, not counting family?”</p>
<p>After checking her phone, Nanase shyly showed seven fingers.</p>
<p>“Seventy people?”</p>
<p>“No, seven.”</p>
<p>That was fewer than expected. I almost slid off my chair.</p>
<p>“…You, you hardly have any friends…!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying. One of them is you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Then that would be six, effectively. Nanase noticed my seemingly speechless gaze and added defensively.</p>
<p>“Our seminar has few girls. And I haven’t started any part-time job either.”</p>
<p>“…Alright, set a concrete goal. Increase your contact list by five within a week.”</p>
<p>It may seem small, but if the deadline is a week, it’s reasonable. It’s important to set achievable and straightforward goals first.</p>
<p>“Five people, huh… Can I do it?”</p>
<p>After pondering for a while, Nanase suddenly exclaimed, “Ah!” as if she had an idea.</p>
<p>“By the way, this Friday, there’s a social gathering for first-year Economics students. It’s a joint event with other seminars, and we’re going to have a dinner together.”</p>
<p>“Then you should go. You’ll easily meet five people there.”</p>
<p>When I said that, Nanase looked at me uncertainly.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun, won’t you come with me? To the social gathering.”</p>
<p>“No way I’m going.”</p>
<p>Just the word “social gathering” made me shiver. Why in the world would I spend time and money interacting with strangers? And even if I were there, I’d probably just be in the way.</p>
<p>But Nanase was persistent and kept insisting.</p>
<p>“Please, I want you to come with me.”</p>
<p>“Huh!? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because Sacchan said she has work and can’t go. I hardly know anyone else… It would be reassuring if you were there.”</p>
<p>“No, I…”</p>
<p>“…You said you would help, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase said that and subtly put pressure on me. I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>…Indeed, I did say I would help. No choice then. This is for the sake of Nanase’s rosy college life, and the recovery of my solitary college life.</p>
<p>“…Just don’t talk to me, okay?”</p>
<p>With a sigh, I spoke, and Nanase’s expression brightened.</p>
<p>“Okay! Just having you there is enough! Thank you!”</p>
<p>She doesn’t realize that she’s strayed about five hundred steps from a rosy life by relying on me as her emotional anchor. Seriously, is she really okay? I became anxious all over again.</p>
<p>Friday, 18:00. After my classes ended, I went home for a bit and then headed to Shijo Kawaramachi, the bustling district of Kyoto.</p>
<p>A short walk from Kawaramachi Street took me to Kiyamachi Street, where the Takase River flows.</p>
<p>This area is known as one of Kyoto’s premier nightlife districts, with all sorts of eateries lined up from Sanjo Street to Shijo Street.</p>
<p>It’s not as intimidating as nearby Pontocho or Gion, so there are many chain restaurants that students can casually use… or so I’ve been told by a senior at my part-time job.</p>
<p>Having skipped every welcoming party imaginable, I’ve hardly ever set foot in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now, where could the venue for the social gathering be? I took out my smartphone to check the map when I spotted a beautiful woman standing under a tree by the river.</p>
<p>It was Nanase.</p>
<p>Nanase today had her hair intricately braided and was wearing a trendy patterned one-piece dress.</p>
<p>Even someone like me, who has no interest in fashion, could tell she was all dressed up. While staring at her phone screen, she kept tilting her head as if she was lost.</p>
<p>Although we were headed to the same destination, it wouldn’t be good for us to arrive together. As I started to walk past her, a group of guys around my age were leering at Nanase with grins on their faces.</p>
<p>Displeased by their rude stares, I moved casually to cut off their line of sight and called out to her, raising my voice slightly.</p>
<p>“Nanase.”</p>
<p>As she looked up from her smartphone, Nanase noticed me and waved vigorously.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>I heard what seemed like a “tch” and a muttered “lucky guy” from somewhere.</p>
<p>There was absolutely nothing for them to be jealous of.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I found you. I didn’t really know the place.”</p>
<p>Nanase seemed oblivious to the men’s stares, smiling airily. I said, “It’s probably this way,” and started walking quickly.</p>
<p>The venue for the social gathering was down a narrow alley off Kiyamachi Street, with only a small noren curtain marking the entrance, making it quite hard to find. Inside was a surprisingly stylish Japanese restaurant.</p>
<p>We were led upstairs to a large tatami room with several tables set up. A few people who had arrived earlier turned their gaze toward us as we entered.</p>
<p>…Oops. Thinking about it, coming with Nanase might have been a mistake.</p>
<p>I settled down at the very edge of the tatami room, pretending it was just a coincidence that we arrived at the same time.</p>
<p>I gave Nanase a sharp look and shooed her away with a flick of my hand when she tried to sit next to me.</p>
<p>She looked a bit forlorn but headed to a table at the opposite corner, the farthest from me. Good, good.</p>
<p>As the starting time approached, nearly all the tables in the room were filled. A senior, who was the organizer of the social gathering, said a few words before a course of Japanese dishes was served, and the event began.</p>
<p>“Um, which seminar is everyone in?”</p>
<p>Someone started the conversation, and the room gradually became lively. But I didn’t say a word. I just sat there silently, eating.</p>
<p>Those sitting around me gave me curious looks, as I emitted a full-force aura of rejection. They must have been thinking, “Why did this guy even come?” If I were in their place, I’d probably think the same.</p>
<p>Now, how was Nanase doing?</p>
<p>I sneaked a glance at her, and she seemed a bit downcast, sipping her orange juice slowly.</p>
<p>The two girls sitting opposite her were having a great time without paying her any attention.</p>
<p>The guy sitting next to her kept talking to her nonstop, but she only had a troubled look on her face.</p>


<p>…No, what are you even doing here!</p>
<p>Perhaps tired of the unresponsive Nanase, the guy eventually left his seat.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, I stealthily moved next to Nanase. I tapped her on the back, and when she turned around, her face lit up with recognition.</p>
<p>“Sagara… Ah.”</p>
<p>Remembering the promise not to speak, Nanase hastily covered her mouth. I gestured silently for her to “come here,” and we quietly left the tatami room, hoping no one would notice us.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>As soon as we were alone, I confronted Nanase. She looked down, embarrassed, and muttered, “I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“I thought it would be less intimidating to ask girls for their contact information, so I sat at a table with them… but the girls that were sitting there seemed to be friends already.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t worry about that. Just jump into the conversation.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but… they were all talking about things I didn’t know about… I couldn’t fit in at all…”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I vaguely remember someone saying long ago that when three girls get together, one is always left out. It might not be as dramatic as being completely being left out, but it certainly isn’t a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Trying to cheer up the disheartened Nanase, I spoke as kindly as I could.</p>
<p>“…There were girls sitting at the middle table. Why don’t you try talking to them?”</p>
<p>“Okay… I’ll give it my best shot!”</p>
<p>Nanase lifted her head, clenched her fists in front of her chest, and with a swift turn, she said, “Watch me!” before heading back into the tatami room to sit next to a girl with fluffy short hair.</p>
<p>“Hello, nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>Nanase said with an awkward smile, and the girl next to her laughed, saying, “Aren’t you a bit stiff?” Good, not a bad start.</p>
<p>After that, I completely blended into the background, taking a seat in the corner of the tatami room. I had become one with the walls, and no one paid me any attention.</p>
<p>Sipping my oolong tea, I watched Nanase. She seemed to have warmed up to the girl she was talking to and was nodding along happily.</p>
<p>It looked like Nanase’s table was the most lively spot in the room. The guy sitting across from her was, if I remember correctly, a handsome guy from our seminar.</p>
<p>I forgot his name, but getting along with someone like him would probably bring her fifty steps closer to a rosy college life.</p>
<p>After two and a half hours, the social gathering ended, and I paid the participation fee to the organizer before slipping out early.</p>
<p>“Who’s up for karaoke at the after-party?”</p>
<p>I heard someone shout, but I ignored it as usual and stepped outside.</p>
<p>Kiyamachi Street at 21:00 was bustling with many people, showing a different face from when I had arrived.</p>
<p>Ignoring the touts calling out to passersby, I walked away when I heard “Sagara-kun!” called out to me.</p>
<p>“I exchanged contact information with five people! Goal achieved!”</p>
<p>Nanase caught up to me, proudly holding up her smartphone. I couldn’t leave her alone in a place like this, so I reluctantly slowed down my pace.</p>
<p>“The girl I made friends with, Tsugumi-chan, said she knows Sacchan!”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Good for you.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, are you taking the bus? Or Hankyu? Let’s go home together!” (Tln : Hankyu Railway)</p>
<p>Nanase looked at me with a cheerful smile, and I glanced at her from the corner of my eye. This time, I couldn’t bring myself to refuse. I’m not heartless enough to tell her to go home alone in this situation.</p>
<p>…But, what about her? Is she not going to the after-party?</p>
<p>“Hey, Nanase… what about the after-party? Aren’t you going?”</p>
<p>If she truly wanted to live the life of a social butterfly, she should definitely attend the after-party. It’s an opportunity to expand her social network even more. However, Nanase frowned slightly as if troubled.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m tone-deaf, and I don’t know any of the recent popular songs… Plus, I’m a bit tired. Although it was fun.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s face showed signs of fatigue. She looked up at me with a sleepy smile, her makeup seemingly faded, revealing a natural, bare-faced expression.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I came today. I was able to take a step forward thanks to you, Sagara-kun. Thank you.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t actually done much. Being thanked so directly made me feel restless. I’m not used to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>We boarded the bus at the Shijo Kawaramachi stop together.</p>
<p>Kyoto’s city buses have a flat fare system, paid upon exiting. The thought of spending 230 yen made me feel bitter.</p>
<p>The bus wasn’t too crowded, perhaps because it was still early for the last bus. We found seats at the back, and I sat by the window, with Nanase settling down next to me.</p>
<p>As I gazed out the window in silence, something leaned against my shoulder.</p>
<p>Startled, I looked over to see Nanase resting her head on my shoulder, breathing softly in her sleep. She must have been truly exhausted.</p>
<p>…Well, she did work hard.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to have been made into an impromptu pillow, but I decided not to wake her. I’d let her sleep until we reached our stop.</p>
<p>As I closed my eyes, I could clearly feel the glitter painted on my eyelids. The fake eyelashes were curled perfectly, sticking naturally to my eyelids.</p>
<p>The sleeping Nanase radiated warmth, and her weight gradually shifted onto me. She wasn’t heavy, but she was definitely close. Every time the bus swayed, her chest brushed against my arm, changing shape softly. It was a softness I couldn’t imagine having anywhere on my own body.</p>
<p>I briefly thought they were larger than I expected, and apologized internally for the accidental touch. I felt like I could hear her heartbeat from where we touched.</p>
<p>…No. Maybe that was the sound of my own heart.</p>
<p>As much as I felt sorry for Nanase, I found myself focusing all my senses on my arm until she woke up. It’s just a sad man’s saga.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Haru-chan’s lipstick is super cute. Which brand is it?”</p>
<p>A week after the social gathering, during lunch break.</p>
<p>After eating lunch in the cafeteria and touching up my makeup, Tsugumi-chan asked me that. Delighted, I took out my lipstick to show her.</p>
<p>“This one! My cousin gave it to me as a graduation present from high school.”</p>
<p>“That brand has really good reviews. It’s known for its great color payoff and long-lasting wear.”</p>
<p>“But, I can’t really afford department store makeup casually. Maybe I’ll buy it when I get my next paycheck.”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, weren’t you broke last month? You’re going to bankrupt yourself shopping again.”</p>
<p>At the cafeteria table, besides Sacchan, there were Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan.</p>
<p>Sacchan and Nami-chan had a language class together, and Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan were in the same seminar.</p>
<p>Since the recent social gathering where Tsugumi-chan and I became friends, we’ve often had lunch together as a group of four.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, my boyfriend got mad at me the other day. He said I spend money without thinking.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Tsugumi’s boyfriend a working adult? You met him through an app, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He acts all mature and gets really annoying. Just the other day…”</p>
<p>The conversation shifted to more intimate boyfriend stories, so I kept quiet.</p>
<p>Since Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan both have boyfriends, this kind of talk has become more common.</p>
<p>When it gets to this point, there’s nothing I can do but listen silently with my zero experience.</p>
<p>…Hmm. The love lives of sparkling girls are quite something…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I nodded along, Sacchan suddenly turned to me and said,</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, Haruko, are you dating Sagara?”</p>
<p>Sacchan’s sudden question made me fumble, and my lipstick slipped from my hands. I hurriedly picked it up and put it back in my pouch.</p>
<p>“W-what? Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>I tried to sound calm, but my voice came out embarrassingly squeaky.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been seeing you two together a lot lately. You even had lunch together the other day. Haruko, you’re popular yet you don’t talk much with boys, so I thought it was unusual.”</p>
<p>“Really? What kind of person is Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>Nami-chan tilted her head. Sacchan is the only one here in the same seminar as us, so not many know about Sagara-kun. After all, he doesn’t try to mingle with others.</p>
<p>“He’s always wearing black clothes, has a sober and serious look.”</p>
<p>Sacchan described him, and I remembered he was unusually wearing a navy polo shirt the other day, but I decided not to interject. Tsugumi-chan seemed to understand right away.</p>
<p>“Oh, I get it! He’s the guy who came to the party with Haru-chan, right? I thought he was an unexpected type. Ah, are you really dating?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it!”</p>
<p>I waved my hands frantically to deny it. I never expected such a misunderstanding. Measuring the right distance with boys is really difficult. I’m a complete novice when it comes to relationships, having had no friends until now.</p>
<p>“So, just friends?”</p>
<p>Tsugumi-chan’s question made me ponder. Are Sagara-kun and I friends?</p>
<p>‘If you become a true sparkling girl, you won’t need to bother with someone like me, right?’</p>
<p>We had started talking, but after he said something like that, it’s hard to claim we’re friends. I laughed it off.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun and I live close by… and we come from the same hometown.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Were you in the same high school?”</p>
<p>“W-Well?!, something like that…”</p>
<p>I mumbled, desperately wanting to avoid being asked to show my yearbook. I forcefully changed the subject.</p>
<p>“But, you know! Sacchan, you went to lunch with Houjou-kun just the other day, right?”</p>
<p>Hiroki Houjou is a boy from our seminar who gets along well with Sacchan. With his actor-like looks, he’s in the futsal club and always surrounded by various people. There’s even a fan club for him within the university, or so the rumors say. I talked to him briefly at the recent gathering, but he was so dazzling that it was a bit exhausting.</p>
<p>“No, it’s different with Hiroki. Sagara seems more serious.”</p>
<p>“Ah, he does seem serious.”</p>
<p>Sacchan’s remark was met with agreement from the others. I didn’t quite get the difference, but it seems going out for a meal with someone like Sagara-kun is considered “serious.”</p>
<p>I learned something new.</p>
<p>“Well, but Haru-chan and Sagara-kun do seem a bit different.”</p>
<p>Tsugumi-chan’s casual remark stabbed me in the heart.</p>
<p>──Nanase-san is so earnest, she’s different from us.</p>
<p>The words of a high school classmate resurfaced, making it hard to breathe. What exactly is so different between him and me? I clenched my hands under the table so no one would see.</p>
<p>…I hate that I can’t deny it when times like these come.</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>I returned a vague smile and somehow got through the moment. I pretended not to notice the sting in my heart and thought about making karaage for dinner tonight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara-kun. Would you like some karaage?”</p>
<p>It was the evening after classes, when I was thinking of taking a nap before my late-night part-time job. When I opened the door to the sound of the intercom, there stood Nanase in her high school tracksuit and glasses.</p>
<p>Nanase, with her makeup removed and looking more approachable than usual, was a refreshing sight compared to how she looked at the university.</p>
<p>“I made too much, but it’s delicious.”</p>
<p>On the plate she held out were nicely fried pieces of karaage.</p>
<p>“It’s also a thank-you for coming with me to the party the other day, okay?”</p>
<p>After she said that, I found myself with even less reason to refuse. I hesitated, not wanting to owe her more, but I couldn’t resist my own desires and accepted the offer.</p>
<p>With my recently deposited paycheck quickly disappearing into rent, utilities, and various other expenses, I ended up eating soy-sauce-flavored udon every day. In such a situation, receiving karaage felt like a thread of hope in hell.</p>
<p>“…I wouldn’t mind taking some. Thanks…”</p>
<p>As I thanked her, conflicted, Nanase puffed up her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Come on, Sagara-kun. You should accept people’s kindness more. Isn’t it hard living like that?”</p>
<p>I think I find it easier to live without involving others, but I had to admit, the karaage was a welcome offer. I sighed at the thought that I needed to be more independent.</p>
<p>Nanase’s karaage was slightly on the darker side, but the aromatic soy sauce smell was appetizing.</p>
<p>When was the last time I had karaage?</p>
<p>“…Looks delicious.”</p>
<p>I muttered, and Nanase peeked at my face.</p>
<p>“Ah, did you smile?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not smiling.”</p>
<p>I hurriedly straightened my expression, but Nanase just beamed with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“Hehe. You really like karaage, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“…Not really. Anyway, you should head back.”</p>
<p>I waved my hand lightly, but Nanase didn’t seem to want to leave. She stood at the entrance, fidgeting with her hands.</p>
<p>“Is there something else?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Nanase hesitated before speaking.</p>
<p>“…Today, Sacchan asked me if I was dating you.”</p>
<p>…See, what I was worried about happened.</p>
<p>Nanase had said it was fine, but as expected, people speculate.</p>
<p>It’s extremely unnatural for a standout beauty like Nanase to be seen with a gloomy introvert like me.</p>
<p>“…If you learn from this, you should stop talking to me at campus.”</p>
<p>“Huh, I don’t want that.”</p>
<p>“Why? It’ll all be for nothing if you’re seen with someone like me after making your college debut.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true! I want to be friends with you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase insisted with unexpected force.</p>
<p>Why is she so fixated on me? Is someone she can be herself around that precious?</p>
<p>To her, aiming for a rosy college life, my existence should be nothing but a hindrance.</p>
<p>“…Nanase. You should get a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase blinked, looking puzzled. I continued.</p>
<p>“If you want to be a sparkling girl, you shouldn’t be giving me treats. Go find a boyfriend quickly and make karaage for him.”</p>
<p>“Ah… It’s not so easy to just make a boyfriend like making karaage… Falling in love isn’t that simple, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase said with a confused expression. I stared at her face and muttered softly.</p>
<p>“…I don’t think it’s that hard.”</p>
<p>I believe it wouldn’t be too difficult for the current Nanase.</p>
<p>After all, Nanase with makeup is beautiful, surprisingly bright, and has a good personality.</p>
<p>If she smiled and talked just as she does with me, most guys would probably fall for her easily.</p>
<p>Probably any guy but me.</p>


<p>“Look, for example, what about him? Uh… Houjou, was it?”</p>
<p>The face that came to mind was that of Hiroki Houjou from the same seminar. A pretty handsome guy, he’s the cheerful type who talks to everyone, including someone like me, who’s more of a shadowy presence.</p>
<p>Even Nanase, who doesn’t usually interact with guys, had talked with Houjou at the recent party.</p>
<p>He’s bright, sociable, and refreshingly pleasant, the kind of guy everyone likes.</p>
<p>If someone like him were her boyfriend, her university life would undoubtedly be rosy.</p>
<p>However, Nanase tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>“Huh? Why Houjou-kun?”</p>
<p>“Girls all like guys like that, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“You’re generalizing too much. I think Houjou-kun is a nice person, but… as for dating him, it doesn’t really strike a chord with me.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Nanase hurriedly added, “Of course, it’s not like I’m in a position to say that!” Apparently, even Nanase has her own preferences.</p>
<p>I admitted to myself that my generalization was indeed too broad.</p>
<p>“So, what kind of guy do you prefer?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I haven’t really thought about it… I’ve never had someone I liked before.”</p>
<p>Well, that makes sense. The Nanase who used to study in the library all the time didn’t seem to have much interest in romance.</p>
<p>“But even you wouldn’t be okay with just anyone, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah. But… I don’t have anyone in particular in mind either…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, even if you find a great boyfriend, what do you want to do with him? Just so you know, your ‘rosy’ life lacks any concrete detail.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Nanase stumbled over her words, apparently hit the mark. She folded her arms and thought hard with a serious expression. Maybe she was imagining her rosy days with a boyfriend.</p>
<p>“…I want to have lunch together at university, talk on the phone every night before bed, go shopping together, and sit side by side on the banks of the Kamo River…”</p>
<p>“Sigh.”</p>
<p>Hearing Nanase talk, I inadvertently let out a sound. I’ve never dated anyone before, but is this what all couples do? Just the thought of it was disheartening.</p>
<p>“…Is that really fun?”</p>
<p>As I asked, tilting my head, Nanase replied passionately.</p>
<p>“It is! If it’s with someone you like, definitely!”</p>
<p>Is that how it is? I can’t understand at all, and I don’t really need to.</p>
<p>“But dating isn’t just about that kind of stuff, right?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s more like… there are things that you do only if you’re in a romantic relationship… right?”</p>
<p>What came to mind were more direct words, but I refrained from saying them out loud. However, it seemed that Nanase got what I was implying. Perhaps she hadn’t considered that aspect, as she blushed and looked down.</p>
<p>“Right… I guess so.”</p>
<p>An awkward and somewhat tense atmosphere going on. Damn, one wrong step and this could be considered sexual harassment.</p>
<p>“Anyway. If you ever find someone you like, I’ll support you.”</p>
<p>After saying that, I felt a tiny prick in my heart, but I pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>
<p>Nanase said, smiling ambiguously.</p>
<p>After closing the door, I warmed up the somewhat cooled karaage in the microwave before eating.</p>
<p>The karaage Nanase made was unquestionably delicious. Whoever might become her future boyfriend and taste this karaage will surely be happy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Then, discuss in groups and summarize. The presentation will be the Friday after next.”</p>
<p>At the professor’s words, a groan rose from the back of the lab. The professor glared at the group with a stern look.</p>
<p>Our seminar’s professor has a severe expression and is nicknamed “Chibesna” by some students. It seems to be short for “Tibetan Sand Fox.”</p>
<p>I think there’s a slight resemblance as I looked at the professor’s cold eyes.</p>
<p>The seminar I belong to involves a lot of group work, which is a pain for someone with zero sociability like me. However, it’s a required course, so there’s no helping it.</p>
<p>To work in society in the future, it’s important to develop at least basic communication skills. I understand that, but interacting with others is still a hassle.</p>
<p>The professor randomly assigned the groups. I want to finish the discussion quickly and go home since I have a shift at my part-time job in the evening.</p>
<p>“So, let’s decide on a theme. What should we do?”</p>
<p>The one who looked around the group and spoke was Houjou. Contrary to his appearance, he’s quite serious and makes sure to complete any necessary tasks.</p>
<p>In the same group were Houjou and Saki Sudo who seemed to be good friends with Nanase. Sudo is quick-witted and not the type to prolong discussions with unnecessary chatter.</p>
<p>With Houjou and Sudo leading, the theme and role distribution were decided efficiently.</p>
<p>They even managed to assign me a role without much input from my end.</p>
<p>“Okay, so that’s settled. Once we’ve gathered the materials, let’s meet again. How about after the seminar on Friday? Is lunchtime okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay. For now, let’s make a LINE group.”</p>
<p>As Sudo took out her smartphone to say that, I spoke up.</p>
<p>“Do we need that? We’ve already decided on the meeting schedule, so there’s no need to contact each other.”</p>
<p>I, who uphold individualism, have no intention of belonging to pointless communities. I’d rather not connect on social media with seminar acquaintances I’m not close with.</p>
<p>“Huh? You finally speak up and it’s that?”</p>
<p>Sudo seemed annoyed and snapped back at me.</p>
<p>“Do you even know the word ‘cooperation’?”</p>
<p>“I know it. I don’t plan to get in the way, but I don’t want to get chummy more than necessary.”</p>
<p>After saying that, I realized I might have gone too far.</p>
<p>But before I could apologize, Sudo started making a fuss, saying, “What’s with that attitude? So rude!” and I missed the chance to smooth things over.</p>
<p>Well, it can’t be helped. I have no desire to cozy up, but I intend to complete the task I’ve been given. I won’t let anyone complain.</p>
<p>“…I’ve got work later. I’m heading out.”</p>
<p>As I was about to leave the lab, I caught a glimpse of bright chestnut-colored hair in the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>It was Nanase. Her long hair was twisted and tied at the back of her head in a complicated structure that I couldn’t quite understand.</p>
<p>Nanase’s group discussion didn’t seem to be going well, as her normally well-shaped eyebrows were slightly furrowed.</p>
<p>It seems she was in the same group as Kinami, who doesn’t appear to be very serious.</p>
<p>Kinami was leaning in and talking to her about something. He probably has feelings for Nanase. Not that it matters to me.</p>


<p>Perhaps noticing my gaze, Nanase suddenly turned around. Our eyes met, and her vivid pink lips formed a gentle arc.</p>
<p>She waved at me with a small motion of her hand.</p>
<p>I averted my gaze in a flash and left the laboratory. Then I could hear the tap-tap of heels on the floor coming from behind me.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, wait.”</p>
<p>The one who had followed me was, as expected, Nanase. I stopped and frowned.</p>
<p>“I told you not to talk to me…”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“You got Sudo thinking weird things, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“The rumor that I’m dating you, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>“Idiot, not so loud.”</p>
<p>I scold Nanase and looked around nervously. If someone heard this conversation and a baseless rumor started, it would be serious trouble.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you going to find a ‘wonderful boyfriend’?”</p>
<p>“That is… I want one someday, but…”</p>
<p>“Someday, when? You only have four years of university life.”</p>
<p>Like a scolded puppy, Nanase looked down dejectedly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, don’t talk to me too much from now on. If a strange rumor starts, guys won’t approach you.”</p>
<p>“But I…”</p>
<p>“See ya.”</p>
<p>I cut off whatever Nanase was about to say and walked away quickly. Just before turning on my heel, I caught a glimpse of Nanase’s face, which seemed unusually sad.</p>
<p>Once I stepped outside the school building, the damp and uncomfortable air clung to me.</p>
<p>The rainy season hadn’t been declared yet, but it had been raining a lot lately, and the humidity was abnormally high.</p>
<p>I remember last June being a bit more comfortable, but maybe this humidity is unique to Kyoto.</p>
<p>“Sagara!”</p>
<p>…Today seems to be a day when my name is called a lot.</p>
<p>Turning around, I saw a tall, handsome man jogging toward me. It was Houjou. Looking at him again, he really did have a model-like figure.</p>
<p>Even though he’s about the same height as me, the length of his legs is entirely different.</p>
<p>“Sagara, give me your contact info. I won’t just add you to the group without permission.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If you suddenly can’t come to campus and no one knows how to contact you, we’ll be in trouble.”</p>
<p>…He did have a point. I was ashamed of my narrow perspective. Maybe I should apologize to Sudo next time.</p>
<p>Pulling out my smartphone, I exchanged LINE IDs with Houjou.</p>
<p>Since entering university, he was only the second person I’ve shared contact information with, following Nanase.</p>
<p>The communication skills of a popular and handsome guy are fearsome indeed.</p>
<p>With a pop, a stamp featuring a comically posed middle-aged man was sent. It could be a setup for a punchline, but I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>While putting his smartphone back in his pocket, Houjou casually asked me as if making small talk.</p>
<p>“Sagara, do you like Nanase?”</p>
<p>Although I was slightly shaken, I was somewhat prepared for the question and answered firmly.</p>
<p>“That’s not true.”</p>
<p>Houjou responded with a noncommittal “Hmm,” and continued.</p>
<p>“I saw you talking with Nanase earlier. You came to the party together too, so I thought you were close.”</p>
<p>I cursed inwardly. See, that’s what I was worried about. People are getting the wrong idea.</p>
<p>“But you’re not dating, right? Ah, this is what Saki said. So, maybe it’s unrequited love on your part.”</p>
<p>This kind of misunderstanding was, as expected, a situation I had anticipated. A plain and unremarkable guy like me getting smitten with a beauty who is kind to everyone. It’s a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>“No way. Someone like me doesn’t match up with Nanase.”</p>
<p>I gave the prepared model answer. But Houjou didn’t seem convinced and tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Really? I think you’d be good together.”</p>
<p>“Huh? How?”</p>
<p>This response was unexpected, so I inadvertently asked back.</p>
<p>To be clear, Nanase, when she’s made up, is a strikingly attractive woman. There’s no way someone as plain as me would be a good match for her.</p>
<p>What on earth was Houjou basing his comment on?</p>
<p>“Hmm… maybe the atmosphere? Like, the air around you when you’re together.”</p>
<p>“Atmosphere…?”</p>
<p>“Nanase isn’t that flashy, you know? When she talks with me, I can sometimes feel she’s straining a bit.”</p>
<p>“No… I don’t think that’s the case.”</p>
<p>I answered, maintaining my composure, but I was inwardly startled. Someone had already seen through the plainness inside the made-up Nanase. Perhaps you can’t deceive the eyes of the real charmers at the top of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>“But somehow, when she talks with you, she seems more natural.”</p>
<p>“…That’s not really true.”</p>
<p>The reason why Nanase seems natural around me is that she doesn’t need to pretend. It’s simply because I know her true face. That’s all there is to it. Being a good match is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Indeed, my existence must be nothing but a nuisance to Nanase, who aims for a rosy university life. Being matched with someone like me must be annoying for her. I need to be even more careful in the future and maintain an appropriate distance.</p>
<p>With a meaningful smile, Houjou patted my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Let’s do our best with the group work. Good luck with your part-time job. See ya later.”</p>
<p>As Houjou raised one hand, I vaguely lifted my right hand as well. University students tend to say “otsukare” a lot as a greeting, but I never really understood what they’re tired from.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, the heavy grey clouds looked ready to pour rain at any moment. I decided to take an umbrella to my part-time job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“No… It’s not coming together at all…”</p>
<p>Struggling with the pile of materials in front of me, I finally raised the white flag and flopped down on the floor. Looking up at the stained ceiling, I let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>The clock showed midnight.</p>
<p>I craved chocolate, but eating such things at this hour is an enemy of beauty.</p>
<p>I had a breakout on my forehead recently, and I need to be careful. I’ve been somewhat sleep-deprived lately.</p>
<p>Checking my smartphone, I saw a LINE message from Sacchan. The notification screen displayed [Look at this and laugh] along with the URL of a video.</p>
<p>It’s probably a clip of a comedian Sacchan likes. I felt sorry, but I wasn’t in the mood to watch it right now. I left it unopened.</p>
<p>What I’m working on is a seminar group work assignment. Ideally, all members should be tackling it together, but everyone else except me hasn’t been very cooperative.</p>
<p>In particular, I found Yuusuke Kinami from my group to be a bit difficult.</p>
<p>The bright and friendly Kinami had been talking to me for a while. He’s not a bad guy, but he’s overly familiar and often throws jokes that are hard to respond to.</p>
<p>When we ended up in the same group this time, at first, he said, “I’ll do anything, so just tell me.” But once we started the group work—his cooperation was less than ideal.</p>
<p>He gently pushed the tedious tasks onto others. When asked for his opinion, he’d escape by saying he didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Yet at the end, he’d claim, “If you had told me, I would have done that.” He might not have bad intentions, but he’s the type I’d rather not work with.</p>
<p>The other group members, too, citing busyness or other reasons, didn’t offer much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As a result, most of the work ended up on my plate.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I had a similar experience in high school. I was supposed to do the library committee work with everyone, but I ended up doing it alone.</p>
<p>“Because I have club activities,” they’d say, and before I knew it, I was sitting at the reception counter every day.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t feel it’s unfair that it’s always me, but—I still couldn’t bring myself to do any less than my best. I don’t want to believe that the diligent person loses out.</p>
<p>Surely, there’s someone who sees my efforts.</p>
<p>Just then, I sensed someone leaving the next room.</p>
<p>It was Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>The door closed, and he descended the stairs.</p>
<p>He must be heading to his part-time job now.</p>


<p>Come to think of it, Sagara-kun was in the same group as Sacchan. Sacchan was angry, saying, “He’s totally uncooperative,” but honestly, I was envious.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun, who is always so serious, would surely complete the task without cutting corners.</p>
<p>Lately, I haven’t been speaking to Sagara-kun at all.</p>
<p>──Anyway, from now on, don’t talk to me too much. If strange rumors start, guys will stop coming near you.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun must be worried about me, but still, I felt lonely.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not that I don’t want a boyfriend to share a rosy university life with, but the idea of not being able to talk to Sagara-kun because of that might be unpleasant.</p>
<p>Since entering university, I’ve had the vague idea that I wanted a “wonderful boyfriend,” but I never seriously considered what I should do to achieve that or what kind of boyfriend I wanted.</p>
<p>To begin with, I can’t even imagine myself dating someone. The hurdle is too high. It’s only natural, considering I didn’t have a single friend until not so long ago.</p>
<p>──There are things that you can only do if you’re in a romantic relationship, right?</p>
<p>When Sagara-kun said that, I was quite shocked. Dating someone isn’t just about sitting side by side on the banks of the Kamo River.</p>
<p>When I imagine having such a deep relationship with someone yet unknown──I feel fear before anything else.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m not ready to become someone’s girlfriend. If that’s the case, I have to tell him properly.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now, group work is my focus. After the presentation is over, maybe I’ll bring dinner again as a treat.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I turned back to the task at hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…W-what? Sagara, you’ve actually done it properly.”</p>
<p>Looking at the report I had compiled, Sudo was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>It had been a week since our group work began. We had gathered for a meeting. I, who had finished the assigned task quickly in between part-time job shifts, was the first to submit it.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s really well put together and easy to understand. You’re quick and amazing, Sagara.”</p>
<p>Houjou nodded in admiration. It seemed that the other members hadn’t finished their parts yet. The presentation is next week, and there is still time, so it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“Sorry! I didn’t think you were up for it, so I underestimated you.”</p>
<p>Sudo said, putting her hands together. The fact that I lack cooperativeness is true, so there’s no reason for me to be apologized to.</p>
<p>“Completing the work given is just normal, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s not always like that. Haruko’s group seems to be having a tough time.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Nanase’s name came up, and I asked back, “Why?” I haven’t been talking to Nanase much recently, so I don’t know what she’s up to.</p>
<p>I wondered if I shouldn’t have gotten involved, but Sudo began to speak freely.</p>
<p>“Haruko’s group isn’t very cooperative, and they don’t seem to take it seriously. It looks like Haruko is struggling on her own.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Nanase is with Yuusuke and such. Sounds tough.”</p>
<p>Houjou gave a wry smile. He seems to be close to Kinami and might understand his lack of seriousness.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, a few days ago, I saw Nanase staying late in the laboratory. When I came back from my part-time job yesterday, even though it was midnight, the lights in her room were on. Maybe she was working on the group work.</p>
<p>As I was silent, Houjou smiled mischievously and asked.</p>
<p>“Sagara, are you worried about Nanase?”</p>
<p>“…Not really.”</p>
<p>“Saying that, you cold-hearted guy! Heartless!”</p>
<p>After Sudo expressed her indignation, she raised her fist with a bright voice.</p>
<p>“But it’s great that everyone in this group is serious! Let’s work hard and get the highest evaluation!”</p>
<p>“Saki. Just so you know, right now you’re the one who’s the most behind.”</p>
<p>Houjou sharply pointed out, and Sudo stumbled over her words. As I watched from the corner of my eye, I was vaguely thinking about Nanase.</p>
<p>Then another week passed, and it was Wednesday.</p>
<p>I woke up to the sound of large raindrops fiercely beating against the window glass.</p>
<p>Peeking outside the window while still lying down, I saw a downpour.</p>
<p>Checking the time on the smartphone charging by my pillow, it was 8:53 a.m.</p>
<p>Since I had a shift until 4 a.m. and took a shower and slept around 4:30 a.m., I had managed to get about four and a half hours of sleep. More than enough.</p>
<p>I don’t have classes until the third period, so the morning is completely free.</p>
<p>The group work is going smoothly, but the presentation is the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>It might be good to prepare a little more. I’ll go to university early and stop by the library.</p>
<p>Getting up, I washed my face at the small sink. I noticed I had a bedhead at the back of my head, but it was bothersome to fix it. No one would probably care anyway.</p>
<p>With this heavy rain, commuting by bicycle would be tough.</p>
<p>Even if I wore a raincoat, I’d end up soaked. It takes nearly an hour to walk to university, but taking the bus seems like a waste.</p>
<p>I’ll have to walk.</p>
<p>With a vinyl umbrella in hand, I headed to university while avoiding puddles.</p>
<p>It looks like the rain had just started a while ago, as I could see salarymen stranded under eaves without umbrellas.</p>
<p>When I arrived at university, I went straight to the library. There’s something like an automatic ticket gate at the entrance, and you can pass by holding up your student ID.</p>
<p>I put my drenched vinyl umbrella into an umbrella bag. The library was air-conditioned and a bit chilly.</p>
<p>After picking up a few legal documents from the shelves, I looked around and noticed a back as straight as if it had a ruler in it, causing me to shrug my shoulders a little.</p>
<p>…It seems I’m quite good at spotting her.</p>
<p>Nanase, with a pale blue cardigan draped over her shoulders, was facing the desk, flipping through pages intently.</p>
<p>Her desk was piled high with books.</p>
<p>I know very well that Nanase is a serious and responsible woman.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the high school library wouldn’t have been kept so beautifully and comfortably. The figure sitting at the desk overlapped with the girl with braids and glasses from back then. Her core hasn’t changed since that time.</p>
<p>I know that I shouldn’t speak to her. Still, I couldn’t leave her alone.</p>
<p>I walked slowly over and pulled out the chair in front of Nanase, sitting down.</p>
<p>Nanase looked up as if startled, let out a small “Ah,” and after glancing around nervously, she spoke in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Good morning. You’ve got bedhead.”</p>
<p>Being told that, I instinctively reached for the back of my head. Damn, next time I’ll make sure to fix it.</p>
<p>“Are you also preparing for the day after tomorrow, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>“…Are you doing this alone?”</p>
<p>I didn’t answer Nanase’s question and asked instead.</p>
<p>Nanase furrowed her brow and gave an unclear “Hmm.”</p>
<p>Taking the notebook on the desk, it was filled with neat handwriting. Probably, she has taken on the work that should have been divided within the group all by herself.</p>
<p>“Why do you go that far? Just slack off a bit.”</p>
<p>Judging from the notebook, her group’s presentation will turn out great. The other members of her group will also reap the benefits. Doesn’t that make her angry?</p>
<p>Even if she slacks off a bit this time, Nanase could make up for it on her own. She is extremely capable.</p>
<p>“Being serious by yourself, you’ll just end up losing out.”</p>
<p>When I said that, Nanase lowered her eyes gently. Long eyelashes cast shadows on her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>“Is being serious really such a bad thing?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to cut corners in anything I do. I want to give my all. Even if people say I’m inefficient, I don’t want to think that being diligent is wrong.”</p>
<p>In the silent library, only Nanase’s voice quietly echoed.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, her current appearance is the result of her “giving her all” to her university debut.</p>
<p>She’s quite a clumsy girl. Even so, I couldn’t bring myself to ridicule her.</p>
<p>“…Even if no one recognizes your effort?”</p>
<p>When I asked sarcastically, Nanase turned towards me and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“There are people who do notice. Like you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Internally, I flinched, but I kept my composure and responded.</p>
<p>“…Not really.”</p>
<p>I looked away suddenly, tossing out those words. Nanase chuckled with a muffled laugh.</p>
<p>“Thank you for worrying about me. I’m glad you spoke to me.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t why I had spoken to her. As always, Nanase is overestimating me.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase leaned forward, calling my name in a quiet voice so as not to bother those around us.</p>
<p>“Maybe I don’t need a boyfriend after all. That, well… maybe the timing isn’t right now,” she said, and then lowered her eyebrows as if asking, “Is that bad?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder if that was really okay for her… but whether it’s bad or not isn’t for me to decide. If Nanase says so, then that’s just how it is.</p>
<p>“…Then do as you like.”</p>
<p>After my response, Nanase’s cheeks relaxed in relief. Then she closed her book and glanced at the wristwatch on her left hand.</p>
<p>“It’s almost lunchtime, isn’t it? I was thinking of buying bread from the convenience store.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if it’s raining outside? I didn’t bring an umbrella.”</p>
<p>Nanase said, looking at my vinyl umbrella. It seems that when she left her apartment, it wasn’t raining yet. You can buy umbrellas at the convenience store inside the university, but it’s a bit of a walk from the library. Without an umbrella, she would surely get drenched for sure.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, I spoke up.</p>
<p>“…Want to share? The umbrella.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Ah, really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was thinking of going to the convenience store too… to buy something for lunch.”</p>
<p>If someone sees us sharing an umbrella, they might start unfounded rumors again, but I had become indifferent to that. It’s a hassle, but if asked, I’ll just deny it.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for me and Nanase to be a couple, even if the world turned upside down.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The moment Nanase smiled and thanked me, what rang in my head was Houjou’s voice.</p>
<p>──I think you two would make a good pair.</p>
<p>While looking at the woman’s smile in front of me, I laughed through my nose, thinking, “As if.”</p>
