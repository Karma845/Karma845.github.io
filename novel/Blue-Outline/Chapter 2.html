<h3>Chapter 2: Making Lunch is Legal</h3>

<p class="calibre5">“Have you ever been here, Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Occasionally, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A week had passed, and it was Sunday again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As promised, Raihara-san and I were out together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. I used to come quite often&mdash;back when my sisters were around…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s expression clouded over, and her shoulders slumped.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We were at a large shopping mall in the city&mdash;a standard option for a weekend in a provincial town.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, as far as the eye could see, there were many families and couples.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to change starting today!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s the spirit; let’s give it our best.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san clenched her fist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, she was dressed in Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, since we’re shopping together, one could imagine a scenario where you ‘act a bit spoiled.’ You might want to take me to stores you like or even have me carry your bags.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Pretty light as far as content goes, I guess?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Being ‘spoiled’ can mean different things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It could be the kind of intimacy you’d expect between lovers or simply acting selfishly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, even if it’s just a pretense, it would be too much to suddenly do the former.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Besides, she probably wouldn’t want to do it with me if she didn’t like me as a man).</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, we decided to first try the latter in various situations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Feel free to drag me wherever you want. Where shall we go?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you! Then let’s go…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …..?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ………… “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No matter how much time passed, Raihara-san’s lips remained sealed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I called out to her without thinking, and upon closer inspection of her expression…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, a-are you okay!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Haa, …Haaah, …Haa.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Large drops of sweat were visible on her face, and her entire body trembled slightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ch-Chifuji-san…! I-I’m sorry, u-um… I…I…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I can’t think of anything!! I can’t think of any place I want to go for myself!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She covered her face with both hands and shouted this with a trembling voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Especially when I think about ‘dragging someone to a place I want to go to,’ it makes it even worse!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“O-oh, I understand!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While trying to calm her down, I thought&mdash;this might be a rather deep-rooted issue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In this place where all kinds of stores are crammed in, she can’t think of a place she wants to go to for herself?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is where I’m failing… not being independent…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Living in a world where messages like ‘Do what you want to do; that is what’s wonderful’ are prevalent must be incredibly hard for Raihara-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s just the beginning, so it’s natural that things won’t go well. Right… then, shall we start with something that seems easier?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright… okay, let’s just go around the stores randomly. Then, please say ‘I’m tired’ when you feel tired.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the simplest thing I could think of.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I understand! If it’s that, then surely…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, um…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After walking around various stores normally for a while, Raihara-san said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What should we do… I’m not tired at all…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A different problem unrelated to whether she was acting spoiled or not arose. Hmm…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s a good thing. …We have walked quite a bit, haven’t we? Not tired at all?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems my legs and hips are strong. Maybe because I’ve been carrying my younger sisters and exercising with them since I was young…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion, giving off a delicate and fragile image, is yet again contrary to her personality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She really is a person full of gaps.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, she was quite a fast runner the first time she talked to me, too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Have you been involved in any sports?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Umm, sports… For example, when there was a marathon at school, I just became so concerned seeing the tired faces of the other children running hard!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Especially when I found someone who seemed to be suffering, I would automatically ask, ‘Are you okay? Need to rest? Want some water?’ and ended up getting scolded by the teacher…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Given that her sisters went abroad for sports studies, maybe Raihara-san has always been quite a physical elite.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Having talent is wonderful. But, if the temperament isn’t suited, competition and contests can be challenging.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, aren’t you tired, Chifuji-san? Are you alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m totally fine. Working at a restaurant is a test of endurance.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. But please let me know if you get tired!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san right now who is considerate has a very lively face, different from when she was unable to be selfish and was sweating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right! Since we’re here, don’t you have something you want to buy, Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Me? I… Ah, I was thinking I have to buy various things to clean my kitchen.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really!? I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a whoosh, Raihara-san showed that unique smile of hers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I have a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s go-let’s go! There’s a good selection on the ground floor! “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, um, Raihara-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s gotten quite warm, and the rainy season is coming, so you want to take measures against mold~. I have some recommendations; they’re easy to use!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The person dressed in Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion speaks with the words of a seasoned housewife as she leads me along.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please look, as you can see, there are various goods here. The important thing here is to choose ones that suit your lifestyle and habits, so you can clean without any trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The standards would be around here, but it’s not about what people use, it’s whether it’s optimal for Chifuji-san’s house…, how is the kitchen in Chifuji-san’s house?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her explanation is clear and her voice is brisk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It feels like she’s completely switched on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment she could use her knowledge for others, Raihara-san’s face sparkles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know we’re moving farther and farther away from what we were supposed to do today, but I can’t say that to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um… well, the washbasin is of this type, and the faucet is just like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm-mmhm, in that case…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, I think this much should be okay for the time being…Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seemed like Raihara-san finally remembered today’s purpose after I had bags filled with meticulously considered cleaning supplies in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I, I’m so sorry! I, I…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry too, I couldn’t find the right timing to stop you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, why am I like this…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san is shaking and lamenting right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is not good! I have to say, I have to be selfish… Um, ah, I don’t want to take care of others… I just want to do things for m-myself… Uuu~~!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“R-Raihara-san… But, I’m really grateful for having you accompany me shopping.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But I… It’s no good! I have to become someone who has something she wants to do…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing her face starting to pale, I couldn’t bear it and inadvertently asked her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I mean, is it not okay to want to take care of others?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not okay! I have to become someone who can think of something she wants to do for herself, without relying on others… because, because…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Drooping her shoulders, Raihara-san murmured in a very small voice, perhaps not intending for me to hear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Taking care of others, in the end, it just causes trouble.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The atmosphere wasn’t one where I could ask what she meant by that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I was to soon understand the meaning of this in an unexpected way.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“They’re blooming cheerfully, blooming. Our work is literally blossoming~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The Sunday I spent with Raihara-san ended, and it was Monday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">During the school lunch break, I came to water the flower beds in the courtyard with a female classmate&mdash;Kusakabe-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the main task for us, the gardening committee members.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s a container for giving water. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah… I’ll water it from this side. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright, then I’ll do it from this side. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san and I divided the tasks and proceeded with today’s watering.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The rainy season will start next week.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once it does, the opportunities for this task will decrease.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When the rainy season starts, I guess we’ll be out of business. We’re going to enter the era of automatic watering~ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying something like that, it seems Kusakabe-san was thinking the same thing,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s already that time of the year, huh? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They’re not at our school, but the hydrangeas are starting to bloom too. Chifuji-kun, are you going to that one? The Hydrangea Festival. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hydrangea Festival…? …Oh, the rainy season version of the spring flower viewing held nearby? No, I’ve never been. Don’t have any plans to, either. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really, there are food stalls on weekends, and there are photo spots that stand out, so there are quite a few couples there. It might be just right for you, Chifuji-kun. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…uh, why? “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I involuntarily look at Kusakabe-san, and she smiles with a mischievous face, saying, ‘I know.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I heard it from Mai-tei, ah, no, Mai from the class 3. She was in the same class as Chifuji-kun in the second year… So, yesterday, it seemed like Chifuji-kun was on a date with a girl at the shopping mall. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…amazing, as expected of the girls’ information network. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The girl who was with Chifuji-kun, Mai said she stood out. She also said she was super cute. Apparently, her facial value is so strong that she doesn’t get dragged down by the Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion at all. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s true, but she’s not my girlfriend. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh~! Really? But Mai said you two were alone! “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We were alone, but it’s different. Raihara-san and I…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">… what should I say?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Can I just normally say we’re friends?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have only spent one day with her, but I feel like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, being in my third year of high school life, I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If girls hear a story about a boy and a girl going out alone, they wouldn’t easily back down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I definitely will be asked, why did you go out together? How should I answer that?</p>
<p class="calibre5">… It’s tough, what should I do?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t honestly talk about Raihara-san’s circumstances, so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Her name is Raihara? “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clang, the watering can dropped from Kusakabe-san’s hand and made a noise, hitting the edge of the flower bed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Kusakabe-san? “</p>

<p class="calibre5">My classmate, who I thought would quickly pile on questions, was looking at me with a frozen face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” Ku-Kusakabe-san? What’s wrong? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…eh, ah, err…ah, ahaha, sorry, sorry, I dropped the watering can. Good, the contents didn’t spill much. W-well, it’s nearly empty, so that’s fine, y-yes, yes. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san is a very lively person by nature, but she spoke unusually fast right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She starts drawing water into the watering can from a nearby faucet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it my imagination, or do her hands seem to be trembling?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…um, well, …… Raihara, what is…her full name? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” Amane. It’s Raihara Amane-san. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a clang, the watering can, midway through being filled, again fell from Kusakabe-san’s hand, making a noise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Kusakabe, -san? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wrong!! “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Turning around suddenly, she seems to shout.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wrong! I, I really like soccer!! I really do!! “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…uh, what..?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m frozen by her abrupt words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Soccer? What’s she talking about?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I do know that Kusakabe-san, indeed, belongs to the girls’ soccer club.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…ah, …sorry…I said something that doesn’t make sense. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san, with her hands clearly trembling, picks up the fallen watering can.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…however, I had to ask.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…an acquaintance? Raihara-san and you? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…the same junior high school. That private integrated junior high and high school. I attended the junior high school there. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see. …you came to this school instead of the high school division there because the girls’ soccer is strong? “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wondering how to expand the conversation, I tentatively ask such a thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…When I was in the ninth grade, a person who had competed in the Olympics in women’s soccer became the coach of this school, and it’s actually someone I had been a fan of for a long time…I found out and thought, ‘Then I want to go to that high school!’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, you really do love soccer, huh. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah, I love it. I don’t know if I can make a career out of it, but I think I’ll be doing it my whole life. …I really do love it, really, truly” <br class="chapter-warning" />.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She repeats insistently to me, who isn’t even doubting her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed like she was reassuring herself more than anyone else.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san was managing the soccer team…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After a moment of silence, Kusakabe-san continued.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Her younger siblings, whom she looked after, grew up, and she wanted to do something in her after-school hours. For such reasons, from the spring of my second year in junior high, she managed the soccer team. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” Oh, that’s so like Raihara-san. Very caring. I might have met such a person for the first time in my life.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san’s heavy silence interspersed the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What happened?</p>
<p class="calibre5">A quarrel or…no, it doesn’t seem like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Just like Chifuji-kun said, Raihara-san was incredibly attentive. She noticed everything, and she did everything for us. It almost feels like we forgot the pronunciation of the words ‘can you please do it for me?’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can imagine, that’s precisely Raihara-san.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“The first month was so amazing, it was a bit bewildering. By the second month, we all had completely gotten used to it, ‘The best manager in the country has come for us!’ we said, and everyone was happy. Even entering the third month, it didn’t change, we completely forgot how it was before Raihara-san came. It became strange around the time we entered summer…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san’s murmuring voice was disturbingly clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The summer tournament was approaching, and practice became rigorous. We,…relied too much on Raihara-san, saying, ‘Do this, do that’ and Raihara-san accepted everything. It was very, very, very…easy. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though it’s supposed to be a story about a wonderful manager, the air was getting heavier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Entering the summer vacation, every day was steeped in soccer, the practice was early, but Raihara-san made everything else easy for us, I’m very grateful, and it feels wonderful and comfortable, it was like the body was slowly melting… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san, who had paused there, picked up the watering can that had fallen on the ground, refilled the spilled amount, and, while watering the flowers, eventually continued speaking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” One day, I went to the field. I pulled out the soccer ball, and while raising my voice, saying, ‘Let’s do this,’ I thought. &mdash;&mdash;‘Why am I doing something so hard?’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …! “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” I love soccer. It’s true. It’s more than a hobby. But, for the first time, I thought. ‘Why,’ Why am I doing this, really? Because there’s a place where it’s comfortable and I don’t have to do anything. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">” Kusakabe-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” It was scary. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Overlaying my words, Kusakabe-san’s voice emits a frozen temperature.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was scary, really scary. I thought soccer would be gone from my life… Before I knew it, the most important, unalterable center of my world had become limp. Different parts of me started to warp, and I couldn’t walk straight…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I don’t have something I can be as passionate about as Kusakabe-san, so I think I probably don’t understand much of the fear she felt even if I tried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….I’m scared, but while I was still feeling scared, I thought I had to act, so I consulted with my teammates, …ahaha, everyone actually felt the same. Some were even starting to write their resignation.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, just the details gleaned from her story send shivers down my spine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…In the end, after warmly welcoming and being thankful, all of us together bowed deeply in apology and asked her to leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that, for real?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seems exaggerated, right? Do we look strange? Just for being taken care of. But you know, the exact same thing happened next in the basketball team.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They’re saying, ‘Why would you let go of such an excellent manager? We would love to have her.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It’s not like Raihara-san quit because she wasn’t working well or fought with the members…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, right. There’s no way to not take a manager who was expelled for ‘supporting too much’. The basketball kids laughed, saying, ‘We are strict, so no matter how much we are supported, it’s not enough.’ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure that’s a good decision…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“However, just like us, it didn’t last more than a season. …That school excels in both literature and sports, so there are many other clubs wanting a considerate manager.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t tell me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Six. Six clubs, including the soccer club, that was ‘in trouble’ and invited Raihara-san saying ‘please help us’, were at the brink of ‘can’t do it anymore’ and almost collapsed….ah, no, sorry, that’s not it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” … “</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that point, Kusakabe-san swiftly turns her face to mine and speaks apologetically.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m not saying it’s Raihara’s fault that the clubs almost collapsed…sorry, I used the wrong words…um…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I understand, so it’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“To Raihara-san, even now I’m still grateful… Really, she was so good to us. For us, she did everything she could…s-so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kusakabe-san mentions her gratitude, but her face is extremely stiff and unbearably strained.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her hands have been shaking all the time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Kusakabe-san, that flower, you might be giving it too much water.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Ah, …yes, right, sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, Kusakabe-san hastily pulled back the watering can she was tilting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ahaha, …it’s not good. …right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"><strong class="calibre4">&mdash;&mdash;If you water them too much, they’ll rot.</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">Bowing her head, she lightly said so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow it’s bustling, so crowded.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On Sunday, I traveled to the edge of the neighboring town.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Here and there, banners for the ‘Hydrangea Festival’ were lined up, and true to its name, colorful hydrangeas were blooming.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From the town’s walking routes to minor hiking courses, the whole area served as the venue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The event known as the ‘Hydrangea Festival’ here seems to be about enjoying the hydrangeas blooming along the way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…it’s true; there are quite a few couples our age.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I unwittingly murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had only known this event by name, and I thought it was something only older, more mature adults would attend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In reality, there are teenagers like myself and people in their twenties, taking pictures and enjoying themselves here and there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, as Kusakabe-san said, it’s popular because it’s photogenic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Speaking of Kusakabe-san, I inevitably recall our conversation from that time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Various things related to Raihara-san during junior high school…</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I understood what Raihara-san meant by taking care of people will, in the end, cause trouble.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">If one has had such experiences, it’s indeed not surprising to think so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed to have become a trauma for Kusakabe-san, but it must be the same for Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I wish I could somehow be of help to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-saaan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I think about such things, she arrives just in time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion is highly refined even today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry I kept you waiting!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s just because I came early.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s still fifteen minutes before our meeting time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since I’d never been to this place, I left home early.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad the weather looks good.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! The flowers are also beautiful.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Looking around, Raihara-san wears a bright expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While nodding, I recall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was something Kusakabe-san said at the end of watering the flowers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『…Raihara-san, she…is kind, beautiful, warm,…and I am really grateful to her…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…however…now when I look back at that summer, …sorry, …I just can’t help but feel…』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『…that I was with a creature of a different kind than us.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">“..Chifuji-san? Are you alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’m fine. Shall we start walking around and looking at various places immediately? …Ah, Raihara-san, I’ll carry your baggage.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No need! I-I can carry this myself!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It looks heavy. Haha, the manager told me not to let women carry baggage.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unless I say something like that, it seemed she wouldn’t hand it over, so sorry, Uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…He probably said something like that. Right, he said it, let’s go with he said something like taht.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If I can at least carry the tent…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…then okay, thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I received the shoulder bag from her, who was bashful.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Hmm, it’s quite heavy. It was good to insist on carrying it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I’m unfamiliar with the etiquette when going out with a guy…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t understand it either.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because I was immersed in part-time jobs even after school and on weekends, I have no memory of going out somewhere with a girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…By the way, this bag.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? …Ah, w-well, that is…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Before I could ask what was inside it, Raihara-san started to panic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s nothing! It’s just nothing really……”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ye, yes, it’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her gaze flutters here and there, and those slender, white hands are clasped, then unclasped, then clasped again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s behavior like it’s out of a picture, suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This awkward demeanor and the feeling of the weight… could it be.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ….Is it something like lunch boxes, including one for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …ah. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, whose mouth is gaping, eyes wide open and trembling, eventually slumped dejectedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was a whim…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, you don’t need to worry, it’s not like you’ve committed a crime…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But…..I’m a person who says that I will practice relying on others! What am I doing by bringing a lunch box?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That is completely correct…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry for starting off like this…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is only our second time going out like this, so it can’t be helped that Raihara-san’s characteristics are still intact.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But I…. uu, I, I knew it! I shouldn’t be doing this! I’m doing something bad! But, but, but when I thought, ‘I can cook for someone,’ my hands were trembling, and pleasure substances were pouring into my head…! It felt so good, and I couldn’t stop!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Doing something bad, her hands trembling, pleasure substances pouring into her head, it feels good, and she can’t stop…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Saying such things in the current Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion seems very dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Making lunch is legal.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But it’s a legal loophole!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not a legal loophole!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While having such a conversation that might be misunderstood if overheard, her face changes expressively.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her beauty may seem unapproachable at times, but she is a very friendly person.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It certainly doesn’t align with the goal, but thank you, I’m happy. Now, let’s look around.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m sorry…If you say so…I’ll, I’ll be careful next time…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A creature of a different kind than us, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I certainly do not resonate with the feelings of Kusakabe-san, who went so far as to say that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, walking next to me is a girl overflowing with humanity.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, I’m really looking forward to it, the lunch box that Raihara-san made.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“R-really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, of course…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…this pleasant and mysterious smile of hers has an out-of-this-world aura to it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Perhaps there are many families here. It’s lively and it’s nice.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, walking next to me, surveyed the surroundings and said so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, the area with the most volume seems to be the families on holiday.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I guess it’s just a good place to go out.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I think so too…Thinking about it, when I came here, it was always with my family.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that so? Raihara-san has been here several times then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She told me something like that when she suggested this place as a destination.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes. My father said it’s because it’s an auspicious event.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Auspicious?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“One of the flower meanings of hydrangeas is ‘family togetherness.’ It’s because the small flowers gather and nestle together, or so they say.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know that. But hearing it, I understand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san, it was your first time, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes… I’ve never been to one of these events before.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Family togetherness, huh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a beautiful phrase.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I could come thanks to Raihara-san; I am grateful…Somehow, I hope I can be of help today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no! I will also do my best today!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today is a revenge for the last time. The goal is the same, the very basics of selfish behavior, to honestly say ‘I’m tired’ when tired.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Last time, Raihara-san didn’t get tired, so we couldn’t even attempt it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But this time, enjoying hydrangeas like this as we walk, we will go from the city to a bit of a hiking course, so even the strong-legged Raihara-san should eventually get tired somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We gaze at the flowers and have casual conversations as we steadily proceed through the course.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Before we know it, we have left the city, and the scent of nature has intensified.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just a little further there’s a shrine, and the stone steps leading to it are one of the famous spots, with hydrangeas blooming neatly beside them. It’s beautiful〜”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s nice. Since we’re here, shall we also pay our respects?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such was our conversation, for a short while.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Soon, what appeared before our eyes was a staircase of considerable length and angle, radiating a significant imposing presence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">True to the word, the row of blooming hydrangeas on the side of the stairs is splendid.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see, it is arranged so that there is plenty of time to enjoy the hydrangeas.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, yes. The length of the stairs might be one of the attractions too. …Ah, please rest if you get tired along the way. Let’s take it easy and rest if needed!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? Ah…I, I will say it too if I’m tired! Y-yes, of course!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Stammering her words, Raihara-san finally nodded.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Oh, it’s steep.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Actually starting to climb, I feel its steep incline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems to be a good exercise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right~. Please be careful not to slip.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, I will.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Such consideration is flowing naturally. It’s probably innate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think it’s the shape of her soul.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ugh~ I can’t do it anymore! It’s hard!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m tired~! Seriously!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How many steps are there!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such voices descend from a group of college-age who are ahead of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, looking beside me,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh my…Should I offer to carry their luggage…would it be rude to suddenly speak up?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A girl in Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion, who appears fragile, murmurs such things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are multiple things I want to retort to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">A shrine in nature, the long stone steps leading to it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hydrangeas bloom neatly on the side, and the descending sunlight is repainting the place in a bright tone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With this almost fantastical natural scenery as a backdrop, her figure, draped in attire with a theme strongly disharmonious to it, has a beauty that is so dense and devilish that it blows away things that I was idly contemplating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Chifuji-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;I found myself only unwittingly staring intently at her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">… It feels like a creature of a different kind than us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t think Kusakabe-san’s words refer to her appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But strangely enough, I, at this moment, felt that this person might be a spirit or a fairy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Alright, there… We’ve arrived!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It was a good exercise.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having passed through the stone stairs, we finally reached the shrine grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whether it’s because we’ve come to a high place, or the sense of liberation from having climbed up, or maybe because it’s a sacred place, the passing wind feels cool and pleasant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, finally! Phew~ It was indeed long.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, who has strong legs contrary to her appearance, seems to have accumulated fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good, this is good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unlike last time, the conditions have reached a point where she can say, ‘I’m tired.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, Chifuji-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it coming?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s one small step from my point of view but a giant leap for Raihara-san&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You are sweating. Here, I have a handkerchief!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost fell down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, that’s wrong, Raihara-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. But I have my own handkerchief.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Feeling it would be impolite to soil hers with my sweat, I declined, and Raihara-san looked visibly disappointed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">….If I’m wrong, then it’s just my embarrassing misunderstanding, but I felt that if I had accepted it, she would have wiped my sweat with her own hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I’m sure that Raihara-san is tired.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, let’s go and pray.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no point in stopping to rest now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I immediately made the next suggestion, moving as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Having finished our prayers, what awaits us next, of course…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, it’s our turn to descend these stairs.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said, looking down the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This should build up even more fatigue, and doing that should make it easier for her to say the word ‘tired.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes~ let’s do our best!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, with both hands in front of her chest, made a firm fist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the two of us descend the steep, long stone stairs.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You mentioned you came here with your family before. It’s probably difficult for your sisters, given how long the staircase is.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, yes, that’s true. By the way, there’s a square lined with stalls just a bit ahead from here, and I really want to get there soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, it’s almost lunchtime.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment I realize that, my stomach lets out a slight growl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We have been walking all morning, after all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, my situation doesn’t matter right now. It’s about Raihara-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While talking, I discreetly checked her face, and it seemed she was slightly sweaty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We have walked a considerable distance before climbing and descending these stone stairs, so it is impossible for her not to be tired.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s strange to hope that the person walking with you gets tired, but… when I remember her saying taking care of people causes trouble, so she wants to change with her shoulders drooping, I couldn’t help but do so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While letting out such a voice, I finally stepped down the last step.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It must have taken about the same time as climbing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">… I feel like I shouldn’t be the one to ask Raihara-san if she is tired.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She should state her needs herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I think this,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chifuji-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looks at me intently and speaks to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… I’m sorry, um…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is she apologizing for being about to make a selfish request?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good, good, good, here it comes!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh! There’s a space open over there! I’m sorry for not noticing~! Let’s go to the square and have lunch~!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a pleasant smile, she said so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a very pleasant smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">… Did she hear my stomach growling?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t think it was that loud, I’m surprised that she noticed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No… well, Raihara-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Don’t ‘Yes?’ me…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sweat is visible on her face. ‘She wants to rest but can’t say it, so she’s using someone’s hunger as a reason.’ such a possibility is not nonexistent, but… she’s not that kind of person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even I, who have known her for a short time, understand this much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Simply, in any case, she is the type who cares more about someone else’s hunger than her own fatigue.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, no, um….well, this won’t do…uhh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san, who seems to have noticed it herself, begins to panic.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Tired, yes, tired, I do feel tired, to voice my own fatigue, to say I want to rest, let’s do so because I want to rest, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san mumbles as if to convince herself, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry, how embarrassing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the worst timing, my stomach growls loudly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine!… but, well, …you must be hungry…. I think the lunch box will be enough, but I didn’t know how much a man of the same age would eat, so…uh.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If it’s not enough, while Chifuji-san is eating, I’ll go and buy something from the stalls! What would you like? There are various options~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Raihara-san’s mind is now completely filled with the fact that my stomach is empty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm…A failure?</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Again, really… it’s so embarrassing…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then the girl Jirai-kei (Landmine type) fashion hangs her head and drops her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that she’s dejected due to the failed attempt to say ‘I’m tired.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No… no need to be so down. It just means that your concerns are that deep, Raihara-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I say this while sitting across from her at a table in the square’s rest area, Raihara-san, with her head bowed, mutters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m nothing, really.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Always caring about others, my heart always goes to that, and I have nothing else that I want to do myself,… there’s no reason or trigger for it… It’s not like I was raised in an environment where my parents couldn’t spoil me or anything like that. There’s absolutely nothing like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I am blessed. I think I was raised in a happy family. But, but why… even then, why didn’t I develop a decent personality?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Do you feel guilty?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I finally realized it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am made to realize that such common sense, which I should have understood, ultimately hadn’t permeated my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It might be appropriate to say she feels ashamed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone has different kinds of problems.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Precisely because she was raised in a warm and decent environment that she feels guilty about her ‘unique’ nature.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never thought about it before, but it’s definitely painful in its own way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…At least, I have to change from now on. Before I cause trouble to those around me again…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That… ah, no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t mention that I have come to know about various things that happened during Raihara-san’s junior high school days.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to remind her of the pain by digging it up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…for now, can we have lunch? Actually, I’ve been looking forward to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want her to blame herself and look gloomy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I have decided to change the topic for now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking forward to the lunch box she made is also true.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Y-yes! Let’s eat! Well, you see, please enjoy and…….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What slid out from the bag was a large parcel. The contents revealed when the wrapping was undone were…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s a stacked lunch box.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I, I got a little excited and got carried away… “</p>

<p class="calibre5">As the lid was snapped open, I saw that the first tier was tightly packed with a variety of side dishes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s evident at a glance that a lot of effort has been put in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you,… I’m actually somewhat moved right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No! It’s not such a big deal.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’ve actually never had anything like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought something like this was something totally unrelated to my life, but you never know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. The style of lunch boxes is different in each house, right? In the Raihara household, because my younger sisters eat a lot, and my father and I love to cook and want to make a lot, this is quite standard when we go out.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While saying so, Raihara-san briskly divides the stacked lunch box and spreads it on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once that is done, next comes a thick flask.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought it was a beverage, but what was poured into the cup was miso soup.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, it, it also contains miso soup, so it might have been heavy for you to carry it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, don’t worry. …It’s amazing, it’s like a full-course meal.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, no-no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to help her with the preparations, but she’s so good at what she does and I can’t find an opportunity to intervene, and … above all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here’s a cloth for wiping your hands. This one has the beverage, and here’s the cup. Ah, please use these chopsticks and this serving plate.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seems to be enjoying it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just a moment ago, she seemed so down, so seeing her lively expression now feels especially vibrant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry to keep you waiting, please enjoy the meal!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, itadakimasu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, if you’d like, I can serve it on your plate! What would you like? You’re a man, so maybe meat and fried food?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Without sitting down herself, Raihara-san takes my plate in her hands and asks such things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The whole flow of her actions is so smooth.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I would really like you to eat the vegetables too, so this and that and… Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly stopping her movements like a rusted machine opposite to her smoothness from before, she returned the plate which was just about to be filled with the side dishes back to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…No, that’s wrong! I, I shouldn’t do things like this!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not that it’s not allowed, but yes, considering today’s purpose…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! I need to change! I will change!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s a strong declaration.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no doubt that she has unshakable resolves there. …that being said, however…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Raihara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“R-Raihara-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her hand still hasn’t left my plate. And then, it starts to shake violently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..Haah, …Haaaah, …Haah, I, I’ll let go, yes, let go…… Not, I’ll not… I’ll not take care others’…others’ people anymore…… Haah, Haah, Haaaah, Haah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is bad, it might be a withdrawal symptom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She might have endured too much.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san, for now, let’s breathe slowly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haa, Haaaah, Haah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Raihara-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Taking away ‘taking care of others’ from her…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it really the right thing to do? Especially when she’s become like this…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…No, is it because she’s become like this that any more of that would be bad?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is a difficult question.</p>
