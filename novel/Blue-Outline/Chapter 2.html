<h2>Chapter 2: The Poisoned Apple and the Witch’s Night</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>There was a night that made me feel like I had lived my life just for this moment. A midnight where I could immerse myself, thinking that a night like this might never come again.</p>



<p>For me, it was the night when you were by my side.</p>



<p>Tears dampened my pillow, and I tossed and turned in my dreams, trembling in fear and finding solace in solitude. Just when I had almost forgotten, I wrapped myself in a warm blanket and drift into slumber.</p>



<p>I wished the morning would never arrive, yearning for the rain to never cease, and praying the moon would never set.</p>



<p>If I hadn’t woken up as I did that night, I wonder if I could have been Snow White.</p>



<p>If I hadn’t woken up as I did that night, would the prince have gently kissed me?</p>



<p>And then, I pondered further.</p>



<p>There was a twilight that confronted me with the possibility that such a night might be stolen away. A dark evening that left me thinking if someone else might get to experience a night like that.</p>



<p>──There was a hope that awakened nameless night just as it was, untouched by anyone.</p>



<p>I didn’t want to give it away, didn’t want to surrender, didn’t want to let go.</p>



<p>The warmth, higher than mine, that I could touch if I reached out. The boyish, defenseless sleeping face. The harmony of our synchronized breaths. The reasons for holding you and being held by you.</p>



<p>The night remained sealed. No matter how refined our conversations in the sunlit corners, or how we exchanged innocent glances, or even when we became passing lovers and brushed lips on the cheek────</p>



<p>I still couldn’t understand every inch of you. So, in our secret world for just the two of us, I wanted you to reveal it all.</p>



<p>Your vulnerabilities you hide behind a facade of strength. Your impulses restrained by reason. Your desires suppressed by aesthetics. Your loneliness that you couldn’t share with anyone. Your real face beneath the mask. </p>



<p>The unadorned, naked you. Your true heart.</p>



<p>I wanted to strip them away, collide with them, rub against them, explore them, merge with them, and release them.</p>



<p>No matter how ugly or muddy they might be, I wanted to accept them, swallow them down, and let them dissolve within me.</p>



<p>So that after wrapping yourself up and falling asleep, you could continue to be the hero of the bright world with an innocent face.</p>



<p>──That’s why I want to be the night you drown in.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>It was after school on a bright Monday at the start of the week.</p>



<p>I, Chitose Saku, a second-year student and a member of the Blue Team cheering squad, along with Asu-nee, the representative from the third year, and Kureha, the representative from the first year, gathered at Ikuhisa Park, right next to the Fukui Prefectural History Museum.</p>



<p>This place boasted a spacious grassy field perfect for our practice, encircled by a dirt track. Beyond that, there were tennis courts, a gateball<sup data-fn="2ccfc7ba-bcc4-4175-813f-36999971ee97" class="fn"><a href="#2ccfc7ba-bcc4-4175-813f-36999971ee97" id="2ccfc7ba-bcc4-4175-813f-36999971ee97-link">1</a></sup> field, and various athletic playsets for children, making it one of the larger parks in the city.</p>



<p>Both the second gymnasium and Higashi Park were already occupied by other cheering squads, so we ventured a bit further than usual. October, with the much-anticipated school festival, was upon us, and excitement had swept through the student body.</p>



<p>Among the three days of festivities, the first day was the “Off-Campus Festival,” primarily held in the grand hall of the “Phoenix Plaza,” featuring presentations from our cultural clubs. The second day was the “Sports Festival,” where our cheering squad and various creations took the spotlight. Finally, the third day marked the “Cultural Festival,” where our class, 2-5, would perform a play.</p>



<p>Various committees, clubs, and classes were working tirelessly to prepare for the big event, and, of course, our blue team cheer squad was no exception.</p>



<p>Our performance time on the big day was seven minutes. Each cheering squad would don handmade costumes and showcase a creative dance they had devised from scratch, synchronized to music on the field.</p>



<p>Our theme for the Blue Team was “Pirates.”</p>



<p>During last month’s training camp, we had solidified the idea for four parts: “Departure &amp; Voyage,” “Encounter with the Enemy,” “Dance of Reconciliation,” and “Feast.” We had managed to decide on the music and choreography for the first three parts, even including members from the third and first years who weren’t present there.</p>



<p>Thanks to that, we had started full-team practices early and our overall performance was shaping up nicely.</p>



<p>Now, why were just the key members present today? Well, that’s because we had finally nailed down the choreography for the remaining part, “Feast.”</p>



<p>Even though there was still time left until the main event, we couldn’t afford to be complacent. It was more efficient to have us learn it first and then teach others, so that’s why we had been practicing ahead of the curve.</p>



<p>“Kaito, what are you so embarrassed about now?” Haru let out an exasperated sigh.</p>



<p>“W-Well…”</p>



<p>“Kazuki-san, are you feeling embarrassed too?” asked Kureha with an exaggerated tilt of her head.</p>



<p>“E-Even I… can’t deny that.”</p>



<p>“Chitose, you’re cute,” said Nanase with a soft, sweet voice.</p>



<p>“I’d rather be scolded than endure this teasing!”</p>



<p>And so, right now, it was mainly the three of us – me, Kazuki, and Kaito – the boys team, in the midst of learning the choreography while being closely observed by the girls.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s try it one more time!” Nanase clapped her hands.</p>



<p>Unusually, we, Kazuki and Kaito, panted heavily and voiced our thoughts.</p>



<p>“This is more exhausting than I thought.”</p>



<p>“They really drain our stamina.”</p>



<p>“How can Kenta look so cool…”</p>



<p>By the way, the reason Kenta wasn’t with us in the practice group was because…</p>



<p>“No, no, this is all wrong, completely wrong!”</p>



<p>He’s the one who created this choreography.</p>



<p>“””Ugh…”””</p>



<p>Seeing our reactions, he sneered and raised both hands toward the sky.</p>



<p>“Are you guys really the star athletes of the sports clubs? Your sharpness, groove, and most importantly, your chuunibyou spirit are seriously lacking. If you don’t perform this with all your heart, you won’t reach the hearts of the audience!”</p>



<p>“””Ugh…”””</p>



<p>I’d love to retort, but earlier, he had just given a perfect, kick-ass demonstration in front of everyone, so we couldn’t argue back. And, embarrassingly enough, it was kinda cool. We even applauded for real.</p>



<p>We’d asked for his help with the choreography ourselves, but I never thought we’d be lagging behind him in cheering practice. He was so reluctant at first, but now he was having a blast. Well, it’s a pleasant surprise, I guess.</p>



<p>Kenta adjusted his glasses and spoke. “Each of you, don’t slack off in your training.”</p>



<p>“””Yes, Master!!!””” We all shouted desperately.</p>



<p>Nanase then took over. “Alright, Haru, Kureha, if you notice anything, please point it out.”</p>



<p>“Sure thing.”</p>



<p>“Got it!”</p>



<p>I let out a soft breath and shrugged my shoulders. Today, Haru was checking Kaito’s moves, Kureha was observing Kazuki, and Nanase was overseeing mine.</p>



<p>Kenta seemed to have absorbed the choreography so thoroughly that giving specific instructions was challenging for him. “Just watch and learn,” he’d say. Was he secretly a jock at heart?</p>



<p>By the way, the girls here had different roles for the “Feast” part, so they didn’t need to learn the choreography. Thus, three of us who were good at sports were providing support.</p>



<p>Yua and Asu-nee had gone shopping together at a nearby supermarket, while Yuuko was happily humming the song for this part.</p>



<p>“Chitose,” Nanase approached me. “It’s about the part where you swing your arms alternately. You might be too focused on swinging them quickly, which is making your arms tense up. Also, it needs a bit more overall enthusiasm, not necessarily like Yamazaki, but more like when you guys were doing that crazy handstand competition or when the guys went wild at the recent camp.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Kenta had pointed out the lack of “chuunibyou” spirit in our performance, too. It was easier to understand when framed in that context.</p>



<p>I tried to incorporate the feedback and danced again. “Is it something like this?”</p>



<p>Nanase squinted her eyes, looking somewhat tickled. “Hmm, getting better?”</p>



<p>As she said this, she moved behind me. Her right hand grasped my right arm, and her left hand gently rested on my waist. In the recoil, my T-shirt’s hem lifted slightly.</p>



<p>And then, she lightly traced my side with her cold fingertips.</p>



<p>I almost reacted instinctively to the smooth sensation, but judging from her rather casual posture, it didn’t seem like she had any ulterior motives. It was similar to when I taught Haru how to throw a baseball.</p>



<p>Just as I was trying to swallow my nervousness,</p>



<p>“Chitose, don’t tense up,” she whispered, her chest pressed lightly against my back.</p>



<p>──!!!</p>



<p>Through our thin shirts, I could feel the subtle contours of her bra. Contrary to Nanase’s words, my body tensed up once more.</p>



<p>“Hey, you’re way too close.”</p>



<p>A soft exhale from her tickled my earlobes. “Come on, just relax,” she said as she slid her hand from my waist.</p>



<p>“Here, stand a bit taller,” she continued, gently pulling my arm backward. In response, her soft bosom pressed and molded itself against my back.</p>



<p>“Hey, seriously?”</p>



<p>“And push your hips forward,” she instructed, ignoring my reaction. Her lower abdomen pressed firmly against my rear. My body flinched at her warm touch.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry,” I stammered, pulling away instinctively.</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat self-conscious, I scanned the surroundings. Haru was deeply engrossed in instructing Kaito, and Yuuko seemed to be checking song lyrics or something on her phone. Only Kureha briefly glanced in our direction, offering a mature smile before returning to her lively conversation with Kazuki.</p>



<p>As I slowly turned to gauge Nanase’s true intentions,</p>



<p>“Next time, be more mindful,” Nanase uttered words open to interpretation, her face adorned with a cool smile.</p>



<p>If I thought about it rationally, this was probably advice about the dance, but… Could it be that I was overthinking it?</p>



<p>No, that couldn’t be it.</p>



<p>This wasn’t the same as the light-hearted banter we shared with Yuuko and Haru a short while ago. Nanase couldn’t possibly be oblivious to her own allure as a woman.</p>



<p>Yet, she’s traversed boundaries that even our playful exchanges didn’t dare to cross. Those suggestive gazes and seductive tones… they were anything but natural.</p>



<p>“What the heck is going on?” I mumbled softly, but then a memory resurfaced.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, something was a little off about Nanase today.</p>



<p>It happened when we were deciding on the pairs for the “Feast” dance routine. Following our familiar pattern, Kureha was the first to raise her hand.</p>



<p><em>“Yes, yes! I’ll go with…”</em></p>



<p>But as if to interrupt her, Nanase spoke up;</p>



<p><em>“──I’ll dance with Chitose.”</em> Without explaining her reasons, she added, <em>“Is that okay with you, Kureha?”</em></p>



<p>Kureha looked a little surprised for a moment, then chuckled as if amused. <em>“Of course! If Yuzuki-san says she’ll look after senpai, I’ll gladly volunteer to be Kazuki-san’s partner!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oi!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Me!?”</em></p>



<p>At that time, I lightly brushed the situation off together with Kaito. But thinking back, it was an unusual move from Nanase. Normally, she’d be the one to step back, right?</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump. </em>Despite my efforts to remain calm───</p>



<p>My heart was racing.</p>



<p>Memories from our training camp, when I practiced the pair dance with Kureha, resurfaced.</p>



<p><em>“Oh, I see, while dancing with my junior… I’ve been chasing someone’s illusion all along.”</em></p>



<p>The softness of Nanase’s chest pressing against me, the heat radiating from her lower abdomen, all seemed to meld with the hazy image I had in my mind.</p>



<p>I shook my head involuntarily. <em>That couldn’t be it,</em> I sighed in frustration.</p>



<p>──Not as the Hero, but as a man named Chitose Saku.</p>



<p>On that evening, as my heart was reflected on the water’s surface during the twilight, I made a solemn vow. That’s why I had been feeling so uncertain lately.</p>



<p>Until I met Nanase, Asu-nee, Haru, Yuuko, and Yua, I never used to be this lost, never been hesitant or turned back like this. I was content to simply devote myself to my convoluted aesthetics.</p>



<p>However, when I finally decided to unearth the truth I had concealed all this time and face someone with it, I found myself feeling so uneasy and pathetic. Even I was surprised by that.</p>



<p>As I was gently placing my hand on my left chest, which had finally cooled down, I pondered.</p>



<p>Even though it might be a lie to say that I wouldn’t have been shaken in the past, I used to be better at making light of the situation before my heart started swaying.</p>



<p>Finding someone’s face and body attractive might not be easy to say aloud as a reason to like someone, but I didn’t consider it impure in the least. In fact, I’d find it far more suspicious if someone claimed to only see the heart while completely disregarded physical attractiveness.</p>



<p>So, despite understanding logically that it was natural to be shaken, the feeling of guilt and apology still triumphed.</p>



<p>Even if I was told that I was still clinging to my aesthetics, or still concerned about appearances…</p>



<p>──For those in my heart, the least I could offer was my true feelings.</p>



<p>However, I had repeated this thought since that evening.</p>



<p>When I become not Chitose Saku, but just a man…</p>



<p>──What should I use as a guide to name these feelings?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>I, Uchida Yua, exited <em>Courant d’air </em>supermarket near Ikuhisa Park.</p>



<p>I had initially intended to grab some drinks and snacks while Saku-kun and Yuzuki-chan perfected the choreography for the ‘Feast’ part, supported by the others. But although I was originally planning to go alone…</p>



<p>My gaze involuntarily strayed to the beautiful profile walking beside me. Asuka-senpai, with a plastic bag in hand, was happily bouncing along with lively footsteps.</p>



<p>Unconsciously, a soft chuckle escaped my lips.</p>



<p>“Yua-san…?” Asuka-senpai noticed and peered at me with a puzzled expression.</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry. It’s just… I remembered how you looked so excited picking out snacks earlier, Senpai.”</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai shyly lowered her gaze. “I’ve always loved snacks. They make me feel like I’m on a school trip or something.”</p>



<p>At this unexpected line, I smiled. “Saku-kun used to say something similar.”</p>



<p>“Yes, Saku-nii loved them too. Grandma used to secretly give us pocket money, and we’d go buy them together during summer vacation.”</p>



<p>“Saku-nii…” I tried rolling the unfamiliar term on my tongue. I had heard it during camp, but that night felt like a quiet, romantic scene cut from a movie, a little sentimental, detached from the everyday life.</p>



<p>Yet, seeing her holding this supermarket bag in hand, I felt a peculiar realization. She had indeed met the younger Saku-kun, adored him like an older brother. It felt strangely amusing, ticklish, joyful, and a tad wistful.</p>



<p>Just to be sure, I opened my mouth once more. “Did you happen to enjoy umaibo snacks back then?”</p>



<p>“Mentai flavor, right?”</p>



<p>“Exactly!”</p>



<p>“Saku-nii was usually kind, but in those moments, he’d never let me have it.”</p>



<p>“Did you play rock-paper-scissors?”</p>



<p>“Best of three!”</p>



<p>Unable to contain ourselves, we both burst into laughter, casting playful shadows together.</p>



<p>After a moment, Asuka-senpai muttered, “But lately, it’s a bit lonely since the small candy shops around here have disappeared.”</p>



<p>I hesitated for just a moment, feeling a twinge of pain in my knee where the scab should have peeled off. I let out a small sigh, hoping it went unnoticed.</p>



<p>To avoid stumbling over my toes again, I calmed my mind before speaking. “Asuka-senpai, have you ever been to Ameyoko?”</p>



<p>“Ameyoko, in Tokyo…?”</p>



<p>I gently shook my head with a soft smile. It was the place where I first invited Saku-kun on a date at the end of summer. Sharing that memory wouldn’t diminish their value.</p>



<p>“No, not there. Near Elpa, right by the Central Wholesale Market, there’s a shop that’s like a candy market. It’s not small, more on the large side, actually. But it’s filled with nostalgic candies.”</p>



<p>“Really!?”</p>



<p>“Yes, Saku-kun was so excited. I’m sure you’ll love it too, senpai.”</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai brightened up instantly, then she shyly fiddled with her fingers. “Um, Yua-san. If it’s okay, would you like to go together sometime…?”</p>



<p>Her uncharacteristically hesitant offer was endearing, making me feel soft.</p>



<p>I lowered the corners of my eyes and answered. “Of course, let’s have lunch at the Fukui Central Market while we’re at it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p><em>Indeed, this suited my nature better</em>. As we exchanged glances, giggling, I remembered something.</p>



<p>“By the way, Asuka-senpai, how’s practice?”</p>



<p>My words were a bit brief, but it seemed to convey enough. Asuka-senpai, with a somewhat childish expression, furrowed her brows in embarrassment.</p>



<p>“My dad’s gotten really enthusiastic.”</p>



<p>“He must be happy, I’m sure.”</p>



<p>“I get that, but he’s so excited that it’s embarrassing.”</p>



<p>“Will he come to watch on the day of the performance?”</p>



<p>“He’s insisting he won’t, but I’m sure he will, without a doubt. He might even shout my name loudly without hesitation. That’s the kind of father he is now.”</p>



<p>Her expression as she spoke was awkward, a mix of embarrassment and exasperation, but there was a hint of happiness in it.</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai and her father seemed to get along well. In my case, even if my father did show up, he’d probably discreetly watch without me noticing.</p>



<p>Well, after what happened during summer vacation, it would likely be awkward if my father and Saku-kun crossed paths.</p>



<p>Absorbed in these whimsical musings, Asuka-senpai casually said, “At least this time, he should greet Saku-kun properly.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?” I let out a surprised sound.</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai continued with a gentle, knowing smile. “Despite initially seeing Saku-kun as an adversary, my father seems to have taken a liking to him. When I became part of the cheering squad, he even asked, ‘Is Chitose-kun there?’”</p>



<p><em>That’s right.</em> In retrospect, it made perfect sense.</p>



<p>I had a vague feeling that Saku-kun had been a support for Asuka-senpai when she was grappling with her career choices, and it wasn’t too far-fetched that her father and Saku-kun had crossed paths during that process.</p>



<p>The way she spoke suggested more than just a casual encounter, unlike my situation, which had been more coincidental. Perhaps Asuka-senpai had experienced something similar.</p>



<p>—Introducing a boy to your father.</p>



<p>It wasn’t something high schoolers commonly experienced, and while I wasn’t naïve enough to believe it was a once-in-a-lifetime thing, I had somehow convinced myself it was something special.</p>



<p>Once again, I lowered my eyes in self-pity. Despite knowing better, nothing had changed.</p>



<p>No matter how well it suited my nature, or perhaps because of it, could I really let things stay the way they were?</p>



<p>“Yua-san…?”</p>



<p>At the sound of her voice, I lifted my head, finding Asuka-senpai looking at me with a worried expression.</p>



<p>“Um, Asuka-senpai,” I tightly gripped the handle of the plastic bag and spoke hesitantly. “Before we go back, can we talk for a moment?”<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>Asuka-senpai nodded without saying a word, and we settled onto the short, broad steps that linked Fukui Prefectural History Museum and Ikuhisa Park.</p>



<p>From the grassy expanse, the echoes of everyone’s practice reached us. I felt a bit apologetic for listening closely.</p>



<p>“Here, Yua-san.” Asuka-senpai handed me an iced hojicha latte.</p>



<p>I accepted it, tilting my head in surprise. I had indeed put it in the basket for myself, but…</p>



<p>“Wait, did I ever drink this in front of you, Asuka-senpai?”</p>



<p>She gently shook her head, causing her silky hair sway gently. “Saku-kun often talks about everyone in front of me.”</p>



<p>Ah, just that made my heart soften a bit. I had assumed that when he was with Asuka-senpai, it was a private world for just the two of them.</p>



<p>“What about you, Asuka-senpai?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I think I’ll go for something refreshing after a while.”</p>



<p>I handed her a Royal Sawayaka from the plastic bag. Asuka-senpai accepted it and sipped it, making a pleasant sound like a smooth, rounded soap being used for a while.</p>



<p>Following suit, I sipped the hojicha latte and realized that my mouth was drier than I had thought. Despite it being October, there were still many days where it felt surprisingly hot in the bright sunlight as the nights suddenly turn chilly, making it tricky to adjust with clothing.</p>



<p>Considering my inclination towards feeling cold, I might soon find myself eagerly donning scarves and coats.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I glanced at the beautiful profile of the senpai sitting beside me.</p>



<p>──How would she welcome winter?</p>



<p>On snowy days, she might stand there on that riverbank in her usual blazer, looking like she just stepped out of a fairy tale—mystical, evoking no sense of temperature.</p>



<p>Yet, if she were bundled up with fluffy earmuffs and layers, that would also feel unmistakably like Asuka-senpai. And that, I think, would be a small step that could bring us a bit closer.</p>



<p>That’s why I wanted to ask.</p>



<p>──How did she connect with love?</p>



<p>Lost in my thoughts, Asuka-senpai unexpectedly spoke up. “Truth is, I’ve been wanting to talk to you, Yua-san.”</p>



<p>“Me…?” I tilted my head in surprise.</p>



<p>With her eyes narrowing somewhat wistfully, Asuka-senpai continued, “About things I can’t discuss with just anyone, about feelings that will never reach.”</p>



<p>I let that distinctly Asuka-senpai-like phrase linger on my tongue, like a secret ingredient subtly dropped into the conversation. After a moment, I suddenly grasped the delicate nuances.</p>



<p>Come to think of it…</p>



<p>I had friends like Yuuko-chan, Yuzuki-chan, Haru-chan, and of course, friends like Mizushino-kun, Asano-kun, and Yamazaki-kun, who I could share Saku-kun’s stories with. But Asuka-senpai, from last year, or perhaps even when she was a little girl in summer,</p>



<p>──She must have always been alone.</p>



<p>Once, and maybe even now, I secretly admired their special bond where no one else could intrude. When she talked with Saku-kun, it felt like the world existed only for them, enveloped in a delicate, pastel-blue curtain that made even peeking seem too intrusive.</p>



<p>I had assumed Asuka-senpai was adept at breathing within that atmosphere, but it was a two-way street. If others couldn’t enter, it also meant she couldn’t enter the world of others.</p>



<p>Had Asuka-senpai ever had someone to share the same warmth when she was conflicted, troubled, in pain, or feeling melancholic about Saku-kun?</p>



<p>No, I shook my head at the question I already knew the answer to.</p>



<p>On that night, she had whispered something that carried a tinge of loneliness.</p>



<p><em>“So, maybe that riverbank is our only place. It’s the only place I have.”</em></p>



<p>Surely, Asuka-senpai had been holding onto feelings she couldn’t express, sentimentalities that had no outlet, stories she could never share with anyone.</p>



<p>She’s strong, I thought, once again finding myself enchanted by that regal nobility akin to a stray cat.</p>



<p>While I had envied her role as the senpai who received Saku-kun’s innocent smiles, she had been standing on the other side of time, unable to rewind, bearing those untold feelings yet always serving as his guiding light.</p>



<p>I had always watched from afar—the backs of those two loners.</p>



<p>If, even for a brief moment, I could become the other half of that lonely back──</p>



<p>I nodded towards Asuka-senpai. “If you’re willing, I’d like to hear it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s take turns.”</p>



<p>“Who goes first?”</p>



<p>“Best of three, sound good?”</p>



<p>“Alright!”</p>



<p>Having won at rock-paper-scissors, I began to delicately unravel the small fragments that had been bothering me ever since that day—a task akin to plucking it with tweezers.</p>



<p>About the day I invited Kureha-chan to Saku-kun’s house, her gracious offer to cook in my place, and my enthusiastic acceptance.</p>



<p>Saku-kun rolling up Kureha-chan’s sleeves, her kitchen culinary prowess unsettling a once-comforting routine, and my mistaken belief of being the sole special one for him.</p>



<p>Her volunteering to cook when I was busy, and him nonchalantly dismissing it. </p>



<p>The chair he gifted me this summer, where she inadvertently tried to sit, and his attempt to intervene.</p>



<p>My unintended yell, reducing the girl to tears. </p>



<p>So, on that night, I fled.</p>



<p>As my story concluded, Asuka-senpai, with a gentle gleam in her eyes, extended her palm, silently signaling “touch.”</p>



<p>When I lightly touched it, she began unfurling a page in the diary, treating it like smoothing out the wrinkles of a torn leaf.</p>



<p>The cherished moments we shared during the cheer squad’s training camp and the ethereal afterglow that lingered into the following day.</p>



<p>The thrill of anticipating Saku-kun’s presence and whimsically considering leaning on him like a child. </p>



<p>Her witnessing him and Kureha-chan practicing pair dancing by the riverside, and feeling as if her cherished space was being trampled upon.</p>



<p>The girl she perceived as a junior seemed capable of spiriting him away to unknown places, and the words “Saku<sup data-fn="9c50ef84-55c4-4a9c-844c-c9eff2401bf6" class="fn"><a href="#9c50ef84-55c4-4a9c-844c-c9eff2401bf6" id="9c50ef84-55c4-4a9c-844c-c9eff2401bf6-link">1</a></sup>” and “Nozomi<sup data-fn="d516740a-a0fa-4db0-b61b-16c845d21bc9" class="fn"><a href="#d516740a-a0fa-4db0-b61b-16c845d21bc9" id="d516740a-a0fa-4db0-b61b-16c845d21bc9-link">2</a></sup>” together pierced her heart.</p>



<p>How both of them conveying their intention to wait for Asuka-senpai, and Kureha-chan innocently inquiring about future visits.</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai involuntarily shouting, and the junior girl’s face on the verge of tears. </p>



<p>So, on that dusky evening, Asuka-senpai fled.</p>



<p>With that, as if resealing a diary with scotch tape, Asuka-senpai concluded her story. We exchanged solemn glances, and then….</p>



<p>──Pfft, a stifled laugh escaped both of us.</p>



<p>It all seemed hilariously absurd. Asuka-senpai seemed to feel the same way, given the rare sight of her clutching her stomach as if in pain.</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai lifted her gaze to meet mine. “You know, we really…”</p>



<p>Still struggling to suppress my laughter, I responded, “Maybe we’re more alike than we think.”</p>



<p>Finally calming down, Asuka-senpai looked into the distance with a softened expression. “It’s kinda ridiculous, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely.”</p>



<p>“Who do you think was at fault?”</p>



<p>“Do we really need to check each other’s answers?”</p>



<p>“There’s meaning in comparing our answer sheets.”</p>



<p>“On the count of three, then.”</p>



<p>“Ready? One, two, three—”</p>



<p>“”──Me.””</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai lowered her eyebrows almost mockingly. She placed both hands behind her and casually stretched out her legs, gazing thoughtfully into the sky.</p>



<p>Following suit, I joined her. A flock of sheep leisurely paraded across the pre-dusk sky.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yua-san,” Asuka-senpai spoke with a newfound lightness. “Could you put into words what you thought after hearing my story?”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>As I hesitated, she continued, seemingly seeing through my reasons.</p>



<p>“I particularly want to hear it from Yua-san, who is especially kind among everyone.”</p>



<p>“Will you pay me back properly later?”</p>



<p>“A payback? Sure.”</p>



<p>I sighed. This wasn’t exactly my forte, but perhaps Asuka-senpai had longed to have such a conversation with someone.</p>



<p>If she chose me as that person, then as a new friend and finally a kouhai who could proudly introduce herself, I wanted to fulfill this modest request.</p>



<p>I bit my lower lip briefly, preparing myself to address her with determination before speaking.</p>



<p>“──Asuka-senpai, the riverside doesn’t belong to anyone.”</p>



<p>“Ouch, you’re hitting right where it hurts.”</p>



<p>“Once, on a certain August evening, I also went down there with Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>“…Ah, he didn’t share that story with me.”</p>



<p>“Saku-kun is someone who values those private moments.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>



<p>“He’ll make sure to keep our secrets.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, that’s a lovely sentiment.”</p>



<p>“That’s why I don’t feel the need to apologize to you, Asuka-senpai.”</p>



<p>“That’s fair.”</p>



<p>“While I can’t presume to understand Kureha-chan’s feelings, at least Saku-kun wasn’t waiting at the riverside without a second thought.”</p>



<p>“You’re confident about that, huh?”</p>



<p>“I’m sure it was Kureha-chan’s idea, and Saku-kun probably tried to refuse at least once.”</p>



<p>“I think so too.”</p>



<p>“But Kureha-chan, being surprisingly perceptive, was unintentionally hurt more than necessary.”</p>



<p>“She must feel like she was excluded…”</p>



<p>“Saku-kun couldn’t just ignore it.”</p>



<p>“He’s a hero, after all.”</p>



<p>“So, it’s not that he was spending time with Kureha-chan at the riverbank; he was waiting for you there, Asuka-senpai.”</p>



<p>“──”</p>



<p>“That’s how I believe he came to terms with it.”</p>



<p>As I finished speaking, Asuka-senpai chuckled weakly. “Everything becomes clear when you’re calm.”</p>



<p>Feeling a bit awkward, I glanced down. “Sorry, I might have gone too far while trying to convince myself.”</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai looked at me, softening her expression as if a weight had been lifted.</p>



<p>“No, I asked for this.” She stretched up a bit and then tilted her head, smiling. “Thanks, Yua-san.”</p>



<p>Leaning against the stairs, I shifted closer, narrowing the distance just a bit more. Then, I lightly tugged at Asuka-senpai’s shirt. “Asuka-senpai, it’s your turn now.”</p>



<p>Just with that, she seemed to understand, her eyelashes lifted with a somewhat amused expression. “Is it okay?”</p>



<p>“I’d especially like to hear it from Asuka-senpai, who’s usually quite neutral.”</p>



<p>“I see,” she closed her eyes and nodded. After a contemplative pause, she squinted her eyes mischievously, like scolding a bad child.</p>



<p>“You see, Yua-san, you’re not Saku-kun’s wife!”</p>



<p>“Asuka-senpai, that’s a bit much!”</p>



<p>Her words hit harder than I anticipated. Unable to contain her laughter, her hair swayed playfully. “Sorry, sorry, I was a bit mean.”</p>



<p>I intentionally puffed my cheeks. “<em>Mou</em>, this is revenge, isn’t it?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0179_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>In some odd way, I was starting to understand Saku-kun’s tendency to act a bit childish around her.</p>



<p><em>She’s truly an enigmatic individual.</em></p>



<p>Asuka-senpai cleared her throat, then spoke with a mature gaze. “Alright, from now on, it’s payback time.”</p>



<p>When I nodded, she began to speak as if reciting a wistful poem.</p>



<p>“I understand that you’re supporting Saku-kun’s daily life who lives alone, Yua-san.”</p>



<p>“It’s not that big of a deal…”</p>



<p>“But that’s still just being support; it’s not about blending into each other’s lives.”</p>



<p>“Saku-kun’s daily life isn’t my daily life, is it?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. So, even though you have the right to be there, you don’t have the authority to evict.”</p>



<p>“I thought I understood, but…”</p>



<p>“Neither I nor Nanase-san, Aomi-san, Hiiragi-san, and even Nozomi-san, strictly need your permission to use his kitchen.”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>“And in this case, it was you who invited Nozomi-san and agreed to her cooking, not Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>“…Yes.”</p>



<p>“That’s why, getting upset just because she’s as good as you in the kitchen seems a bit unreasonable, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“──Yes, you’re right.”</p>



<p>“The chair he gave as a gift, he prepared it for you, right?”</p>



<p>“At first, it was only me who sat on it, as we had agreed on the usual arrangement. I never imagined Kureha-chan would be cooking.”</p>



<p>“Of course, Nozomi-san wouldn’t know about that.”</p>



<p>“She wouldn’t.”</p>



<p>“So, from Nozomi-san’s perspective, it’s like being scolded out of the blue by a usually calm and kind senpai.”</p>



<p>“I truly don’t have words to reply.”</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai paused for a moment and then, with a slightly softer tone, asked, “Do you understand why Saku-kun didn’t chase after us?”</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I respond to her question. “Because it would make Kureha-chan, who did nothing wrong, look like the villain.”</p>



<p>Asuka-senpai nodded gently with a calm expression.</p>



<p>In truth, we were at fault without needing this kind of validation. However, at that moment, if Saku-kun had chased after us, it might have left Kureha-chan feeling abandoned and blaming herself.</p>



<p>Even if, upon reflection, I was the one selfishly hurt, Saku-kun, in his swift judgment…</p>



<p>He chose to side with the one who ended up in tears.</p>



<p>One reason was to avoid placing responsibility on an innocent junior girl. The other, perhaps, was to offer ourselves an escape route, suggesting that the one who was wrong wasn’t us but rather himself.</p>



<p>Whether intentional or not, Saku-kun had this tendency—to shoulder even our weaknesses, perhaps without realizing it.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about these, Asuka-senpai let out a soft, self-deprecating smile. “Perhaps that’s the only modest solace for us right now.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>



<p>When I questioned, she furrowed her brows, looking somewhat troubled.</p>



<p>“Saku-nii always prioritizes others’ affairs over his own.” She said it with the gaze of a girl yearning for a hero.</p>



<p>“His own affairs and others’ affairs…”</p>



<p>As I repeated those words in a hushed tone, she hastily added, “Saying ‘others’ affairs’ is just a turn of phrase. I don’t mean to imply Nozomi-san is just a random person, just to be clear.”</p>



<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>



<p>In essence, what Asuka-senpai wanted to convey was that, for Saku-kun at that moment, our misunderstanding fell within the scope of his own concerns. Therefore, he set aside his own feelings and considered Kureha-chan’s perspective.</p>



<p>While it might not be appropriate to rejoice recklessly after causing trouble for Saku-kun and hurting a junior girl, if that genuinely was the case, it did offer a modest solace.</p>



<p>I sighed deeply, releasing the tension in my shoulders. Finally, it felt like I could organize the turmoil that had lingered since that day.</p>



<p>When I glanced at Asuka-senpai, her profile appeared refreshingly clear. Feeling grateful for our conversation, I decide to express it;</p>



<p>“Thank you, Asuka-senpai.”</p>



<p>“This makes us even, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>As Asuka-senpai stood up, she remarked, “We should probably head back soon.”</p>



<p>“Indeed.”</p>



<p>When the two of us each grabbed a plastic bag and were about to descend the stairs, Asuka-senpai spoke up as if suddenly remembering something.</p>



<p>“Can I ask you something a bit embarrassing before we go?”</p>



<p>I chuckled before responding, “After all the embarrassing stories we’ve shared, it’s a bit late for that.”</p>



<p>“That’s true,” Asuka-senpai said, scratching her cheek. “Hey, Yua-san.”</p>



<p>In a voice both mature and reminiscent of an ordinary high school girl, she continued, “Do you think Nozomi-san likes someone?”</p>



<p>She didn’t specify whom. Yet, it didn’t need clarification, as it inevitably conveyed itself.</p>



<p>“I wonder. It’s hard to say.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, sorry.”</p>



<p>While observing Asuka-senpai’s delicate back as she began to walk, a single thought crosses my mind:</p>



<p><em>“She must had been holding onto feelings she couldn’t express, sentimentalities that had no outlet, stories she could never share with anyone.”</em></p>



<p>If that were the case,</p>



<p>──Surely, she harbored a strong, noble heart within her.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>It was a relief that I was able to confide in Yua-san. I, Nishino Asuka, thought so as I walked toward Ikuhisa Park. A subtle and graceful set of footsteps trailed me from behind.</p>



<p>Until now, I never had someone I could share my concerns about him with.</p>



<p>Yua-san, Hiiragi-san, Nanase-san, and Aomi-san – perhaps they had been having conversations like this for a long time. Like the times when only I wasn’t invited to baseball practice. Like the study camp night when only I couldn’t sleep. Like that August day when only I was outside.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but envy it – the relationship where they could openly bare their hearts to friends who share the same struggles. It was like exchanging secret tales in a sandbox at the park, intertwining hands in a tunnel dug from both sides, a mixture of unspoken guilt and the unique excitement that came with it.</p>



<p>Suddenly, memories of a distant day during a school trip resurfaced.</p>



<p>Back when I was in fifth grade, where I stayed in the Youth Nature House I once told him about, I vividly recalled a room with four bunk beds facing each other. Three girls, aside from me, giggled about whether to sleep on the top or bottom bunks.</p>



<p>I didn’t understand it then, but now I realized it was an arrangement to prevent mischievous kids from doing mischief. Except when sleeping, the rule was to keep the room door wide open even during free time.</p>



<p>Sitting beneath the bunk beds and talking, I remembered the moments when those three girls would get all excited. It always happened when the popular boy in our class passed by.</p>



<p>──They all had a crush on the same boy.</p>



<p>He was fast, charming, kind, and funny. Not exactly like my childhood friend Saku-nii, but he seemed to embody all the traits that make someone popular in elementary school.</p>



<p>Watching the three girls huddle and stifle laughter as he passed, I couldn’t fathom what was so amusing.</p>



<p>Just to clarify, I didn’t mean to look down on my friends.  After meeting Saku-nii, I painfully understood the feeling of getting excited at the sight of someone you like. </p>



<p>However, I couldn’t quite grasp the act of sharing that among close friends. It seemed as if they were deepening their bond by proudly wearing a “We Like the Same Boy” badge.</p>



<p>I often found myself tilting my head, pondering why they behaved like that despite knowing only one of them could end up with him. What intrigued me even more was that it was a common knowledge in the class that this boy liked one of these three girls.</p>



<p>Even so, why…</p>



<p><em>“Totally caught him staring!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oh, come on, he wasn’t.”</em></p>



<p><em>“He’s been intentionally passing by our room.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Just confess already.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But, I don’t really know if it’s true…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Everyone says it’s obvious!”</em></p>



<p>──Why did they continue to talk excitedly together?</p>



<p>What was that time, I wonder. I squinted my eyes, basking in the lingering nostalgia of unexpected memories.</p>



<p>A time when everyone was still a little girl. Perhaps we were all just in love with the concept of love itself.</p>



<p>Now, long past our childhood, I felt like I had finally grasped that fleeting sense of warmth, huddling under a faint cherry blossom-colored blanket, just slightly leaning on each other.</p>



<p>──A secret only for girls, something that boys cannot hear.</p>



<p>However, with the warmth emanating from Yua-san walking behind me, I couldn’t help but think.</p>



<p>The hands intertwined in the sandbox tunnel would eventually have to let go.</p>



<p>It was fine until now. I was always on the outside, which meant I never had to consider other girls when thinking about him. I was allowed to behave like a carefree stray cat.</p>



<p>──Not aware that I could hurt someone when love was reciprocated.</p>



<p>Of course, logically, I understood. Behind fulfilled love lied the basic premise of unrequited love.</p>



<p>Yet, because I wasn’t part of his circle, I could remain irresponsible and oblivious. While I felt a kind of affection as I listened to his stories and offered advice, I wasn’t so kind enough to withdraw my own feelings based solely on that.</p>



<p>But now────</p>



<p><em>“Finally, my name is lined up in your story.”</em></p>



<p>I had become a character too, something I had longed for.</p>



<p>If only I were in the same grade, in the same class, part of the same group as everyone, weaving the same story—how wonderful that would be, even if only for a brief moment?</p>



<p>Even after the school festival ended, the bonds formed here wouldn’t fade away. And that’s why I must face them, whether I wanted to or not.</p>



<p>This was no longer just Nishino Asuka’s story.</p>



<p>Even though I had been narrating it in the first person all along, the protagonist was Nishino Asuka, and if her love was reciprocated, it would be an unquestionable happy ending.</p>



<p>Even if someone was crying behind the scenes, if it wasn’t depicted, it might as well never happened.</p>



<p>But now that I had become a character in the ensemble drama you all were spinning…</p>



<p>──I could imagine Yua-san’s tears.</p>



<p><em>Maybe, just maybe,</em> I think. Yua-san, Nanase-san, Aomi-san, and of course, Hiiragi-san who confessed her feelings.</p>



<p>──They had already been aware of this long ago, but still choose to face love and the girl next to them.</p>



<p>If that was the case, then I was the only one, significantly lagging behind. It was a step I wished for. I couldn’t take it back now, nor did I want to.</p>



<p>The time spent with everyone during the cheer camp, the bond I forged with Yua-san – these would surely be cherished memories ten years from now.</p>



<p><em>But</em>, I gently placed my hand on my chest, I realized I might have been too ignorant and naive.</p>



<p>If only that day, I hadn’t eagerly joined the cheering squad just because your invitation. If only that night, I hadn’t become Asuka-senpai and had disappeared as the illusion of Nishino-senpai…</p>



<p>──I could have devoted myself wholeheartedly to my own love.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the words that slipped out of my mouth earlier came back to me.</p>



<p><em>“Do you think Nozomi-san likes someone?”</em></p>



<p>Despite knowing there wouldn’t be an answer, why did I ask Yua-san that? I wasn’t serious about it, let alone being sly or acting defensively.</p>



<p>Unconsciously, was I yearning for something?</p>



<p>Nozomi-san was still in a position where she could behave as she pleases from the outside of the circle. She might already be heading towards a love that had begun or was about to begin, leaving the starting line without looking back at others.</p>



<p>Senpai and kohai, kohai and senpai.</p>



<p>Although they were slightly different, Nozomi-san still firmly held the right I had just a little while ago—to ignore and pretend not to see.</p>



<p>Ah, if only. I should have asked while I could still be a girl.</p>



<p>──How did that girl, those girls, weave that love?<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>Having swiftly downed the drinks Yua and Asu-nee brought for everyone, I, Chitose Saku, stood in front of the vending machine within the park grounds.</p>



<p>I inserted the coins from my left pocket, hesitated briefly before pressing the button for Calpis.</p>



<p>Surrounded by three orderly vending machines and a tin-roofed shed containing a trash bin, this place exuded a quaint charm reminiscent of a rural bus stop. The scene, coupled with the now-tilted western sun that nostalgically recalled the long-gone summer twilight, prompted me to take a sip of Calpis with a self-deprecating chuckle.</p>



<p>Finally feeling at ease, I settled onto the bench before me.</p>



<p>When I lightly massaged my arms and sides, a sensation akin to stiffness lingered in various parts of my upper body. Despite maintaining my training routine since quitting the baseball team, it seemed like I might have some forgotten muscle soreness tomorrow. I hadn’t anticipated Kenta would come up with such a challenging choreography.</p>



<p>Finding joy in muscle soreness was like the quirks of a sports club. Unlike skills and endurance in baseball, where improvement happened gradually, training results were promptly reflected the next day.</p>



<p>Ignoring the nuances of injuries and such, the straightforwardness of feeling growth in tandem with pain was quite appealing.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about these…</p>



<p>“Saku, mind if I join you?” Yuuko, who had somehow approached unnoticed, peered down at me.</p>



<p>“Hey, good job today.”</p>



<p>“I was just singing, though.”</p>



<p>I brushed away some fallen leaves on the bench. Yuuko, seeing this, lowered her eyes with a subtle smile.</p>



<p>“Thanks, Saku.” As she said that, she gracefully took a seat beside me.</p>



<p>I thought I had gotten used to this sight, but involuntarily, I averted my gaze from Yuuko.</p>



<p>Over the past year and a half, I had seen her profile countless times—long, glistening hair cascading down, creating a gentle, feathery shadow on sunny days. Every time, it felt like I was being taught unfamiliar landscapes and new emotions, much like the iridescent soap bubbles that floated one after another.</p>



<p>However, now, as I stole another glance at Yuuko’s profile, her recently cut semi-long hair flowed seamlessly like a babbling brook, sparkling with the hues of twilight and casting a flickering, star-like shadow.</p>



<p>With each look, I found myself enveloped in a comforting tranquility, akin to dozing off by a quiet lakeside, where only the sound of water gently resonated.</p>



<p>“Saku…?”</p>



<p>While I was lost in thought, Yuuko tilted her head curiously as she looked at me.</p>



<p>After realizing that I’d been staring at her, I quickly put on a smile to deflect. “So, did you need something?”</p>



<p>In response to my question, she chuckled and narrowed her eyes playfully. “Yeah, I have something to talk to you about.”</p>



<p>“Alright.”</p>



<p>Keeping my response brief, Yuuko continued while gazing toward the plaza. “It’s already October, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, time flies.”</p>



<p>“Feels like the school festival is just around the corner.”</p>



<p>“‘The Feast on our end seems to be shaping up fine, but how about yours?”</p>



<p>“We’re good! Yuzuki and everyone seem excited.”</p>



<p>“That’s good then.”</p>



<p>“We need to work hard on the class play, though.”</p>



<p>“Will you be okay, Snow White?”</p>



<p>“I’ll be fine. What about you, Indecisive Prince?”</p>



<p>“Cut it out.”</p>



<p>“But I like the prince.”</p>



<p>“Don’t you find him pathetic when reading the script?”</p>



<p>“I like his pathetic side.”</p>



<p>“You won’t deny it, huh…”</p>



<p>“It’s the flip side of kindness and sincerity.”</p>



<p>“I get that’s the intention, still…”</p>



<p>After pausing, as if seeking reassurance, I glanced at her beside me.</p>



<p>She also turned toward me, my figure was reflected on her eyes, similar to looking at a clear water surface of a lake in the evening. Smoothly, almost like tenderly stroking my head, her semi-long hair gently rustled.</p>



<p>Surrendering to this comfort, I opened my mouth, “Do you think we can do it?”</p>



<p>“We can.”</p>



<p>“Can I choose?”</p>



<p>“You can.”</p>



<p>“It’s just acting.”</p>



<p>“I won’t get hurt.”</p>



<p>“What if…”</p>



<p>“I’ll be fine.”</p>



<p>“Not because…”</p>



<p>“I understand.”</p>



<p>“I’m facing it.”</p>



<p>“I can feel it.”</p>



<p>“The prince is still a bit pathetic, isn’t he?”</p>



<p>“Maybe just a bit.”</p>



<p>“Do you hate it?”</p>



<p>“I love it.”</p>



<p>“Regarding what we were just talking about…”</p>



<p>“I’m fine with that.”</p>



<p>“It’s like I made you say it.”</p>



<p>“You let me say it.”</p>



<p>“Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“Saku.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, just felt like calling your name.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, me too.”</p>



<p>We were just like moon rabbits.</p>



<p><em>Pettan, pettan</em>, just the two of us. </p>



<p><em>Pattan, pattan</em>, just the two of us.</p>



<p>When my heart settled into a pure calm, Yuuko answered skillfully by molding the shapes.</p>



<p>On the way home, she said this once to me;</p>



<p><em>“When you truly let someone into your heart, there are so many things you can talk about. Things you want to say, things you want to hear, even complaints. There’s so much more you want to share.”</em></p>



<p>I couldn’t help but narrow my eyes at the nostalgic memory. Back then, I tried to downplay it as something related to Kenta, but perhaps Yuuko had always wanted to have conversations like this.</p>



<p>It was strange, though.</p>



<p>──When you truly let someone into your heart, it seemed words weren’t needed as much as you’d think.</p>



<p>Yuuko continued as if recalling something. “But I’m feeling a bit lonely.”</p>



<p>“Lonely…?”</p>



<p>“Because, isn’t the preparation for festival like this the most enjoyable part?”</p>



<p>“I get that feeling.”</p>



<p>“Should we do this again next year?”</p>



<p>“I wonder.”</p>



<p>“You don’t know?”</p>



<p>“No idea.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Saku, can I say something a bit more lonely?”</p>



<p>“If it’s not too sad.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t the culmination of loneliness leading to ultimate sadness?”</p>



<p>“Maybe the remnants of sadness are what create loneliness.”</p>



<p>“You’re weird, Saku.”</p>



<p>“You’re weird too, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“But I think this feeling is probably more on the lonely side.”</p>



<p>“Okay, then I’ll listen.”</p>



<p>“This might be the last.”</p>



<p>“The last…”</p>



<p>“Yeah, our school festival.”</p>



<p>Ah, that was undeniably a conversation tinted with loneliness. Yet, Yuuko’s sentiment was painfully relatable. Perhaps it was because Asu-nee was graduating, and we might no longer be in the same color with Kureha.</p>



<p>Even though we were well aware of that, there was more to it.</p>



<p>──Surely, the “us” next year wouldn’t be the same as we were now.</p>



<p>We didn’t know how things would settle, but at the very least, continuing this relationship where everyone’s hearts were tied by a single blue thread seemed to be reaching its limits.</p>



<p>We had choices to make. We needed answers.</p>



<p>─We had to untangle the blue thread and reweave the red one.</p>



<p>So, this was it, the end.</p>



<p>To ensure I wouldn’t be left behind by the melancholy, shrouded in loneliness, I spoke up, “I feel the same way.”</p>



<p>Yuuko delicately folded the loneliness and tucked in her pocket, or so it seemed.</p>



<p>“Let’s enjoy the festival, Saku.”</p>



<p>“Let’s do that, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>At least, until the first and last festival we welcomed together came to an end, it would be nice if we could remain in the same shade of blue.</p>



<p>Even if the approaching footsteps of the red hues, dyeing the season, were soon approaching.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>Having taken a slightly longer break, Yuuko and I strolled towards the athletic field.</p>



<p>While not exactly the park’s main attraction, it did boast a combination of slides, ropes, and nets in the playground. I vaguely remembered frequenting this place in my childhood.</p>



<p>We settled on a bench, engaging in leisurely conversation when suddenly,</p>



<p>“Senpaaaai! Yuuko-san!”</p>



<p>Kureha cheerfully ran up to us from behind. Yuuko and I exchanged glances before raising our hands in a casual response.</p>



<p>“Hey, good job there.”</p>



<p>“Good work, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Kureha positioned herself in front of us, exaggeratedly wiping sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand before speaking;</p>



<p>“I had a satisfying chat with Kazuki-san, so I came here for a little break with Senpai.”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on.”</p>



<p>As I interjected, Yuuko, sitting beside me, seemed to be amused. Her semi-long hair swayed playfully.</p>



<p>Seeing that, Kureha hurriedly spoke up, “Don’t laugh, Yuuko-san! I get nervous, you know!”</p>



<p>Yuuko, stifling her laughter with a hand over her mouth, replied, “No, not that.”</p>



<p>Kureha tilted her head in confusion. “Then what is it?”</p>



<p>In response, Yuuko lowered the corners of her eyes with a gentle expression. “Actually, Kureha, you get nervous when talking with Saku, right?</p>



<p>“”Eh…?””</p>



<p>Both Kureha’s and my voices unintentionally overlapped.</p>



<p>“That can’t be true.”</p>



<p>“It really isn’t.”</p>



<p>Seeing similar reactions from both of us, Yuuko chuckled softly. She tapped the bench next to her without explaining any further.</p>



<p>“Want to join us, Kureha?”</p>



<p>“Um, yes!”</p>



<p>Following the invitation, Kureha sat down and started talking. “Were you two having a chat?”</p>



<p>Yuuko answered the question. “Yeah, we haven’t had much time like this lately.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, did I interrupt something?”</p>



<p>“Not at all. We’ve chatted enough.”</p>



<p>“That’s a relief!”</p>



<p>It struck me as I thought about it. There used to be times when I’d often walk Yuuko home, and we’d share aimless conversations at the park along the way. Since the incident in August, though, neither of us had quite broached the topic. With the cheering squad’s collective practices and moments like these to talk slowly, it felt like it had been ages since we had the chance.</p>



<p>Yet, oddly enough, it felt like we understood each other even more than before.</p>



<p>Kureha, after glancing between Yuuko and me, cautiously spoke up. “Um, is it just me, or is the vibe between you two different from before summer vacation…?”</p>



<p>Caught off guard by a question that hit too close to home, I instinctively threw out a deflective remark. “How did you know about us before summer vacation, Kureha?”</p>



<p>Kureha answered without hesitation, like she didn’t need to explain.</p>



<p>“Haven’t I told you? I observed everyone closely!” Finding myself at a loss for how to respond, she continued, “Yuuko-san back then felt like the universally acknowledged Senpai’s wife, didn’t she? Always walking together at school or on the way home, you two seemed like a perfect match, and it became a hot topic among us freshmen.”</p>



<p>While I wasn’t completely oblivious, hearing it from a junior made it strangely awkward. Glancing at Yuuko, she seemed just as bashful.</p>



<p>I sighed briefly and spoke, “So, are we different now?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Kureha answered promptly. “I apologize if you two feel uncomfortable, but since I started this topic, I’ll be honest with my impressions.”</p>



<p>With a slightly guilty look, she continued, “Well, it’s just that before, you two seemed so perfect together, almost like it was too fake.”</p>



<p>Pausing abruptly, Kureha hurriedly added, “Oh, of course, I mean it in a good way! I mean, in the sense of being like a drama or a movie, that’s how perfect you two were that it seemed unreal!”</p>



<p>“Ah,” I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Where’s your usual catchphrase and the angry glare, Yuuko?”</p>



<p>After teasing Yuuko like that, I glanced at her.</p>



<p>“Saku?”</p>



<p>“Sorry.”</p>



<p>It had been a while since she scolded me, so I apologized within seconds. Somehow, there was a strange calming familiarity in it, which was oddly reassuring.</p>



<p>With my gaze, I urged Kureha to continue. She nodded.</p>



<p>“Lately, it’s like you naturally gravitate towards each other, not forcing it, yet always together…”</p>



<p>She’s truly observant, I thought, slightly widening my eyes. Regardless of how Yuuko felt about it, this sensation was exactly what I had been experiencing.</p>



<p>Despite the increased physical distance, it felt closer than ever. If this was evident even to a casual observer, then something must had indeed changed between us.</p>



<p>Whether it finally changed or we were just now changing, that remained uncertain.</p>



<p>“I’ve been curious for a while,” Kureha continued, “Did something happen during the summer vacation?”</p>



<p>Well, considering the flow of the conversation, such a question would naturally come up. Thinking this, I absentmindedly scratched the back of my neck, buying some time.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the others got involved in this, it wasn’t a story to casually share with strangers, even if they were cute kouhai from cheering squad.</p>



<p>While I hesitated on how to answer, Yuuko looked at me with a somewhat wistful expression.</p>



<p>“Saku, is it okay?”</p>



<p>Her words, unexpected or perhaps exactly as expected, prompted an immediate nod from me.</p>



<p>“Yeah, if you’re okay with it, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>This certainly wasn’t something to hand out like flyers in front of the station. But if Yuuko had decided it was alright to tell Kureha, I saw no reason to stop it. Yua, who wasn’t here, would probably share the same sentiment.</p>



<p>Kureha observed our interaction with apparent interest. Yuuko glanced at me once more, blinking softly.</p>



<p>“Thanks, Saku.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>After that, I leaned back against the bench, surrendering my weight to the backrest. I closed my eyes as if contemplating the bygone August.</p>



<p>In the background, children playing on the sports equipment made rhythmic steps on the wooden floor, and nearby playground equipment creaked and giggled in the breeze. Occasionally, rustling leaves added their own harmonies.</p>



<p>“I…” Yuuko began, glancing towards Kureha and tilting her head slightly. “I confessed to Saku this summer, and, well, he turned me down.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>It was a story from the summer vacation, something that no one spread around carelessly. Even Kureha, who was in the loop with everything, seemed to be hearing it for the first time.</p>



<p>Kureha was fidgeting with her fingers apologetically over her skirt. “I, uh, shouldn’t have asked without thinking.”</p>



<p>“No worries,” Yuuko replied, the tips of her semi-long hair gently swayed. “We’re holding hands now, so it doesn’t hurt anymore.”</p>



<p>“Holding… hands?”</p>



<p>Nodding slightly, Yuko began to speak slowly.</p>



<p>She expressed dissatisfaction with being treated differently since childhood. She wished for genuine friendships and the chance to meet someone special in high school.</p>



<p>And then, a conflict broke during the class representative election in our first year, which marked the first time she was being scolded. It became the starting point for her to develop feelings for me.</p>



<p>She confessed during our first year and said she could wait for my answer. She felt a sense of urgency due to the friendship that blossomed with Yua in the second semester. She regretted it for a long time.</p>



<p>In our second year, as she got closer to Nanase and Haru, she felt the need to draw some boundaries. She realized that her precious ones couldn’t genuinely appreciate their specialness because of her.</p>



<p>Her confession wasn’t to start something but to end it.</p>



<p>And in the end, Yua was the one who held our hands.</p>



<p>Yuuko concluded her story, slowly opening her eyes. “That’s our August.”</p>



<p>Kureha, who had been on the verge of tears, finally couldn’t contain herself, and tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>



<p>“That’s…” her voice choked with emotion. “Oh, um, I…”</p>



<p>Apparently, Kureha wasn’t aware that she was crying. She looked startled as a tear dropped from her chin.</p>



<p>Yuuko handed her a sunflower-colored handkerchief with a concerned expression. “Why are you crying?”</p>



<p>“It’s not… These aren’t beautiful tears, it’s just that────”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed about to say something, but she fell silent, her hands tightening into fists on her skirt. In the meantime, raindrops trickled down her knuckles.</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Kureha said, accepting the handkerchief. “I’ll wash it and return it to you.”</p>



<p>“No need, it’s fine.”</p>



<p>Kureha quietly wiped her tears, trying not to make any stains on the handkerchief. Yuuko then spoke with a soft tone. “Um, was it sympathetic tears?”</p>



<p>Kureha vigorously shook her head. “I’d rather not make it about that, even though that might be easier.”</p>



<p>Gently, as if wiping away tears from the heart, Yuuko stroked Kureha’s back and asked. “Could you tell me a bit more?”</p>



<p>Kureha sniffed briefly, and she quickly wiped her nose. Turning her face away, she seemed to be squeezing out the moisture from her voice, as if wringing water from a cloth.</p>



<p>“I… I realized I let the entire summer slip away.”</p>



<p>The sentimentality of summer, now with nowhere to go, collided with the entrance of autumn. An invisible emotion, like the transparency of a ramune marble—unreachable, popping, and disappearing.</p>



<p>Frankly, the meaning behind those words wasn’t clear. Even in our short time together, Kureha occasionally revealed surprisingly mature expressions. Yet, this was the first time she laid bare this vulnerable corner of her heart.</p>



<p>Her crying face was distinctly junior-like, and for some reason, exuding the untouched freshness of spring, like that of a lonely girl.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kureha?” Without a trace of hesitation, Yuuko spoke. “You can start anew.”</p>



<p>At those words, Kureha widened her eyes. “Huh…?”</p>



<p>Yuuko, with eyes narrowed like the first snowfall redefining the landscape, smiled wistfully.</p>



<p>“──Just like me, who lost one love this summer and start a new one.”</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san…”</p>



<p>It seemed that the tears Kureha had been holding back were about to fall again, and she bit her lip tightly.</p>



<p>For some reason, I felt an odd urge to cry myself.</p>



<p><em>So, let’s start walking again. Let’s run once more. </em>It felt like that’s what she was saying.</p>



<p>Kureha stood up and took a step forward, her skirt swirling as she looked back. The eyes that resisted the tears held a certain resolve. Perhaps, it was akin to the expression she showed at the starting line of a short-distance race.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san, may I ask you one thing?”</p>



<p>Yuuko tilted her head with a soft smile. “Sure, what is it?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0221_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Gripping the handkerchief tightly enough to form wrinkles, Kureha spoke, “If you hold hands, don’t you end up unable to let go?”</p>



<p>“No, you don’t let go; you offer your hand.” Yuuko continued without any hesitation in her warm voice.</p>



<p>“All these overflowing feelings, the days we’ve spent, the colors reflected in our eyes, the gazes we exchanged, the warmth of touched hands, the scent on the way home, the spilled tears, the hearts that couldn’t connect—”</p>



<p>She paused momentarily, gently placing both hands on her chest.</p>



<p>“──I’m entrusting all of those to them, so they can be happy.”</p>



<p>She delivered these words with a smile like a bouquet.</p>



<p>“────!!”</p>



<p>“Yuuko…” I instinctively stood up, but managed to stop myself in time.</p>



<p>Who was I to say, “Don’t smile like it’s goodbye”? How could I beg “Please don’t wish like you’re about to cry”?</p>



<p>Especially when I was the one who causing you to have that expression.</p>



<p>Kureha tried to say something over and over again, but fell silent. She shrugged her shoulders with a slightly bewildered look, then burst into laughter with a playful look on her face.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san, isn’t that a bit too heavy?!”</p>



<p>Yuuko tilted her head in confusion. “Is that so?”</p>



<p>Kureha casually stated, “Even though you had found your love, why are you taking care of other girls’ heart?”</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Yuuko repeated the same lines once more. “At least the people I want to offer my hand to will surely take my feelings with them.”</p>



<p>Kureha inadvertently let out a small voice. “That’s…” then, she shook her head as if to retract her words. “Everyone is wonderful!”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>“I admire relationships where you can share your feelings like that!”</p>



<p>“Kureha, let’s become such friends too!”</p>



<p>“Ehehe.”</p>



<p>Right at that moment…</p>



<p>“There you are! It’s about time we resume practice!”</p>



<p>Nanase rushed over from behind. At those words, I checked the clock, we were way beyond our break time. The conversation had taken an unexpected turn, and I found myself completely engrossed.</p>



<p>Nanase sighed in exasperation. “Seriously, the three of you here together.”</p>



<p>Yuuko and I exchanged awkward glances. Kureha hastily spoke up to explain. “Sorry! It’s because I was hearing about what happened in August from Yuuko-san.”</p>



<p>Nanase raised an eyebrow slightly. “Oh?”</p>



<p>With an innocent tone, Kureha continued, “It was a really wonderful story!”</p>



<p>Nanase shrugged slightly, responding with a relaxed smile befitting a senpai. “Really?”</p>



<p>As the four of us began walking towards the square,</p>



<p>“──────♫”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yuuko hummed the melody from the ‘Feast.’</p>



<p>“I really love this song!”</p>



<p>Nanase and I exchanged a glance, smiling subtly.</p>



<p>“I like it too.”</p>



<p>“So do I.”</p>



<p>Kureha joined Yuuko, and soon Nanase followed suit.</p>



<p>Unintentionally, the clumsy melody melted into the evening sky. It was like a down-to-earth, life-sized longing, and it didn’t sound bad at all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>After finishing the cheer practice and parting ways with everyone at Ikuhisa Park, I, Nanase Yuzuki, stopped my crossbike at the plaza of Tawaramachi Station on my way back towards Fuji High. </p>



<p>As I stood on the pedestrian bridge nearby, the surroundings were already enveloped in a faint indigo darkness.</p>



<p>The night seemed to be stretching on, creating a boundary between day and night, as if drawn by a pencil and was slowly being smudged away by a toy-eraser. The longer it took, the more the black stains spread, contrary to the owner’s wishes. Perhaps, by the time you noticed, it had dyed irreversibly, much like my current self.</p>



<p>As I was lost in such thoughts without direction…</p>



<p>“I love the view from this pedestrian bridge,” said Kureha, who stood beside me.</p>



<p>“I get that,” I replied, gazing at the night scenery ahead.</p>



<p>The Phoenix Avenue, wide enough to straddle the pedestrian bridge, had cars with headlights flowing in a regular pattern like a school of migratory fish. In its center, the railway tracks extended towards Tawaramachi Station, and a tram, taller than its surroundings, slowly receded like a ship crossing the sea.</p>



<p>Streetlights and the glow from vending machines reflected on the transparent enclosure of the bus stop, while traffic lights neatly lined up all the way to the end of the road changed colors in succession – red, blue, yellow.</p>



<p>Vaguely visible on the left, the distinctive triangular roof of the Fukui City Gymnasium seemed to blend with distant mountain ranges, shrouded in a haze.</p>



<p>“It’s been a while,” I said, leaning on the railing of the pedestrian bridge.</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“The pedestrian bridge.”</p>



<p>“You have to climb to get up here.”</p>



<p>“Since elementary school, maybe.”</p>



<p>“I kind of imagined it.”</p>



<p>“It was cute, wasn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Yes, it’s cute.”</p>



<p>While exchanging such casual conversation with Kureha, I suddenly recalled a nostalgic memory.</p>



<p>My elementary school had group commuting, so I walked to school with neighborhood kids. Grades were mixed, and essentially, if there were sixth graders, they became the leaders with armbands, walking as the head and tail of the group.</p>



<p>I still remembered that back then, the armband seemed like a medal of honor for those in the lower grades.</p>



<p>There was a classic pedestrian bridge just like this one over a large road on the way to school, and about six unevenly tall kids would line up and cross together. Since there was a crosswalk a little farther away, all the adults used it, so only children walked on the pedestrian bridge.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, back in those days, crossing the pedestrian bridge always gave me a sense of excitement.</p>



<p>During the morning rush hour, the road below would be reasonably packed with cars, and I, as a child, would feel a strange mix of guilt and superiority as I effortlessly strolled above them. When a large truck passed underneath, I’d feel the vibrations and whimsically imagine that if I jumped now, I could ride its broad back to some unknown town.</p>



<p>On the way home with friends, the pedestrian bridge served as our playground, much like the equipment in a park. We’d play Weighted Rock-Paper-Scissors, ran around playing tag, and sat on the stairs to chat. There were even times when we silently watched the sunset sinking behind the distant mountains together.</p>



<p>Strange, why had I forgotten all this?</p>



<p>At that time, the pedestrian bridge was undeniably a special place. For us, still small, peeking at the town through the gaps in the railing felt like a secret act, and the passing cars and occasional pedestrians probably had no idea they were being observed from a high place. It was a peculiar sensation. Perhaps that was the closest thing to an extraordinary view, a secret spot for little boys and girls unnoticed by adults.</p>



<p><em>Before I realized it, I had long since moved on,</em> I thought so as I was gently stroking the railing in front of me. It felt cool and was much shorter than my height.</p>



<p>Oh, right.</p>



<p>──This was the perfect place to have a secret talk with just the girls like this.</p>



<p>While absentmindedly watching the flow of passing cars, I murmured, “I wonder if things like this eventually disappear.”</p>



<p>“Things like this…?”</p>



<p>“Pedestrian bridges, things that have served their purpose.”</p>



<p>“Served their purpose?”</p>



<p>“It’s just the night’s sentimentality, don’t mind me.”</p>



<p>I didn’t mean to discuss things like ensuring pedestrian safety or whether elementary students still use it. Nor do I want to delve how youngsters weren’t being friendly to the elderly or people with mobility issues these days.</p>



<p>It was more about conceptual things that had come to an end.</p>



<p>Things like the public telephone quietly fading away on street corners. Or the mini stereo system nestled between Bluetooth speakers and a full-fledged audio setup. Or the love letter tucked into a shoe locker.</p>



<p>“Sceneries that were once special, things we’ve forgotten,” I muttered again.</p>



<p>“Or…” Unexpectedly, Kureha picks up where I left off.</p>



<p>“──Love we dared not express, things we looked away from.”</p>



<p>Well, at this point, I was no longer surprised by that sharpness.</p>



<p>When I was about to head back from Ikuhisa park, Kureha asked if she could come along, and I accepted her invitation without hesitation. So, when she suddenly mentioned wanting to go up the pedestrian bridge, I didn’t probe for a specific reason.</p>



<p>It was a night where there might be something to talk about, but it also felt fine if there wasn’t.</p>



<p>“I heard it, Nana-san,” Kureha said without retracting her previous statement. “You defeated a strong team from outside the prefecture in the practice match.”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>



<p>“My basketball friends were thrilled, saying Nana-san was amazing.”</p>



<p>“Do you want me to say I awakened my power thanks to someone stoking the flames?”</p>



<p>“No way! Regardless of the trigger, the performance you displayed in the match is undoubtedly your own skill, Nana-san.”</p>



<p>Her reaction made me involuntarily chuckle. “You’re a real jock, huh?”</p>



<p>“I am, indeed!”</p>



<p><em>If only she were bluffing</em>, I mused, already anticipating the answer and quietly sighing at the expected result.</p>



<p>Then, in a self-mocking and slightly provocative tone, I spoke up. “For now, you’re still above me.”</p>



<p>“We can’t directly compare because the sports are different. But if we talk about achievements alone, for now—”</p>



<p>“Wow, you’re quite shameless.”</p>



<p>When I heard that Kureha was competing in the 100-meter race at Inter-High, I genuinely felt surprised. It was a prestigious event in track and field, and precisely because it was a straightforward sport of running, you couldn’t just breeze through with luck and momentum.</p>



<p>Achieving results there meant you were genuinely strong.</p>



<p>Unlike team sports like basketball, where factors like team cohesion, individual quirks, or bad form could serve as excuses. Track and field is a battle of individual prowess with no room for justifications. And Kureha faced it alone, relying on her own abilities to triumph.</p>



<p>Even from just this reaction, I could sense how earnestly she faced her sport. The fact was undeniable.</p>



<p>“Fufu,” Kureha exclaimed, looking amused. “Well, Nana-san, you’re not in a position to say that kind of thing.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>



<p>When I inquired, Kureha turned gracefully, leaning her back against the railing of the pedestrian bridge. Looking up at the sky, she opened her mouth with a hint of joy.</p>



<p>“My friend told me that your playing style was different that day.”</p>



<p>“So?”</p>



<p>“While you usually score by utilizing Haru-san and others with your passes, that day it seems like you took on the role of a scorer.”</p>



<p>“…It depends on how you look at it.”</p>



<p>Whether she sensed my slight hesitation or not, Kureha casually remarked, “Did you discard Haru-san for the sake of your goal?”</p>



<p>“If you just look at the surface, maybe.”</p>



<p>I decided not to make a big deal out of this. Not just for my sake, but for my partner’s as well.</p>



<p>Kureha casually continued, “Well, it’s fine, isn’t it? You achieved the result.”</p>



<p>“I think so.”</p>



<p>“Your teammates were happy about it, right?”</p>



<p>“Except for my partner, yeah.”</p>



<p>“That’s Haru-san’s problem, not yours.”</p>



<p>“Do you think she’ll get over it?”</p>



<p>“Deep down, you believe she will.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but smile at that. “Seriously.”</p>



<p>Like Kureha, I leaned back against the railing of the pedestrian bridge, our shoulders nearly aligned as we gazed at the sky.</p>



<p>Despite being in the heart of Fukui city, the night sky was adorned with a dazzling display of stars, almost sickeningly beautiful. Aside from the constant flow of passing cars, there was no one else in sight but us.</p>



<p>In a place closer to the stars than usual, with a cheeky kouhai who I couldn’t fully like or dislike. Just the two of us.</p>



<p>Words tinged with fiction seemed on the verge of slipping out, and I mocked myself again for succumbing to the night’s sentimentality.</p>



<p>If only we were classmates. If only we were teammates. If only we hadn’t fallen for the same guy… Perhaps we could have been surprisingly good friends.</p>



<p>Regretting what didn’t happen, I find myself pondering that, and suddenly, the words spilled that day came pouring down like rain.</p>



<p><em>“Have you ever wondered, if the sequence of our encounters had been different?”</em></p>



<p><em>“For instance, if we had been in the same class from the beginning, if we had been childhood friends…”</em></p>



<p><em>“When you fall for someone, and their heart already belongs to someone else, what if it had been you who met them first? Thoughts like that.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’ve been nothing but myself all along, so why should I be overshadowed by a mere twist of fate? That’s why…”</em></p>



<p><em>“I want to rewind spring.”</em></p>



<p>Ah, I see, Kureha was────</p>



<p>With such a small trigger, the reality hit me uncontrollably. It turned out, when the hypothetical person you were talking about happened to be someone you loved, you couldn’t just brush it off with a casual remark.</p>



<p>So, rewind it, huh?</p>



<p>Kureha was probably the only one who truly understood what those words implied. For me right now, I could only trace the outline.</p>



<p>In essence, if there was such a thing as fate in this world, Kureha was trying to confront it head-on, doing everything in her power to overthrow it. Much like what I did against Tōdō that day in the gym.</p>



<p>──Not in her territory of the track and field but on the grand stage of love.</p>



<p>So, I also needed to gather my resolve and step onto that stage, to prove myself as the heroine of this story under the spotlight.</p>



<p>Kureha, seemingly seeing through my thoughts, opened her mouth. “So, you choose to be Nana rather than remaining as Nanase Yuzuki, huh?”</p>



<p>I responded with a relaxed, confident smile. “After all, actors don’t step on stage with their real names, do they?”</p>



<p>At those words, Kureha chuckled, her shoulders shook lightly. “Even though I set this up myself, the current Nana-san seems a bit tough.”</p>



<p>“Just a bit, huh?”</p>



<p>“But still not as tough as Yuuko-san.”</p>



<p>“So, that’s the main topic, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Honestly, I was beyond amazement or anger; I was just amused at her honesty. It seemed the previous conversation was just the warm-up act.</p>



<p>Kureha spoke unapologetically. “Please bear with me tonight. So far, Yuzuki-san is the only one I can have such a honest conversation with.”</p>



<p>“That was my intention from the start,” I said. “But still, even you have feelings you can’t bear alone, huh?”</p>



<p>“How’s that possible? I’ve been holding onto those feelings all by myself all this time.” With a ticklish expression, Kureha shook her head and continued, “Being able to be alone is one of my few advantages, so there’s no way I’d willingly let it go.”</p>



<p>“True, I was foolish to ask.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>“That’s not the right response.”</p>



<p>Both of us looked at each other and burst into laughter.</p>



<p>After a good laugh, I spoke up. “Well then, why did you invite me?”</p>



<p>“Who knows?” Kureha tilted her head. “Maybe it’s the sentimentality of the night, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“Then, I guess it can’t be helped.”</p>



<p>Even as I gave that response, I was sure my expression carried a touch of sentimentality too.</p>



<p>Perhaps this was the eve, a night that aimed to begin a little ahead of the school culture festival. A stage we needed to step onto before the curtain rose, a fleeting moment before we played our roles until the end.</p>



<p>So, was this a brief moment before that? Just Nanase Yuzuki and Nozomi Kureha exchanging words?</p>



<p>I gently squinted my eyes and started. “This is about what happened in August, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes.” Kureha nodded quietly and continued. “Do you remember what I said about Yuuko-san?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>The first cut I received on that rooftop.</p>



<p><em>“What do you want with us?”</em></p>



<p><em>“With us?”</em></p>



<p><em>“The fact that you can’t even say it’s about Chitose speaks volumes about the distance between you and Yuuko-san right now.”</em></p>



<p>I couldn’t forget even if I wanted to. That was something I felt more keenly than anyone else.</p>



<p>“It was strange,” Kureha muttered. “Until the end of summer vacation, I never thought that way about Yuuko-san, whom I observed from a distance. Even though, out of everyone, she seemed to be in the most precarious position…”</p>



<p>“I’m not trying to belittle the past Yuuko, but I get what you mean.”</p>



<p>If asked whether I had similar thoughts in the back of my mind, I’d have a hard time answering.</p>



<p>The Yuuko of the past seemed overly naive, or to put it more bluntly, she appeared to be forcing her freshly born, childish feelings on him too much. It felt like, eventually, the word ‘love’ would become as mundane as ‘good morning’ or ‘good night’ in the daily life. And while attachment might develop, it wouldn’t necessarily transform into love.</p>



<p>Of course, I hadn’t consciously analyzed it that way, but looking back now, I think I probably have had such thoughts somewhere. That’s why I was more perturbed when Nishino-senpai, Haru, and Uchi grew closer with Chitose.</p>



<p>“However,” Kureha, crossing her right leg over her left, continued. “When I actually joined the cheer squad, the atmosphere was completely different. Not because her hairstyle or anything like that, but more like…”</p>



<p>“Matured?”</p>



<p>I suggested, and she nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“If I were to put it bluntly, that fits the best. Before, she was trying to make the person she liked to look at her alone. Now, it’s like she’s earnestly thinking about Senpai. It made me feel like she’s suitable as someone next to him.”</p>



<p>“──she’ll keep thinking about him.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes widened. “Huh…?”</p>



<p>Recalling a serene and beautiful smile, I spoke. “That’s the answer Yuuko gave at the end of that summer, when I asked her what she planned to do from now on.”</p>



<p>“I see…” Kureha squinted her eyes somewhat sadly and continued, “That’s why I wanted to ask them. What happened between Yuuko-san and Senpai.”</p>



<p>“Did you get a satisfactory answer?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>“So,” I sighed briefly, “Given the situation, it’s just proper to ask, but what are your plans from here?”</p>



<p>To the question I didn’t expect an honest response to, Kureha effortlessly replied, “Nana-san, do you remember the provocative statements I said on the rooftop?”</p>



<p>“Do you think that’s enough to give me an idea?”</p>



<p>“You know, about being on par with Yuzuki-san.”</p>



<p>“Ah.”</p>



<p>I remembered those lines vividly; one that seemed to symbolize the person in front of me.</p>



<p><em>“I’m beautiful enough not to pale in comparison to you, Yuzuki-san. I can cook like Yua-san, and I’m not inferior to Haru-san in sports either. If I set my mind to it, I could even offer advice like Asuka-san.”</em></p>



<p>She had spoken in a tone as if listing plain facts.</p>



<p>Kureha lightly pressed her clenched fist against her lips. “Do you think it’s just a bluff?”</p>



<p>“No, I believe it’s true.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“I said it before, I acknowledge you.”</p>



<p>“Don’t try to woo me under the starry night.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay to accidentally fall for me.”</p>



<p>“Maybe if I had met you first.”</p>



<p>“Don’t you hate using the ‘order of meeting’ as an excuse?”</p>



<p>“That’s exactly why.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>After a momentary pause, I redirected the conversation, “So, why did you bring that up?”</p>



<p>“Can’t you figure it out?”</p>



<p>“I can guess.”</p>



<p>“Well…” As Kureha spoke, she let go of the railing, turning to face me. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, blinked slowly, and with an air of maturity beyond one summer, continued;</p>



<p>“──I can continue to think about Senpai just like Yuuko-san does.”</p>



<p>She smiled softly, like untouched white snow.</p>



<p>“I admit.”</p>



<p>As I expected, confronted with a Kureha who seemed just like Yuuko, I straightforwardly admitted it.</p>



<p>“Indeed, you can carry yourself like Yuuko, Uchi, Haru, Nishino-senpai, or even me. However…” I stepped away from the railing, brushing my hair behind my left ear. “Can I show you something?”</p>



<p>“Of course! What is it?”</p>



<p>I deliberately approached the girl who was trying to act like a kouhai, step by step… Gently, my fingertips brushed against the area around her left thigh, over her skirt.</p>



<p>“Y-Yuzuki-san…?”</p>



<p>To Kureha, who rarely showed genuine confusion, I moistened my lips with a tip of my tongue. I softly moved my fingertips, continuing in a way that drew small circles towards her buttocks, more delicate than touching.</p>



<p>“Hmm…”</p>



<p>Ignoring Kureha’s reaction, I continued to ascend with my fingers. After confirming the left hip bone, I traced the ribs one by one from the waist, circling around the collarbone slowly, and then following the neck, enveloping the jawline.</p>



<p>“Nn…” Kureha unintentionally let out a sweet voice.</p>



<p>“Naughty lips.”</p>



<p>While saying that, I gently closed her slightly chapped lips with my thumb. As I glided over the surface, her lips stiffened in a slightly tormented manner. I sensed the movement of her tongue inside.</p>



<p>“Don’t tease me too much.”</p>



<p>Our noses gently touched as we blinked together. Kureha’s shortened breath brushed against my lips. I slowly brought my cheeks up to the distance where I could touch her ear with my mouth open, and whispered softly,</p>



<p>“You’re not the only one who can act like this.”</p>



<p>“──”</p>



<p>Kureha couldn’t contain herself and squirmed. Satisfied with her reaction, I smiled with narrowed eyes.</p>



<p>“Cute,” Facing the junior who covered her left ear and turned her face away, I continued with a sweet voice. “Even though you were so spirited, you still react like a novice.”</p>



<p>Our slightly hurried breaths echoed on the deserted walkway bridge, beyond our control.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki-san, uhm…”</p>



<p>“──It’s Nana now.”</p>



<p>Kureha looked at me with a start. Her cheeks, unable to hide her agitation completely, were still slightly flushed.</p>



<p>“That was your decisive attack, huh?”</p>



<p>As I lifted the corner of my mouth, she sighed like she had given up.</p>



<p>“I stand corrected.” Kureha, with a somewhat looking like a typical kouhai, lowered her eyes with a wry smile. “Current you, Nana-san, is quite formidable.”</p>



<p>“That’s the idea.”</p>



<p>I shrugged, smiling. Kureha scratched her cheek awkwardly and continued, “I… couldn’t help but feel a bit fascinated by your charm.”</p>



<p>“Thinking of changing allegiance now?”</p>



<p>“It seems quite challenging to handle you.” At that point, Kureha’s voice bounced with excitement. “Now that you’ve finally gotten serious, it’s okay for me to do the same, right?”</p>



<p>“You seem oddly happy.”</p>



<p>“Yes! If I’m going to win, I want to beat the real Nana-san.”</p>



<p>I moistened my lips and said provocatively, “It’s too late for regrets now.”</p>



<p>“I’ve gotten used to irreversible regrets.”</p>



<p>“Sorry for keeping you waiting.”</p>



<p>“I’ve been looking forward to this!”</p>



<p>We looked at each other and chuckled together.</p>



<p>Surely, we both understood. The light banter on the eve before the opening act had come to an end. Kureha would now dash forward without hesitation. Just as she easily cut through our stagnation, she’d pierce his heart with her strong aspirations.</p>



<p>Thank you, Kureha. Without you, I wouldn’t have had the courage to face the real Nanase Yuzuki for so long, nor could I have prepared to sacrifice everything for the man I loved.</p>



<p>So, as a token of gratitude, I’d enchant you.</p>



<p>To you, who concealed my moon.</p>



<p>──With the night of the witch named Nana who hid a bright red poisoned apple.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p><em>Mirror, mirror,</em></p>



<p><em>──If I were, for instance, the evening lake.</em><sup data-fn="b629ec40-749d-4556-b400-3584487b6e53" class="fn"><a href="#b629ec40-749d-4556-b400-3584487b6e53" id="b629ec40-749d-4556-b400-3584487b6e53-link">1</a></sup><br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>The next day after school, I, Chitose Saku, remained in the classroom even after homeroom ended.</p>



<p>Surrounding me were Yuuko, Yua, Nanase, Haru, Kazuki, Kaito, and Kenta, along with Nazuna. All wearing their Kura-T while seated in a circle.</p>



<p>Today marked the first rehearsal or rather, a script reading for the play we’d perform at the cultural festival, titled ‘Snow White, the Dark Cloud Princess, and the Indecisive Prince.’ Except for Yuuko, Nanase, and me, the cheer squad members were seeing the script for the first time.</p>



<p>Setting aside the acting for a moment, we all took turns reading our lines aloud until the end. When we finished, Nazuna clapped her hands.</p>



<p>“That was great!” She glanced at everyone and squinted her eyes playfully. “By the way, I’ve decided to leave the ending to Chitose-kun and the others’ ad-lib.”</p>



<p>Hearing this, Kazuki let out a wry smile. “Well, this is… something.”</p>



<p>For some reason, Kaito gritted his teeth with a frustrated expression. “Argh, I shouldn’t have given up the lead role.”</p>



<p>Kenta muttered in a dry tone, “But this is just like King.”</p>



<p>Haru quickly added, “Ugh, what a lousy guy.”</p>



<p>Finally, Yua delivered her familiar line. “Well, Saku-kun does have those moments.”</p>



<p>“──This is fiction, okay?!”</p>



<p>Following the expected sequence, everyone laughed, and that’s when Nazuna spoke again. “So, any questions?”</p>



<p>The newcomers exchanged glances before nodding in agreement.</p>



<p>Well, the dwarf roles, which were reduced to six through some arrangement, didn’t have that many lines, so there shouldn’t be a problem. And with the cheer squad members doubling as narrators and Nazuna taking on the role of the magic mirror’s voice, everything seemed under control.</p>



<p>By the way, the dwarf roles were tailored to match each of us, so it seemed like we could perform them quite naturally. I was initially surprised, but upon rereading, various aspects were well thought out considering the limited practice time.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just the literary club members who wrote the script; the contents conveyed Nazuna’s consideration for us in many ways. I could understand why not only Yuuko, but also Nanase, who used to clash with Nazuna, trust her now.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about these things, Nazuna opened her mouth once more. “Seems fine, right? Okay then, let’s start practicing the performance right away while looking at the script.”</p>



<p>When everyone nodded and ready to stand up…</p>



<p>“Me, me, me!!” Yuuko energetically raised her hand.</p>



<p>“Alright, Yuuko,” Nazuna said,</p>



<p>Yuuko’s voice resonated with an excited tone. “How about trying the scene with the Dark Cloud Princess and the Magic Mirror first? I don’t know much about acting, so seeing what Yuzuki and Nazuna are doing might help me get a feel for it.”</p>



<p>“”Ah…”” both of them responded simultaneously.</p>



<p>It made sense. Nazuna had probably immersed herself in the script more than anyone, and Nanase must have grasped the basics too. They could easily adapt on the spot.</p>



<p>Yua raised her hand timidly. “Um, I’d like to see it too.”</p>



<p>Quickly following suit, Kenta added, “Oh, count me in!”</p>



<p>Nazuna, upon hearing this, looked towards Nanase. It was undoubtedly a sign of trust.</p>



<p>“Is that alright?” Nazuna casually asked, like inviting someone to the cafeteria when the lunch bell rang.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the classroom had fallen silent. Yuuko’s voice was loud, so everyone around must have heard it. Our classmates who were preparing props and other things had stopped, holding their breath and watching the scene unfold.</p>



<p>The person involved must have noticed too.</p>



<p>Nanase, without false modesty, gracefully stood up and declared;</p>



<p>“If it’s what the audience’s desire.” She delicately lifted her skirt and bowed elegantly.</p>



<p>“Whooooooa!” The classmates couldn’t contain their excitement any longer, erupting into cheers.</p>



<p>“I’ve been working hard on tedious chores for this day!”</p>



<p>“Same here!’</p>



<p>“I’m done after that bow!”</p>



<p>“My eyes and ears are too blessed, it’s dangerous.”</p>



<p>It had to be Nanase. She wasn’t only becoming an example for the actor crew like Yuuko, Yua, and Kenta but must also understood how her performance could boost the motivation of classmates working diligently behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Of course, Nanase Yuzuki was consciously aware of the meaning of showcasing her performance.</p>



<p>It felt relieving in a way, and for some reason, I was caught off guard by the warmth of that feeling. As if this calm feeling might turn into a poignant sentiment, I found myself searching for some trace of melancholy.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed Nanase was directing a calm gaze in my direction. Our eyes met, and it seemed like she was about to start a secret conversation. The shadow of her eyelashes gently swayed.</p>



<p>That subtle signal felt strangely poignant, and almost like to conceal something, I instinctively raised the left corner of my mouth.</p>



<p>Nanase, like a serene midnight in a snow-covered land, displayed a pure white smile.</p>



<p>“Keep your eyes on me, Saku.”</p>



<p>“I am, Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>As if being drawn into those eyes, I found myself answering before I knew it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>


<p>And just like that, Nanase, having switched into her uniform, stood at the makeshift podium.</p>



<p>The costumes for the actual performance hadn’t been tried on yet, but even for an impromptu play like this, she must have thought the Kura-T wouldn’t quite cut it. This meticulousness was so typical of her.</p>



<p>A grand mirror, large enough to reflect Nanase’s entire form, was already set up on the podium. Where they managed to procure such an item was a mystery, but the antique frame exuded an atmosphere perfectly fitting the scene.</p>



<p>Nanase gazed into the mirror and adjusted a strand of hair behind her left ear. After everyhing was ready, she nodded.</p>



<p>Kazuki, who was doubling as the narrator, flashed a calm smile and began.</p>



<p>“Now then, we present the opening segment of the play ‘Snow White, the Dark Cloud Princess, and the Indecisive Prince,’ performed by Class 2-5.”</p>



<p>“Oooohhh!” Applause thundered through the classroom.</p>



<p>“Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a princess known as the Dark Cloud Princess.”</p>



<p>Kazuki recited the familiar prologue.</p>



<p>“However, the Dark Cloud Princess, believing herself to be the fairest of them all, was frankly haughty and carried an arrogance that looked down upon others.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that a bit harsh?”</p>



<p>Nanase interjected, causing a burst of excitement in the classroom. This was an improvised ad-lib not written in the script, and it was indeed clever. I chuckled along with the others.</p>



<p>Kazuki continued, his cheeks seemingly lightened by the joyful atmosphere.</p>



<p>“The Dark Cloud Princess possessed a magic mirror.”</p>



<p>Nanase gracefully stepped forward, checking her reflection in the mirror to ensure the audience could see her. She shifted her weight to her right leg, lightly lifting her left foot so only the tip touched the ground.</p>



<p>Placing her left hand on her waist, she formed a graceful pose, like a model, and began speaking.</p>



<p>“──Mirror, mirror on the wall.”</p>



<p>With that line, a panel descended from above the mirror. It featured a deformed illustration of Nazuna, distinctly embodying the spirit of a magical mirror entity.</p>



<p>The illustration portrayed Nazuna adorned in attire with a subtle hint of witch-like aesthetics. The craftsmanship of these details added a charm, perfectly encapsulating the essence of a school festival.</p>



<p>When Nazuna’s panel overlapped with the mirror, Nanase gazed at herself with a slightly enraptured expression, placing her right hand delicately near her lips.</p>



<p>“In all the world, who is the fairest of them all?”</p>



<p>Pausing for effect, she sensually licked her lips before continuing.</p>



<p>“Well, that would be me, of course!”</p>



<p>“Wait a sec!!”</p>



<p>Nazuna’s voice, doubling as the magic mirror, immediately retorted, prompting laughter from our classmates.</p>



<p>I chuckled too when I first read this part in the script. Their personalities were seamlessly woven in, creating a sense of familiarity for the audience.</p>



<p>Nanase offered a deliberately happy smile. “And so, as the world’s most beautiful being, I lived happily ever after with the world’s most fantastic prince. The end.”</p>



<p>“Don’t just end it like that!”</p>



<p>Perhaps due to their newfound friendship, their timing was impeccable. Nanase’s performance, as well as Nazuna’s interjections, complemented each other perfectly.</p>



<p>“Is there any point in confirming the obvious answer every time?”</p>



<p>“It gives purpose to my existence!”</p>



<p>Adjusting her posture, Nanase crossed her arms, casting a disgruntled look at the mirror. “Yeah, yeah. So, who’s the fairest of them all?”</p>



<p>“Hey, wait. Aren’t you treating me a bit casually? I’m the magic mirror, you know.”</p>



<p>“Hurry up.”</p>



<p>“Ahem,” Nazuna intentionally cleared her throat before replying. “Oh, Dark Cloud Princess, if we pretend not to notice your unattractive and arrogant personality, you are indeed beautiful.”</p>



<p>“…Should I bury you in the mountains?”</p>



<p>“Wait! We’re just getting started!”</p>



<p>Including myself, our classmates were caught in a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Yua seemed to be on the verge of losing it, she was pounding the floor and struggling to breathe.</p>



<p>After regaining composure, Nazuna continued. “Unfortunately, the fairest of them all is Snow White. Both in appearance and inner purity, the difference is like heaven and earth, the moon and a turtle, or a Hermès bag and an enamel bag. I mean, she’s Snow White, and you, well, you’re Dark Cloud. Even the names make it pretty clear who wins.”</p>



<p>“I might as well smash this thing right now.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, got carried away. Looks-wise, you might be on par!”</p>



<p>“Oh really?”</p>



<p>“And besides, she’s not exactly rolling in wealth, so your clothes are way prettier.”</p>



<p>“Clothes, huh? All right, enough of this.” Nanase declared, turning her gaze toward the audience. “Summon Tall.”</p>



<p>This “Tall” was one of the six dwarves, referring to Kaito. Needless to say, the name was derived from his towering height.</p>



<p>Similarly, Yua was “Elegant,” Haru was “Little One,” Kazuki was “Snazzy,” Kenta was “Glasses,” and when playing the dwarf role, Nazuna was “Gal.”</p>



<p>By the way, in our play, the six dwarves served the Dark Cloud Princess.</p>



<p>Nazuna laughed knowingly. “There we go—sending assassins to disturb Snow White. Classic villain move! You’re truly wicked!”</p>



<p>“Are you in your right mind?”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s the flow, right?”</p>



<p>“If I do that, I won’t be able to prove I’m the more beautiful one.”</p>



<p>“Then what’s your plan?”</p>



<p>“Of course, I’ll invite Snow White to this castle.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>



<p>“We have a ball coming up.”</p>



<p>“Ah, the one where your first love, The Prince, is supposed to come?”</p>



<p>“How do you know that?”</p>



<p>“I’m the magic mirror.”</p>



<p>“Stop being unnecessarily competent only at times like these.”</p>



<p>“But, wouldn’t it be better not to invite Snow White? If I were the prince, I’d choose her in a heartbeat for a happy ending.”</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>“Got it! You’d embarrass her in front of the prince!”</p>



<p>“Listen…”</p>



<p>With an exasperated mutter, Nanase tapped the stage with the sole of her shoe. Contrary to her graceful posture, her eyes narrowed coldly.</p>



<p>Instantly, the air tightened with a palpable tension, as if disturbing the exquisite princess on the stage with even the slightest sound could shatter her mood. Each person unintentionally tensed their body, silently awaiting the next lines.</p>



<p>In the poignant silence, Nanase added a touch of allure to her gaze. She subtly made eye contact with each person, seemingly whispering secrets with her eyes while surveying the classroom.</p>



<p>Finally, after facing the patiently waiting audience, she nodded approvingly, almost like praising obedient children.</p>



<p>With a soft exhale, akin to a midnight breeze, Nanase spoke up;</p>



<p>“I’ll dress Snow White in the most exquisite gown, apply flawless makeup, and teach her all the necessary social etiquette.”</p>



<p>Crossing her arms in a manner that accentuated her chest and waist, she continued;</p>



<p>“Then, at the ball, I’ll boldly approach The Prince.” Her right hand rested on her cheek, her pinky finger lightly grazing her lips. “I’ll ask him, ‘<em>Who, in this world, is the fairest of them all?</em>‘”</p>



<p>Lowering her eyelids seductively, she created an enchanting atmosphere. The classroom fell into a brief, hushed silence.</p>



<p>I, too, found myself captivated. Her performance was like that of the most beautiful princess in the world, bewitching like an enchanting witch, and, at times, it felt like a single, toxic flower that could enthrall any observer.</p>



<p>Someone made a cough sound. Even that seemed to disturb the ambient air, causing everyone to gulp nervously. The worn-out podium at the front of the old classroom now seemed like a distant stage illuminated by a spotlight. The mirror, whose panels had been raised without notice, reflected the after-school sky.</p>



<p>As Nanase gracefully took a step back, tilting her body slightly, her beautiful figure was mirrored without a single flaw.</p>



<p>In an instant, myself included, was ensnared by the bewitching glance through the mirror, forgetting how to breathe. My heart tingled sweetly, a sensation both numbing and subtly painful.</p>



<p>“Wow.”</p>



<p>Just as the air, adrift in some detached timeline, was being exchanged…</p>



<p>“I never thought you’d say it with such a smug face. It’s too much! So cringe!”</p>



<p>It was Nazuna’s transparent voice that cut through.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t call it cringe,” Nanase shot back, and like that, the spell was broken, and everyone burst into laughter.</p>



<p>Miraculously, Nazuna’s panel had once again been placed over the mirror.</p>



<p>“You act all high and mighty, but I bet you’re the type to be super possessive when you start dating! Seriously, it’s unbearable!”</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s better to bind the useless mirror with rough rope first.”</p>



<p>“Oh well,” The magical mirror laughed. “Regardless, I’ll be here to witness how this story concludes.”</p>



<p>“No guarantee you’ll still be displayed here until that day, though.”</p>



<p>The prologue of the script concluded here. Nazuna popped out from behind the mirror and casually exchanged a high-five with Nanase.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>



<p>Together, they bowed towards us.</p>



<p>Applause erupted in waves—<em>clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap</em>.</p>



<p>Yuuko was the first to start, and soon the applause spread like wildfire through the classroom, engulfing everyone like they had just finished watching a blockbuster Hollywood movie. Each face expressed genuine surprise and excitement.</p>



<p>“Wait, is this already a guaranteed win for Class 2-5?”</p>



<p>“I get that, but there’s no winner at the cultural festival, right?”</p>



<p>“But didn’t we usually do some kind of voting? I’m dumping all my tickets in.”</p>



<p>“Was Snow White always this interesting?”</p>



<p>“Nazuna-chan’s mirror gimmick is too strong; I’m a fan.”</p>



<p>“Seriously, I might die from Nanase-san’s overdose.”</p>



<p>“And she’s going to wear a dress for the actual performance?!”</p>



<p>“If Hiiragi-san shows up too, what’s going to happen?”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement. The script Nazuna and the others created was undoubtedly entertaining, but Nanase’s presence on stage was something else. I assumed she could skillfully perform given her usual behavior. However, what I witnessed far exceeded the standards I had imagined.</p>



<p>While I had never properly watched a play, from the resonance of her voice, the intonation, and even the subtleties of her gaze and gestures, everything seemed meticulously calculated to capture the audience’s attention. I wouldn’t be surprised if she had seriously studied this.</p>



<p>I once described Nanase as an actress type, and looking back about half a year, it turned out I wasn’t wrong. Back then, we would casually engage in playful acts over the phone.</p>



<p>As I scanned the room, the class was still in high spirits.</p>



<p>“Is it okay for The Prince to be Chitose-kun?”</p>



<p>“It’s not ideal, but can you do better?”</p>



<p>“No way, impossible, impossible. I’d freeze the moment our eyes meet.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t Chitose-kun too laid-back for that role? Won’t he be overshadowed by her acting?”</p>



<p>“Well, his indecisiveness might actually work in his favor.”</p>



<p>“If he just stay quiet, he’ll look like The Prince.”</p>



<p>“I can hear everything, you know.”</p>



<p>For now, I laughed off the comments but truly considered it. Since it was a performance at a school festival, I thought that a bit of amateurishness would add charm, but if Nanase was giving her all, I had to step up my game in practice; otherwise, I’d be left behind.</p>



<p>Well, compared to the two princesses who were the faces of the story, my role was minor. I couldn’t afford to be a hindrance.</p>



<p>Today’s script only went up to the prologue. However, later on, as commanded by the Dark Cloud Princess, the dwarves would be singing ‘Heigh ho<sup data-fn="c971d74d-e4d8-4a64-8b41-3c661784b6f4" class="fn"><a href="#c971d74d-e4d8-4a64-8b41-3c661784b6f4" id="c971d74d-e4d8-4a64-8b41-3c661784b6f4-link">1</a></sup>‘ while going to welcome Snow White.</p>



<p>The sequence after inviting her to the castle was just as Nanase’s lines indicated earlier. Surprisingly, the Prince’s appearance wouldn’t happen until quite late in the story.</p>



<p>I tried watching both the Japanese-translated “Snow White” and the animated movie in an attempt to contribute a bit to Nazuna and the others’ script. However, to put it bluntly, these references were somewhat vague and the characters seemed like mere extras. For this occasion, my role had been somewhat elevated through the script’s adjustments.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the true stars of this story were Snow White and the Queen, or in our play, the Dark Cloud Princess. It felt somewhat reassuring yet lonely, leaving me with mixed feelings.</p>



<p>While I was pondering, Nanase, who was chatting with Nazuna and Yuuko on the podium, looked at me like she just remembered, then hurried towards me. The bewitching atmosphere from earlier dissipated, replaced by a mature smile that somehow exuded purity.</p>



<p>Standing in front of me, she clasped her hands in front of her body, tilting her head ever so slightly.</p>



<p>“Chitose, were you watching?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I was.” I replied.</p>



<p>She lowered her eyelids softly and continued, “Thank you, Chitose.”</p>



<p>“For what?”</p>



<p>“For watching closely.”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t take my eyes off.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, really.”</p>



<p>The rhythm of our conversation, somewhat uncharacteristic for Nanase and me, tickled me slightly.</p>



<p>Normally, we’d exchange extravagant and theatrical banter, but maybe because it was right after coming down from the stage, she seemed to have let go of some tension. Just moments ago, she captivated the audience with a stunning allure, and now, standing in front of the girl who did that, I felt a bit awkward,</p>



<p>Nanase, fixing a strand of hair that clung to her cheek, gazing at me with a natural upward glance.</p>



<p>“How was it?”</p>



<p>“It was amazing.”</p>



<p>“Did I make a good princess?”</p>



<p>“A Nanase-like princess.”</p>



<p>“Just that?”</p>



<p>“It was interesting in many ways.”</p>



<p>“Chi…to…se?”</p>



<p>“Sorry.”</p>



<p>“What else?”</p>



<p>“You looked cute.”</p>



<p>“And after that?”</p>



<p>“Exquisitely beautiful.”</p>



<p><em>Indeed, not typical of me. </em>When I was about to throw in my usual quip…</p>



<p>“Mm.”</p>



<p>Nanase pressed her index finger to my lips, as if sensing my intention. After the soft, tender sensation, a subtle fragrance of hand cream tickled my nostrils.</p>



<p>When I tried to open my mouth, the pressure in her fingers became stronger, almost like saying that it wasn’t the time.</p>



<p>Nanase leaned in a bit, bringing her face closer and looking directly into my eyes as if peering deep, and then, reflecting me in her eyes like a rippling water surface…</p>



<p>“Keep looking at me just like that.”</p>



<p>She smiled like a bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8</strong></p>


<p>Once the lively commotion settled, everyone in Class 2-5, who seemed to have motivated, returned to their own tasks in preparation for the actual event.</p>



<p>From the looks of it, the construction of both major and minor props had progressed significantly, as snippets of the fairytale world peeked from various corners of the classroom. The sight of Kura-T in sky blue colors darting around was somewhat comical and surreal, inadvertently hinting at the approaching school festival.</p>



<p>Haru, Kazuki, Kaito, and Kenta, under the guidance of Nazuna and the literature club members responsible for the script, had delved into the practice of their roles. Meanwhile, Yuuko, Nanase, and I were on our way to the dressing room for a fitting session, which had already been completed early.</p>



<p>Notably, Yua joined us instead of the girls who actually create the costumes. As there might be a need to assist with changing into dresses or taking measurements by touching the body, Yua, who had occasionally lent a hand with the work, would be a more comfortable companion for Yuuko and Nanase.</p>



<p>We stepped into the costume room after a long time. It was a large space like other special classrooms, featuring neatly arranged tables for group work. In a corner, a seemingly age-worn mannequin stood forlornly, and several well-used sewing machines lined the wall.</p>



<p>The distinctive scent of the special classrooms, shared by places like the music room, art room, biology lab, and the cooking room, filled the air. It wasn’t objectively a pleasant smell—likely a mixture of long-embedded paint, chemicals, and remnants of dishes prepared during practical lessons. But I strangely didn’t dislike it.</p>



<p>For instance, when I someday looked back on my high school days as an adult, even if the details of classes had completely faded away, the air of these special classrooms would instantly evoke nostalgia in me.</p>



<p>While I was lost in such thoughts, Yua, who was quietly making preparations, spoke up. “Alright, let’s get started. First, Saku-kun’s costume.”</p>



<p>“Sure thing.” I answered lightly.</p>



<p>Yua handed me a large paper bag. “You should be able to put it on by yourself, probably…”</p>



<p>Now that she mentioned it, I hadn’t been informed about what the costume would be. While the image of a prince naturally led to thoughts of a cape and a crown, I checked the contents.</p>



<p>“…Huh, seriously?”</p>



<p>When I involuntarily uttered my surprise, Yua tilted her head curiously.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I didn’t consult you about it. Did you dislike it, by any chance?”</p>



<p>“I don’t dislike it, but…”</p>



<p>“Saku-kun, with your style, I think it’ll suit you.”</p>



<p>“Not exactly…”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, don’t worry.”</p>



<p><em>Well, whatever</em>, I shrugged my shoulders. “Since everyone prepared it for me, I’ll try it on for now.”</p>



<p>“Yes!” Yua, whose face lit up, swiftly took out a piece of black fabric. “I’ll use this to cover the window on the door, so wait a moment.”</p>



<p>“Looks like you’re well-prepared.”</p>



<p>The dressing room, being on the first floor, naturally had its fair share of foot traffic. Even though we closed the curtains, it still made me wonder if there was enough privacy for Yuuko and Nanase to change comfortably.</p>



<p>Once the four of us worked together to finish the preparation, Yua spoke up, “We’re going to step outside for a bit. Let us know when you’re done changing, okay?”</p>



<p>“I’ll finish quickly, so you don’t need to go that far.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“It’s too late to worry about it now unless you mind.”</p>



<p>While saying this, I quickly took off my blazer and began unbuttoning my shirt, leaving me in just a tank top. As I put my hand on my belt, I turned around on a whim.</p>



<p>Yua appeared accustomed to this, Yuuko seemed slightly embarrassed, and Nanase observed me carefully—each of them staring intently at me in a row.</p>



<p>“Uh, sorry, but could you step outside for a bit?”</p>



<p>After I finished changing, I poked my head out of the dressing room door. “Done.”</p>



<p>Yua, Yuuko, and Nanase entered one by one, each of them freezing momentarily. After a while, Yua gently lowered the corners of her eyes.</p>



<p>“Just as I thought, it suits you really well.”</p>



<p>Yuuko followed with a soft smile, “Saku, you look like a real prince.”</p>



<p>Nanase, seemingly without any hidden implications, tilted her head. “Yeah, it’s wonderful, Chitose.”</p>



<p>Their genuine compliments made me feel awkward, and I scratched my head. “It kinda feels like I’m a host or something, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>The costume prepared for The Prince was, to put it simply, a white tuxedo. Since I usually wore casual and comfortable clothes, this formal outfit felt a bit off. Even though it wasn’t much different from a blazer, being entirely in white felt somewhat itchy.</p>



<p>Yua chuckled. “The costume team insisted. They thought it’d be better not to make the prince and princess look too cosplay-like.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Is the size okay?”</p>



<p>In response to her words, I lightly moved my arms and legs. “Yeah, seems fine.”</p>



<p>Yua nodded contentedly. “Alright, Saku-kun, could you wait outside for a bit this time?”</p>



<p>“Got it. Should I keep the costume on?”</p>



<p>“Yes, please. I want to check the balance when you’re all together. Changing into Yuuko-chan’s and Yuzuki-chan’s costumes might take a bit longer, though.”</p>



<p>“Understood. I’ll kill time somewhere around here.”<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>I grabbed a bottle of mineral water from the nearby vending machine and headed to the courtyard. I was initially in the mood for coffee, but I figured that could turn disastrous if I accidentally spilled it on the costume.</p>



<p>Sitting on a nearby bench, I quenched my thirst, finally feeling at ease. The square pool, surrounded by the school building and covered walkways, was bathed in the pleasant autumn sun, adorned with clouds resembling sardines swimming. I lightly tugged my shirt’s collar, allowing the cool breeze to sneak in.</p>



<p>I thought I’d stand out in this outfit, but everywhere I looked, various students in vibrant Kura-Ts ran around, members from tea ceremony and koto clubs in yukatas crisscrossed paths, and the juggling club practiced in colorful stage costumes. The whole school buzzed with a festive atmosphere.</p>



<p><em>Still</em>, as I stretched my legs, a faint sense of loneliness crept in with the approaching festival. It wouldn’t be long before this place returned to its usual deserted courtyard.</p>



<p>Glancing at my feet, I involuntary chuckled. Me wearing a tuxedo with indoor shoes—this had to be once-in-a-lifetime experience in the cultural festival.</p>



<p>There were moments we could never relive, like practicing the cheer squad dance, memorizing lines for the play, playing the role of a prince, and perhaps…</p>



<p>Waiting nervously for fellow classmates to change into their customes—moments like these.</p>



<p>Lost in thought, I heard a familiar voice. “Senpai!?”</p>



<p>“Kureha.” I turned to see her running towards me.</p>



<p>“What’s up? Are you finally quitting school to become a host, Senpai?”</p>



<p>“Thanks for that much-awaited jab. Finally, someone who understands.”</p>



<p>I tapped the bench next to me. Kureha took a seat, leaving just the right amount of space. “Kidding. Is that your cultural festival costume, by any chance?”</p>



<p>“Ah, so you knew.”</p>



<p>“Yes! Yuuko-san said you’re doing Snow White.”</p>



<p>I nodded. “I’m waiting for Yuuko and Nanase to finish their fittings.”</p>



<p>“But,” Kureha stared at me intently. “You seem like a pretty frivolous prince.”</p>



<p>“Leave me be.”</p>



<p>“You’re adapting the original, right? What’s the title?”</p>



<p>“Snow White, Dark Cloud Princess, and the Indecisive Prince.”</p>



<p>After I said that, she burst into laughter beside me. While holding her stomach in pain, she spoke, “That means Dark Cloud Princess is Yuzuki-san, and the Indecisive Prince is you, Senpai?”</p>



<p>“By the way, the characters match our personalities.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I’d like to see that.”</p>



<p>I didn’t expect that reaction, so I stole a glance at her profile.</p>



<p>Kureha leaned against the bench, seemingly carefree, but her eyes gazing into the distant sky betrayed a hint of unease and loneliness. She used to be so excited during the cheer squad practice.</p>



<p>I always assumed that everyone would naturally gather in the front row to watch the play we were all part of without needing explicit invitations.</p>



<p>“What’s up? Not coming to watch?” I inquired.</p>



<p>Kureha dropped her gaze to the ground. Her expression hidden by her hair. “Of course, I’d love to come if I can.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like a line from someone who won’t actually show up.”</p>



<p>Her tone still carried that uncertainty and a touch of loneliness, making her seem more fragile than usual. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, “Worried your class act will overlap?”</p>



<p>Finally, Kureha looked up with a bright expression. “No, my class’s act is before you, Senpai!”</p>



<p>The fleeting vulnerability seemed to vanish, and she returned to her usual lively manner. Maybe it was just my imagination, or perhaps the girl in front of me, too, was grappling with a tinge of sentimentality as the festival approached.</p>



<p>I relaxed my shoulders and opened my mouth. “So, a stage performance?”</p>



<p>“More like a participatory stage event, I guess?”</p>



<p>“Interesting. What’s it about?”</p>



<p>“It’s something like an old TV show segment that used to be popular. The details are a surprise until the day. Senpai, you must come!”</p>



<p>“Is that an order?”</p>



<p>“The audience will be so pumped if Senpai joins the stage!”</p>



<p>“I’ll be getting back on stage right after that.”</p>



<p>“Just use it as an opportunity to promote the play. People will probably stay in the gymnasium afterward.”</p>



<p>Well, there was no reason to refuse. I had already planned to support Kureha, Asu-nee, and the rest of cheer squad’s members in their performances</p>



<p>I sighed softly, shrugging my shoulders. “Alright, I’ll let everyone know.”</p>



<p>“Yes! I hope everyone can come together if possible!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah, got it,” I replied casually.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kureha fixed me with a serious gaze. “Senpai, it’s a promise, okay?”</p>



<p>“Don’t make it sound so grand.”</p>



<p>“I really want you to promise.”</p>



<p>“Fine. I promise. I’ll definitely come watch.”</p>



<p>“Yes! Thank you so much!”</p>



<p>“Almost forgot.” I handed her a note that I had stuffed into my pocket along with some changes when I had just left the dressing room.</p>



<p>Kureha looked puzzled as she accepted it. “Senpai, when did you start liking me?”</p>



<p>“It’s definitely not a love letter.”</p>



<p>She smiled and unfolded the paper that had been neatly folded into quarters. “Eh, is this…?” Her eyes widened in surprise.</p>



<p>The note contained details like my shoulder width, height, and waist – essentially, measurements needed for making clothes.</p>



<p>“Yua measured me for the drama costumes.”</p>



<p>Aside from the play, each of us was responsible for making our own costumes for the cheering squad as well. Originally, I intended to ask Yua, but during last month’s training camp, Kureha volunteered to make me one. Anticipating that Kureha might require the details soon, Yua thoughtfully jotted it down.</p>



<p>Well, I didn’t expect to run into her again so soon. I simply grabbed some change, and the note ended up coming along inadvertently.</p>



<p>Realizing there was no response, I looked to the side.</p>



<p>“Again, I’m a bit late…” Kureha, softly gripping the note with both hands, muttered as if talking to herself.</p>



<p>“Kureha…?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s nothing.” Kureha neatly folded the memo paper and put it in her pocket with a playful grin. “I was planning to measure you thoroughly when I visited your place.”</p>



<p>“Please spare me.”</p>



<p>When I sighed exaggeratedly, Kureha chuckled and said, “Just kidding. I’ll do my best making your costume, Senpai!”</p>



<p>“Sorry for the trouble. I appreciate your help.”</p>



<p>Right at that moment, Yua peered in from the dressing room. “Saku-kun, and Kureha-chan…?”</p>



<p>It seemed Yua was done helping Yuuko and Nanase change. I stood up from the bench and suggested, “Why don’t you join us and see their costumes?”</p>



<p>Kureha hesitated for a moment, then slowly shook her head. “No, I’ll save the surprise for the actual performance.”</p>



<p>“Fair enough.”</p>



<p>Her statement sounded a bit inconsistent with the previous one. However, there was no need for me to delve deeper into explanations or excuses at this point.</p>



<p>To Kureha, who was waving at Yua with an innocent smile, I opened my mouth once again;</p>



<p>“If you can make it, come, <em>Kouhai</em>.”</p>



<p>“I’ll try, Senpai.”</p>



<p>The two of us exchanged glances, then shared a spontaneous laugh at just the right distance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9</strong></p>


<p>After parting ways with Kureha, I stood before the dressing room. Yua, standing beside me, smiled playfully.</p>



<p>“Saku-kun, you’re in for a surprise. Both of them look incredibly beautiful.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m mentally prepared.”</p>



<p>“At Yuuko-chan’s suggestion, we decided to show each dress one by one.”</p>



<p>“Oh?”</p>



<p>“First up is Yuuko-chan’s dress.”</p>



<p>“Sure, but hasn’t Nanase changed yet?”</p>



<p>“No, Yuzuki-chan is waiting behind the curtain, so try not to look too hard.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Alright, shall I open it, then?”</p>



<p>I nodded. Yua gently opened the door, making sure not to obstruct the view.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>Standing there in a pure white dress was Yuuko with a faint, bashful smile. “What do you think, Saku?”</p>



<p>Without a witty reply at my disposal, I uttered, “Like the first snow.”</p>



<p>The upper part of the dress, dominated by lace, featured a high-necked, slightly transparent long-sleeved design with a ribbon. Despite its simplicity, it complemented Yuuko’s current aura—something mystical and modest, reminiscent of Snow White. The skirt, spreading like ripples, resembled the powdery snow by the lakeside, stirred by a gentle breeze.</p>



<p>Everything must had been prepared specifically for this day. Earrings shaped like snowflakes dangled delicately from her ears.</p>



<p>Yua chuckled softly. “Saku-kun, could you stand next to her?”</p>



<p>Startled by her words, I nodded slightly. Making sure not to step on the skirt and leave footprints, I carefully positioned myself next to Yuuko. Then Yua brought over a full-length mirror on wheels.</p>



<p>As our reflections appeared in the mirror, we looked like…</p>



<p>Yuuko, with a faint blush on her cheeks, opened her mouth casually. “It’s kind of like a wedding, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>Having the situation, which I had deliberately ignored, plainly stated left me momentarily flustered. I knew Yuuko meant nothing by it. Anyone in this situation would have such thoughts.</p>



<p>Yet, for some reason, I couldn’t smoothly brush it off as I would have before. Just this once, I couldn’t muster a convincing smile.</p>



<p>As expected, Yuuko turned to me with a worried expression. “Uh, sorry. I didn’t mean it in a weird way, Saku.”</p>



<p>“I know,” I reassured her and forced a faint smile. “The bride looks great.”</p>



<p>Instead of an apology, I offered a lame joke instead. She would probably see right through this façade, but…</p>



<p>“Then, Saku, could you give an opinion as the groom, and not from a shopkeeper’s perspective?”</p>



<p>Through the mirror, Yuuko chuckled and adeptly received my awkward attempt.</p>



<p>Finally, putting a lid on sentimentality, I spoke sincerely, “It really suits you, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, Saku, you too.”</p>



<p>“Like a princess.”</p>



<p>“Like a prince.”</p>



<p>“The actual performance is going to take a while.”</p>



<p>“You’ll stay with me, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, until then.”</p>



<p>“Let’s leave it here for today.”</p>



<p>“Seriously,” Yua, who had been observing our exchange, appeared somewhat exasperated, “Both Yuuko-chan and you are keeping Yuzuki-chan waiting.”</p>



<p>At that remark, Yuuko and I exchanged glances and chuckled.</p>



<p>“Hey, Saku, Yuzuki looks stunning too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>



<p>Yuuko smiled softly at those words and called out towards the window. “Yuzuki, sorry for the wait.”</p>



<p>With that cue, the curtain opened, revealing a silhouette bathed in the soft, wet-feather shade. It approached with a rhythmic tap on the floor, as if the night itself was drawing near. Swaying gently in tandem with her shadow, the night seemed to shimmer.</p>



<p>And there stood Nanase before me, twirling gracefully before asking, “How do I look, Chitose?”</p>



<p>Her lips, a shade redder than usual, moved alluringly.</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>Though I had managed to calm my heart after the upheaval caused by Yuuko, I was now struck again, feeling defenseless.</p>



<p>Mustering what little composure I had left, I muttered, “You’re like the night itself.”</p>



<p>Unintentionally, I found myself speaking honestly once more.</p>



<p>Nanase’s dress, made entirely of deep black fabric, was a stark contrast to Yuuko’s, exposing more of her shoulders. Although it might not be accurate to call the dress off-shoulder, as it exposed about half of her back and deepened into a low-cut design, displaying a tantalizing cleavage.</p>



<p>The minimalistic design, devoid of any elaborate adornments, seemed to emphasize that Nanase’s beautiful body itself was the true work of art.</p>



<p>“Hey, take a good look.”</p>



<p>At her words, I redirected my gaze that had inadvertently averted, only to be met with an allure atmosphere that seemed to swirl around Nanase, making it hard to breathe.</p>



<p>Yua repeated her previous words, “Saku-kun, can you stand next to Yuzuki-chan?”</p>



<p>Nanase’s skirt was slightly shorter than Yuuko’s, hovering just above the ground. With no worry about stepping on the hem, we naturally closed the distance between us. Standing side by side again in front of the mirror…</p>



<p>“It really does look like a wedding.”</p>



<p>Nanase subtly adjusted my hair with her fingers and intertwined her arm with mine. I reflexively stiffened. “Hey, Nanase.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t escorting a groom’s specialty?”</p>



<p>Feeling resigned, I clenched my fist lightly and bent my elbow. Through the mirror, Nanase softened her eyes, quite unlike her bewitching charm earlier. Her cheeks were lightly flushed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0305_01jpg.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“I’m happy.” Nanase murmured those words, applying a bit more strength to her grip.</p>



<p>“Does it suit me?”</p>



<p>“I think it suits you.”</p>



<p>“At the very least.”</p>



<p>“If it’s just about appearance.”</p>



<p>“What about a proper comment?”</p>



<p>“You already know.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“We’re similar.”</p>



<p>“Like a reflection in the mirror.”</p>



<p><em>Oh, right.</em> I suddenly realized.</p>



<p>White and Black. Moon and Lake.</p>



<p>This tranquil feeling, this relationship requiring so few words, mirrored the passage of time between Yuuko and me that had extended beyond that August. Seemingly distant yet close at hand.</p>



<p>The reverse of white appeared black. As the moon and the lake seemed to reflect someone. </p>



<p>I could indeed converse like this with Nanase. Yet, simultaneously, I pondered.</p>



<p>Had Nanase changed, or had I changed? Was Nanase trying to change, or was I attempting to? Had Nanase already changed, or had I? Or…</p>



<p>──Was I the only one still unable to change?</p>



<p>In a corner of the shifting autumn hues, I felt as if I were alone, crouching amidst stagnation, abandoned and left behind.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>After finishing our costume fitting, we rejoined the class for drama practice.</p>



<p>Whether inspired by Nanase and Nazuna’s performance or perhaps because the cheering squad had long been in full swing, everyone was now earnestly focused. As we practiced on the stage, other classmates occasionally glanced our way while progressing with their individual tasks. This atmosphere wasn’t bad, I thought.</p>



<p>We persevered until the last possible minute before the evening dismissal, concluding our practice and preparations. Unfinished props and tools were stored away, desks were returned to their designated spots, and the date on the corner of the blackboard was updated for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Although it wasn’t because I was the class representative, for some reason, I found myself watching over everything until the very last person left.</p>



<p>The announcement urging students to leave echoed gently through the speakers. Outside the window, a calm silence, like someone hastily drew a curtain, filled the surroundings. Instead of the familiar school grounds, two classrooms reflected side by side, and I, standing still, observed from the side.</p>



<p>When the lights dimmed, the contours of the night became prominent. During this hour, the school seemed ambiguous. My mind began to wander as I strolled through the hallway.</p>



<p>Despite usually symbolizing the daytime world, the school, once the lights were dimmed, began to doze off and blurred the boundaries.</p>



<p>The locked special classrooms, the deserted corridors, the soundless gymnasium. Though ghost stories about the school at night were common, the sensation of letting your guard down, momentarily stepping out of the familiar routine, was undeniably palpable.</p>



<p>As I left the entrance while pondering about this…</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>Nanase, leaning against the school gate, waved casually.</p>



<p>“Good evening. Are you going home?”</p>



<p>“Good evening. Shall we head home?”</p>



<p>We hadn’t specifically arranged to meet. No promises made, no expectations. It seemed fitting to attribute it all to the night.</p>



<p>Day and night. Joy and sorrow. Stage and audience. Imitation and authenticity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it was alright to let things blur and fall asleep in ambiguity.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10</strong></p>


<p>We walked in silence for a while. It was when we reached the banks of the Asuwa River that Nanase suddenly spoke up;</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose.”</p>



<p>“What’s up, Nanase?”</p>



<p>“How was I today?”</p>



<p>“Which version of you are we talking about?”</p>



<p>“Let’s say, the bride version of me.”</p>



<p>“Or perhaps the witch version of Nanase?”</p>



<p>“Do you dislike the dark version of me?”</p>



<p>“I dislike questions without options.”</p>



<p>As I responded, her hand was extended towards me.</p>



<p>“I told you, it’s gonna become a habit.”</p>



<p>“Don’t let me say it; I want this to become a habit.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, a vague smile emerged from both of us.</p>



<p>“Because you are the night.”</p>



<p>“Because it’s <em>your</em> night.”</p>



<p>I gently rejected Nanase’s hand.</p>



<p>“Let’s stop here for tonight.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s call it a night.”</p>



<p>With those words lingering ambiguously, we wandered aimlessly into the night.</p>



<p>Like folding sentiments into small pieces and hiding them among stardust, we blinked slowly. Occasionally, we gazed at the sky as if searching for a constellation without a name.</p>



<p>“Saku.”</p>



<p>“Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>A fleeting lie that had become familiar on our lips.</p>



<p>“Chitose.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>A past that might one day become untouchable.</p>



<p>Beside a girl who seemed like a reflected mirror, two similar entities nestled together.</p>



<p>──What kind of ending could lie ahead for us?<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>One afternoon the following week, I decided to unlock the door to the rooftop which I hadn’t visited in quite a while.</p>



<p>Despite being a regular after quitting the club activities, lately, I’d been occupied with cheering squad and class play, leaving me quite out of touch. With neither activity scheduled today, I was thinking to read ‘Blue or the Other Blue’ by Yamamoto Fumio while enjoying the autumn vibes or just lay back and listen to music.</p>



<p><em>Besides</em>, my lips curled up into a smile unconsciously. It was about time I dedicate some moments to confront my own feelings.</p>



<p>When I opened the door, a strangely nostalgic scent greeted me. Stepping onto the rooftop, I looked up to find wisps of smoke lazily drifting around the water tank, emanating an oddly pleasant feeling.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, wasn’t the last time I caught the scent of Lucky Strike back during the summer camp? They said scent was closely tied to memories, but I’d rather not recall Kurasen when I was sitting in some pub a decade later. </p>



<p>Or maybe, by then, would I simply embrace the nostalgia? Picturing that scenario, that might be a sentimental scene in its own right.</p>



<p>As I was lost in such thoughts, I climbed the ladder as usual.</p>



<p>“Hey there, average high school guy.” Kurasen sprawled out with a cigarette between his fingers, casually raised his hand.</p>



<p>“What’s up with that?” I chuckled and took a seat beside him. “How obsessed are you with that Kura-T anyway?”</p>



<p>In response, Kurasen pinched the collar of the Kura-T he wore and smirked. “I’ve finally started to appreciate style.”</p>



<p>“Why not just say you like it?”</p>



<p>When I said that, Kurasen squinted his eyes as if reminiscing a distant day, and exhaled a puff of smoke. “The t-shirt has the youthful vibe. I like it.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>Surprised by the unexpected line, I forgot to answer with the usual sarcasm or joke. Kurasen, with a self-deprecating smile, spoke again;</p>



<p>“Wearing this once a year is one of the few moments that makes me feel being a teacher isn’t so bad, after all.”</p>



<p>“Reminds you of your youth, huh?”</p>



<p>“You’ll get it once you hit your thirties.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?” I let out a short breath. “What was that earlier, by the way?”</p>



<p>To that question, Kurasen responded with a mischievous grin. “What are you talking about?”</p>



<p><em>He sure loves playing dumb</em>, I shrugged. “That ‘average high school guy’ thing.”</p>



<p>Kurasen never casually use such words. If he said it, there was undoubtedly some underlying meaning. Judging by his expression, it seemed my assumption was spot on.</p>



<p>Kurasen exhaled smoke rings resembling donuts. “Seems like you’ve been surprisingly well-behaved lately.”</p>



<p>“Because the school festival is approaching. I gotta behave like a decent youth.”</p>



<p>At my reply, he spoke in a somewhat dry, ironic tone. “Maybe it’s more like shedding some skin than behaving?”</p>



<p>“Whenever you say something like that, it sounds like a dirty joke.”</p>



<p>He didn’t seem inclined to respond to my banter. There was a pause, and then a notably larger smoke ring floated up. Like poking the hole in the middle with a finger, he continued;</p>



<p>“──or perhaps it’s because you’ve moved beyond that one summer.”</p>



<p>“W-What do you…”</p>



<p><em>Ah, I see.</em></p>



<p>Kurasen lowered the corners of his eyes, looking somewhat troubled.</p>



<p>“Have you stopped being hero for everyone?”</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>His words, like he could see right through everything, made my stomach tighten. It was obvious, but we hadn’t reported the details of that summer to the homeroom teacher. Yet, despite not knowing anything about our internal affairs, his words cut through the barriers of my heart effortlessly.</p>



<p>Before I could offer some defense or deflect with a joke, Kurasen spoke again.</p>



<p>“I can tell just by watching you guys.” While pressing the shortened Lucky Strike into the portable ashtray, he continued, “Seventeen-years-old summer is just like that.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, a genuine question slipped from my lips. “Kurasen, did you have a summer like that too?”</p>



<p>“Well, who knows.”</p>



<p>His response, almost identical to an affirmation, inexplicably tickled me. Even though I first met Kurasen when he was already a fully-fledged adult and a school teacher, he, too, had a time when he was seventeen.</p>



<p>Did the summer sky he witnessed at that time share the same blue as ours? Did the autumn sky he saw back then shift just like ours?</p>



<p>“…I’m probably scared.”</p>



<p>Caught in the unexpected sentiment between an adult and a child, I voiced my honest feelings.</p>



<p>“Everyone just keeps changing, leaving me behind.”</p>



<p>Yuuko, Yua, Nanase, Haru, Asu-nee ─ Girls who once walked side by side with me were now passing me by, growing more mature with each step.</p>



<p>Even if they looked back and reached out their hands, my heart kept spinning in place. No matter how hard I paddled, the frustration only intensified, and there was no sign of catching up.</p>



<p>“Good grief.” Kurasen lit his second cigarette with an exasperated sigh. “One might think you’ve grown up a bit, but deep down, you’re still a virgin in a relationship.”</p>



<p>“H-hey, now—”</p>



<p>He took a satisfying drag, then exhaled sharply.</p>



<p>“──The one who’s changed more than anyone is probably you.”</p>



<p>Casting a provocative gaze my way, Kurasen continued, “You’re no longer everyone’s hero. You’re just Chitose-kun, an average high school guy.”</p>



<p><em>Ah, right. </em>His words revealed the true nature of the discomfort lodged in my chest.</p>



<p>──Not the Hero, but a man named Chitose Saku.</p>



<p>It wasn’t that everyone changed. Well, of course, they were changing too, that’s undeniable. But fundamentally… maybe it was me who first bent myself.</p>



<p>Perhaps, I wasn’t standing still but foolishly stepping backward on the path everyone else was advancing on.</p>



<p>“I’m not denying that.”</p>



<p>Almost like anticipating my reply, Kurasen muttered, “Sometimes, that’s what we call growth.”</p>



<p><em>Growth</em>, I rolled that mismatched word on my tongue. It felt as bland as chewing gum that had lost its flavor. It was like being told that I no longer understood, and I almost spat it out.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the nostalgic exchange I had with Kurasen from a while back resurfaced.</p>



<p><em>Can I believe it’s the correct path?</em></p>



<p>Almost like talking to myself, the words came out, “I might have dropped my compass that summer.”</p>



<p>Kurasen smiled subtly. “Because of women?”</p>



<p>“Saying that nowadays will get you criticized by society.”</p>



<p>“Timing and context, kid. ‘Women’ or ‘girls’ won’t cut it in every situation.”</p>



<p>“I get what you’re trying to say, still…”</p>



<p>“There’s a sentiment born only when a man calls a woman, well, a woman.”</p>



<p>I let out a deliberate sigh. “You seem to have your own way of dealing with things, but have you ever been torn between women?”</p>



<p>Kurasen narrowed his eyes with a nostalgic expression.</p>



<p>“──Choosing a woman is akin to choosing your way of life.”</p>



<p>“Way of life,” I repeated, feeling the weight of those words, and chuckled self-deprecatingly. “Recently I got scolded for thinking I’m the only one who gets to choose.”</p>



<p>“It’s all in the nuances; women choose men too.”</p>



<p>I knew it wasn’t the best topic to discuss with a homeroom teacher. My issues were my own, and I wasn’t seeking a correct answer. However, sitting before me was a man who once was seventeen, and I wanted to hear from him.</p>



<p>“So, how do you decide on matters of the heart?”</p>



<p>“Who knows?” Kurasen said, glancing downward momentarily. “You might have to gather up memories.”</p>



<p>Saying this, he watched the cigarette shorten like an incense fire before continuing.</p>



<p>“The words spoken and received. The smiles given and received. The tears shed and wiped away. The similarities and differences. What you’ve seen and seen by others. What you’ve realized, and what’s been realized by others. The times you’ve been there for someone and had someone there for you. The times you’ve been scolded and had scolded. The times you’ve forgiven and not been forgiven. The times you’ve been forgiven and unable to forgive.”</p>



<p>The unusually verbose enumeration of words sounded like he was reminding himself of something.</p>



<p>“You gather those memories and think about them one by one.”</p>



<p>He pressed the cigarette into the portable ashtray and gazed at the sky absently.</p>



<p>“Consider who I can be when I’m with someone, huh?”</p>



<p>“No,” Kurasen concluded, “It’s about standing beside someone and deciding how you want to live.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, my eyes widened.</p>



<p>Choosing someone was choosing your way of life. Who you wanted to be with and <em>who you wanted to be</em>.</p>



<p>A sound, like a faint echo, resonated deep within my heart. It felt like I was on the brink of remembering something important or, perhaps, forgetting something precious.</p>



<p>For instance, like the moon I saw that day. Like the marble sunk in a ramune bottle.</p>



<p>Before Kurasen could continue and unravel something unknown, the rooftop door creaked open.</p>



<p>“Chitose…?”</p>



<p>Following that, Nanase’s voice, searching for me, echoed. Kurasen stuffed the cigarette and ashtray into his pocket and stood up with a nonchalant air.</p>



<p>“Our gruff extracurricular lesson between guys ends here.” </p>



<p>Glancing briefly at Nanase, he grinned. “It’s the gentleman’s code to fill the void left by losing one woman with another.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>11</strong></p>


<p><em>Mirror, mirror.</em></p>



<p><em>──If I were the wind that blew tomorrow.</em><sup data-fn="f6ac5db7-d957-402f-bb87-ea1b9670967d" class="fn"><a href="#f6ac5db7-d957-402f-bb87-ea1b9670967d" id="f6ac5db7-d957-402f-bb87-ea1b9670967d-link">1</a></sup><br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*</p>



<p><br />Descending from the ladder, I watched Kurasen as he exited the rooftop before speaking;</p>



<p>“Did you need something?”</p>



<p>“No,” Nanase smiled subtly, like cherry blossoms drifting before reaching full bloom, and shook her head. “Just thought I’d find you if I came here today.”</p>



<p>“Ah, got it.” I nodded casually, the phrase feeling strangely familiar. “What about your club activities?”</p>



<p>“Misaki-chan had to check on her class. With a match approaching, we wrapped up practice a bit early.”</p>



<p>“The tournament is close, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“How’s it going?”</p>



<p>“I think I’m doing pretty well.”</p>



<p>“If Nanase says so, it must be true.”</p>



<p>Memories of the gymnasium in May flashed in my mind. The day Nanase’s basketball shoes were stolen during the practice match, I recalled Misaki-sensei’s words.</p>



<p><em>“But sometimes, her shackles come off unexpectedly.”</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the subsequent play was impressively sharp, even sending chills down my spine as an outsider.</p>



<p>When I first saw Tōdō Mai, I sensed she was remarkable. The way she effortlessly handled the ball in running, stretching, and dribbling exuded the aura of a skilled player.</p>



<p>Honestly, I had the same impression of Nanase since our first year. So, when I witnessed that consecutive three-pointer, I oddly felt convinced.</p>



<p>If anyone could pull off something like that, it would be Nanase Yuzuki naturally. While I initially thought it was a spontaneous zone-like occurrence, if she could consistently unleash her potential like that, she might become a player comparable to Tōdō.</p>



<p>As I contemplated this, I approached the rooftop railing and placed my hands on it.</p>



<p>In the passage and parking lot between the ground and the school building, preparations were steadily progressing for the arches that would decorate the school gate during the festival.</p>



<p>I must had been engrossed in conversation with Kurasen for quite some time. The sky before us fully embraced the twilight. The distant mountain ranges softened into gentle peony hues, forming a beautiful gradient toward the beginning of the night in a color reminiscent of violet. The air itself seemed softly dyed in a dianthus<sup data-fn="7e3e5156-7556-4fb8-af9c-5b25e630ca2c" class="fn"><a href="#7e3e5156-7556-4fb8-af9c-5b25e630ca2c" id="7e3e5156-7556-4fb8-af9c-5b25e630ca2c-link">2</a></sup> color, enveloping the town.</p>



<p>Perhaps Nanase had been pondering something similar. While standing shoulder to shoulder, she muttered softly.</p>



<p>“I love the autumn twilight; it’s the most beautiful among the seasons.”</p>



<p>“I get it, maybe because the air is so clear.”</p>



<p>“Or perhaps it’s that our hearts are clear.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that’s it.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because even in my current state, the twilight reflects beautifully.”</p>



<p>“You’re saying something unusual.”</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s the lingering traces of an unusual conversation.” I shrugged self-deprecatingly.</p>



<p>It was probably the slightly flushed color of the air that was affecting me. The words Kurasen left behind still lingered at the edge of my mind.</p>



<p>Just as I was about to crack a joke to lighten the mood, I suddenly noticed Nanase leaning on the railing, resting her chin on her hand, looking at me.</p>



<p>Our eyes met, and with a mature expression, she squinted her eyes. In a voice akin to the autumn wind ready to sweep away fallen leaves, she opened her mouth;</p>



<p>“Your heart is clear.”</p>



<p>“Huh…”</p>



<p>“Because it’s clearer than anyone else’s, even the slightest sediment stands out.”</p>



<p>“Nanase…?”</p>



<p>Reflecting the evening glow in her mirror-like eyes, she continued, “People might mock irresponsibly when they see it.”</p>



<p>Her choice of words, her tone—somewhere in them, I felt an inadvertent overlap with someone else.</p>



<p>“Saying your clear heart has sediment while shelving their own murky heart,” Nanase said, tenderly smiling. “Though you might be the one who cares about that sediment more than anyone.”</p>



<p>“My heart isn’t that grand.”</p>



<p>“But I know,” While saying this, Nanase approached and softly placed her hand on my chest. “What’s sinking in there is, in reality, a ramune marble.”</p>



<p>“──”</p>



<p>As if she had touched my heart directly, my heartbeat surged.</p>



<p>Nanase turned around, leaning her back against the railing.</p>



<p>“Hey, look at this.”</p>



<p>She spoke while gazing at the ever-changing sky. Following suit, I casually joined her, our shoulders brushing playfully.</p>



<p>“It feels like we’re connected to the sky, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>In an instant, I felt enveloped in something ephemeral. The gradient painting the horizon turned into a semi-transparent curtain, gently veiling our surroundings.</p>



<p>The wind, tinged with the hues of a first love, tousled Nanase’s hair, teasing my throat with a tantalizing touch. The subtle fragrance of a sophisticated shampoo seeped in like a midnight radio show.</p>



<p>In this solitary drift beneath the sky, Nanase spoke as if gently scooping up sediment. “What were you talking about with Kurasen?”</p>



<p>I cautiously opened my mouth, making sure not to lean too much against my classmate. “It’s not a story for you to hear, Nanase.”</p>



<p>“Nana.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>“At this moment, I’m not Nanase, Yuzuki, or Nanase Yuzuki. Just Nana. How about that?”</p>



<p>Perhaps, this was an excuse Nanase had prepared—an act, like becoming a prince and princess on stage.</p>



<p>A story that couldn’t be shared with Nanase, Yuzuki, or Nanase Yuzuki, only with Nana.</p>



<p>“…Nana.”</p>



<p>Almost like calling out to someone on a riverbank, I found myself whispering the name without even realizing it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0333_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>12</strong></p>


<p>And so, I carefully cut through the details like it were someone else’s story, relaying the words that Kurasen had shared with me to Nanase in a detached manner.</p>



<p>Regardless of how convoluted the setup might be, even if the other party was the mysterious Nana revealed in the twilight, I felt the necessity to draw a line within myself.</p>



<p>As the story came to an end, Nanase murmured to herself, “Choosing a way of life, huh…”</p>



<p>Her tone carried a hint of self-deprecation, introspection, and perhaps even a touch of self-punishment.</p>



<p>Swiftly, before regrets could weigh me down, Nanase offered a fleeting smile, almost like covering the moon with one hand.</p>



<p>“I understand what Kurasen said.” Tracing the rooftop railing with her steps, she continued, “Deciding who you want to be with and how you want to live—a beautiful excuse for love, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“An excuse, you say…?” I asked, standing shoulder to shoulder with her.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I guess that was a bit crude for Nana.” Nanase tilted her head with a somewhat troubled expression. “But I’m sure Nanase Yuzuki would have empathized with me.”</p>



<p>Gradually, the dusk faded, and night drew nearer.</p>



<p>“But for me now, I feel it’s okay to have slightly more human reasons.”</p>



<p>“And that is…?”</p>



<p>When I unintentionally interjected, she halted and spoke with a voice that felt like a soft caress.</p>



<p>“──Choosing someone who can see even the side of you that you absolutely don’t want to be.”</p>



<p>It was an answer that seemed to complement Kurasen’s perspective.</p>



<p>“Anyone can’t be beautiful or a hero at all times.” Nanase hummed somberly, looking at me and lowering the corners of her eyes.</p>



<p>“For example, even in your clear heart, there are times when sediment settles. That’s why…” Her hand rested against my cheek. “At least in front of the person you’ve decided your heart for, I wish you’d be willing to expose yourself.”</p>



<p>Her fingertips delicately touched my lips.</p>



<p>“The you who is timid, the you who is indecisive, the you who can’t be Chitose Saku.”</p>



<p>“Nana…”</p>



<p>Before I could finish, Nanase covered my slightly opened mouth.</p>



<p>“──Let your body and soul drown into the night like falling asleep.”</p>



<p>And so, until the lingering shades of the gradient reluctantly succumbed to the deceptive the blue hour,<sup data-fn="e9ad9c5e-c30c-4616-b851-dbf7ae893c59" class="fn"><a href="#e9ad9c5e-c30c-4616-b851-dbf7ae893c59" id="e9ad9c5e-c30c-4616-b851-dbf7ae893c59-link">1</a></sup> we continued to gaze quietly at each other.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>It was a Friday afternoon after school, just a week before the eagerly awaited school festival. The cheerleading squad and the play were in the midst of their final preparations, reaching the climax of their rehearsals.</p>



<p>Moments ago, we had borrowed the main gymnasium stage for a full-scale rehearsal, meticulously fine-tuning every detail. With the announcement of the final dismissal time, our practice came to a satisfying conclusion.</p>



<p>In this short period, all of us, including Nanase, Yuuko, and myself, remarkably sharpened our acting skills. It was amusing how, despite initial reluctance, time had swiftly passed.</p>



<p>As we strolled down the hallway alongside the rest of Class 2-5, Yuuko eagerly expressed, “I’m really looking forward to the school festival!”</p>



<p>Haru chuckled. “I wasn’t too concerned, but it seems our class play will turn out just fine.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing this, Yua gently lowered the corners of her eyes, saying, “The cheering squad, too. Our ‘Feast’ part is finally complete, and I’m relieved.”</p>



<p>For some reason, Kenta proudly snorted, “Mizushino and the others have also mastered the choreography for the ‘Feast.’”</p>



<p>When the conversation shifted to Kazuki, he smiled in amusement. “I’m grateful, Master.”</p>



<p>Kaito, hands folded behind his head, added, “But, it’s kinda sad, isn’t it? The festival buzz will only last until next week.”</p>



<p>Nazuna lightly placed a hand near her mouth. “But things like this are special because they have an end, right?”</p>



<p>Nanase, with a distant gaze, nodded quietly. “Agreed.”</p>



<p>After a brief pause, I muttered under my breath, “Atomu-kun, don’t you want to say something?”</p>



<p>“Shut it.”</p>



<p>The exchange elicited laughter from everyone.</p>



<p>Kazuki playfully took charge, teasing Atomu, and Kaito soon joined in. Although Kenta observed from a distance, he didn’t appear entirely disinterested either.</p>



<p>How many nights until then?</p>



<p>In the midst of my thoughts, Yua approached me with an apologetic face. “Sorry, Saku-kun. I might not be able to come over and cook for you this weekend.”</p>



<p>“Understood. Is it related to brass band practice?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’ll take longer than usual because of the off-campus festival announcement.”</p>



<p>“Good luck. I’m looking forward to the stage.”</p>



<p>While exchanging these words, Nanase, who was walking nearby, chimed in, “Uchi, if you’re okay with it, can I fill in for you this week?”</p>



<p>Perhaps she had overheard our conversation. I chuckled at her words and casually retorted, “Why ask Yua?”</p>



<p>Nanase responded matter-of-factly, “That’s the point. Even if I ask you, Chitose, you’ll say it’s fine because you can whip something on the spot.”</p>



<p>“That’s true, but…”</p>



<p>“What do you think, Uchi?” Asking for opinions, Nanase sent a questioning glance.</p>



<p>Yua smiled, seemingly troubled. “Saku-kun’s cooking tends to be heavy on carbs and meat, and the fish and veggies end up neglected…”</p>



<p>“See?” Nanase shrugged.</p>



<p>“I’m not good at making a variety of dishes.”</p>



<p>As I responded in agreement, Nanase’s gaze returned to Yua. “It can also be practice for me to make side dishes and pre-prepared meals. How about it, Uchi?”</p>



<p>For a fleeting moment, a memory about Kureha crossed my mind, who had cooked in my kitchen after seeking Yua’s permission. The situation was eerily similar to that time, and Nanase, who was there with us, couldn’t possibly be unaware of it.</p>



<p>However, Yua answered nonchalantly, “Sure, I might have to count on you, Yuzuki-chan.”</p>



<p>Nanase clasped her hands and lowered her eyes with a gentle smile. “Yes, leave it to me!”</p>



<p>“Uh, is that my catchphrase?”</p>



<p>When they exchanged glances and laughed, I realized my worries were unnecessary. It seemed an unshakeable bond had formed between them. Nanase, aware of this, likely made the suggestion.</p>



<p>Yua smiled softly. “As a return, if it’s alright, I’ll prepare the bento for both Saku-kun and Yuzuki-chan at the sports festival.”</p>



<p>“Really? Thanks, I’m looking forward to it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>With that, I absentmindedly watched the girls move ahead, leaving me behind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>13</strong></p>


<p><em>Mirror, mirror.</em></p>



<p><em>──If I were a gentle sky.</em><sup data-fn="605d298f-7819-41ea-b939-d3cc6da242a6" class="fn"><a href="#605d298f-7819-41ea-b939-d3cc6da242a6" id="605d298f-7819-41ea-b939-d3cc6da242a6-link">1</a></sup><br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>As the evening descended on Saturday, having completed my room-cleaning, laundry, a daily jog, and a round of swings and training, I found myself dozing off on the sofa.</p>



<p>Just then, the doorbell chimed delicately.</p>



<p>“Come in.”</p>



<p>Shifting into a sitting position, the door creaked open, and Nanase, with a soft click, peeked her face in.</p>



<p>“Good evening, mind if I intrude?”</p>



<p>“What’s that? You’re acting like a stranger now.”</p>



<p>My bemused laughter was met with a soft, modest smile. Nanase was dressed a bit differently than usual, donning an ice-blue cardigan paired with a pleated, blue-green long skirt. It emitted a modest charm, exuding a calm and graceful aura.</p>



<p>Noticing my gaze, Nanase tilted her head in curiosity. “What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Oh, just thought your outfit is kind of unusual.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it usually a bit more boyish?”</p>



<p>“I’ve figured a change once in a while was okay. Do you dislike it?”</p>



<p>I shrugged. “Not at all. Just thought it suits you unexpectedly well.”</p>



<p>Nanase, wearing a gentle expression, lowered the corners of her eyes. “Thanks, Chitose.”</p>



<p>She gently smiled, fluttering like a dandelion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0347_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her reaction. Lately, Nanase seemed a bit off, revealing sides I hadn’t known before, each time stirring my emotions.</p>



<p>Whether it was the enchanting Nanase during our drama rehearsals, the innocent Nanase in a dress, or the mature Nanase as dusk transformed the rooftop—I hadn’t quite grasped the meaning behind it.</p>



<p>Lost in these thoughts,</p>



<p>──a soft, unexpected note of serene everyday life echoed.</p>



<p>Only then did I notice the plastic bag Nanase held in her hands. Though I intended to go together, she had taken care of the shopping. Green onions peeked out playfully, delicately balancing the more feminine impression that Nanase gave off tonight.</p>



<p>Despite finding solace in the mismatched yet oddly comforting atmosphere, I hastily spoke up, “Sorry for troubling you.”</p>



<p>“No worries, may I come in?”</p>



<p>Taking the plastic bag from Nanase, it felt weightier on my fingers than expected, causing a twinge of guilt. Placing it on the table, I said, “You should’ve just asked me to come along.”</p>



<p>Nanase, squatting down to align her shoes, turned her face toward me with a reassuring expression. “It’s alright. I just wanted to spend some relaxed time when I got here.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>The weekend vibe, reminiscent of the usual Saturdays, teased my senses. I casually lifted the left corner of my mouth to conceal it.</p>



<p>“Nanase, how was your club activity?”</p>



<p>“We had practice since morning.”</p>



<p>“Want to take a shower first?”</p>



<p>“No, I didn’t come straight from there, so I’ll do it after dinner.”</p>



<p>“Well, you did change clothes. But seriously, you’re going to shower again after coming from your home?”</p>



<p>“The earlier shower was just a quick one. I’ll have a proper bath here tonight.” Nanase pulled out something like a stylish bottle from her slightly larger-than-usual bag, raising it happily near her face. “I brought bath salts~”</p>



<p>Now that she mentioned it, didn’t we discuss this the last time she came alone? Had it been a month already? Recently, autumn had truly started to settle in, and the season where a bath seemed more appealing than a shower was approaching.</p>



<p>Accepting the bath salts from Nanase, I commented, “Well, might as well fill up the tub.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>“But aren’t bath salts usually from Bath Clean or BUBBLE? Feels like a waste to use it alone.”</p>



<p>“Really? Then let’s use it when we bathe together.”</p>



<p>I sighed quietly. </p>



<p><em>At least throw in a hint or a playful remark; otherwise, it’s hard to react when something like that is casually thrown out! It’s different from when Yua brought unusual seasonings or spice</em>s, <em>you know!</em></p>



<p>Unaware of my inner turmoil, Nanase went to the washroom to wash her hands.</p>



<p>I smiled softly, turning on the Tivoli Audio, and as my phone shuffled through the playlist, BUMP OF CHICKEN’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ6GTKFIYkw">Small world</a>” began to play.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>After a while, Nanase returned to the living room, now adorned in the same vertically striped blue apron she wore when she made katsudon for me. In contrast to the slight awkwardness she exhibited back then, her movements now appeared completely natural, as if it were a part of her daily routine.</p>



<p>Holding a hair tie in her mouth, Nanase turned her back, gathering her hair. The smooth nape of her neck caught my eye, prompting me to instinctively look away. With her slightly more modest attire today, my attention was drawn to the subtly exposed skin.</p>



<p>Once ready, Nanase efficiently began sorting the groceries she had bought. Items for the fridge, those that could be stored at room temperature, and those for immediate use. Given Nanase’s observant nature, it was clear she picked up on Yua’s habits whenever possible. Her efficiency felt like a scene from the weekends I was accustomed to witnessing.</p>



<p>After finishing the sorting, while pulling out a knife and cutting board, Nanase asked, “Chitose, just to be sure, is there anything specific you want to eat?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I’m hungry for some meat.”</p>



<p>“That’s exactly the reason why I’m here.”</p>



<p>“I just feel like having your katsudon again.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, thanks. But today, the menu is fish.”</p>



<p>“Tch.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry; Uchi gave me the recipe.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>That was a slightly unexpected revelation. But come to think of it, Yua had also asked Nanase for the katsudon recipe, and she had taught her. So it made sense that Nanase could effortlessly propose today’s arrangement even after the incident involving Kureha.</p>



<p>In that moment, a faint sense of sadness grazed my chest. Although it was such a commonplace thing, it served as a reminder that behind the Nanase and Yua I knew, there were aspects of each other that only one of them was privy to.</p>



<p>When the dynamics between someone and someone else changed, it would inevitably ripple through the intertwined relationships.</p>



<p>Suddenly, memories of a conversation exchanged at Ikuhasa Park came rushing back.</p>



<p><em>“This might be the last time.”</em></p>



<p><em>“The last…?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah, our school festival.”</em></p>



<p>Certainly, Yuuko stepped forward sooner than anyone else—no, she established clarity in our ambiguous and unstable relationship faster than anyone else.</p>



<p>She must had steeled herself for whatever the future held.</p>



<p>Choosing someone meant not choosing someone else.</p>



<p>Opting for one way of life meant forsaking another.</p>



<p>Even if Nanase had been around recently…</p>



<p>While pondering this, I might have unintentionally let my expression darken.</p>



<p>“Chitose…?” Nanase looked at me with a hint of concern.</p>



<p><em>This is not good, </em>I shook my head slightly. Shifting gears to face the girl in front of me, I asked, “By the way, what fish did you get?”</p>



<p>“Mackerel and yellowtail.”</p>



<p>“Considering the season, let’s go with mackerel tonight.”</p>

<p>“Nah, let’s keep it simple: salt-grilled with grated daikon and rice.”</p>



<p>“Come on, where’s the challenge…” Nanase chuckled in an exasperated manner. “It might take a while since there are some preparations. Chitose, why don’t you take a bath first?”</p>



<p>“Is that okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, take your time.”</p>



<p>“Then, I’ll take you up on that offer.”</p>



<p>“Use the bath salts.”</p>



<p>“Sure, let me know if there’s anything you need help with.”</p>



<p>“Thanks. Can you at least rinse the rice while the bath is filling up?”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“I bought pearled barley; can I mix it in?”</p>



<p>“Oh, I love barley rice.”</p>



<p>“I was thinking of making wakame rice, like the school lunches.”</p>



<p>“That’s the one that boost the spirits!”</p>



<p>Our natural exchange tickled me, and I quietly indulged in some self-deprecation.</p>



<p>In my everyday life with Yua, Nanase wasn’t there. On the weekends with Nanase, Yua wasn’t there.</p>



<p>That’s how it was, realizing once again. As I was watching Nanase in the kitchen, a sense of melancholy washed over me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>14</strong></p>


<p>Upon my return from the bath, the living room already wafted an appetizing scent.</p>



<p>Despite my brief soak, a variety of pre-prepared dishes neatly filled Tupperwares and Ziplock bags on the table. There was meat and tofu, ginger-fried fish, simmered yellowtail, bansansu (marinated bamboo shoots), celery tuna mayo, pickled cucumber, shredded cabbage, and komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach).</p>



<p>She managed to prepare all of this in a short time, and I was genuinely impressed.</p>



<p>“It’s quite luxurious.”</p>



<p>“Is it? The only thing that takes a bit of effort is the thin omelet for Bansansu. The rest is relatively simple—boiling, grilling, mixing. The pickles are a bit of a cheat; I used a base. Oh, and these won’t last, so be sure to finish it by tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Got it. But seriously, how can you make so much?”</p>



<p>“Well, unlike Uchi, I rely on recipes for everything.”</p>



<p>“And this one?”</p>



<p>I asked while picking up one of the Tupperwares. Inside was radish cut like autumn leaves, lightly tinted red.</p>



<p>“I got cheap turnips, so I made umeboshi (pickled plum) and mayo mix. Sorry for the mayo overload.”</p>



<p>“Huh, turnips?”</p>



<p>“Wanna try it?”</p>



<p>Accepting the chopsticks and a small plate Nanase offered, I placed the turnip on it. Taking a bite, the dish elevated the vegetable’s simple sweetness with the subtle acidity of umeboshi and the richness of mayo. It was enough to make rice enjoyable on its own.</p>



<p>“This is delicious.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, I’m glad you like it.”</p>



<p>I wouldn’t usually pick up a turnip myself. While I was fine with eating the same thing every day, from fall to winter, if things got tough, I’d just settle for a hotpot. However, when Nanase or Yua prepared dishes I wouldn’t normally eat, it made me appreciate home-cooked meals even more.</p>



<p>Lost in these thoughts, Nanase, who had been checking the frying, spoke nervously.</p>



<p>“I plan to make more side dishes, but for the main dishes, is fried chicken wings and salad chicken enough?”</p>



<p>“That’s plenty. I really appreciate it.”</p>



<p>Upon my response, she visibly relaxed, releasing the tension in her shoulders. “I never know how much Uchi usually makes…”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about that.”</p>



<p>Seemingly not entirely convinced, she glanced at me with a gaze that seems to question my mood. “But, I’m not used to this like Uchi.”</p>



<p>“You’ll get used to it quickly.”</p>



<p>“Are you sure you’re satisfied?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want you to feel like I’m lacking…”</p>



<p>“Uh, is this still about the foods?”</p>



<p>Unable to resist, I playfully teased Nanase, and for once, she tilted her head with a puzzled expression. After a moment, seemingly grasping the meaning, she blushed slightly and lightly smacked my chest.</p>



<p>“Geez! I was being serious, you know?”</p>



<p>“Sorry?! I thought, with you, it’s always an invitation for a witty comeback.”</p>



<p>“That was pure spontaneity!”</p>



<p>“Wait a minute. Now I’m starting to feel embarrassed.”</p>



<p>“So, do you understand what kind of woman you think I am?”</p>



<p>“Well, isn’t that usually the vibe you give off?!”</p>



<p>And there we were, looking at each other and bursting into laughter.</p>



<p>Being with Nanase always carried a certain tension, not in the sense that there was still a barrier between us, but more in the sense that, being so similar, I felt the need to step up my game. In conversations, appearance, demeanor—everything had to be gracefully performed to match the person next to me.</p>



<p>But occasionally, having these relaxed exchanges, almost like with another member of the family, wasn’t a bad thing.</p>



<p>Nanase pouted, lips slightly pointed. “I was actually thinking of letting you taste the freshly fried chicken wings, but I guess I’ll put that on hold now.”</p>



<p>“Sorry!”</p>



<p>“You really do have those moments, Chitose.”</p>



<p>“I’ll do anything, just cut me some slack.”</p>



<p>“Well, what should we do?” As she spoke, she smiled, appearing amused.</p>



<p>Nanase used a skimmer to drain the oil from the chicken wings, then placed them one by one into another pan where she had prepared the sauce. Using tongs, she expertly swirled them around, ensuring the flavor coated each piece thoroughly.</p>



<p>Once done, she took one out, blew on it a few times, and then offered it to me.</p>



<p>“Here, be careful; it’s hot.”</p>



<p>“Thanks!” I accepted it without hesitation and took a bite. “Hot!”</p>



<p>“See? I told you.” Nanase sighed, then handed me a glass of water, smiling in an exasperated way.</p>



<p>“Mmm.”</p>



<p>I took the water, letting it cool my mouth.</p>



<p>Nanase, with a tone reminiscent of guiding a little brother, remarked, “You’ve got to blow on it properly, you know?”</p>



<p>“Alright, alright, <em>fuu fuu</em>.” Then, I bit into the chicken wing again. “Mmm, delicious!”</p>



<p>The slightly sweet sauce, likely based on soy sauce and mirin, carried a subtle hint of garlic, making it tempting to devour several more. What’s more, the coating seemed to have a thin layer of starch, giving the skin an irresistibly crisp texture.</p>



<p>Approaching the frying pan for a second helping, I noticed Nanase scratching her cheek, a look of mild distress on her face. With an ambiguous smile, she opened her mouth;</p>



<p>“Originally, these are meant for later.”</p>



<p>“Just one more, or maybe two.”</p>



<p>“Come on, make sure you leave room for dinner.”</p>



<p>“No worries, there’s plenty of space. Why don’t you have some freshly fried ones too, Nanase?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I’ll pass for today.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Well, I added garlic, you see. The smell would be…”</p>



<p>“It’s just a subtle flavor, and you won’t notice unless you get really close.”</p>



<p>At those words, the familiar Nanase Yuzuki expression peeked into her face.</p>



<p>“──That’s, in a way, a woman’s touch.”</p>



<p>“I see,” I nodded, not delving too deeply into it, and took another bite of the second chicken wing.<br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>As Nanase finished the preparations, the reclined sofa offered a view of the evening sky, painting a sentimental gradient. The warm evening sun subtly tinged the living room air with a rosy glow as peach blossom and iris hues gently layered onto the azure canvas.</p>



<p>Holding two mugs, Nanase asked, “Can I sit next to you?” prompting me to sit up.</p>



<p>“Isn’t coffee usually for after meals?” I teased, but my comment received a weaker response than expected.</p>



<p>“Sorry, just need a short break before grilling the mackerel,” Nanase explained.</p>



<p>Considering the extensive meal prep after morning club practice, I felt apologetic for teasing her and tapped the space beside me. “Kidding, take your time.”</p>



<p>Nanase placed the mugs on the coffee table, sat next to me, and rested her head on my shoulder.</p>



<p>Without waiting for my response…</p>



<p>“Just a little, can I lean on your shoulder?” she asked casually. Hearing her relaxed breath, I couldn’t muster the will to push her away.</p>



<p>The blend of cooking aromas and the scent of shampoo in the living room created an oddly pleasant dissonance.</p>



<p>“Something on your mind?” I asked, easing my shoulder’s tension.</p>



<p>“Hmm, just charging and discharging.”</p>



<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>“Like taking a deep breath during intermission.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Nanase squirmed, as if tickled, and with a hint of teasing, she spoke, “These moments, they’re not half bad, huh?”</p>



<p>“These moments?”</p>



<p>“The twilight hour, the time just before dinner, sharing a moment sipping coffee with our shoulders brushing against each other.”</p>



<p>“More like my shoulder being used as a pillow.”</p>



<p>“Don’t make a joke of everything, you silly.” She lightly bumped her head against mine playfully. “If I had met you before Uchi, could we have had these ordinary days too?”</p>



<p>“Let’s drop it; that’s not something to ponder.”</p>



<p>“Someday, if we go to the same university and live together, could we have these ordinary days?”</p>



<p>“Someone said if we both live together, she might stop cooking.”</p>



<p>“I would still cook as long as you’re sleeping next to me.”</p>



<p>“How about I tell you a fairy tale on sleepless nights?”</p>



<p>“A night tale for just the two of us sounds nice.”</p>



<p>And so, we exchanged conversations like twilight at the border of day and night.</p>



<p>Ambiguous time. Ambiguous relationship. Ambiguous distance. Ambiguous words. Ambiguous future. Ambiguous hearts.</p>



<p>Pretending not to see it all, we quietly left it in this gap, securely locking it away in a box that no one could touch until tomorrow morning.</p>



<p>As the surroundings darkened, to the point where even our outlines became uncertain…</p>



<p>“It’s night.”</p>



<p>Nanase, seeming somewhat impatient, let out a soft sigh as she said those words.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>15</strong></p>


<p><em>Mirror, mirror.</em></p>



<p><em>──If I were the witch with a poisoned apple.</em><br /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">*<br /></p>



<p>Afterward, Nanase and I savored the salt-grilled mackerel she expertly prepared, paired with lightly pickled cucumbers, napa cabbage, and komatsuna. We also enjoyed stir-fried sakura shrimp and cabbage with salted kelp, accompanied by a school lunch-style barley and wakame rice, all complemented by iwashimaki soup.</p>



<p>It was a very homely menu, completely unpretentious and seeped into my heart so gently. While everything proved delicious, the wakame rice, with its exquisite touch of saltiness, stirred an inexplicable sense of nostalgia, prompting me to go for seconds. Apparently, it was quite easy to make, and she promised to share the recipe later.</p>



<p>After finishing my own quick teeth-brushing in the washroom, I took charge of the washing up the dishes while Nanase took a bath.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, despite the generous amount of food, the sink was filled with barely more than the dishes we used for dinner. I couldn’t help but chuckle at Nanase’s efficient handling of the aftermath, especially considering the remnants of bowls and cutting boards when she made katsudon before.</p>



<p>Done with the dishes, I sprawled out on the sofa.</p>



<p>On a typical weekend, it would be time for coffee with Yua, and I would walk her home after dinner, so my routine felt a bit off. However, when Nanase wanted to take a bath at my place, just serving her dinner and promptly sending her away wasn’t an option.</p>



<p>As I thought about this, I heard the sound of the bathroom door opening, and I turned up the volume on Tivoli Audio a bit. Gone were the days when the sound of the shower alone would thoroughly shake me the first time she stayed over in May; now, this sequence had become a routine.</p>



<p>Maybe it was because of who the other person was. Excluding the exception of Yua staying over once in my first year and this August, Nanase was the only one of the opposite sex who showered or bathed at my place.</p>



<p>I remembered saying something when she once asked me to pretend to be her boyfriend.</p>



<p><em>“In other words, you choose me because I wouldn’t misunderstand and fall for you.”</em></p>



<p>Maybe that statement held true for our current situation as well.</p>



<p>──Because there’s no risk of misunderstanding and overstepping, I accepted Nanase’s behavior.</p>



<p>For instance, even if she brought her own towel into my closet. Even if she didn’t need a special reason to come into this room. Even if the scent of the same shampoo lingered. Even if she had a bath salt exclusively for the times we were together. Even if we exchanged “what ifs” scenarios…</p>



<p>──None of these became an excuse to embrace this night.</p>



<p>Understanding this, I believed we had maintained a balance by setting boundaries. “<em>I am here, this far,</em>” leaving room for interpretation, only allowing our fingertips to touch when one of us desired.</p>



<p>We both, I think, skillfully exploited this convenient ambiguity, where we could feign ignorance if one’s mood didn’t align.</p>



<p>The hum of the hairdryer filled the air. I closed my eyes, using my crossed arms as a makeshift pillow, and unexpectedly caught a whiff – a scent that could only be described as the ambiance of someone taking a bath at home.</p>



<p>Back when I lived with my family, and even when strolling through the town at dusk, there were moments when this kind of atmosphere surrounded me. The scents of shampoo, conditioner, body soap, and bath salts would ride the warm steam, gently softening my expression without realizing it. Maybe there was a comforting reassurance in knowing that someone you were comfortable with was letting their guard down.</p>



<p>As I pondered about this and started dozing off unintentionally, the rustle of the bathroom curtain opening broke my half-sleep state.</p>



<p>──With a soft click, the lights in the living room dimmed.</p>



<p>The soft glow of the crescent light Nanase brought from the bedroom during dinner spread vaguely.</p>



<p>“Chitose, sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>



<p>Her voice, somewhat inviting, made me smile, anticipating her usual playful lines.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, it seems our little ball doesn’t include a slow dance session.”</p>



<p>As I was casually rising from the sofa…</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>I involuntarily gasped. In stark contrast to the modest outfit she wore earlier, Nanase was now donned in a smooth, wine-red one-shoulder dress that seemed like silk. It left one collarbone and a hint of cleavage exposed, with a subtle peek of skin at the waist.</p>



<p>A distinctive long ribbon hung from her left hip, adding an intriguing touch to the black long skirt with a deep slit up to her thighs, showcasing her elegantly extended, beautiful legs.</p>



<p>A delicate gold bracelet on her wrist, paired with dangling earrings swaying between her half-up hair, added an enchanting shimmer.</p>



<p>Nanase slowly moved her lips, which, tonight, seemed a shade redder than usual.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose?”</p>



<p>“N-Nanase…”</p>



<p>Words failed me momentarily, and I ended up awkwardly repeating her name.</p>



<p>The charm during the dress fitting was captivating, but that was in the context of an extraordinary event and stage costume. Yet, on a regular weekend night, in my room, with Nanase, freshly bathed and dressed like this, an indescribable sense of taboo crept in.</p>



<p>Her limbs, softly illuminated in the dimness, were unnervingly vivid and alluring. Although I was well aware of Nanase’s beauty, this felt different.</p>



<p>Suddenly, her words from the time when we were fake lovers came to mind.</p>



<p><em>“Oh, Chitose doesn’t seem to be into girls who go all out dressing up for a date with a good-looking guy.”</em></p>



<p><em>“And isn’t it unexpectedly thrilling this way? Despite the tomboyish style, the lines of the body that appear with a casual gesture, the glimpse of thighs when legs are crossed – doesn’t that create a little excitement?”</em></p>



<p>While I took those seemingly profound lines at face value, looking back, it was a conversation from before we laid bare each other’s inner selves. Nanase, in her own way, was likely practicing self-defense, and that probably applied not just to me but to all the opposite sexes. Her boyish attire was enticing enough that I didn’t notice.</p>



<p>──In other words, all this time, Nanase had been hiding the woman within herself like embodying an aesthetic.</p>



<p>Gulping unconsciously, I found myself momentarily speechless. As if enjoying my reaction, Nanase’s lips curled slightly. Even in those subtle gestures, my heart sought meaning.</p>



<p>So, why did Nanase unveil herself on this night? Why was she captivating me as a woman tonight?</p>



<p>Contrary to my bewilderment, Nanase tantalizingly, teasingly, stirred the silence. Slowly blinking her eyes, squinting meaningfully, occasionally moving her lips.</p>



<p>After indulging in the aftermath for a while…</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose?”</p>



<p>Once again murmuring the same lines, Nanase took a delicate step forward. The tips of her toes glistened with wine-red nail polish, matching the one-shoulder dress. The slit opened up, revealing her flushed knees and thighs after her bath.</p>



<p>“It’s night.”</p>



<p>“It’s night.”</p>



<p>My attempt to maintain composure failed miserably as the mirrored response slipped away and vanished outside the window. With every step Nanase took closer, I involuntarily retreated, and my calves bumped into the sofa, leaving me with no escape.</p>



<p>I shook my head slightly. <em>Why am I getting flustered?</em></p>



<p>We had played out this kind of flirtation countless times. Tonight, I just needed to perform it skillfully again. From within the boundaries we set, we could engage in an ambiguous play, touching only fingertips.</p>



<p>Nanase chuckled, skillfully playing with my swaying emotions.</p>



<p>“I love the night.” Her voice, tender as if it were gently caressing my earlobe, continued, “Because it’s enclosed, because it hasn’t been named yet.”</p>



<p>Gradually, she closed the distance.</p>



<p>“I love the night,” she reiterated, like reciting a poem with ink that had yet to dry. “Because it’s our world alone, a realm for secret stories we can’t share with anyone.”</p>



<p>With that, Nanase positioned herself in front of me, taking my right hand with her left and gently resting her other hand on my shoulder. Almost instinctively, my arms wrapped around her waist.</p>



<p>The hem of her dress had ridden up, exposing bare skin to my touch. The smooth sensation and the warmth of her body threatened to overwhelm my senses.</p>



<p>I considered pulling away, but Nanase, sensing the impulse, sensually rubbed her body against mine, as if entwining. Her chest pressed against mine, her lower abdomen against my lower abdomen.</p>



<p>A warm surge of blood raced through me.</p>



<p>“Nanase, this is──”</p>



<p>Interrupting my words, she leaned in, her slightly flushed cheek close to mine. A warm, seductive breath brushed the edge of my ear.</p>



<p>In a somewhat distant corner of my consciousness, I felt relief for having brushed my teeth beforehand.</p>



<p>The hand that had been holding my right hand, along with the other hand on my shoulder, traced down my back and reached my waist. With our bodies already melded together, she pulled me even closer.</p>



<p>Then, she whispered, like hinting at a secret pact.</p>



<p>“You can drown in the night.” She said slowly, pulling her cheek away.</p>



<p>Just as relief settled in, thinking that this was over…</p>



<p>──<em>smooch.</em></p>



<p>Her lips, sensually sweet and alluring, touched my left cheek. It was a kiss as provocative and intoxicating as the poison in autumn’s red spider lilies.</p>



<p>“Wha────”</p>



<p>Before I could hurriedly push her away,</p>



<p>──<em>squeak</em>.</p>



<p>Nanase shifted her weight, leaning into me. With my body already tensed and my calf wedged against the sofa, my knees buckled, and I awkwardly toppled over.</p>



<p>──<em>Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Nanase’s chest entwined with mine, pressed so intensely that our heartbeats intertwined, indistinguishable, echoing throughout my entire being.</p>



<p>──<em>Hh, hh, hhh.</em></p>



<p>Her feverish and yet moist breath, tantalizingly sensuous, tickled my ear in erratic rhythms. My right leg nestled against Nanase’s thigh, and any attempt to resist felt like committing to an irreversible reaction.</p>



<p>The slightly worn springs of the sofa groaned in harmony with our breaths. Even the accustomed, ordinary sounds of daily life now echoed licentiously sweet. The cushion, bearing the weight of both of us, sank willingly.</p>



<p>──<em>Creak</em>.</p>



<p>Nanase, who was on top, pushed herself up using both hands on my shoulders.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose?”</p>



<p>Maintaining a smoldering gaze, she teasingly spread her legs, enveloping my lower abdomen as she straddled me. Through the thin fabric of her skirt, the raw warmth and softness beneath revealed themselves, transmitting sensations that made my neck tense.</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>I bit my lip, attempting to stifle both my voice and my emotions.</p>



<p>“It’s night.”</p>



<p>Her slit skirt hiked up, exposing nearly the entirety of her upper thighs.</p>



<p>“A time for our private secrets, just the two of us.”</p>



<p>With a tantalizing motion, Nanase moved her hips.</p>



<p>“Even if Chitose Saku and Nanase Yuzuki were just an ordinary man and a woman…”</p>



<p>Sweat glistened along her exposed side peeking from the one-shoulder top.</p>



<p>“Even if we couldn’t make good excuses…”</p>



<p>The shoulder strap dangled towards her upper arm, revealing a generously exposed chest.</p>



<p>“Even if tonight we can’t be beautiful anymore…”</p>



<p>Her earrings swayed hypnotically, like a mesmerizing pendulum.</p>



<p>“No one’s watching, no one’s listening, so no one will ever know.”</p>



<p>Nanase provocatively traced my collarbone with her nails.</p>



<p>“In the morning, at noon, and evening…”</p>



<p>Each gentle touch sent shivers through my spine. I inadvertently caught a glimpse of her smooth armpits beyond the billowing sleeves, and the voyeuristic guilt turned into a tingling warmth around my belly.</p>



<p>“The roles of the daytime world can be relinquished to everyone. That’s why…” Nanase gazed down at me, “Could you give me your nameless night?”</p>



<p>Her eyes were so alluring, so steeped in desire that they threatened to melt away, casting a spell of seduction that was nearly irresistible.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose. Don’t you think we’re alike?” Nanase pulled out a line that seemed to be from the beginning of May. “See, we’ve always been good at drawing lines.”</p>



<p>Her fingers traced those words, dancing along my collarbone.</p>



<p>“From here is night, up to here is night.” With that, she slowly blinked her enticing eyes at me. “Don’t you think we can draw lines like that too?”</p>



<p>“I… don’t…” I attempted to shift my body, not wanting to say more.</p>



<p>“Mmh.”</p>



<p>Nanase’s hips bounced sensitively as our lower bodies rubbed against each other, and a sweet sigh escaped from her usually cool voice.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry.”</p>



<p>An addictive, stirring guilt, like needles jabbing and churning my brain, crawled up from the tips of my toes.</p>



<p>“…It’s alright,” Nanase wore an expression that combined semi-transparent shyness with a dreamy trance. “Move however you like.” </p>



<p>As she said this, she sensually shifted, gently rubbing our thighs together. The warm air concealed beneath the skirt rose subtly.</p>



<p>“Hey, Prince?” While enveloping both my cheeks like petals, she continued, “This is a stage titled ‘Night.’”</p>



<p>Nanase’s right hand trailed down my neck.</p>



<p>“We’re just playing; once the curtain falls, everything will return to normal.”</p>



<p>Moving past the collarbone, her fingertips drew circles around my chest, teasingly through the T-shirt. Open, close, large, small, clockwise, counterclockwise. Teasingly, like to withhold, deliberately taking detours.</p>



<p>A frustrating sensation surged to my throat as Nanase explored, making me want to scratch at my chest. Eventually, Nanase stopped at a certain point, and suddenly, her nails scratched sharply.</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>A stimulation resembling both pain and intoxication pierced through my core, and I desperately swallowed a voice that refused to form.</p>



<p>“So, will you taste it?” Then, almost pleading, she embraced my head and overlaid our bodies. “My hidden poison apple.”</p>



<p>Her words seemed like honey dripping into my ear.</p>



<p>“Nanase, really, I…”</p>



<p>“It’s Nana now.”</p>



<p>With a soft, succulent touch, her lips met my cheek once more.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>16</strong></p>


<p>“It’s Nana now,” I whispered as I pressed a soft, lingering kiss on Chitose’s left cheek.</p>



<p>A birthday present for you in the false May, an offering for me who would succumb to the poisoned apple of October.</p>



<p>His body, pinned beneath mine, tensed abruptly. With a mix of care for the man I had fallen for, the last shreds of reason and fondness compelled me to lift my hips slightly, creating a distance in our lower bodies.</p>



<p><em>Smooch, smooch</em>. I kept moving, sliding my lips across Chitose’s cheek.</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>It was adorable how he desperately turned his face away from me.</p>



<p><em>Smooch</em>. I kissed him once again in the same spot.</p>



<p>Was he nervous, still tangled in complicated thoughts, or was he simply feeling the heat like I was?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0393_01jpg.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>I wanted him to feel more of me. I wanted him to melt to the point he couldn’t think of anything else. I wanted to fill him with myself.</p>



<p>A droplet of sweat descended from Chitose’s temple.</p>



<p><em>Lick</em>. I delicately scooped it up with the tip of my tongue. The slightly salty taste spread in my mouth.</p>



<p>“It tastes like Chitose,” I said while savoring it carefully.</p>



<p><em>Smooch, smooch, smooch.</em></p>



<p>Down from the temple, I carefully traced the contour of his jaw.</p>



<p><em>Smooch, smooch, smooch.</em></p>



<p>When I reached the tip, I extended my tongue and licked the underside of his chin.</p>



<p>“Nana──”</p>



<p>I quickly pressed Chitose’s startled lips with my fingertip. Despite being a guy, they were plump and moist.</p>



<p>I inserted my index finger into his mouth, tracing the underside of his lips. The sensation of teeth neatly aligned against the moist membrane sent a tingling warmth below my navel. His tongue brushed against the pad of my finger reflexively.</p>



<p>“Mmh.”</p>



<p>As the tingling sensation extended to my shoulders, I instinctively pulled my hand away. From my lips to my finger, a transparent string of fluid connects us.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry.”</p>



<p>Chitose, still facing away, looked at me with an apologetic expression.</p>



<p>“It’s not dirty.”</p>



<p><em>Suck</em>, I put my fingers in my mouth. “Bwah─”</p>



<p>Your lips, your tongue—something I had imagined countless times in bed. Perhaps due to brushing his teeth after dinner, there’s a faintly bitter taste of mint.</p>



<p>He seemed about to say something, but…</p>



<p><em>Smooch, smooch, smooch</em>. I continued the trail of kisses from beneath the jaw, heading downward.</p>



<p>“Haah, haah…”</p>



<p>Even though I thought I had steeled myself, an excited and slightly higher-pitched moan involuntarily escaped my lips. Embarrassment morphed into a mix of self-deprecation and a tinge of sadism, heating up my body.</p>



<p>Breathing became difficult; my hips felt weak, and my head seemed on the verge of spinning. I never knew I could make these sounds in front of you.</p>



<p>“Mm, hhh…”</p>



<p>Although I was the one in control, a poignant tightening in my chest, fueled by affection, overwhelmed me. With each short breath, a reddened haze clouded my mind.</p>



<p>Chitose’s body, his warmth, his breath, his voice.</p>



<p>Since that day, I had comforted myself in the night countless times while thinking of you. I had always wanted to share kisses like this. I wanted to offer my everything, to touch your everything.</p>



<p>A secret shared only between us, unreachable outside the realm of dreams—joyful, sorrowful, maddening.</p>



<p>When I pressed my lips to the rough texture around his Adam’s apple…</p>



<p>──He twitched noticeably.</p>



<p>“Here?” I asked, trailing my fingertips gently in circles around his Adam’s apple. “Does it feel good?”</p>



<p>“No, that’s not—”</p>



<p>“Oh?”</p>



<p>His sudden fluency, the rushed attempt to feign ignorance, and the abrupt return to nonchalance, all annoyed me strangely.</p>



<p><em>Smooch</em>.</p>



<p>I kissed Chitose’s Adam’s apple once again. I sucked forcefully, leaving a mark. Then, as if commending his restraint, I delicately licked from the bottom to the top.</p>



<p>“Mm, nn.”</p>



<p>For the first time, Chitose let out a moan. In that moment, a shiver ran through my lower abdomen.</p>



<p>Despite his usual carefree or suddenly manly demeanor, it was a voice that sounded like he’s desperately resisting desire, trying to suppress an impulse. It was almost pitifully fragile.</p>



<p>“Cute.”</p>



<p>I wanted to hear more, wanted him to spill more, wanted him to expose himself further.</p>



<p>I slowly brought my mouth close to his ear.</p>



<p>“Don’t hold back on your voice,” I whispered directly into his ear.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>Chitose seemed determined to keep his lips sealed.</p>



<p>“That’s too bad.”</p>



<p>I playfully nibbled on his earlobe, moving my teeth gently across its surface and pulling back.</p>



<p>“Mmm.”</p>



<p>Next, I let my tongue trace the contours of his ear, slow and teasing.</p>



<p>“Ngghhh…”</p>



<p>His muffled moan spilled out, and I felt myself melting in response.</p>



<p>“Can you share more sounds with me?”</p>



<p>I sucked, nibbled, licked, kissed. In the dimness, indistinguishable breaths mingled.</p>



<p>“Mmm, hah.”</p>



<p>“Mmm, haa.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, haa.”</p>



<p>“Fff, mmh.”</p>



<p>I persistently showered affection on Chitose’s left ear with my mouth, my left hand tenderly stroking his head.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, let it out.”</p>



<p>As I spoke, I slipped my free right hand beneath the hem of his T-shirt, encountering resistance—strained muscles, evidently from resisting with all his might. The sculpted abs rippled subtly under my touch.</p>



<p>“Chitose, you’re so hard.”</p>



<p>Whispering suggestive words near his ear, I moved my hand gently.</p>



<p>Slowly, with an ambiguous touch, I caressed his abs, his ribs, the lower part of his chest—like adoring a piece of art. My pinkie snagged in his navel momentarily, teasingly exploring its depths.</p>



<p>“S-Stop—”</p>



<p>With a firm grip, Chitose grabbed my right arm and pulled it out of the T-shirt.</p>



<p>“Are you ticklish, or is it frustrating?”</p>



<p>“Please, Nanase.”</p>



<p>“You want me to continue?”</p>



<p>“You get what I mean.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I do.”</p>



<p>Still with his face turned away, his expression was obscured by disheveled hair.</p>



<p>Exhaling a sigh, I relaxed a bit. Perhaps relieved, Chitose loosened the grip on my arm.</p>



<p><em>Sorry, I understand.</em></p>



<p>──Even in moments like these, your kindness always took precedence.</p>



<p><em>Smooch</em>. I kissed his collarbone and ran my tongue over it.</p>



<p>“Nn, w-wait…!”</p>



<p>Ignoring Chitose’s fluster, my hand ventured lower. Despite the chilly nights lately, his room attire, with its short pants, revealed warmth. I caressed the thigh through the fabric, playing with the sensitive area beneath the kneecap.</p>



<p><em>Smooch, lick, kiss.</em></p>



<p>As I indulged in these actions, my lips and tongue gradually memorized the contours of his collarbone.</p>



<p><em>It’s true; I’m sorry for imposing. I’m sorry for taking advantage of you. This is the crimson that devastated me, the Nana who veiled the moon tonight.</em></p>



<p><em>Smooch</em>.</p>



<p>My lips pressed against his neck, and my right hand stealthily infiltrated the hem of his shorts. The inner thighs, moist and heated, bore witness to my exploration. The skin was smoother than anticipated, a canvas untouched by inexperienced hands.</p>



<p>Nudging my nose behind his ear while gently caressing above his knee, the intoxicating scent of him wafted up to my nose.</p>



<p>“Hmm, hmm, ah, haah.”</p>



<p>Unable to contain my desire, I extended my tongue to his neck like a plea.</p>



<p>“Nh, Chitose.”</p>



<p>I gradually moved my fingers upward from around his knee. When they touched the smooth fabric of his shorts—</p>



<p>“No, stop.”</p>



<p>Chitose grabbed my arm again, forcefully lifting his upper body. His eyes, on the brink of tears, met mine.</p>



<p>“Let’s stop here, Nanase.”</p>



<p>I held his trembling hand gently against my cheek and…</p>



<p>──<em>suck</em>.</p>



<p>I took Chitose’s index finger deep into my mouth.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>I teased with my lips, avoiding any pressure from my teeth. Slowly, I moved up and down, repeating the motion, occasionally releasing your finger and licking up from the base to the tip.</p>



<p><em>Kiss, smooch, suck.</em></p>



<p>After an exhaustive round of kisses, I took the tip into my mouth, tracing it with my tongue between his nail and finger gap.</p>



<p>“Nh, Chitose, Chitose.”</p>



<p>Calling his name desperately, he still avoided meeting my gaze. So, I—</p>



<p>“May I?” I inquired while touching Chitose’s left chest.</p>



<p>──<em>Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Interpreting his heartbeats, which raced almost embarrassingly loudly, as a silent agreement, I continued to explore downward. Tracing his ribs, caressing his stomach, my fingers hooked onto the waistband of his shorts.</p>



<p>Just as I summoned the courage to face what I had been avoiding—</p>



<p>“──Nanase!”</p>



<p>Chitose forcefully called my name. He grabbed both of my shoulders and pulled me towards him, a strong yet tender embrace.</p>



<p>“Chitose…?”</p>



<p>“That’s not it. This isn’t how it should be.” Almost like begging, he pressed his cheek against mine. “Sorry, Nanase. I’m sorry for making you do this.”</p>



<p>“Why is Chitose apologizing?”</p>



<p>There was no response to my inquiry; only the strength in his embrace tightened.</p>



<p>Seeking more, I extended my tongue, tracing along the nape of his neck.</p>



<p>“I’ve got a good body, you know?”</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p><em>Kiss</em>.</p>



<p>“I’ll do anything you want, Chitose.”</p>



<p>“Then, tonight, I want you to do nothing.”</p>



<p><em>Suck</em>.</p>



<p>“Don’t you want to hold me?”</p>



<p>“I can’t.”</p>



<p><em>Smooch</em>.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to love me entirely yet.”</p>



<p>“Stop it, Nanase.”</p>



<p><em>Kiss, smooch</em>.</p>



<p>“Even if just for tonight, let’s love each other with our bodies.”</p>



<p>“I’ll get mad, Nanase. You shouldn’t say things like that.”</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>Growing impatient, I pushed Chitose away forcefully. “I don’t want to hear any of your courteous lines right now!”</p>



<p>Holding his cheeks with both hands, I released a sweet, languid breath.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose, let’s kiss properly. Love my body thoroughly. Lick and touch me all over. Can I have you inside me?”</p>



<p>While saying this, I took Chitose’s hand and guided it to my chest.</p>



<p>“A girl is going this far. Please don’t embarrass me.”</p>



<p>Just a few more centimeters before his fingertips touched…</p>



<p>“No, stop.”</p>



<p>He spoke clearly, his fist clenched. His will, seemingly impenetrable, rejected my attempts.</p>



<p><em>Just a bit more</em>, I couldn’t turn back now. Although my heart and body were ready to accept…</p>



<p>Chitose gently but firmly peeled away his fingers. With each separation, it felt like the distance between us widened, tearing at my heart with sorrow and anxiety.</p>



<p><em>One, two, three, four. </em>As he freed his fingertips, he gently placed them on my cheeks, staring straight into my eyes.</p>



<p>“This isn’t right,” He whispered.</p>



<p>With clear eyes, like the marbles we peered at during the festival,</p>



<p>“──If I accept now, Nanase Yuzuki would be humiliated.”</p>



<p>He spoke like the hero Chitose Saku.</p>



<p>“Huh, ah…”</p>



<p>In that moment──</p>



<p>The days spent with you, the exchanged conversations, the nights you were by my side, the name that had become a past tense, the love that was once fake and eventually turned into something real, the flower vase in my heart, my own pattern of May, and the serene moon we gazed at that day…</p>



<p>──All of them touched my heart without you laying a finger on my body.</p>



<p>Like a carousel of memories raced through my mind,</p>



<p>──I simply felt ashamed of myself.</p>



<p>Tears welled up and trickled down my cheeks.</p>



<p><em>“I’ll get mad, Nanase. You shouldn’t say things like that.”</em></p>



<p>Earlier, I dismissed it as a gentleman line, but it was different. Chitose’s voice was filled with genuine frustration and helplessness, just like that day when he comforted me on this very sofa. Now, I finally realized the reason.</p>



<p>A relationship that didn’t seek the heart, only a physical connection. A one-sided imposition of desires without requiring consent.</p>



<p>Exploiting the relationship and kindness we’d built, what I did was no different from what I loathed about that man in my nightmares.</p>



<p>Ah, that’s right. With this realization, everything became clear.</p>



<p>What was my sincerity? What was the charm I wanted to show? What was Nana? What was the mirror? What was the witch of poisoned apple?</p>



<p>Right now, I was the mad queen who, driven by jealousy, committed a heinous act.</p>



<p><em>If I can’t live beautifully, that’s no different from being dead. </em></p>



<p>The woman named Nanase Yuzuki, whom I loved insanely, died this night.</p>



<p>“U-uh…”</p>



<p>I hugged my trembling body. The heart that was burning just moments ago turned so cold that it froze. Tears flowed selfishly and uncontrollably. In my blurred vision, I caught a glimpse of you, your eyes gently downturned.</p>



<p>The venomous red marks I left on your neck have transformed painfully into a bruising purple. Your cheeks, ears, and various places were moist with saliva.</p>



<p>“…Dirty.”</p>



<p>Unintentionally, I muttered those words, and without realizing, I fumbled around. What should I do? I need to wipe it off quickly.</p>



<p>I reached out with my unsteady hand, tracing Chitose’s cheek, neck, and ear with my fingertips.</p>



<p>“Dirty, it’s all so dirty.”</p>



<p>Desperately trying to erase my own marks, as if attempting to atone for my sins.</p>



<p>“Nanase…”</p>



<p>But the more I rubbed, the more the stain of my own dirtiness seemed to spread.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I couldn’t bring myself to look at your face properly. “I’ve dirtied you, the beautiful you. I’m so sorry.”</p>



<p>Sniffing and sobbing like a child, I moved my hands.</p>



<p>“Cough, cough… “</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>Afraid of the words that would follow, I vigorously shook my head.</p>



<p>“I’ll clean up properly.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p><em>Drops, drops, drops</em>—stains spread on the unfamiliar skirt I wasn’t used to wearing.</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose, want to take another bath?”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>I feared that everything would end the moment Chitose said something more.</p>



<p>“I’ll wash you clean.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p><em>I’m scared, scared, so scared…</em></p>



<p>“Sorry, not like that, I mean—”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>I kept rambling blindly, “I’ll do anything.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>I wiped Chitose’s cheeks with trembling fingertips, “If you say not to talk to you for a while, I won’t.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>I pleaded, squeezing out a teary voice. “I’ll bow to Haru and ask her to take over my role in the play.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>I knew that I had thrown away the right and qualification to say such things…</p>



<p>“I won’t come to this house until you forgive me.”</p>



<p>“Nanase.”</p>



<p>However, your presence was just too significant for me to withdraw cleanly.</p>



<p>“So please…” I sobbed nauseously, yet still clinging to the slimmest hope, “Please, don’t hate me.”</p>



<p>Without shame or dignity, I buried my face in your chest and clung desperately.</p>



<p>“Please don’t erase me from your life.”</p>



<p>Pleading, whimpering, sobbing.</p>



<p>“…don’t hate me.”</p>



<p>“──Nanase Yuzuki!”</p>



<p>I flinched; Chitose’s voice felt like a slap. <em>Ah, it’s over</em>. Hearing that rejecting tone, I braced myself.</p>



<p>We hadn’t spent a lot of times together since our freshman year; we weren’t intertwined by the closeness of daily life, nor strongly bound through sports, and certainly not due to childhood admiration.</p>



<p>Yet, the reason I could stay by Chitose’s side was that he believed we were similar. He let me into his home because he trusted I wasn’t someone who would misunderstand and cross boundaries.</p>



<p>──Birds of a feather.</p>



<p>However, on this night, I let go of the sole excuse that kept me by your side. I, lacking any special bond or anything to reciprocate, had become just another nameless one who consumed Chitose Saku’s generosity immodestly, elated by a bit of kindness.</p>



<p>Probably appearing and passing through your life countless times, soon to be forgotten, one among many.</p>



<p>Where did it all go wrong? I only wanted simple, sincere love.</p>



<p>Was it when I was shattered on that rooftop? When I decided to use my hidden woman charm? When I turned away from beauty? Or perhaps when I misconstrued beauty itself?</p>



<p>Deep down, I think I always knew. In the end, this too was fake. When confronted with honed determination, I hastily performed a facade with makeshift tricks.</p>



<p>The borrowed crimson couldn’t dye your heart, after all.</p>



<p>But still, I closed my eyes, and tears streamed down my cheeks.</p>



<p>──I didn’t want it to end like this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0429_01.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>I loved the beautiful you. I wanted to be someone equally beautiful, fitting to stand beside you. I took pride in being your reflection in the mirror.</p>



<p>The only thing I dreaded was being seen as dirty by you, for that might be the lasting impression you had of me.</p>



<p>“No, I don’t wanna…”</p>



<p>“It’s not dirty.”</p>



<p>Softly, Chitose’s warm fingertips touched my cheek.</p>



<p>“Huh…?” I raised my face hesitantly, searching for the meaning behind those words.</p>



<p>“You’re not dirty,” he repeated, smiling kindly with those infinitely tender eyes. “So don’t say such sad things.”</p>



<p>As if tracing the line of fate, Chitose gently wiped away my tears with his thumb. Unexpectedly, his touch grazed my lower lip.</p>



<p>“Mm…”</p>



<p>Smoothly, he continued to stroke the inside.</p>



<p>Feeling embarrassed by my own voice that had turned a bit erratic, I hastily opened my mouth, “So-sorry…”</p>



<p>──<em>suck.</em></p>



<p>Then, without hesitation, Chitose put his still-moist thumb into his mouth.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>I instinctively grabbed his hand. His fingers still carried traces of my saliva. Even though he had just wiped my tears away, sorrow welled up again at the corners of my eyes.</p>



<p>“Stop it, Chitose!”</p>



<p>I desperately pulled his hand away, but his fingers remained unyielding, like they embodied Chitose’s will itself.</p>



<p>“Please, it’s dirty.”</p>



<p>──<em>suck, slurp.</em></p>



<p>Casually, like enjoying a popsicle, he pulled the finger he had been sucking out.</p>



<p>“You silly,” he laughed, masking the awkwardness. “I told you, it’s not dirty.”</p>



<p>Chitose lowered his eyes ever so slightly and continued in a calm voice. “I’ve never once thought of you, Nanase, as anything dirty.”</p>



<p>While wiping away my tears again with the thumb that hadn’t been in his mouth, he spoke;</p>



<p>“──Not your body, not your heart either.”</p>



<p>It was almost like he could see through everything.</p>



<p>“A-ahh…”</p>



<p><em>Again</em>, I thought.</p>



<p>Once again, you were willing to ignore your own feelings and be the hero. You’re trying to erase it all, carrying the weight of my weakness. Although I felt overwhelmingly frustrated by being protected back then…</p>



<p>This time, it was me who had hurt you.</p>



<p>──Using the same method as the man I could never accept.</p>



<p>So now, your kindness felt painful, and I wish it would vanish into the night.</p>



<p>“Sorry…”</p>



<p>I bowed my head sincerely once more and tumbled off the sofa. The abrupt fall struck my kneecaps sharply, sending tingles down both calves and thighs.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, my skirt, adorned with a deep slit, had embarrassingly fallen open. The one-shoulder strap slouched down to my shoulder, revealing the cleavage he never touched until the end.</p>



<p>Shame crept over me, for laying bare such an undignified display in front of the man I loved.</p>



<p>Adjusting my disheveled skirt and fixing the strap, I rose. Tears welled up again at my own pitiful state.</p>



<p>──I was such a fool.</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, another truth of my feelings cried out, tinged with forlorn loneliness.</p>



<p><em>I see</em>, I bit my lip.</p>



<p>──Honestly, I had a tiny bit of hope.</p>



<p>While pretending that using women’s weapon was a mere means to touch your heart, I was convincing myself that even if it ended in failure, the attempt alone would make you aware of me—I justified it all, using my newfound self as Nana.</p>



<p>──Maybe, somewhere deep down, I hoped you would accept it.</p>



<p>So I picked out new underwear in your favorite shade of blue, got my fingernails and toenails done, meticulously cleaned every inch of my body, took time with brushing my teeth, delicately applied perfume on my wrists and neck, even prepared for an overnight stay, planning to wake up first to make coffee and crispy bacon with fried eggs.</p>



<p>──It wasn’t supposed to be like this, and it made me want to tear at my chest.</p>



<p>Even if I came here today with that intention, there could have been more refined ways to extend the invitation. I could have traced my steps within the limits of a playful flirtation, all while gauging your reactions. Even in seductive provocation, there was something called finesse.</p>



<p>Yet, the moment I stepped over that line, driven by lust, I leapt forward like an untamed beast and…</p>



<p>──Literally wallowing on my own.</p>



<p>Would you see me as a shameless woman? Would you think of me as someone overwhelmed by one carnal desire?</p>



<p>While listening to my sweetly arrogant voice…</p>



<p>Were you maintaining a stern expression all along? Were you continuously looking at me with alert eyes?</p>



<p>──I was such a fool.</p>



<p>I squeezed my eyes shut, clenching my fist until it hurt, and pondered once more.</p>



<p>Even if there was a faint, dreamy hope, deep down, my rational mind knew that the possibility of truly becoming one this night was almost nonexistent. No matter how liberally I used my feminine charm, that complicated man wouldn’t easily let himself be swayed by the atmosphere without even giving a name to his feelings.</p>



<p>That’s why, sooner or later, whether persuaded or condemned, I had prepared myself to not be accepted in the end.</p>



<p>──I never thought being rejected by the man I loved could be this painful.</p>



<p>As if being told I lacked charm. As if being told he couldn’t see me in that light. As if being apologized to for not eliciting a reaction.</p>



<p>──It felt like the pride I had cultivated as a woman was collapsing with a loud crash.</p>



<p>And the disgust grew at myself who still thought about my own heart more than him, making excuses for my faults.</p>



<p>Nanase Yuzuki died this night. This was where my stage drew its curtain.</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>Turning away from the unbearable, hollow silence, I sprinted towards the entrance.</p>



<p>“──Nanase!”</p>



<p>My arm was pulled forcefully.</p>



<p>“Don’t go yet.”</p>



<p>Arms wrapped tightly around me from behind. For a brief moment, I felt relieved that he chased after me, but as I realized I was the one who initiated this, it left me feeling like a woman feigning a reluctant farewell, and a sense of cheapness washed over me.</p>



<p>“Let me go!” I shouted, squirming desperately.</p>



<p>“Calm down, Nanase.” Chitose’s gentle voice whispered in my ear.</p>



<p>“No!” I rejected it sharply, shaking my head. “Why? Even after I did such terrible things to you…”</p>



<p>While aware there was no justification for raising my voice, and even though I should acknowledge this kindness and beg for forgiveness again and again, still, the raw emotions on display couldn’t be contained.</p>



<p>“You won’t even embrace me, so don’t touch me with your half-hearted kindness!”</p>



<p>I blurted out words that should never be said, causing the arm that had enveloped me to tense up involuntarily.</p>



<p>“Sorry, but…” Chitose tightened his hold once more.</p>



<p>“──I may not be able to embrace Nana, but I can at least hold Nanase Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>He spoke those words in a voice that seemed to forgive everything.</p>



<p>“Chitose…” Guilt washed over me, realizing how emotionally unstable I must seemed. “Sorry, I’m really sorry.”</p>



<p>I squeezed the arms holding me with trembling hands and pressed my forehead against them.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for staining you in such a despicable way.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, I felt Chitose’s smile against my ear. “You haven’t stained me. Want me to prove it again?”</p>



<p>As his fingers approached my lips, panic surged, and I shook my head vigorously, “But I… I became like that man, didn’t I?”</p>



<p>Chitose softly placed a hand on my head.</p>



<p>“Not the same.” While tenderly combing my hair with his fingertips, he continued, “Nanase, until now, you’ve only touched my heart.”</p>



<p>It felt like he was rearranging the moon I’d hidden in the night sky. My chest tightened painfully.</p>



<p>“Is it really not the same? Haven’t I hurt you irreparably?”</p>



<p>“Nanase, you’re being silly today,” Chitose said, resting his chin on my shoulder. “There’s no man who’d be hurt when seduced by a woman he has feelings for.”</p>



<p>“Chitose…”</p>



<p>If taken at face value, it sounded like a line that could easily be misunderstood. But because it was me, he believed I’d correctly interpret the feelings behind those words.</p>



<p>──For my sake, he chose to express it that way.</p>



<p>The remaining trust was just warm now.</p>



<p>I lost my strength, collapsing onto the floor.</p>



<p>Chitose turned off the lighting to a crescent moon and joined me on the floor while leaning against the wall. Since he was still hugging me from behind, I ended up leaning against her chest. His nose occasionally brushed against the back of my head, creating a faint ticklish sensation. With my legs bent lightly, wrapped in his arms like a scarf, his warmth seeping into my heart.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump</em> – my heartbeat gradually became calm.</p>



<p>In the living room, bathed in moonlight, only Norah Jones’ “Shoot The Moon” was quietly playing on the Tivoli speaker.</p>



<p>With a sigh, I murmured, “I wonder if I can face everyone normally from tomorrow…”</p>



<p>Chitose’s sudden laughter lightly tickled my hair. “At night, things are sealed off, right?”</p>



<p>Feeling embarrassed by the words I had spoken during the heated moment earlier, I nodded softly. “Hmm…”</p>



<p>“If that’s the case,” Chitose continued, somewhat with a self-mocking tone, “This becomes our little secret.”</p>



<p>“I see,” I replied, smiling at myself in the same way, “I’m really a shameless woman…”</p>



<p>“…and I’m a pathetic man.”</p>



<p>As we conversed, the tension in my heart seemed to melt away. Once again, he managed to subtly shift my problems into ‘our’ problems.</p>



<p>Chitose’s arm around me tightened ever so slightly, then he asked, “Can I ask you something?”</p>



<p>There was no need to confirm what he wanted to ask. I answered with my cheek pressed against his arm, “There are nights when even a woman wants to be held.”</p>



<p>“And there are nights when a man wants to be embraced too, right?”</p>



<p>While I was wondering if we could still be so similar, I felt comforted by his response and squinted my eyes. Just like that, together, Chitose Saku and Nanase Yuzuki returned, and we shared a soft laugh.</p>



<p>Every time our shoulders moved, our scents intermingled and floated in the night. The slowly synchronizing heartbeats resembled adjacent second hands.</p>



<p>“Hey, can I ask you a bit of a mean question?” I said, absentmindedly.</p>



<p>“Go easy on me.”</p>



<p>While gently caressing Chitose’s arm, I continued, “Why didn’t you reject me sooner?”</p>



<p>A slight twitch over my back hinted at his surprise.</p>



<p>“…That’s truly a mean question.” </p>



<p>“Hehe,” I responded with a mischievous laugh, “The answer will be left behind with the night, anyway.”</p>



<p>A resigned sigh escaped his lips.</p>



<p>“Nanase, this dress suits you well.”</p>



<p>“Too late for that.”</p>



<p>“I’ve been avoiding looking at you for so long.”</p>



<p>“I bought it thinking of you.”</p>



<p>“Well,” Chitose loosened his hug slightly, nuzzling against my neck like seeking comfort. “I’m a guy too, especially when it comes to you, Nanase.”</p>



<p>His sharply defined nose brushed against my skin, and I couldn’t help but think I was glad I took the time to take care of myself.</p>



<p>“To say I wasn’t shaken would be a lie,” he continued matter-of-factly, as if having a conversation with himself. “In that situation, there’s no way to keep a cool head.”</p>



<p>For a moment, Chitose grumbled, “And there was a moment when I almost lost my rationality.”</p>



<p>“Really?” I felt a bit relieved hearing that.</p>



<p>“I thought maybe we should just drown ourselves in the night,” he said, somewhat bashfully. “As you said, maybe we could draw a line like that.”</p>



<p>The boundary between day and night, between the heart and the body.</p>



<p>“I thought it would be easier. However…” he exhaled slowly, his chest rose and fell against my back. “It only makes it more painful. For both you and me.”</p>



<p>He continued to whisper with a hint of fear, “I’m sure the more we entwine our bodies, the more love will wear thin.”</p>



<p>The sound of fabric gently rubbing against each other echoed.</p>



<p>“Besides, it seemed like you didn’t want this either.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?” I reacted involuntarily.</p>



<p>He continued like it was nothing. “That’s why, until the very end, you left an escape route, right? Even if it was just anxiety about confirming the answer.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“Most of all,” Chitose painfully continued, “If I accepted this night, it felt like the Nanase Yuzuki I love wouldn’t be able to return from being Nana.”</p>



<p>With that, like trying to anchor me, he held me tightly.</p>



<p>“──Since that day, the one who has been in my heart is Nanase Yuzuki.”</p>



<p>“C-Chitose…?”</p>



<p>Instinctively, I started to turn around, but he gently pressed his cheek against mine, like silently saying not to look at him right now.</p>



<p>I knew that in Chitose’s heart, Yuuko was there. Also Uchi, Haru, Nishino-senpai, and of course, me too…</p>



<p>I hoped for it. I believed in it like a prayer. I knew it as I dreamed for it.</p>



<p>But, in this way…</p>



<p>──You said you love me.</p>



<p>──You said I’m in your heart.</p>



<p>Warmer tears trickled down, creating tiny puddles where our cheeks met, overflowing and streaming down the space between us.</p>



<p>No matter how strong I pretended to be, deep down, I had always been insecure. Perhaps it was because I had no special bond or anything to give in return, merely a woman unilaterally saved by you with no place in your heart.</p>



<p>That’s precisely why…</p>



<p>──Your words, as touching my lips, were more precious than any kiss.</p>



<p>My place existed there, a place you conveyed to me. You gave it a name that I wanted to cherish, together with you.</p>



<p>“Hey, Nanase?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes?”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, he called my name, and my voice involuntarily rose. Chitose, loosening the arm wrapped around me, cupped both my cheeks.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you a woman? You’re Nanase Yuzuki, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>These were words I had woven to support you when you were lost.</p>



<p>“No matter how much you resembled Yuuko recently, even if you took after Asu-nee, Yua, or Haru…”</p>



<p>Ah, indeed. You saw through it all, didn’t you?</p>



<p>Still wiping away my tears that wouldn’t cease, Chitose continued, “You are neither Yuuko, Asu-nee, Yua, Haru, nor even Nana.”</p>



<p>A mirror was a mirror, after all.</p>



<p>“So please, don’t try to be someone else.”</p>



<p>Unconsciously, I found myself biting my lip. When I sniffled, a pitiful sound echoed. And with a teary, quivering voice;</p>



<p>“I know that, but…” I clung tightly to your arms. “As long as I stay as Nanase Yuzuki, I’ll never reach you. I won’t throw everything away for you if I strive to be beautiful. Nanase Yuzuki’s rightness isn’t mine. I’ll surely regret it. I could have ignored the eyes around me, not afraid to hurt others, and not hesitated to surpass them. I could have embraced you without leaving any escape route.”</p>



<p>Once spoken, regrets about why I shattered, what I thought, and why I decided to come here today surged up again. Despite swearing to leave behind friendship, sympathy, kindness, sorrow, and even Nanase Yuzuki…</p>



<p>If I retracted it, wouldn’t it just be a repetition of the same mistakes? Wouldn’t I lose the ability to defy the whims of fate?</p>



<p>“Nanase…”</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose,” My tear-stained voice trembled as I spoke.</p>



<p>“If what I am right now is wrong, if Chitose Saku would still embrace Nanase Yuzuki, if you wish for things to stay the same…” I paused, cleared my throat with a small cough, then continued, “Can you guide me?”</p>



<p>“Sorry,” He muttered, “Whether the current Nanase Yuzuki is right or wrong, I don’t know. Certainly, for someone, it’s a kind of beauty. So I can only convey my own heart.”</p>



<p>I let out a short, sob-like whimper, and repeated those words. “Your… heart…”</p>



<p>“But one thing is certain,” Chitose gently wrapped his arms around me again. “I fell for Nanase Yuzuki, who strives to remain Nanase Yuzuki no matter what.”</p>



<p>He hugged me tightly, as if refusing to let us drift apart in the night sea. Ever so silently, pure white tears accumulated.</p>



<p>Ah, that heart of yours…</p>



<p>──For me, it was the most reliable beacon of moonlight.</p>



<p>If that’s what you desire, that indeed was the reason for Nanase Yuzuki’s existence.</p>



<p>“That’s why,” Chitose said with a voice that seemed on the verge of tears. “…I’m the one who needs to change.”</p>



<p>When I softly put my hand on top of his, he squeezed it back tightly.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for making you go through this, for cornering your beautiful way of living. I know it’s my fault.”</p>



<p>In one pained and yearning sigh, your sincere feelings were embedded.</p>



<p>“Still, naming these feelings is something I want to do at the very end.”</p>



<p>Quietly, a single drop rolled down my nape.</p>



<p>“I’ll trace our time together carefully, imagining the future we’ll face together, locking away keys for each ‘what if’ one by one, to doubt and question if it’s wrong each night, to face it again each morning, to agonize over it and struggle through, and then, I want to scoop them up gently with both hands like making an eternal vow.”</p>



<p>In that tone of voice, he carried his sincere feelings.</p>



<p>“Once I name it, I won’t overwrite it.”</p>



<p>Like watching falling cherry blossoms…</p>



<p>“──I’ll give an answer by the time the next cherry blossoms bloom.”</p>



<p>Chitose spoke as if practicing a prelude to farewell.</p>



<p>“Just a little longer, I want you to wait.”</p>



<p>That’s why, tracing the name given to these feelings…</p>



<p>“Alright,” I replied, as if this was the beginning of my final love.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-0463_01-1.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Our hearts found their place, like two puzzle pieces fitting seamlessly. Just as the fizz escaped from a pressed-down ramune marble, the night air released with a subtle pop. The tension in Chitose’s body dissipated, and before I realized it, my tears had ceased as well.</p>



<p>A bubbly laughter, seemingly from nowhere, rose like ephemeral foam from both of us.</p>



<p>Then, having adjusted the lines between us, I mischievously stepped over them and opened my mouth;</p>



<p>“Hey, Chitose?”</p>



<p>Chitose’s shoulders stiffened, “You’re starting to scare me…”</p>



<p>As expected, he seemed to have noticed the deliberate similarity in the way I had brought this up. Although I couldn’t see his face from behind, I was sure the corners of his mouth were twitching.</p>



<p>In tune with those expectations, I pressed on, “Can I ask just one more thing?”</p>



<p>Chitose, with a short sigh that sounded almost like a chuckle, responded, “Be easy on me, please.”</p>



<p>I asked with a sweet, coquettish tone, “Hey, did you react to me?”</p>



<p>Gently, I stroked the exposed part of his knee.</p>



<p>“Oi!” Chitose promptly interjected with a dry voice.</p>



<p>“Nana went through all that embarrassment. Is it too much to ask that?”</p>



<p>“Then why don’t you let me talk to Nana instead?”</p>



<p>This was the usual exchange between Chitose Saku and Nanase Yuzuki. Even if there was a drop of sincerity in there, no, precisely because there always was…</p>



<p>Through my shoulders, I sensed the movement of him scratching his head in mild frustration. <em>See? You always respond to an invitation, don’t you?</em></p>



<p>Amidst a contemplative silence, Chitose started with an oddly serious tone.</p>



<p>“Nanase, if that’s the case, I have one request as well. Will you hear me out?”</p>



<p>“Sure, if it’s your request.”</p>



<p>When I responded calmly, he took a deep breath, almost as if preparing to reveal a profound secret.</p>



<p>“Alright, absolutely, you cannot move back any further. This is related to Chitose Saku’s dignity!” He blurted out this ridiculous, rapid-fire statement.</p>



<p>Understanding what he meant, I maintained silence, resisting the urge to burst into laughter. One second, two seconds, three seconds…</p>



<p>Chitose, unable to endure any longer, lightly tapped my shoulder, “Uhm, well, won’t you say something?”</p>



<p>After thoroughly enjoying the awkwardness of the situation, I replied, “Hehe, well done.” Without turning back, I extended my arm and patted his head.</p>



<p>Chitose exhaled like he just received a perfect score on a test paper.</p>



<p>“Jeez, couldn’t you be more serious?”</p>



<p>“To close a night like this, don’t we need a lame joke?”</p>



<p>“That’s called a vulgar dirty joke. What you said just now.”</p>



<p>My lips probably twitched slightly. Perhaps you were once again playing the fool to comfort me, lowering yourself to lift me up. But for now, that’s okay.</p>



<p>If you were me, if Chitose Saku and Nanase Yuzuki were reflections in a mirror…</p>



<p>Certainly, if you knew the truth, you couldn’t utter lies that would deeply wound. Surely, a droplet of sincerity would seep through.</p>



<p>I shifted my position, prompting a surprised reaction from Chitose.</p>



<p>“Hey, are you listening to my stupid talk?”</p>



<p>“I just turned my body sideways.”</p>



<p>“Quit with the technicalities.”</p>



<p>“The heat has surely died down by now.”</p>



<p>“It’s still a smoldering fire.”</p>



<p>“Want me to blow it out?”</p>



<p>“Please stop with the suggestive remarks.”</p>



<p>“Add fuel to the fire!”</p>



<p>“It’s over, seriously.”</p>



<p>At those words tossed like spoons, laughter burst forth, our breaths fluttering and dancing in the quiet corners of the night.</p>



<p>Beautiful breaths, a beautiful voice, a beautiful smile, and beautiful you, resolute in confirming the contours that was nearly lost, I gently enfolded them into my heart, careful not to tarnish them this time.</p>



<p>After this brief moment, I leaned softly onto Chitose’s chest. Shifting slightly, I searched for a comfortable position, and Chitose, without uttering anything, softly encircled me, his arms more like a comforting wrap than a mere embrace.</p>



<p>Either way, this night was one where we couldn’t revert to being just a man and a woman.</p>



<p>Listening to the calm, steady heartbeat, I opened my mouth. “Our school festival has begun, right?”</p>



<p>“Our first and last one.”</p>



<p>“Will you stroll around with me at the cultural festival?”</p>



<p>“Of course. Shall we try to find some apple candy that isn’t poisoned?”</p>



<p>I gently placed my hand on Chitose’s chest. “Before naming it…”</p>



<p>“Before giving it a name…”</p>



<p>Feeling the warmth beneath my fingertips, I recalled a story I heard about his talk with Kurasen.</p>



<p><em>“Choosing a way of life, huh…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Deciding who you want to be with and how you want to live—a beautiful excuse for love, don’t you think?”</em></p>



<p>Now, as the current me, returned to Nanase Yuzuki, I found myself resonating with those words once again. If choosing a man was a choice in defining my way of life…</p>



<p>──How did Nanase Yuzuki want to be with Chitose Saku?</p>



<p>Then, gently holding onto Chitose’s shirt, I thought about him.</p>



<p>──How would Chitose Saku want to be next to Nanase Yuzuki?</p>



<p>Quietly, the closed night deepened. The moonlight pouring through the window projected our entwined shadows like a silver screen. Similar entities blinked, overlapping as our eyes met.</p>



<p>As you gently combed through my hair, the dimness danced softly. Our breathing synchronized, and the swelling emotions in our chests swayed like a cradle.</p>



<p>The violet mark left on your neck transitioned into a poignant mixture of your blue and my red. Our entwined fingers behind the curtain continued to seek each other in a discreet dance of kisses, yet our vows remained unbound.</p>



<p>We turned our backs to the night that refused to drown us and embraced the night where we succumbed.</p>



<p>Like peeling the layers of a poisoned apple, like bidding farewell to crawling stars in the night, you dye the destiny lines you traced with a vivid red.</p>



<p><em>Mirror, mirror…</em></p>



<p><em>──If I were the serene moon.</em><sup data-fn="0c10c21c-9456-4612-922a-9f2676001e82" class="fn"><a href="#0c10c21c-9456-4612-922a-9f2676001e82" id="0c10c21c-9456-4612-922a-9f2676001e82-link">1</a></sup></p>
