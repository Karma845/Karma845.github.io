<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 2: The Summer When Something Changes </h2>


<p>Summer has finally begun. The infamous, sweltering summer of Kyoto.</p>
<p>When the rainy season cleared in July, I felt like the students started to get excited all of a sudden. After the Friday seminar, I could hear the fulfilled ones in the lab, talking about going to summer festivals or to the beach. I have no connection to such things.</p>
<p>Nanase seemed to be discreetly reapplying her lipstick a little away from the circle. I could see her smiling at the small hand mirror.</p>
<p>Even though it’s not a smile directed at me, I couldn’t help but feel a thump in my chest.</p>
<p>“Hey! Nanase, won’t you come to the beach with us?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kinami shouted in a voice that echoed through the lab. Nanase, who was suddenly addressed, flinched and responded in a high-pitched voice,</p>
<p>“W-what!? Uh, the beach!?”</p>
<p>“We’re talking about going to the beach during the summer break. Let’s go, Nanase!”</p>
<p>Nanase looked around with a panicked expression and then shook her head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Sorry… I, the beach is a bit…”</p>
<p>“Oh, then how about the pool?”</p>
<p>“I, I… um, that’s right, I can’t swim!”</p>
<p>As Nanase stuttered, Kinami burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“No, but even if we go to the beach or pool, we don’t have to swim, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase tilted her head, “Is that so?” wondering what exactly they do there.</p>
<p>She probably doesn’t know how the fulfilled ones enjoy the beach or pool. I don’t know either, for that matter.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s fine if you can’t swim! I’ll teach you step by step…”</p>
<p>“Yusuke, you’re persistent. You just want to see Haruko in a swimsuit, right?”</p>
<p>Sudo said that and lightly hit the back of Kinami’s head. Kinami didn’t seem to be offended, and just laughed, “Was it that obvious?”</p>
<p>… I thought as much.</p>
<p>However, going to the beach with seminar friends would be the very picture of the rosy summer Nanase aspires to. Why did she turn it down?</p>
<p>Nanase glanced at me, perhaps noticing my gaze.</p>
<p>She waved her hand slightly, and I gestured to her, “Don’t look over here.”</p>
<p>On my way to the bicycle parking area after the fourth period, I spotted Nanase from behind.</p>
<p>Her chestnut-colored long hair was tied up high, and large earrings dangled from her ears. Her outfit was somehow refreshing and summery. I was impressed by how she dresses stylishly in the summer.</p>
<p>My summer attire is basically just T-shirts.</p>
<p>I had been keeping my distance but suddenly, Nanase turned her head and looked around.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is Sagara-kun after all!”</p>
<p>“Whoa. What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I just had a feeling you were there.”</p>
<p>I pride myself on having a low presence, but how does Nanase always notice me?</p>
<p>Since Nanase stopped, I had no choice but to stand next to her. Then I asked her.</p>
<p>“…Nanase. You were invited to go to the beach today. You should have gone.”</p>
<p>“No, absolutely not! No way!”</p>
<p>Nanase’s voice was almost a scream. Surprised by her extreme rejection, I wondered what was so bad about it.</p>
<p>“Is it because you don’t want to be seen in a swimsuit?”</p>
<p>Well, I also think she shouldn’t show her swimsuit to someone like Kinami. Nanase mumbled, “That too,” and then said,</p>
<p>“…The beach, the pool… if I think about my makeup coming off at such places… I’d rather die than show everyone my bare face.”</p>
<p>…Ah. So that’s the reason.</p>
<p>It seems Nanase is excessively afraid of her bare face being exposed to those around her.</p>
<p>I think her bare face isn’t that bad. There are probably quite a few guys who prefer it that way.</p>
<p>Not that I’m one of them or anything.</p>
<p>“By the way, Nanase, do you have any plans for the summer break? You’re always with Sudo and the rest… It doesn’t seem like you’ve made any progress.”</p>
<p>Perhaps I hit the nail on the head, as Nanase pressed her chest and slumped down dejectedly.</p>
<p>“Plans for the summer break… I don’t have any. Maybe I’ll just go home for Obon.”</p>
<p>“…Huh.”</p>
<p>“But, you know. I do have something I want to do this summer! There’s a café near my apartment that has a tropical parfait for the summer, and I’m going to eat it!”</p>
<p>The goal she declared so proudly turned out to be surprisingly modest. I couldn’t help but feel deflated.</p>
<p>“Just go and have it now…”</p>
<p>“But, I don’t have the courage to order a parfait by myself.”</p>
<p>Nanase stopped mid-sentence, then lit up with an idea and exclaimed, “That’s right!” I had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun! Let’s go and have a parfait together right now!”</p>
<p>…I knew she’d say that.</p>
<p>“Why does it come to this…”</p>
<p>“Please! Eating a tropical parfait is my first step towards a rosy life!”</p>
<p>Nanase put her hands together in front of her face and pleaded desperately.</p>
<p>Somehow, I felt like I was being persuaded by some strange logic, but when she said, “You said you’d help, right?” I found it impossible to refuse.</p>
<p>“…I’ve got a part-time job tonight… I’m going home right after this.”</p>
<p>Nanase cheered “Yay!” and, humming a clumsy tune, straddled her bicycle.</p>
<p>With her ponytail fluttering, she rode off on her red bike, looking dashing, and I reluctantly followed her.</p>
<p>We arrived at a cafe with a calm atmosphere. It wasn’t as noisy as the chain coffee shops, and it seemed like a place students could easily frequent.</p>
<p>When we opened the solid wooden door, a bell chimed with a “clang-clang.” The aromatic scent of coffee tantalized my nostrils.</p>
<p>“Welcome! How many in your party?”</p>
<p>We were greeted by a young woman staff member, who looked slightly older than us.</p>
<p>Nanase, with a slightly tense expression, answered “Two.” We sat down across from each other at a window-side table.</p>
<p>The sofa was fluffy and comfortable. I could live here, it’s that cozy.</p>
<p>“See? The person just now, she was beautiful, wasn’t she?”</p>
<p>Nanase said, seemingly entranced. Apparently, she was referring to the female staff member we had just encountered.</p>
<p>Glancing back to confirm, indeed, she was a beauty. The tear mole by her eyes was distinctive, and she had a certain sensuality about her.</p>
<p>She seemed strong-willed, and I felt she had an aura similar to Sudo’s. I think Nanase is more beautiful, but I guess it’s a matter of preference.</p>
<p>“I sometimes come to this cafe to study. It’s quiet and stylish, and I really like it here.”</p>
<p>Nanase handed me the menu, and as I unfolded it, I saw that a single cup of coffee cost six hundred yen.</p>
<p>To someone like me, who usually drinks cheap, carton-packed coffee, that price was enough to make my head spin.</p>
<p>“Look, this is it! The summer limited tropical parfait!”</p>
<p>When Nanase pointed to the price of the parfait, an involuntary “Wow” escaped my lips.</p>
<p>“That’s expensive. Can’t believe paying so much for just a parfait. I’ll stick with coffee.”</p>
<p>Seeing Nanase’s face fall at my words, I immediately regretted it. It seems I had inadvertently poured cold water on her pure excitement about the parfait.</p>
<p>“…Then, I’ll have the parfait. Excuse me, could I place my order?”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled forlornly and called over the server. Having missed the chance to apologize, I silently sipped my iced water.</p>
<p>After a while, my coffee and Nanase’s tropical parfait arrived. The parfait was topped with a lavish amount of colorful fruits.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s cute!”</p>
<p>Nanase exclaimed with joy. It looked delicious, but I can’t quite understand the feeling of calling food “cute.” Girls seem to be creatures that incessantly call everything “cute.”</p>
<p>After taking a photo, Nanase carefully inserted her spoon into the parfait that seemed difficult to eat.</p>
<p>“Mmm, it’s really delicious!”</p>
<p>Nanase said, smiling happily. Having spent quite some time with her, I’ve realized that Nanase is incredibly expressive with her emotions.</p>
<p>Happiness and joy; her positive feelings are openly displayed. That’s a part of her that makes watching her never dull, a perfect slice of life in action.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been curious about this parfait but ordering one alone seemed to require a bit of courage. Ahh, I’m so glad I finally got to eat it.”</p>
<p>For her, this parfait must hold a value beyond 1,500 yen.</p>
<p>Since what people value varies from one person to another, I shouldn’t have said anything unnecessary.</p>


<p>I took a sip of my coffee without adding sugar or milk.</p>
<p>It had a deep aroma that was different from instant coffee.</p>
<p>Since it cost six hundred yen, I might as well savor it to the fullest.</p>
<p>Despite it being a weekday, the cafe was crowded, and the staff were bustling around hectically.</p>
<p>Nanase paused and looked at a “Staff Wanted” sign on the wall, murmuring to herself.</p>
<p>“They’re looking for part-timers here…”</p>
<p>I remember Nanase mentioning that she didn’t have any part-time jobs.</p>
<p>To me, part-time work is just a means to earn money, but for many students, it isn’t just that. Expanding one’s social circle beyond university could be a good thing for Nanase, who is aiming for a rosy university life.</p>
<p>“Why not give it a try? You might as well start a part-time job.”</p>
<p>At my words, Nanase’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Then, she looked down unconfidently and poked at her parfait’s ice cream with her spoon.</p>
<p>“But… everyone there is so sparkly, and it might not suit me…”</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of sparkly crowd you’re aiming to get along with, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Plus, I’ve never worked part-time before… I wonder if I can handle customer service.”</p>
<p>“Customer service can be surprisingly manageable. The important thing is not to let your emotions get the best of you”</p>
<p>I’ve been working at a convenience store for two months now, and I think I’ve been doing pretty well, despite my lack of friendliness. I initially had a strong aversion to it, but it’s not so bad once you can handle your emotion. There aren’t many customers who expect excessive communication from convenience store clerks. Well, the quality of customer service at a cafe might be different from a convenience store.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll try practicing a bit.”</p>
<p>After clearing her throat a few times, Nanase straightened her back. She looked straight at me and smiled.</p>
<p>“Welcome!”</p>
<p>When I remained silent, Nanase looked embarrassed and urged me to say something with her lips pursed.</p>
<p>Snapping back to reality, I took a sip of my coffee to disguise my reaction.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Really? Do you think I can do it?”</p>
<p>“You’re suited for it… I think. Nanase, you’re hardworking, have a good memory, and you’re friendly. You’re the type who could probably do well in any workplace.”</p>
<p>After all, there would be plenty of customers who would pay six hundred yen for coffee if they could be served by a clerk like her.</p>
<p>What people value varies from person to person.</p>
<p>Nanase had been looking down in thought, but after a while, she seemed to make up her mind and looked up.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun. I’ll try applying for the job! Thank you. I’ll give you this parfait as a thank you for pushing me forward. It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Nanase handed me a spoon. I took it impulsively and then wondered if this was what they call an indirect kiss. Am I the only one who cares about this because I’m a loner?</p>
<p>…Well, it doesn’t matter. She probably isn’t thinking about anything like that.</p>
<p>With a sense of resignation, I scooped up some peach, cream, and ice cream with the spoon and took a bite. It’s probably delicious, but I couldn’t really taste it.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Smiling, I handed the spoon back to Nanase. She took it with an unperturbed face and continued eating her parfait.</p>
<p>I took another sip of my coffee, trying to hide my agitation. Somehow, my body temperature had risen, and I regretted not ordering iced coffee instead.</p>
<p>And then, a few days later, Nanase, having finished her job interview, came to my room and gave a peace sign, saying, “I got the job!” If this helps her world expand and brings her one step closer to a rosy university life, then paying six hundred yen for that coffee was worth it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gion Matsuri is a summer tradition in Kyoto.</p>
<p>Once July arrives, floats called yamaboko line up along Shijo Street and Kawaramachi Street in the heart of Kyoto, and the sounds of Gion Bayashi echo through the air.</p>
<p>On July 17, there is an event called Yamaboko Junko, where the yamaboko parade through the streets of Kyoto. From the 14th to the 16th at night, the evenings are called Yoiyama, with many stalls lining the main streets. When students in Kyoto say they’re going to Gion Matsuri, they usually mean this Yoiyama.</p>

<p>…That’s what I heard from Tsugumi-chan, a Kyoto native girl.</p>
<p>Wearing a yukata and going to Gion Matsuri with a boyfriend seems to be a status symbol for Kyoto girls.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, hastily made couples seem to increase before Gion Matsuri, or so they say.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s super crowded, so there’s a high chance they’ll just end up fighting and breaking up.”</p>
<p>While Tsugumi-chan explained, I sipped my Frappuccino and nodded with a “hmm.” There’s no way for me to verify how accurate her story is. It might even be slightly prejudiced.</p>
<p>The first Sunday of July. The rainy season hasn’t officially ended, but it’s a clear, sunny day.</p>
<p>Tsugumi-chan had invited me out shopping. There are youth-oriented fashion buildings in Shijo Kawaramachi, Kyoto’s downtown area, and the pre-summer sales had already begun.</p>
<p>I fell in love with a blouse but gave up on buying it due to its not-so-cute price.</p>
<p>Shopping is definitely fun. It would be even more enjoyable with money.</p>
<p>After shopping, we entered a coffee shop near Sanjo Bridge. The limited-time peach Frappuccino had a refreshing aftertaste and was delicious. But, it was quite pricey. I’m sure if I told Sagara-kun the price, he’d make a face and say, “You could order a set meal at Kaifuutei and still get change.” I smiled a little at the thought.</p>
<p>But no matter what Sagara-kun thinks, a limited-time Frappuccino shared with a friend is priceless to me.</p>
<p>The Kamogawa River outside the shop reflects the relentless sunlight.</p>
<p>“Couples sitting at equal intervals along the riverside” is a typical scene at Kamogawa, but in this scorching heat, I think it looks hot before feeling any longing for it. Still, some couples sit closely together, showing impressive perseverance.</p>
<p>“Haru-chan, are you going to Gion Matsuri?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t really have any plans…”</p>
<p>When I answered, Tsugumi-chan said, “I see,” and sipped her Frappuccino through a straw. To tell the truth, I’d like to go to Gion Matsuri.</p>
<p>I had never participated in local festivals before. I listened to my classmates planning to go to festivals with a face that said I wasn’t interested. I really wanted to wear a cute yukata with friends, take pictures, eat candied apples, and enjoy an extraordinary atmosphere.</p>
<p>If it were Sacchan, she’d casually suggest, “Let’s go together,” in situations like this.</p>
<p>Even three months after entering university, I still find it hard to invite friends out. The fear of being rejected crosses my mind, and I hesitate.</p>
<p>Even today’s shopping trip came about because Tsugumi-chan invited me.</p>
<p>But if I really want to pursue a rosy university life, perhaps I should be the one to proactively reach out. Sagara-kun would probably tell me to invite them myself if he were here.</p>
<p>Gathering my courage, I opened my mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tsugumi-chan…”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. I wonder if Sacchan is going to Gion Matsuri with Hiroki-kun. I heard Hiroki-kun was planning to ask her out.”</p>
<p>My mustered courage was crushed, and I swallowed the words I was about to say. I sipped the almost-melted Frappuccino and asked,</p>
<p>“Why, Houjo-kun?”</p>
<p>“It seems like they’re on the countdown. They’re likely to start dating soon.”</p>
<p>I covered my mouth with one hand in surprise. Houjo-kun and Sacchan get along well, but they said it wasn’t like that. Was I the only one who wasn’t informed?</p>
<p>Seeing my shocked reaction, Tsugumi-chan hurriedly tried to reassure me.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t hear it directly from Sacchan. It just seems like they’re getting along well.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>Sacchan and Houjo-kun dating. They do make a good match and would probably be a wonderful couple. But it’s a little shocking. I want to be happy for them, but it feels lonely.</p>
<p>If Sacchan is going to Gion Matsuri with Houjo-kun, maybe it would be a bother if I invited her. Tsugumi-chan and Nami-chan have boyfriends too, so maybe it’s better if I don’t say anything unnecessary…</p>
<p>“Hey, hey Haru-chan. Can we go back to that store later? I can’t forget the dress I didn’t end up buying.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure! I want to take another look at that blouse too!”</p>
<p>After going back to the fashion building with Tsugumi-chan, I ended up buying the cute blouse with the not-so-cute price.</p>
<p>For a while, I’ll follow Sagara-kun’s lead and live frugally, deciding to increase my shifts at my part-time job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>There is a chain convenience store where I work part-time near Shijo Shinmachi, the center of the Gion Festival.</p>
<p>Normally, I’m stationed at a store a bit further away, but today I was called in for backup.</p>
<p>“You can enjoy the atmosphere of the Gion Matsuri; it’ll be fun. Do your best, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>That’s what the manager said as she sent me off, but honestly, I’m not enjoying it at all.</p>
<p>The Yoiyama of Gion Matsuri was three times more crowded than I had imagined.</p>
<p>Between the floats and food stalls, a sea of people writhed and squirmed. It was so packed that walking properly seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Just looking at it was suffocating. Amidst the sounds of the Gion Bayashi, the voice of a girl rings out, “How about some chimaki?”</p>
<p>Normally bustling with cars, Karasuma Street has now become a pedestrian paradise.</p>
<p>Drenched in sweat, I stood in front of a stall right outside the convenience store. Fried chicken and bottled drinks were set at prices significantly higher than usual.</p>
<p>It’s a cheeky strategy to take full advantage of the Gion Matsuri.</p>
<p>It’s so hot. Less than an hour has gone by, and I’m already yearning for the cool, air-conditioned inside of the store.</p>
<p>I even endure the heat in my own room without turning on the AC, and yet, here I am suffering the heat at my part-time job too.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. I’d like to buy this.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a woman wearing a red yukata approached to buy a drink.</p>
<p>I took the thousand-yen bill, handed over the change and the bottled drink. Mustered the bare minimum of friendliness, I bowed my head and said, “Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>The woman smiled and returned to the person who seemed to be her friend. As I watched her nape peeking out from her yukata collar, I thought it wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p>I told Nanase otherwise, but the truth is, I quite like yukatas.</p>
<p>They have this indescribable sexiness despite the minimal exposure. Women in yukatas appear thirty percent more beautiful, I believe.</p>
<p>I have no intention of diving into the crowd, nor do I plan to spend money on ridiculously overpriced night stalls, and I was getting a bit tired of the ever-present Gion Bayashi, but that doesn’t mean I dislike the Gion Matsuri itself. Being able to see many women in yukatas is quite a pleasure.</p>
<p>It’s now half-past nine. I wonder if Nanase is walking around somewhere in her yukata at this moment.</p>
<p>──I’m looking forward to Gion Matsuri. Houjo-kun and Kinami-kun are coming too.</p>
<p>That’s what Nanase said when we met at university yesterday.</p>
<p>By the way, it seemed like Kinami took a liking to her. I bet he’s overjoyed seeing Nanase in a yukata. A feeling of irritation mixed with envy wells up inside me.</p>
<p>Just then, my smartphone in my pocket vibrated. Sneaking a peek at the display, I saw a LINE message notification. It’s from Houjo.</p>
<p>[“Good work.”]</p>
<p>[“I’ll share a photo of Nanase in her yukata with you!”]</p>
<p>Then came a notification: [“A photo has been sent.”].</p>
<p>What is he thinking? Sending me that photo, does he expect me to be happy? If so, that’s a huge misunderstanding.</p>
<p>But as if driven by something, I opened the LINE app. It’s not that I’m interested, but now that it’s been sent, I have to check it.</p>
<p>I opened the chat room with Houjo, and below the message, there should have been a photo of Nanase in her yukata──but there wasn’t.</p>
<p>No matter how long I waited, it just kept loading.</p>
<p>…Come on, my smartphone, work harder!</p>
<p>Apparently, due to the dense crowd, the signal was very poor. The budget carrier I’ve contracted with is known for slower data speeds, and my phone model is a few generations old. Damn, maybe it’s time for an upgrade…</p>
<p>Feeling let down, I slumped my shoulders. That’s when someone patted me on the back.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, good work.”</p>
<p>“Ah, good work to you too.”</p>
<p>It was my senior at work, Kazuha Itogawa.</p>
<p>She’s a third-year student in the Faculty of Economics at the same university as me. A beautiful woman with an active vibe and short bob cut, she’s kind and takes good care of others.</p>
<p>Normally, she works at the same store as me, but it seems she was also called in for reinforcement today.</p>
<p>“You can take a one-hour break, okay? Make sure you hydrate since it’s hot.”</p>
<p>Today’s shift is a long eight-hour haul, with a one-hour break in between. Relieved that I could finally escape the heat, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“By the way, Sagara-kun, you’re not from Kyoto, right? Don’t you want to enjoy the Gion Matsuri?”</p>
<p>“…No, I’m good.”</p>
<p>Just looking at this crowd is enough to make me feel full. I was about to head back inside to the store’s backyard to rest when a woman in a yukata caught my eye.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see her face, but I thought she looked beautiful. More than anything, she had good posture. Her yukata was dark blue with white morning glory patterns, and her red obi was neatly tied around her waist. Her chestnut hair was tied up, with some strands loosely waved. The nape of her neck peeking out from her collar was delicate and shockingly white.</p>
<p>As I absentmindedly stared, the woman slowly turned towards me.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00005-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Our eyes met, and she lifted her red lips into a smile.</p>
<p>Standing there was an exceptionally beautiful woman, not betraying any expectations.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Startled by my name being called, I came to my senses. She was waving at me with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>“I was surprised. What are you doing in a place like this?”</p>
<p>The yukata beauty was none other than Nanase. Clack-clacking her geta, she hurried over to me. Tilting her head slightly, the floral ornament in her hair swayed.</p>
<p>“…Ah… I’m working.”</p>
<p>I managed to reply at last. Noticing my voice was hoarse, I swallowed. My throat had become parched without me realizing it.</p>
<p>“…What about you? What are you doing here alone?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t see Sudo or Houjo around her. Nanase smiled with her eyebrows lowered.</p>
<p>“That’s the thing, I got separated. I just got in touch with them, so I’m about to meet up. I think they said they’re near the Naginataboko float.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>“What’s this? She’s super pretty. Is she, by any chance, your girlfriend, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Itogawa-san teased me, nudging me with her elbow.</p>
<p>I hastily denied, “No, she’s not.”</p>
<p>“We’re in the same seminar at university.”</p>
<p>Nanase responded with a smile, not seeming to take any offense. Itogawa-san’s interpretation of our relationship was ambiguous, with a teasing grin on her face.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun. You’re about to take a break, so why don’t you go enjoy the festival with her for a bit?”</p>
<p>“Really? If you don’t mind, let’s go together for a little while!”</p>
<p>Nanase said cheerfully, clasping her hands in front of her chest.</p>
<p>That’s out of the question. Walking around with Nanase in her yukata would definitely lead to misunderstandings if someone saw us.</p>
<p>I was about to refuse when Itogawa-san chimed in.</p>
<p>“Besides, it’s dangerous for such a cute girl to walk alone; she might get picked up by some random guy. Don’t take Gion Matsuri lightly.”</p>
<p>“…Uh.”</p>
<p>That might indeed be a possibility. In fact, there was a pair of men not too far away, sneakily glancing at Nanase.</p>
<p>…It seems I won’t be able to rest in a cool place just yet.</p>
<p>“…My break is just an hour. I’ll go with you to where Sudo and the others are and then come back.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s face lit up, and she nodded with a “Yeah!” I steeled myself and dove into the crowd with her.</p>


<p>360° degrees, everywhere I look it’s people, people, and people.</p>
<p>The walls of people make it difficult to walk straight. It’s already sweltering, and the heat makes it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>From Shinmachi Street, where the convenience store is located, to where Sudo and the others are, it would normally take less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>But with this crowd, it’s hard to move forward as I want to.</p>
<p>I could feel Nanase, walking half a step behind me, grabbing the hem of my T-shirt tightly. For a moment, my heart skipped a beat. When I turned around, she looked at me with an apologetic face.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I don’t want to get lost again…”</p>
<p>“…Well, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s forehead was slightly sweaty, and her cheeks were redder than usual, probably because of the heat. A sigh escaped from her slightly parted lips. I felt strangely affected.</p>
<p>Noticing my gaze, Nanase started fiddling with her bangs uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Is, is my face okay? Is my makeup smeared? Are my eyelashes still on?”</p>
<p>“…You look the same as always.”</p>
<p>As if reassuring myself, I responded. Nanase murmured with relief, “That’s good.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I never thought it would be this crowded… Ah! I wanted to try a candied apple! Sagara-kun, can I buy one?”</p>
<p>Nanase raised her voice excitedly, pulling on the hem of my shirt. Reluctantly, I followed her to the candied apple stall.</p>
<p>“One, please.”</p>
<p>“Here ya go, thank you!”</p>
<p>The candied apple stuck on a chopstick cost five hundred yen.</p>
<p>It was a rip-off price, I thought, but seeing Nanase’s eyes sparkle as she received the candied apple, I held back any unnecessary comments.</p>
<p>A giant float could be seen in the distance, illuminated by the festival lights, shrouded in an extraordinary atmosphere.</p>
<p>The girl walking next to me still held onto the hem of my shirt with one hand.</p>
<p>Just that alone made me feel so restless – maybe because she was dressed differently than usual.</p>
<p>“I’ve never had a candied apple before. I always thought it looked beautiful… so this is what it tastes like.”</p>
<p>Nanase muttered to herself. It was a small voice, almost drowned out by the noise of the festival.</p>
<p>“I never went to a local summer festival in my hometown. I didn’t have friends.”</p>
<p>“…Huh.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I got to wear a yukata and come to the festival with friends. I guess it was good that I tried hard. Thank you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. Surely Nanase wasn’t expecting a reply.</p>
<p>By the time Nanase finished her candied apple, we had arrived at the Naginataboko float.</p>
<p>A woman in a bright light blue yukata was waving wildly; it must be Sudo. Next to her was Houjo. It was good that they managed to meet up safely. With this, my role was completed.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to work now. See ya.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun… wait, wait a minute.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Um, well, you see. I, my…”</p>
<p>Just as Nanase started to speak,</p>
<p>“Nanase! Finally found you!”</p>
<p>A male voice rang out from not too far away. Parting the crowd, Kinami rushed over. Nanase’s face tightened slightly, and she gripped my shirt harder.</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>She mumbled a vague “Uh, um…” before I could press her.</p>
<p>“Do you not like Kinami by any chance?”</p>
<p>Nanase gave a wry smile and nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Well, I had somewhat guessed it. It’s unfortunate for Kinami who seemed to have feelings for her, but he was uncooperative even in group work, so it’s his own doing.</p>
<p>“Kyah!”</p>
<p>Before Kinami could reach us, a tall man bumped into Nanase.</p>
<p>Before I could ask if she was okay──Nanase suddenly flung herself into my chest. The pure white nape of her neck was right before my eyes, and my heart felt like it was flipping over.</p>
<p>“Nanase.”</p>
<p>The girl with her face buried in my chest smelled unbelievably good despite being sweaty. My hands, with nowhere to go, roamed aimlessly in the air.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“My eyelashes.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“My false eyelashes fell off…”</p>
<p>Nanase said in a fading voice. It seemed that the fake eyelashes glued to her eyelids had come off when she bumped into the tall man. I let out an exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>“Who cares about some eyelashes…”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t! It makes a huge difference with or without them! What should I do? I absolutely can’t let anyone see me like this.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s shoulders were shaking. I couldn’t understand it, but the presence or absence of lashes on her eyelids seemed to be a very serious and important matter for her.</p>
<p>While I was wondering what to do, Kinami had arrived right in front of us. He saw Nanase, who seemed to be hugging me (from his perspective), and furrowed his brows suspiciously.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I thought who’s that with Nanase…”</p>
<p>“…We just happened to meet here.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. What’s up with Nanase?”</p>
<p>“…She seems to be feeling unwell.”</p>
<p>I said, trying to sidestep the issue, and Kinami expressed concern with, “Really?”</p>
<p>“Nanase, are you okay? Should we go somewhere to rest?”</p>
<p>Kinami reached out to Nanase, who still had her face buried in my chest. Nanase’s shoulders jolted, and the hand gripping my shirt trembled.</p>
<p>Before Kinami’s intrusive hand could touch her, I forcefully knocked it away.</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Kinami was obviously annoyed by my sudden action. He glared at me with dissatisfaction, but for Nanase’s sake, I couldn’t back down.</p>
<p>“…I’ll take her. That’s okay, right, Nanase?”</p>
<p>Nanase nodded silently, over and over. As we walked away, I could hear a sullen “What’s with him” from behind. I might have made an unnecessary enemy, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sagara-kun took me to the toilet at Shijo Subway Station. I fixed my false eyelashes firmly, touched up my foundation, and reapplied my blush and lipstick.</p>
<p>Finally, with a decent face, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>That was close. It really was a crisis. The thought of being seen by Sacchan and the others with that face sends shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun cleverly handled the situation and took me away.</p>
<p>I remember hugging him and my cheeks grow hot.</p>
<p>By the way, he was on his work break. He needs to get back soon.</p>
<p>I hurried out of the restroom, and there was Sagara-kun, leaning against a pillar, looking spaced out.</p>
<p>I noticed him glancing at a passing woman in a yukata, and I couldn’t help feeling a little put off.</p>
<p>──Do you like yukatas, Sagara-kun?</p>
<p>──Not really.</p>
<p>I’m starting to realize that Sagara-kun actually likes women in yukatas. His “not really” is synonymous with “yes.”</p>
<p>I checked my face once more with my compact mirror and made sure my yukata’s obi hadn’t come undone. I called out to him with a loud voice.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Finally, Sagara-kun turned towards me. For a moment, he squinted as if he saw something dazzling. I rushed to him, conscious of my yukata’s hem.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. You really saved me, Sagara-kun. My university life almost ended right there… Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating.”</p>
<p>Sagara-kun shrugged in exasperation</p>
<p>“Well, I’m going back for real this time.”</p>
<p>As he started to walk away, I found myself involuntarily grabbing the hem of his shirt.</p>


<p>Sagara-kun turned back with a look of reluctance.</p>
<p>“Um, just one thing. Do I look good in my yukata? Is it… cute?”</p>
<p>I had wanted to ask him that question ever since we ran into each other by chance earlier today.</p>
<p>Even when choosing the yukata and doing my hair, I had unconsciously thought about what Sagara-kun might like.</p>
<p>All my other friends had complimented me, saying it was cute, but I desperately wanted to know what he really thought.</p>
<p>With a feeling akin to prayer, I awaited his response. Sagara-kun’s face quickly turned grumpy.</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>I know. His “Not really” is synonymous with a yes.</p>
<p>Despite his hard-to-read response, I couldn’t help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late July, with the end of the rainy season, came the time for mid-term exams at the university.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun. You’ve been looking a bit pale lately, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>Nanase, who had come to deliver dinner as usual, said with concern.</p>
<p>While accepting the plate piled high with cold Chinese noodles, I replied, “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Nanase muttered, “Is that so…” and tilted her head in doubt.</p>
<p>The regularity of Nanase bringing dinner had become part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>However, I had not forgotten to be grateful.</p>
<p>“…Thanks. This helps.”</p>
<p>“No problem! Sorry for the simple meal.”</p>
<p>Though Nanase said that, it was far from simple. The cucumber, ham, and eggs were beautifully shredded, and it was topped with a delicious sesame dressing.</p>
<p>I prefer sesame dressing over soy sauce dressing.</p>
<p>Even during the exam period, it seems Nanase has been cooking properly for herself.</p>
<p>Cold Chinese noodles are a blessing in this blisteringly hot weather.</p>
<p>I was running out of the bargain-priced somen I’d bought in bulk and had been wondering what to do.</p>
<p>“You’ve been working part-time every day recently, right? Are you sure you’re okay with exams coming up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>I’m diligent with my classes and have no issues with attendance points. I’ve also already submitted my report assignments.</p>
<p>All that’s left are the written exams.</p>
<p>Most students reduce their part-time hours to study for exams. Nanase, who had started working at a cafe, mentioned she hasn’t been taking many shifts lately.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t afford to do the same. Cutting back on shifts means less pay, and living paycheck to paycheck, that’s a matter of survival for me.</p>
<p>So, despite the upcoming exams, I’ve been working almost every day. The manager appreciates it because it’s a busy time with fewer hands on deck.</p>
<p>Still, I can’t afford not to study. Failing a course is out of the question, and for the sake of my future, I want to get the best grades possible.</p>
<p>I have no intention of skipping classes, so, as a result, I have to cut back on sleep.</p>
<p>…Well, either way. It’s not like I can sleep well in this unbearably hot apartment anyway.</p>
<p>“You’ve got serious bags under your eyes. Aren’t you sleeping much?”</p>
<p>“…I can’t sleep. It’s too hot…”</p>
<p>I still haven’t turned on the air conditioning in my room, trying to endure the heat.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can make it through the summer with just a fan.</p>
<p>Nanase looked at me in dismay and shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>“Hey, maybe it’s time to give in and turn on the AC… you’ll ruin your health.”</p>
<p>But I stubbornly shook my head.</p>
<p>“No. I’m fine. I can still manage.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, you’re stubborn about the strangest things… What are you fighting against?”</p>
<p>If I had to say, it would be against myself.</p>
<p>“Anyway, get back to your room. You need to study too.”</p>
<p>With that, I pushed her back and Nanase turned around as if being pulled by her hair.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Sagara-kun. If anything comes up, rely on me right away. We’re neighbors, after all.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. I won’t trouble you.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean!”</p>
<p>I half-forced Nanase out of the room, still seeming like she had more to say.</p>
<p>After the door closed, suddenly, I felt a wave of exhaustion hit me.</p>
<p>I still had a part-time job today, and after eating the cold Chinese noodles, I decided to take a quick nap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walking towards the university library, I listened to the annoying buzz of cicadas in the blazing sun. I took a towel handkerchief out of my basket bag to wipe the sweat beading on my forehead and checked my makeup with a compact mirror to see if it had smudged.</p>
<p>It was the end of July. With the mid-term exams just a week away, the campus suddenly seemed more crowded.</p>
<p>Everyone skips lectures but still fervently wants the credits. They hurriedly check the exam scope and copy lecture notes borrowed from someone else.</p>
<p>I’ve had several acquaintances ask to copy my notes, too. It’s fine by me, but if they’d attended class regularly, they wouldn’t need to panic now.</p>
<p>With the exams a week away, I, of course, have been diligently studying.</p>
<p>Today, too, I planned to study in the cool, quiet library. I’m aiming for the highest grades. I’ve been punctual and present for every class, and I’ve completed my report assignments perfectly.</p>
<p>There’s no failure.</p>
<p>By the way, I wonder if Sagara-kun has been studying properly, since he’s been working part-time every day even before the exams. He’s been looking pale lately, and whenever we pass each other at university, he seems very tired. Maybe he’s suffering from summer fatigue.</p>
<p>I remember his words, “I won’t trouble you,” and feel frustrated because that’s not what I meant.</p>
<p>No matter how close I think we’ve become, Sagara-kun fundamentally doesn’t seem to open his heart to me. If I try to cross a certain line, he quickly distances himself.</p>
<p>──I don’t want to let anyone into my world. I’d rather not allocate resources to troublesome human relationships. So as much as possible, I prefer not to interact with others.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought he was just being stubborn . But perhaps his solitary life is something deeper.</p>
<p>As I thought about this, I arrived at the library. In front of the library, a group of five or six boys and girls were hanging around.</p>
<p>One of them, a tall boy, noticed me and waved with a smile. It was Houjo-kun.</p>
<p>I waved back lightly, and Houjo-kun came jogging over.</p>
<p>“Hey, Nanase. Going to study at the library?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. What about you, Houjo-kun?”</p>
<p>“Just hanging out with the guys from the club. It’s so damn hot, we were thinking of moving.”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun’s companions seemed to be from the futsal club. He has many acquaintances in other faculties and seems to have many friends of both genders.</p>
<p>According to Sacchan, he’s incredibly popular. I suppose his university life must be rosy, I thought.</p>
<p>“Nanase, you got a minute?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, sure…”</p>
<p>“Then, wanna grab some ice cream? I’ll treat.”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by his sudden invitation, I was flustered. Although I had some interactions with Houjo-kun, we had rarely talked alone. What could he be intending?</p>
<p>While I was bewildered, Houjo-kun said, “Let’s go,” and headed for the convenience store inside the university.</p>
<p>I hurriedly followed him.</p>


<p>After buying ice cream at the convenience store, we casually took our seats on a bench in the coffee corner. I chose a 100-yen biscuit sandwich ice cream</p>
<p>Houjo-kun laughed, “Nanase, you’re modest, huh? You could have picked something more expensive.”</p>
<p>“Uh, um. Do you have a favor to ask me or something?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you have good intuition.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Houjo-kun’s lips curved into a sly grin. Perhaps he wanted to copy my notes too. I would lend them to him even if he didn’t treat me.</p>
<p>However, his request was something I didn’t expect.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about asking Saki to hang out during the summer vacation.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so?”</p>
<p>Hojo-kun and Sacchan really get along well. Especially recently, I often see the two of them together. I summoned my courage and asked about something that had been bothering me for a while.</p>
<p>“Um… Houjo-kun, do you like Sacchan?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I do.”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun affirmed it boldly, without a hint of shyness. Oh, cool!</p>
<p>“But, when I invited her to the Gion Festival before, it ended up being ‘with everyone.’ Maybe Saki is on guard against me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think… Sacchan doesn’t dislike being alone with Houjo-kun.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, because I invited Sacchan, Houjo-kun couldn’t have his date at the Gion Festival with her.</p>
<p>Ugh, I’m sorry. A sense of guilt prickles my heart belatedly.</p>
<p>“But maybe it’s too much of a hurdle to be just the two of us from the start. So,”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun made a peace sign with his right hand and thrust it out towards me.</p>
<p>“Nanase. How about a double date?”</p>
<p>I was taken aback and my eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Saki will feel more at ease if she knows you’re there from the beginning. Well, I suppose we can split up at some point.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. I… don’t have someone to date.”</p>
<p>I finally comprehended Houjo-kun’s suggestion and cut him off in a panic. Houjo-kun tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>“No way, there is.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun isn’t like that!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mention Sagara at all.”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun said nonchalantly, and I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Watching my reaction, he smirked a bit mischievously. Maybe he’s quite a tricky person behind his refreshing facade.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s not really the problem. Just invite anyone you deem appropriate.”</p>
<p>“But why me?”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun is well-connected. He has plenty of friends who’d go on a double date without him having to ask me.</p>
<p>Looking straight at me, Houjo-kun’s gaze seemed to pierce through to my very core, making me feel uncomfortable as if he could see through my facade.</p>
<p>“Nanase, you’re not the type to blab about who likes who, right? I have a pretty good sense about these things.”</p>
<p>“That’s… of course, I wouldn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, it means I trust you. You can refuse if you don’t like it, but Nanase, you ate the ice cream. It’s my treat.”</p>
<p>…Yes, I did eat it.</p>
<p>I couldn’t refuse when he said he trusted me. Although Houjo-kun and I weren’t that close, I wanted to help as much as I could.</p>
<p>It would also serve as atonement for ruining their Gion Festival date.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m okay with it.”</p>
<p>“Really? That helps. After the exams… let’s plan for the summer vacation. I’ll get in touch with you later.”</p>
<p>Houjo-kun smiled, waved his hand, and walked away.</p>
<p>As I watched his retreating back, I wondered what I should do. Although he said anyone would be fine, the face that came to mind was inevitably Sagara-kun’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After finishing my shift at 21:00, I yawned widely. Just as I entered the backroom, I was spotted by Itogawa-san.</p>
<p>“Oh, Sagara-kun, you look really tired.”</p>
<p>Suppressing another yawn, I responded with a “Yes.”</p>
<p>I had worked a shift until morning yesterday, so I went straight to the university without sleeping.</p>
<p>Today’s shift was from 16:00 to 21:00, so I have time to go home and study now.</p>
<p>However, my body is sluggish. Maybe due to lack of sleep, I’m even starting to get a headache.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, you’re working every day even before exams. Are you studying properly? If you need notes for Social Economics, I have some I could lend you.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I’ve been taking notes properly.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Sagara-kun is always so diligent.”</p>
<p>“I’m just average.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Sagara-kun, you look pale. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>…Now that she mentioned it, Nanase said something similar.</p>
<p>I checked my face in the mirror on the wall. I might look a bit pale, but I’ve always had an unhealthy complexion.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it always like this?”</p>
<p>“When you put it that way, maybe… but I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>“Well then, thanks for your hard work.”</p>
<p>“Bye, take care. Make sure you get some sleep.”</p>
<p>Itogawa-san saw me off as I left the convenience store through the back door into the moody air.</p>
<p>The temperature hasn’t dropped much even at night. Thinking about another tropical night made me feel tired.</p>
<p>As I walked towards my apartment, sweat began to pour from my forehead. It’s ridiculously hot for July, and my head feels foggy.</p>
<p>Staggering, I finally arrived at my apartment.</p>
<p>Dragging my leaden feet up the stairs, I took out my keys and opened the door.</p>
<p>I kicked off my sneakers and headed to the kitchen to get some water – and stumbled.</p>
<p>The kettle I left on the stove fell with a loud crash. I collapsed onto the tatami mats.</p>
<p>… Ah… this might be bad.</p>
<p>As I tried to get up, I felt dizzy. My body was burning up, and I couldn’t muster any strength. It felt like my whole body was at its limit, sending out an SOS.</p>
<p>The headline “Kyoto University Student Found Dead in His Apartment” flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>It’s terrible to fall ill before exams. No, at this rate, exams are the least of my concerns. I reached for my smartphone on the tatami but couldn’t quite grasp it.</p>
<p>Am I going to die like this? – I thought, when suddenly, The doorbell rang. I didn’t have the energy to get up. Ignoring it, a voice came from the other side.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun? I heard a loud noise; are you okay?”</p>
<p>It was Nanase’s voice. Unable to reply, I just groaned.</p>
<p>“I’m coming in!”</p>
<p>With that, she opened the door, letting in the light from outside. A scream-like voice echoed.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun!”</p>
<p>Nanase rushed over and shook me. When our eyes met, she sighed in relief and murmured,</p>
<p>“Thank goodness, you’re alive.” Her eyes, behind thick lenses, seemed to be moist.</p>
<p>“Should I call an ambulance?”</p>
<p>“…No need, I’m okay.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Nanase muttered, “Then that’s good,” and gently held my hand. As soon as her cool, small hand enveloped mine, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m turning on the air conditioner.”</p>
<p>After confirming my nod, Nanase turned on the AC and the fan. Along with a slightly dusty smell, cool air began to circulate.</p>
<p>After briskly laying out a futon, Nanase handed me a damp towel.</p>
<p>“You should wipe yourself with this towel and change your clothes. Need help?”</p>
<p>“I, I can do it myself…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t let Nanase do such a thing. My body felt heavy and sluggish, but I managed to sit up. While I changed, Nanase brought an ice pack and a sports drink from her room.</p>
<p>“Drink this for now.”</p>
<p>I took the bottle and let the cold, sweet liquid slide down my throat. Placing the ice pack under my neck, I lay down on the futon and started to feel better.</p>
<p>“Sorry to trouble you… Thank you.”</p>
<p>With a hoarse voice, I expressed my gratitude. Nanase smiled and narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bother at all. I was scared you might have died.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Besides, we should help each other when in trouble. Sagara-kun, you also took care of the cockroach for me.”</p>
<p>That’s right, there was that time. The first time I saw Nanase’s no make up face. It’s been almost two months since then.</p>
<p>“You’ve helped me a lot, too.”</p>
<p>Nanase reached out and gently touched my forehead. Perhaps because of my fever, her touch felt pleasantly cool.</p>
<p>“You’re a bit warm. Might be heatstroke. And you’re overworking.”</p>
<p>“…I’m sweating.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I’ll leave the sports drink by your pillow. I’ll come check on you tomorrow. Leave the door unlocked, okay? Good night.”</p>
<p>With that, Nanase left the room. I lay there, my thoughts drifting.</p>


<p>Living on my own is hard, huh.</p>
<p>When Nanase entered the room, I felt a profound sense of relief from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Now that she’s gone, I feel a little lonely. I remember the sensation of her firmly gripping hand.</p>
<p>…Damn. What am I getting so disheartened about? Ever since I graduated high school, I decided to live by myself without relying on anyone.</p>
<p>As I lay down, drowsiness slowly creeps up on me. I had a fleeting thought about the exams, but getting better should be my first priority.</p>
<p>I close my eyes and almost immediately fall asleep.</p>
<p>The sound of the doorbell wakes me up.</p>
<p>The sun has fully risen outside the window, and I can feel its light through the thin curtains.</p>
<p>The ice pack under my head has completely warmed up. I sit up sluggishly on the futon.</p>
<p>I’m still a bit sluggish, but my head feels clear.</p>
<p>Thanks to the air conditioner, I feel like I’ve had a proper sleep for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>The inventions of civilization are indeed wonderful. From now on, I’ll stop being so frugal.</p>
<p>Opening the door, there stands Nanase, perfectly made up and holding a small pot in her hand.</p>
<p>“Good morning. How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Much better.”</p>
<p>“That’s great. I made some porridge. Let’s eat together.”</p>
<p>Nanase comes in, takes out the bowls, and serves the porridge. The good smell of the broth wafts through the air.</p>
<p>Upon eating, I realize I’m hungrier than I thought. I finish it in no time. Seeing that, Nanase exhales a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Good. You seem to be doing okay.”</p>
<p>While eating the second bowl of porridge, I nod silently. At this rate, I should be able to go to class and work. Still, I’ve caused a lot of trouble for Nanase this time.</p>
<p>“… Sorry. I really appreciate it.”</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Nanase, I might have really died. To think, I boasted about living alone.</p>
<p>From now on, I need to pay more attention to my health.</p>
<p>“I’ll repay you properly next time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I told you, we’re even.”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t done anything…”</p>
<p>If I weighed Nanase’s and my favors on a scale, it would tip significantly in her favor. I can’t leave it like this.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything I can do, just ask. I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>Then, as if Nanase remembered something, she suddenly opened her eyes wide. She fidgeted with her hands on her knees before speaking hesitantly.</p>
<p>“… Then, can I ask you for one favor?”</p>
<p>“Okay. Sure.”</p>
<p>This time, I am ready to accept whatever she asks for.</p>
<p>Bracing myself, Nanase grabs my hands firmly. Her large eyes looking at me hold a serious intent.</p>
<p>“… Sagara-kun. Will you go on a date with me during the summer break!?”</p>
<p>“… Huh!?”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by the unexpected “favor,” I blurt out a dumbfounded response.</p>
<p>Nanase looks at me with an earnest expression, as if it’s the most natural request in the world.</p>
<p>My summer vacation, which wasn’t going according to plan, was about to begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exams are over, and a week has passed since the start of summer vacation.</p>
<p>Nanase begged me to go on a date without asking any questions, so here I am, taking the day off from work, on a city bus.</p>
<p>Our destination is the Kyoto Aquarium, located in Umekoji.</p>
<p>I sneak a glance at Nanase sitting next to me. Today, she’s wearing a dress that comes down to her ankles and has her hair tied up in a bun on top of her head.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because it’s summer break, but she feels a little different from when she’s at university.</p>
<p>“Hey, Nanase…”</p>
<p>Nanase, with her perfect makeup, smiles and says, “What?”</p>
<p>In the end, I couldn’t ask anything and just looked out the window, saying, “Nothing.” I repeat the unasked question in my mind.</p>
<p>Why did she invite me?</p>
<p>A date is typically between people in a romantic relationship or something close to it.</p>
<p>Does that mean… could Nanase possibly have feelings for me?</p>
<p>No, no, I don’t want to get involved with others, and I have no intention of getting into a relationship…</p>
<p>After such thoughts, I scold myself for being too conceited. Nanase, who boasts about wanting a “wonderful boyfriend” for her rose-colored college life, wouldn’t fall for a guy like me.</p>
<p>I am, if anything, at the opposite end of the spectrum from “wonderful.”</p>
<p>As I stew in my thoughts, the bus stops.</p>
<p>“We’re here. Let’s get off,”</p>
<p>I followed her off the bus.</p>
<p>In front of the aquarium is Umekoji Park, a large park bustling with families, student groups, and couples despite the scorching sun.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the aquarium, I can see a familiar man and woman standing.</p>
<p>“Hey, Haruko! Over here!”</p>
<p>Waving at us is Sudo, with the handsome Houjo standing next to her.</p>
<p>…What’s going on?</p>
<p>I look at Nanase for an explanation, and she mutters an apologetic “Sorry.” Houjo looks at me and smiles meaningfully.</p>
<p>Somehow, I get the gist of the situation.</p>
<p>For some reason, she must have been asked by Houjo to bring me along.</p>
<p>…So it’s not really a date at all. What a complicated way to put it.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in. I’ve got the tickets, so I’ll collect the money later.”</p>
<p>“Haruko, Haruko! Let’s take a picture with the giant salamander!”</p>
<p>Sudo, overly excited, pulls Nanase along and runs off.</p>
<p>Leaving us behind, and then the handsome Houjo turns a refreshing smile towards me.</p>
<p>If that smile hit any of the girls around here, it would be lethal.</p>
<p>Inside the polished aquarium, a massive ray glides smoothly with a school of little sardines swirling around it.</p>
<p>The interior of the aquarium is dim lighted, with only the tanks glowing faintly blue.</p>
<p>As I was looking at it and thinking it looked delicious, Hojo started talking to me.</p>
<p>His bangs sway smoothly.</p>
<p>“Hey, did you know? Rays have poison in their tails.”</p>
<p>…Why am I spending my summer vacation at an aquarium with a handsome guy?</p>
<p>Seeing my dissatisfied expression, Houjo pats my back</p>
<p>“Don’t make that face.”</p>
<p>Nanase and Sudo are happily taking pictures of the tanks a little away from us. Girls sure like taking photos, I think, as I watch them.</p>
<p>“Nanase ended up inviting Sagara, huh? Even though I said anyone would do.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘as expected’?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, man, for getting you involved in my stuff.”</p>
<p>“…So you’re the one who started this?”</p>
<p>I ask, and Hojo blinks in surprise.</p>
<p>“Huh? Didn’t Nanase tell you the situation? I told her to keep it a secret, but she could have told you.”</p>
<p>“… She asked me to go on a date without asking any questions.”</p>
<p>Houjo grins at my sullen response.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see. So Sagara thought it was going to be just the two of you. My bad, I didn’t mean for us to be together.”</p>
<p>His teasing tone irritates me, but since I did think it was just the two of us, I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>“What’s the situation?”</p>
<p>Now that I’m here, I have the right to know. I’ve not only taken time off work but also spent money on transportation and the entrance fee.</p>
<p>Houjo answers casually.</p>
<p>“I asked Nanase for a favor because I like Saki. I wanted her to help me out.”</p>
<p>“… Seriously?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed at all. I instinctively look towards Sudo. She seems like someone who wouldn’t need Nanase’s help to win anyone over. Is Sudo that tough?</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the situation. I’d be happy if you could leave us alone at some point.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, you should have just asked her out alone from the start.”</p>
<p>“If I asked her out of the blue, she’d be on guard, wouldn’t she? Besides, I wanted to hang out with you and Nanase, too.”</p>
<p>Houjo says this with a refreshing smile. I can understand why he’d want to hang out with Nanase, but why bother with a boring guy like me?</p>
<p>I can’t quite grasp what he’s thinking.</p>
<p>After taking plenty of photos together, Nanase and Sudo wave at us from a distance.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a picture with Hiroki and Sagara!”</p>
<p>Before I could refuse, Houjo drags me over. I’m forcibly positioned in front of the tank, and Sudo presses the shutter on her smartphone. Not knowing what face to make, I end up expressionless. I don’t really like having my picture taken.</p>
<p>I’m not knowledgeable about fashion, but even I can tell that the other three are stylish and stand out. And there’s me, in my usual black T-shirt, sticking out like a sore thumb in this group.</p>
<p>…I’m clearly out of place here. Someone like Kinami would have been better.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I post the photo of the four of us on Instagram?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll sue you for infringement of portrait rights.”</p>
<p>Sudo pouts her lips and calls me a stingy in response to my firm refusal.</p>
<p>In a small circular tank, translucent jellyfish make strange, squishy movements, their tentacles swaying like threads in the water.</p>
<p>I had never been to an aquarium before, so this was my first time seeing jellyfish up close.</p>
<p>They’re quite interesting. The way their insides are visible, including something that looks like a faintly pulsating heart, is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>I’m captivated and observe the jellyfish intently.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>I turn around at the sound of my name, and there’s Nanase standing behind me.</p>
<p>“Where are Houjo and Sudo?”</p>
<p>“They’re over there in the deep-sea fish section. They said you were looking at the jellyfish so intently, they didn’t want to distrub you. Do you like jellyfish?”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00011-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“They’re cute, aren’t they? I like the small, round ones.”</p>
<p>I find them interesting to watch, but cute…? If anything, I think they have a grotesque appearance, with their internal organs visible and all.</p>
<p>It seems Nanase and I have a different sense of aesthetics.</p>
<p>I stole a glance at Nanase before turning back to the jellyfish.</p>
<p>“I heard from Houjo. You were used as a bait to get Sudo to hang out with him, right?”</p>
<p>Nanase let out a slightly exasperated sigh at my words.</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t make it sound so bad… Houjo-kun isn’t such a bad person.”</p>
<p>“…Then why me?”</p>
<p>Nanase tilted her head with a puzzled “What?” Her large eyes, enhanced by contact lenses, reflected the blue light of the aquarium, shining in a mysterious hue.</p>
<p>“I’m obviously out of place here. If you’re going to invite someone to this kind of things… there are better candidates.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true! I wanted it to be you, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s answer was earnest. She probably just doesn’t have any guy friends, that’s all.</p>
<p>But still, it’s kind of an itchy feeling.</p>
<p>Then Nanase lowered her voice a bit and continued.</p>
<p>“Hey, should we leave them alone soon?”</p>
<p>Following Nanase’s words, I looked over at the two by the deep-sea fish tank.</p>
<p>Houjo was talking to Sudo, who was laughing with her shoulders shaking. Watching Sudo, Houjo’s gaze indeed seemed different from the one he directed at Nanase or me.</p>
<p>“Houjo-kun really does like Sacchan, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Seems like it. I don’t really get it, though.”</p>
<p>“Wandering off now would be too obvious… How should I explain it to Sacchan?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t had lunch; I’m getting hungry.”</p>
<p>While we whispered, Sudo turned around and shouted in a loud, clear voice.</p>
<p>“Hey hey! There’s a dolphin show starting soon! Wanna go watch?”</p>
<p>Since Sudo beckoned us insistently with her hand, we gave in and went over to them.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to watch the jellyfish a bit longer, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>After watching the dolphin show with the four of us and taking a full tour of the aquarium, we moved to the café inside the facility.</p>
<p>Nanase and Sudo, who ordered giant salamander meat buns, were both giddy and exclaimed, “So cute~!” I only ordered an iced coffee.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been to the aquarium since middle school, but it was super fun!”</p>
<p>Houjo smiled in response, “Then I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“It’s my first time at an aquarium.”</p>
<p>I muttered casually, to which Nanase responded in surprise.</p>
<p>“Huh? Didn’t you go to Nagoya Port Aquarium on a school trip in elementary school?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t go. I went to Meiji Village, though.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that brings back memories.”</p>
<p>Houjo seemed to have interested upon hearing our exchange.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. You two are from the same hometown, huh? That’s why you’re close.”</p>
<p>We’re not particularly close, but I keep silent since clarifying would complicate the conversation.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, you said you went to the same high school!”</p>
<p>At Sudo’s words, Nanase nodded ambiguously. For Nanase, high school topics are probably something she’d rather avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>“Were you two close since high school?”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes darted around at Houjo’s question. It was a blatantly obvious reaction. Not wanting to watch her struggle, I put down my coffee glass and spoke up.</p>
<p>“Not really. I knew she existed, but we didn’t interact.”</p>
<p>“Really? What was Haruko like in high school? Was she cute, too?”</p>
<p>Sudo asked innocently, making Nanase’s shoulders twitch. With a slight increase in volume, she responded definitively.</p>
<p>“She’s the same as now. Nothing’s changed.”</p>
<p>Nanase glanced at me momentarily before looking down guiltily.</p>
<p>…Idiot, just act normal. What will you do if you make them think weirdly?</p>
<p>As I inwardly fretted, Houjo changed the subject with, “So, where to next?” Sudo didn’t press any further, and I felt relieved.</p>
<p>Before leaving the aquarium, Sudo said, “I’m going to the bathroom for a sec,” and stepped away.</p>
<p>Seizing the moment, I told Houjo.</p>
<p>“I’m heading home then.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Since we’re here, let’s hang out a bit more.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had enough. Nanase, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Nanase looked puzzled, “Where to?” Could she have forgotten her original purpose?</p>
<p>“What did you come here for? You were supposed to leave Houjo and Sudo alone together, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right! Then good luck, Houjo-kun! Fight on!”</p>
<p>Nanase seemed to finally remember, clenching her fist in front of her chest. Houjo waved a fluttering hand, saying, “Thanks~”</p>
<p>As we left the aquarium, we walked toward the bus stop. Nanase kept looking back, as if she was worried about Sudo.</p>
<p>“I wonder if they’ll be okay. I’ll send Sacchan a LINE message later, just in case.”</p>
<p>“If she really hates it, she’ll go home on her own.”</p>
<p>“I think… Sacchan doesn’t hate it. Probably…”</p>
<p>Nanase said, holding her parasol against the sun. Frankly, I don’t care what happens to those two, but I don’t want to be involved again. I hope they just get together quickly.</p>
<p>“Houjo-kun is handsome, and Sacchan is beautiful. They’re a perfect match, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“… Yeah, maybe.”</p>
<p>Then I remembered something. Houjo once told me that Nanase and I were a good match.</p>
<p>I looked at Nanase walking next to me.</p>
<p>She’s a beauty, clearly out of my league.</p>
<p>A good match with me? That’s impossible, even if I turned myself inside out.</p>
<p>After a while, we arrived at the bus stop. Our bus was scheduled to come in five minutes, but Kyoto buses are never on time.</p>
<p>The bench, heated by the sun, was so hot it seemed like it could cause burns, making it hard to sit down.</p>
<p>“It’s really hot. I’m thirsty.”</p>
<p>Nanase said and bought a drink from a vending machine near the bus stop—a refreshing summer lemon soda.</p>
<p>I thought about getting something myself, but I didn’t have any change, so I gave up.</p>
<p>Nanase took two modest sips from the bottle, leaving faint pink lipstick marks on the rim, which made me feel oddly conscious.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. Sorry about earlier.”</p>
<p>Nanase suddenly said. Her voice was almost drowned out by the loud cicadas.</p>
<p>The black parasol cast a shadow on her profile.</p>
<p>Why she was apologizing.</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“For making you tell an unnecessary lie. That I haven’t changed at all since high school.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Not really, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>I already owe Nanase, and a little white lie like that doesn’t hurt me at all. If such a thing can protect Nanase’s peace of mind, it’s a small price to pay.</p>
<p>…Besides.</p>
<p>“…It’s not completely a lie, anyway.”</p>
<p>Nanase has changed. But there’s also a lot about her that hasn’t changed, like her straight posture and her diligent attitude towards work. Those things are the same as they were in high school.</p>
<p>I stared at the tips of my sneakers hitting the asphalt and continued slowly.</p>
<p>“You’ve always been serious and hardworking, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“…I guess.”</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s just that the direction of your full effort has shifted a bit… The core part of you hasn’t changed at all.”</p>
<p>When I looked up, Nanase was still staring at me, listening to my words.</p>
<p>Eventually, she smiled with a soft, drooping eye, reminiscent of her unguarded self.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“…It’s not something to be thanked for.”</p>
<p>After my reply, Nanase leaned in to look at my face, then pressed the cool bottle against my cheek with a “there.”</p>
<p>“Whoa. What’s that for?”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, your face is red. …Heatstroke again?”</p>
<p>The lemon soda felt refreshingly cold against my skin. That’s when I finally realized that my face was surprisingly hot.</p>


<p>Several days after going to the Kyoto Aquarium, as usual, Nanase came over with dinner.</p>
<p>The moment she opened the door to my room, her eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s hot! Sagara-kun, you’re not using the air conditioner again!?”</p>
<p>Her tone was somewhat accusatory, and I scratched my head awkwardly.</p>
<p>Today the heat wasn’t as bad, and I had to go to work in three hours, so I thought I could endure it for a little while.</p>
<p>“…Sagara-kun. Have you already forgotten when you collapsed the other day?”</p>
<p>Being glared at like that, I couldn’t say anything back. I definitely caused Nanase a lot of trouble that time.</p>
<p>“…Sorry. I’ll turn on the air conditioner.”</p>
<p>As I give up, Nanase had a flash of inspiration and exclaimed,</p>
<p>“That’s right!”</p>
<p>She clasped her hands together in front of her chest, looking pleased.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we eat together in my room? It’s cool because I have the air conditioner on.”</p>
<p>Her outrageous suggestion made me exclaim, “Huh!?” I always thought she was a girl with a strange sense of distance, but what on earth is going on with her sense of crisis management?</p>
<p>“Y-You… Don’t just easily invite guys into your room.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying it easily. I wouldn’t do this for other boys.”</p>
<p>Watching Nanase innocently smile, I shrugged slightly.</p>
<p>Maybe she should hurry up and get a boyfriend. At this rate, she’s going to drive other guys even further away.</p>
<p>“Besides, we already ate porridge together in your room the other day. You should cool off in my room until you have to go to work! Come on, let’s go.”</p>
<p>When she said that much, I started to feel like maybe it’s okay (whatever), and I went along with it.</p>
<p>Nanase has no ulterior motives in inviting me, and I’m not planning to start thinking weird things.</p>
<p>Absolutely, definitely not. Not at all.</p>
<p>“Please come in. Come in.”</p>
<p>Urged by Nanase, I stepped into her room. This was my second time here since the day I came to exterminate a cockroach.</p>
<p>Her room was enveloped in the pleasantly cool air from the air conditioner.</p>
<p>It was cleaned thoroughly, and it seemed to smell nice. As usual, most of the room was dominated by a ridiculously large closet, making it feel smaller than my room.</p>
<p>Though the layout should be the same.</p>
<p>“Today, I made hamburgers! I even tried my best to make the sauce from scratch.”</p>
<p>Nanase said as she placed a plate with hamburgers and a bowl of white rice on the low table.</p>
<p>As I sat down, she apologized for the cramped space and sat down next to me.</p>
<p>There wasn’t enough room to sit across from each other because of all her stuff.</p>
<p>I was secretly unsettled by the close distance, but I tried to appear calm.</p>
<p>“…Itadakimasu.”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/00004-3.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>I picked up a piece of the hamburger with my chopsticks and put it in my mouth. Juicy meat juices overflowed inside my mouth, and I involuntarily groaned.</p>
<p>The demi-glace sauce she mentioned was homemade and delicious.</p>
<p>Nanase is truly skilled at cooking.</p>
<p>When I said, “It’s really delicious,” Nanase let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p>“Really? Actually, when I made it before, it was a little undercooked and a failure. I’m glad it turned out well today.”</p>
<p>Even Nanase can fail, I thought, then realized that made sense. She’s an exceptionally hard worker. Her current culinary skills must surely be the result of her hidden efforts.</p>
<p>It seemed that there was only one rice bowl, so Nanase was eating white rice from her miso soup bowl.</p>
<p>Realizing she had given up the bowl for me, I felt a bit guilty. I would have been fine with any dish.</p>
<p>As we ate in silence, Nanase murmured softly.</p>
<p>“…I’m going back to my parents’ house next week.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s face as she said this seemed to be tinged with an unavoidable gloom.</p>
<p>I swallowed my rice and responded nonchalantly, “Huh.”</p>
<p>“It’s Obon holiday, so they’re telling me to come back.”</p>
<p>I thought it would be troublesome if the topic shifted to my family, but Nanase didn’t touch on that.</p>
<p>After chewing her hamburger thoughtfully, she let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>“…I don’t really want to go back.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“…When I go back to my hometown… I can’t help but remember who I used to be.”</p>
<p>For Nanase, her hometown must be a place that forcibly confronts her with her less brilliant self.</p>
<p>While the reasons may be completely different, I can understand the feeling of not wanting to visit one’s parents.</p>
<p>“…Well, probably nobody will remember me anyway. It’s fine, I guess. Yeah. No one probably remembers me anyway.”</p>
<p>As if convincing herself, Nanase muttered. Then, turning to me with a smile, the gloominess from before had vanished.</p>
<p>“Ah. Sagara-kun, do you want another serving of rice? I’ll prepare it for you.”</p>
<p>Nanase, with a smile, took my bowl. In the process, our shoulders lightly touched, and my heart skipped a beat ever so slightly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the middle of August, I returned to my parents’ home in Nagoya.</p>
<p>I hadn’t gone back even during Golden Week, so this was my first time since graduating. I might run into someone I know.</p>
<p>Even if they see the current me, no one will probably recognize me, but I still felt a sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>I’m grateful to my parents. They allowed me to live on my own after leaving home and accepted the changes in me after high school graduation.</p>
<p>“Well, Haruko is a university student now,” they said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Yet, I wasn’t enthusiastic about going back because being here, I’m reminded of my empty past self.</p>
<p>“Welcome home. You must be tired from the long trip.”</p>
<p>When I got home, my mom greeted me warmly. My dad still hadn’t come back from work.</p>
<p>I replied with a smile, “I’m home.”</p>
<p>“It’s convenient with the Shinkansen, but it’s expensive. Maybe Kintetsu would have been better.”</p>
<p>“You got back quickly, so it’s good. Dinner isn’t ready yet, so go change and relax.”</p>
<p>At my mom’s words, I headed to my room with my suitcase.</p>
<p>My room, which I hadn’t entered in a while, was exactly the same as it had been months ago. Yet, it felt somewhat like someone else’s room. I changed into a T-shirt and shorts I pulled out from the dresser and flopped onto the bed.</p>
<p>…I wonder how Sagara-kun is doing.</p>
<p>Since summer vacation started, he’s seemed extremely busy. He’s still doing a lot of part-time jobs, and I can sense him coming home at dawn.</p>
<p>I hope he’s eating properly, even without me around. He’s probably just eating udon all the time. Hopefully, he hasn’t gotten sick again.</p>
<p>…Come to think of it, I wonder if Sagara-kun is going back to his parents’ house.</p>
<p>A thought struck me, and I sat up, pulling my high school yearbook from the bookshelf. Truth be told, I hadn’t opened it even once since receiving it.</p>
<p>There are no memories of mine within this thick album.</p>
<p>I opened the album with “Nagoya City Koryo High School” embossed in gold on the deep green cover.</p>
<p>I was in Class 3-4. There was a plain, unremarkable girl with black hair braided into three parts.</p>
<p>Wearing a navy blazer with a red tie, all the buttons on her shirt were done up to the top.</p>
<p>She was the very image of “the correct way to wear a uniform” depicted in the student handbook.</p>
<p>I wasn’t featured in the pages of school events or club activities that followed. The only time I appeared was in the photo of the library committee.</p>
<p>Next, I turned to the page for Class 3-6. I found Sagara-kun surprisingly quickly. He looked almost the same as now, but his hair was a bit shorter.</p>
<p>He might not be good at taking pictures, as his expression was stiff.</p>
<p>Looking at the name written below, I thought, “Huh.”</p>
<p>Iijima Souhei. The person there was certainly Sagara-kun, but not Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>I recall he mentioned that his surname had changed. Maybe due to his parents’ divorce or possibly a bereavement. I thought it would be rude to speculate too much, so I shook my head vigorously to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>…I thought we had become close, but I realize I don’t know anything about Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>Faced with that reality, I felt a sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>I put the yearbook back in its place and flopped back onto the bed.</p>


<p>Since last week, Nanase has been back at her parents’ home.</p>
<p>During the absence of my neighbor, I’ve been diligently working and studying. Although I’ve been fully enjoying the rare lonely life , not hearing the sound of the TV drama from next door or Nanase’s off-key humming while she hangs laundry makes me feel like something is missing.</p>
<p>Every time I eat the discounted udon, I hear Nanase’s voice in my head, “You should eat something more nutritious!” With Nanase not bringing dinner, my diet has been getting worse.</p>
<p>I have to try cooking for myself to prove that I can manage without Nanase.</p>
<p>I bought some green onions and chikuwa from the supermarket and pulled out the never-used knife and cutting board from the back of the shelf.</p>
<p>Tentatively, I start cutting the chikuwa and green onions. Just when I thought I had finally finished, I realized the green onions were all still connected.</p>
<p>Apparently, I’m not cut out for cooking. I sigh and start over.</p>
<p>I toss the green onions and chikuwa into the frying pan, add the thirty-yen udon, stir-fry it, and finish with a splash of soy sauce.</p>
<p>It’s wasnt as good as Nanase’s, but it wasn’t inedible.</p>
<p>After finishing the udon, I washed the dishes, cutting board, knife, and frying pan.</p>
<p>Cooking is one thing, but cleaning up is really a hassle. I’m newly impressed by Nanase, who does this every day. From now on, I’ll make sure to be more grateful.</p>
<p>After the cleanup, I lay down to sleep before work when I heard someone climbing the apartment stairs. Accompanying the footsteps were the thudding sounds of a carry-on suitcase’s wheels.</p>
<p>Soon after, I heard the sound of the key turning in the lock next door and a “Tadaima” that wasn’t meant for anyone in particular. Nanase had returned.</p>
<p>As I lay with my eyes closed, the intercom in my room rang. I got up and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sagara-kun. Long time no see.”</p>
<p>It was Nanase, still in her sparkly, made-up mode.</p>
<p>She said it’s been a while, but had it really been that long? It should have been only about a week since Nanase went back to her hometown.</p>
<p>However, seeing her smiling face, I thought maybe it really had been quite some time.</p>
<p>“I missed the Gozan no Okuribi because I was back home. I wanted to see it.” (tln : Gozan no Okuribi, more commonly known as Daimonji, is a festival in Kyoto, Japan. It is the culmination of the Obon festival on August 16)</p>
<p>“…Ah. Yeah, they were doing something.”</p>
<p>“Did you see it, Sagara-kun? You can see it from near the apartment, right?”</p>
<p>“No, I was at work.”</p>
<p>I replied, suppressing a yawn. I hadn’t slept much since I had work last night.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Were you about to sleep?”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>As I replied, Nanase handed me a paper bag, saying, “This is a souvenir.” The logo on the bag looked familiar. It was uirou from a famous shop in Nagoya. (tln : Uirō also known as uirō-mochi (外郎餠), is a traditional Japanese steamed cake made of glutinous rice flour and sugar. )</p>
<p>“Do people normally buy uirou for someone from the same place?”</p>
<p>“When you live in Nagoya, you don’t really eat it much, right?”</p>
<p>She’s right; I might not have eaten it much. I’ll gratefully accept it.</p>
<p>She seemed a bit down before she left, but I wondered if everything turned out okay.</p>
<p>Choosing my words carefully, I asked Nanase.</p>
<p>“…So, how was it? Your home…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I had a relaxing time. I didn’t meet any kids from the neighborhood. It was good to eat my mom’s cooking after a long time. We went to visit the family grave with the three of us, and on the way back, we stopped by my grandmother’s house… Oh, my grandmother lives in Mikawa, by the way…”</p>
<p>I listened silently as Nanase happily talked about her time.</p>
<p>It seems her family life is quite good. Nanase must be loved by her kind parents, and she probably cherishes them as well. What a commonplace, love-filled family is like, I can only imagine.</p>
<p>After sharing some memories with her grandmother, Nanase suddenly stopped talking. She seemed to have something more to say and hesitated. So, I asked, “What?”</p>
<p>“…Aren’t you going back to your hometown, Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>At Nanase’s question, I involuntarily held my breath. After moistening my lips quickly, I answered.</p>
<p>“…I don’t want to go back.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>It was the first time Nanase had inquired about my family. Until now, she had skillfully avoided the subject, sensing that I didn’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>“Nanase, it’s none of your business. Leave it alone.”</p>
<p>The voice that came out was much sharper than I intended. It was too late to take it back. Nanase, struck by the raw anger, widened her eyes and took a step back.</p>
<p>“I’m… sorry.”</p>
<p>No, wait, that’s not it. I want to follow up, but I can’t find the right words.</p>
<p>“…Then, I’ll go back to my room. Bye.”</p>
<p>Nanase said quickly and left my room, her long skirt fluttering.</p>
<p>Even though it was a topic I didn’t want to be touched on, saying it was none of her business was too much. Or was it? It really is none of Nanase’s business, so maybe it’s okay.</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything wrong. Why do I even have to worry about this? Damn, this is why relationships are so troublesome.</p>
<p>…After all, it’s best not to get involved with others.</p>
<p>I lay down on the tatami and closed my eyes, trying to distract myself from the frustration welling up inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in my own room, I sat in the corner, hugging my knees, quietly reflecting.</p>
<p>──It’s none of your business, Nanase. Leave it alone.</p>
<p>Sagara-kun had rejected me with his whole being. Just like I don’t want everyone to know my true self, Sagara-kun has parts of himself he doesn’t want anyone to touch.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a place for someone like me to intrude carelessly.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve been too dependent on Sagara-kun until now.</p>
<p>Even things I hesitate to say to other friends for fear of being disliked, I could strangely say to Sagara-kun.</p>
<p>He was the only one I could be my true self with. Despite his grudging face, he always helped me.</p>
<p>…But. Maybe I’ve finally been disliked…</p>
<p>Feeling down about my own ineptitude, my smartphone on the table vibrated. A LINE message from Kinami-kun had arrived.</p>
<p>〈Nanase, are you back yet?〉</p>
<p>Kinami-kun sometimes contacts me during the summer vacation. The content is always trivial, but somehow I can’t bring myself to end the conversation, so it drags on.</p>
<p>I hesitated whether to reply right away, but wanting to distract myself from feeling down, I sent</p>
<p>〈I got back today〉.</p>
<p>〈Are you free tomorrow? Want to go see a movie?〉</p>
<p>Underneath, a URL was attached. It led to a live-action remake of a Disney animation. I remember watching the original over and over on DVD when I was little, a favorite of mine.</p>
<p>I hesitated about what to do. It was the first time a boy had invited me out just the two of us.</p>
<p>No, maybe I’m the only one who’s overly conscious of it, and Kinami-kun didn’t intend it to be just the two of us.</p>
<p>I don’t have work tomorrow, and if Sacchan or the other are there, it might be nice to go for a change of pace.</p>


<p>While giving a vague reply, I sent a message that said, “That sounds fun.” Immediately, a response came back.</p>
<p>〈Nanase, you’re on the Hankyu line, right? How about we meet at Kawaramachi?〉</p>
<p>Even though I hadn’t said whether I would go or not, he had already decided on a meeting place. As I was panicking, I received another message,</p>
<p>〈I reserved tickets for two! The showing at 2 PM!〉</p>
<p>He was quite pushy. Oh, what should I do?</p>
<p>Holding my smartphone, I slumped down. I felt bad for him, but I really wasn’t keen on going.</p>
<p>Feeling gloomy, I murmured to myself, “I’m such an idiot.”</p>
<p>“The movie was great! I only remembered the story from when I was a kid, but now I remember that’s what it was about.”</p>
<p>After leaving the movie theater, we moved to a nearby cafe. Kinami-kun was drinking iced coffee, and I was sipping hot cocoa.</p>
<p>The theater’s air conditioning was too strong, and I had gotten completely chilled. Even here, the direct blast of cold air from the air conditioner above us was cold.</p>
<p>I rubbed my arms, which were exposed from the sleeves of my light purple blouse, thinking I should have brought a cardigan.</p>
<p>Kinami-kun, wearing a khaki T-shirt and shorts, was in a good mood, talking about the movie.</p>
<p>I sat opposite him, nodding along to what he was saying. I had been worried about being alone with Kinami-kun, but it wasn’t as nerve-wracking as I thought it would be since he was so talkative and I just had to respond.</p>
<p>The glass-walled cafe was filled with lively conversations, and I could see couples looking cozy.</p>
<p>I wondered if Kinami-kun and I appeared the same way.</p>
<p>“You and Sagara are pretty close, huh, Nanase?”</p>
<p>“Ah, W-what!?”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by the mention of Sagara-kun’s name, I stiffened. Kinami-kun looked at me with a probing gaze.</p>
<p>“Are you two dating?”</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>Kinami-kun smiled happily when I shook my head. “That’s good to hear!”</p>
<p>“Is there someone else you’re dating? Someone you like?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t.”</p>
<p>Kinami-kun, swirling his iced coffee with a straw, said in a light tone:</p>
<p>“So, why don’t you go out with me?”</p>
<p>My expression froze while still shaped in a smile. After looking around in confusion, I stared at the steaming hot cocoa.</p>
<p>…This is a confession, isn’t it? If so, this is the first time I’ve been confessed to by a boy.</p>
<p>A rose-colored college life should come with a wonderful boyfriend.</p>
<p>Kinami-kun might be a bit careless, but he’s a fun, bright guy. He’s not bad-looking, either.</p>
<p>He casually held the cafe door open, showing he’s attentive. Objectively speaking, he’s too good for someone like me.</p>
<p>The high school me would have never caught the eye of someone like Kinami-kun. Maybe being with Kinami-kun would bring me closer to a rose-colored college life.</p>
<p>I took a small breath before answering.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I can’t go out with you, Kinami-kun.”</p>
<p>Kinami-kun’s face looked momentarily pained, but then he smiled at me.</p>
<p>“That’s okay. My bad for asking.”</p>
<p>He didn’t push for a reason. He really is a nice guy.</p>
<p>…Even so. Why am I thinking of Sagara-kun’s face right now?</p>
<p>Unlike the always-smiling Kinami-kun, Sagara-kun always has a grumpy look. He’s kind but expresses it in a clumsy and twisted way.</p>
<p>He doesn’t match my pace when we walk, so I always have to hurry after him.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason, when I’m by Sagara-kun’s side, breathing feels easier.</p>
<p>I repeated “I’m sorry” once more and took a sip of my now lukewarm cocoa.</p>
<p>The overly sweet cocoa clung to the back of my throat, making my chest feel tight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sunlight streaming through the gaps in the curtains was dazzling, waking me up.</p>
<p>It was the end of August, and the fierce heat had eased up a bit, which was a relief.</p>
<p>But the end of summer means I’ll have to worry about winter next. I’ve heard Kyoto gets cold in the winter because it’s a lower area, trapping both heat and cold.</p>
<p>Hot summers and cold winters—how can that be? It’s the worst.</p>
<p>I checked the time on my phone by the pillow. It was noon. I have work starting at 17:00 today. For now, I should get something to eat.</p>
<p>As I pondered what to eat, my eyes landed on a paper bag left in the corner of the room. I got up sluggishly and took out its contents.</p>
<p>It was uirou, a souvenir from my neighbor. For lunch, this’ll do.</p>
<p>I’m still depending on Nanase’s charity, I thought, feeling empy.</p>
<p>I remembered Nanase’s trembling voice saying, “I’m sorry.” Guilt pained my chest.</p>
<p>Since that incident, I haven’t faced Nanase. There’s no sound from the next room, so she seems to be out somewhere now.</p>
<p>I peeled the plastic from the uirou and took a bite.</p>
<p>──Aren’t you going back to your hometown, Sagara-kun?</p>
<p>…It’s not that I won’t go back, I don’t want to go back. I’ve felt this way ever since the days I spent in the library.</p>
<p>The cicadas’ cries echoed outside the room. The tepid breeze from the fan brushed against my sweaty skin.</p>
<p>Nanase’s sad expression was stuck behind my eyelids and wouldn’t fade.</p>
<p>“…ra-kun, Sagara-kun.”</p>
<p>Jolted back to reality by a tap on the shoulder, I saw Itogara-san waving her hand lightly in front of my face.</p>
<p>…Damn. I zoned out, even though I was in the middle of my shift. It was almost 21:00, time to finish up.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Did the cash register tally up?”</p>
<p>“Ah… yes, it’s alrigh…”</p>
<p>Before I could finish, I flipped over the coin case with the register’s cash. Itogara-san let out a “Whoops” and a chuckle, helping me pick up the scattered coins.</p>
<p>While apologizing to Itogara-san, I gathered the coins and put them back in the case. As I recounted them with a sigh, Itogara-san looked concerned.</p>
<p>“This is weird, Sagara-kun the most reliable ones mess up, What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Ah… well, it’s just… that…”</p>
<p>“Ah, did you fight with your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“Sh-she’s not my girlfriend! She just lives next door…”</p>
<p>I blurted out more than I should have and hurriedly shut my mouth.</p>
<p>Itogara-san laughed, “Is it that cute girl from Gion Matsuri?” I hesitated but nodded.</p>
<p>“…It’s not really a fight, I just… said something too harsh when she touched on something I didn’t want to be touched on. I made her sad, no matter how you look at it…”</p>
<p>Itogara-san nodded as she listened to my story.</p>
<p>Somehow, she has a calmness and an embracing quality that makes me want to confide in her.</p>
<p>“If you want to make up, why not just apologize?”</p>
<p>A perfectly logical suggestion. I looked down and replied, “Yeah, I guess so.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Maybe buy her something sweet?”</p>
<p>“Something sweet?”</p>
<p>Surprised by the suggestion, I stopped and looked up. Itogara-san continued with a serious face.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I often fight with my boyfriend, but we usually make up over ice cream.”</p>
<p>Itogara-san lives with her boyfriend from high school. For me, who doesn’t understand women at all, her advice was precious.</p>
<p>“Plus, that girl likes chocolate, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh? How do you know that…?”</p>
<p>Why would Itogara-san know such a thing? As I tilted my head, she continued.</p>
<p>“That girl sometimes comes here when you’re not around and often buys small chocolates.”</p>
<p>She pointed at the chocolate snacks placed near the register.</p>
<p>This is the closest convenience store to the apartments, so it’s not strange that Nanase comes here often. Even so, I didn’t know she liked chocolate.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I realized I don’t know anything about Nanase.</p>
<p>I’ve never tried to learn what she likes or dislikes.</p>
<p>“Ah, looks like you already reached todays quota. Well, take care.”</p>
<p>I bowed to Itogara-san and then retreated to the back to change.</p>
<p>As I was about to leave—I stopped and thought for a bit, then turned back inside the store.</p>
<p>Staring intently at the row of sweets, I seriously examined my options.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I picked up a chocolate snack shaped like mushrooms and headed to the register.</p>
<p>When I returned to the apartment, I could see the light on in the next room.</p>
<p>Taking a small breath, I rang the doorbell with a ‘ping pong’ sound.</p>
<p>Soon after, Nanase appeared with a bare face, hastily adjusting her slipping glasses.</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun?”</p>
<p>Without a word, I pushed the convenience store bag toward her, and Nanase peered inside with curiosity.</p>
<p>Seeing her face bloom into a happy smile at the sight of the snacks, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>“Is this for me? What brought this on all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“It’s… just because,” I replied, though it wasn’t really an answer.</p>
<p>But Nanase didn’t press any further. “Thank you,” she said, hugging the bag as if it were precious.</p>
<p>I suddenly worried whether the chocolate might melt.</p>
<p>Looking down and scratching my cheek, I spoke up quickly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about the other day.”</p>
<p>Nanase’s eyes widened, then she blinked with a troubled frown.</p>
<p>“No… I should be the one apologizing for asking something so rude.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. I was just on edge. It was misdirected anger.”</p>
<p>As I said this, Nanase slowly reached out her right hand.</p>
<p>“Then… let’s make up.”</p>
<p>I hesitantly took her small offered hand in mine. Nanase’s hand was warm. Or perhaps, it was just that my own hand was cold.</p>
<p>Without holding someone else’s hand like this, I wouldn’t have realized that fact.</p>
<p>When was the last time I had a fight with someone and then made up like this?</p>
<p>I didn’t want to get deeply involved with anyone, to get hurt or to hurt others. But somehow, before I knew it, I had started to worry about all sorts of things concerning Nanase.</p>
<p>The clumsy, hardworking, and dangerously earnest girl had, at some point, taken up a tiny seat in my heart.</p>
<p>And as for me… I was beginning to not mind it.</p>
<p>“…Nanase, you like chocolate?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I love it. But actually, I prefer Takenoko over Kinoko.” (tln : mushroom chocolate type)</p>
<p>“Seriously? We’re incompatible then.”</p>
<p>“Sagara-kun, let’s share this. If I eat it all at this hour, I’ll gain weight.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Nanase smiled softly. When she smiles without makeup, her eyes disappear.</p>
<p>I’ve grown completely accustomed to seeing that face.</p>
<p>A cool night breeze blew between us, signaling the end of summer.</p>
