<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Great Things are Not Done by Impulse, But a Series of Small Things Brought Together.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The urge to crumple it up and throw it away was irresistible even with just the first sentence. It would have been a moving scene, the start of the drama section in a film. However, Yuri Kashiwazaki, the person who wrote the letter, was at school today, going about her business as usual, and making a fool of herself as usual. That was why I was irritated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably put the letter in my bag as one of her random pranks, and completely forgot about it the next minute. If you were going to pull this kind of prank, could you at least make it convincing? In the first place, who in the world would write their suicide letter on the back of a classical literature quiz paper? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sighing, I put the suicide letter under the application form for this year’s Snow Festival I had just recieved from Hiiragi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was now on my way to the multipurpose town hall to pick up the guidelines for the Maimori Snow Festival. The Snow Festival was a major annual event that featured a centerpiece snow sculpture of over ten meters in height, the main attraction drawing tourists into the venue. And surrounding it were two-meter snow sculptures of different themes by various organizations throughout Maimori.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the domineering centerpiece created by the JSDF personnel and other volunteers requires manpower, time, and effort to create, snow sculptures created by schools and companies were to merely liven up the festival. There were even cases of families and groups of friends who were interested in snow sculpting and enjoying the festivities participated in snow sculpting. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:JSDF, Japan Self-Defense Forces, or essentially, Japanese military]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the famous Sapporo Snow Festival, the number of applications for the citizens’ snow sculpture creation far exceeds the number of blocks available. Since participants were selected by raffling, it was said that just being selected to create a snow sculpture at the Sapporo Snow Festival was a fortune. On the other hand, the Maimori Snow Festival was practically unknown to the world, when compared to Sapporo’s. Even though there was a raffle drawing, nearly 100% of those who applied were eligible to participate. In fact, the application was so few that the Maiei High School art club was obliged to participate in the Snow Festival every year to fill the gap. I attended the raffle drawing, a raffle drawing only in name, got selected, then was on my way home, with a Snow Festival guideline paper with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the Snow Festival, Hiiragi-sensei basically threw the whole thing to me, the club leader. I chuckled as I considered humoring myself by changing the name on Yuri’s suicide letter to Komiya Sousuke and left it on Hiiragi-sensei’s desk. On my way back, to flee this suffocating reality, I fancied. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three-day creation period required dozens of hours of work in temperatures well under the freezing point. The winners of the event were selected by votes of Maimori citizens. However, the reward for the effort were only medals and brief introductions and mentions here and there in local news, no prize money, nothing more, just that. Therefore, it was always a challenge just to convince enough people to participate in the event. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year too, my precious participating members, excluding myself, were two people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s just get this over with. First, let’s talk about what kind of snow sculpture we are going to make. What should be our theme?” I began, “You probably know it already, but I’m repeating this: themes related to politics or religion are not allowed. Also, oversizing, carving text, or coloring are against the rules and will result in immediate disqualification,” As I read out the guideline I received yesterday, Igarashi, with her chin resting on her hands, sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I was relieved when you said we are not participating,” she let out another depressed sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too, but since we are now participating, let’s endure it together. Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sorry for taking it out on you even though you did nothing wrong… I’ll do my best!” said Igarashi, her back straightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was practically forced to participate since her parents were members of the festival’s committee. Because of that, this was the second year she participated while not at all enthusiastic about it. Nonetheless, I was thankful that someone with experience agreed to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This year, it looks like there will be fewer of us than last year, so let’s follow our senior’s footsteps and make something simple and safe. Komiya, what do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, and since our experiences are just as well as beginners’ in this field, so something with a stable center of gravity would be preferable,” I added, “Last year, senpais also carved a character from a popular video game with a stable center of gravity too… Oh, and Saegusa, if you have any ideas, don’t hesitate to suggest it, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saegusa, a first year who kept lots of layers of permed hair as if to hide her round face, and if you ruffled her hair, you could see her round, easily agitated eyes. She was the type of quiet girl that could be outspoken when it came to her opinions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… I want more first-years to participate, since we need to lead next year… But that seems hard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t asked her directly why she participated, but I had a gist of it. I was confessed by Saegusa a while before summer. While I ended up refusing, she might have lingering feelings and participated because I was here. Or perhaps I was just being conceited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, but I have already approached some first-years today, but none came. Hang in there, I’ll try convincing more to join.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no. I didn’t mean to complain… Senpai is always working hard… I’m… sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hopefully more people will join in the future, but for now, we  are now running out of time, so let’s just decide on what we are going to do by ourselves. Let’s see, within two cubic meters, the production period is three days… If we assume that there are just the three of us… That’s going to be pretty tough&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The discussion went smoothly, we decided that the snow sculpture for our club will be the famous “Monomon”. The two-headed character had a stable center of gravity and a simple face. Although other groups might choose “Monomon” like us, it was a safe choice that no one could voice a complaint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All we have to do now is to work out a little more in detail about how we are going to carve it and submit the production plan to the management. Let’s just get it over with and get back to our own work!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Agreed. I just started carving a new piece, spending too much time on this is the last thing I would ask for. Honestly, I’m not into this at all, but yeah, we’ll get through this together!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Igarashi and Saegusa were comrades who love creating, whether it be painting, sculpturing, or something else, they were irreplaceable friends. It was true that the Snow Festival was certainly a painstaking event, but getting to work with other club members like this was something I looked forward to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I had a precious memory at the Snow Festival.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could still vividly remember every word I exchanged with Utako on that day, back then, at the festival. The feeling that I wanted to stay beside her forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she had the opportunity to come to the festival once, she had told me that she loved Maimori Snow Festival. It was only natural that I would do everything in my power to convey the atmosphere of the festival to her.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’ll be sculpting in this year’s Snow Festival too.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, when our dreams came true, the three of us would be able to enjoy the festival together one more time. With a smile on my face, I sent the message to Utako.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urgh–, this is too cold–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my scarf wound around my neck, I left the house. There was a puzzling fashion trend with unknown origin that high school boys wearing coats were lame. But whoever came up with it surely hadn’t considered how much inconvenience this trend would cause. Walking in this freezing weather without a coat and several layers of stuffy sweaters and undershirts underneath to compliment, what a peak fashion. Thanks a lot, whoever you were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I opened the classroom door with a sigh, I immediately heard their usual banter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, last night, my mom forgot to turn on the heater, and it was super cold this morning. My hands were freezing! Cuz of that I couldn’t even attach the eyelashes properly–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Marina, why don’t you stop wearing those fancy outfits and makeup that benefits no one? By your looks, I would take you as a girl who goes to night pools, takes selfies, and posts them on social media. That look would only attract playboys to a virgin like you, and ends up with you drowning in tears. See? Nothing good out of it,” reasoned Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be so biased! You seem so keen on making enemies, don’t you?” snapped Seino</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exchange between Yuri and Seino had become a famous daily commotion in class seven. Reactions varied from sometimes taking part in the conversation to ignoring. I walked past them to my seat and began unwrapping my scarf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Yuri had still made a proper use of her artistic talents and devoted all her energy to painting, perhaps this feeling of restlessness in my chest would still be a little easier to bear. However, Yuri hadn’t changed since the mixer, she hadn’t come to the club once, and I doubt she would paint at home. That was what made this irritation and envy even more unbearable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been nagging Yuri to come to club activities and draw pictures, but it was not only because of my personal feelings. Anyone who had seen Yuri’s paintings, even once, must have felt compelled to say something about the artist’s current attitude, just like Sugawara-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if this were a manga, perhaps you might still look stunning without makeup. But unfortunately, you are still stunning without makeup… just stunningly bad.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! I don’t want to be lectured by a potato-headed girl who knows nothing about makeup!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that I know nothing, there’s just no need to know,” shrugged Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huhhh? Aren’t you too annoying? Unbelievable, I&#8217;ve been dying of mental stress since morning… Yuri, are you compensating for this!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the ridiculous exchange continued until the teacher arrived.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, I blocked Yuri’s path as she was leaving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, Sousuke? Gonna confess or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As if I like you in the first place. You know, Yuri, you should really come to the club today. It’s December already, remember? The deadline for Kouji is the end of March, and I also want to see your new work.” I stared into her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care if you say so. I don’t feel like painting, so I won’t. What is impossible is impossible. If I had time to paint in the first place, I’d rather play.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, winning the Kouji would guarantee a recommendation letter into universities. It’s true that you’ll have less time to play now, but it would save a lot of time later on. It’s your gain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Yuri despited studying, I believed it was an effective way to persuade her. In fact, Yuri had intentionally won awards in junior high school just to get a recommendation to enter Maiei.  However, Yuri blatantly showed her annoyance as she let out a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is it up to you to decide what’s a loss or gain for me?” she said coldly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flinched at the unusually cold and dismissive look. My body trembled with frustration, but I straightened my back; I didn’t say anything wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not just me, until now, many people must have said the same thing. Isn’t that right?” I insisted, standing my ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just stop that boring talk. How about the exhibition ticket I gave you? Have you checked it out?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So now you try to change the topic… So I need to answer that, right?” Owning no other choice, I answered,  “I’ll be there next Sunday, the last day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I gave you two tickets, so why don’t you go twice? Unless you have a girl you can ask out,” she taunted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glared at the teasing genius in front of me. Originally, the ticket was specifically given to her, yet the notion of going herself didn’t seem to cross her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my silence, Yuri suppressed a laugh and added, “I’m just kidding, you already have Utako. Well then, I’m going home, bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to tell me that that was the end of the line, Yuri strode away. Joining Seino who was chatting with her friends as they set their course home. Yuri was not coming to club activity again today. ’As if I would just let you go,’ I gritted my teeth. As I scurry after them, I noticed people halting, their gaze piling on the courtyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri turned my direction and amusedly pointed. “There, Sugawara-senpai is being confessed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was said that confessing to Sugawara-senpai was an act of extreme bravery, either that or utter foolishness. When I peeked out the window to see what kind of guy was up to the challenge,  I saw Senpai and a guy talking. Although I could not see the man’s face, Senpai appeared as composed as usual. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the given distance, I wasn’t able to pick up their conversation, but as I watched the courageous challenger’s confession, Senpai bowed and turned to leave the scene. As expected, bravery could only carry him this far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The challenger persisted, probably chewing on his failure, but Senpai continued walking, not turning back even once. As I was about to avert my eyes, feeling sympathetic for the guy, he took a step forward. The brave challenger, who had become a bullish fool at this moment, seized Senpai’s wrist, unable to suppress his feelings.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plop! </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost yelped as Yuri slid the window open, stepped over the window sill, then dropped. I and Seino rushed to the window, eyes following as Yuri descended, skirt flapping, leggings revealed. She landed gracefully, snow cushioning her fall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a quick glance at Senpai and the guy, their face painted with surprise, before darting down the stairs myself. I quickly changed my shoes and charged into the courtyard. By the time I was there, the guy was gone, standing there was a giggling Senpai and Yuri, dusting snow off her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri! That was dangerous! What if you got an injury!?” I snapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An injury? How could I get hurt from something like this? I’ve already dealt with that guy. Really, a guy who dares to raise his fist to a woman deserves to be single for another hundred years!” she explained. Puffing her chest, Yuri was enjoying the feeling of being the hero of justice. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Yuri. If you hadn’t dealt with him, I might have taken action myself. Just the idea of getting into trouble before graduation terrifies me. So thanks, Yuri.” thanked Senpai</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Kaede-chan, no…Sugawara-senpai! We were just watching the commotion from upstairs, but… you were con… You were confessed?” gulped Seino, who had finally arrived, puffing white breath. Last time, she was too distracted to be aware of Senpai, but now, Seino was in full-on fangirl mode. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Seino-chan! Yeah, like you said, I was confessed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Personally, I don’t think any boy in this school is worthy of your beauty, so it’s normal you would turn them down… But was it because you already have a boyfriend? If you have one, then he must be either a celebrity or someone in the industry, right? Ah, if your agency doesn’t allow you to say it then you don’t have to!” Seino’s eyes glittered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seino, weren’t you over excited… Even I was embarrassed for you…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boyfriend? No, none. I’m moving straight to Tokyo after graduating and becoming a full-fledged model, so I’m not interested in anything that could cause a scandal. Right now, my dreams are more important than love. I got talent, so it would be a pity if I don’t make the most out of it, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai glanced at Yuri, as if to provoke her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… that’s the ’good girl answer’ for the media. I’ve never actually been in love, so I can’t say. I might even turn out to be the passionate type, who knows?” she suggested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter what choice you make, I will always support you, Sugawara-senpai!” gushed Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you–. I’m happy to hear that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not she was aware of senpai’s provocation, Yuri half listened to their exchange. When her eyes found me, she grinned, her amusement restored. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, Sousuke, since you are here, why don’t you ask some love advice from Senpai, she’s the most popular high school girl in Maimori, afterall.”</span></p>l

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me that kind of wink that I would never do even if I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Sousuke, is there something you want to ask from me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confused, I mumbled, “Um, no. I don’t think I do… Ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only after Yuri and Seino escaped the courtyard that I realized that the statement earlier was a bait. She got away again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, do you realize that the most popular high school girl in Maimori was being used by a stupid kouhai of hers to skip club activities…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;What–, Really!? You did it huh, Yuri! Hmph, it’s infuriating to be deceived like that! Well then, at least you could ask for some advice, so her statement could be partially true!” said Senpai, resolute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is your competitive spirit triggered by something like that!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Troubled, I stared at her up and down. Nope, with that composure, she was not backing down. Then it suddenly dawned on me. I rummaged for the tickets in my backpack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, would you like to go with me? A famous painter named Shouhei Kawabe is having a solo exhibition in Sapporo. This ticket was given to me by Yuri&#8230; and I think it is better to actually see and feel the work of a real painter once if you want to be an oil painting model. Senpai’s opinions about them could also be used as a reference. How about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So… just the two of us? I’m a popular model, after all, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yes.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really understand what you are talking about–&#8230; Well, okay. I’m going. What time and where to meet?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked my eyes, not expecting to get an OK.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, you’re really going?” I voiced my doubt into words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you the one inviting me? I don’t know anything about painting, so you’ll have to show me around, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we decided the date and the meeting place before we parted ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had invited her in the heat of the moment, thinking only about how having the model and the painter share their impressions of the same piece of art would improve the quality of the painting. That was what I was thinking. But to keep silent to Utako was like betraying her, so I sent her an explanatory message.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’m going to an art exhibition next Sunday with a senpai who will be a model for my painting form school. It’s for my painting, I don’t have any ulterior motives.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That sounded awfully like an excuse. Feeling guilty, I wrapped my arms around my head.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunday, December 9th. The train ride took around eighty minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two-story white building with a spacious garden welcomed us to the Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Senpai said it was her first visit to the museum, I had been here far more than ten times, though I did not remember the exact number. I had come here once with Yuri and her family during elementary school. At that time, Yuri had always found inspiration from things that no one expected here. She had even once used a sculpture from the shady corner of the museum as an inspiration. She never said it out loud, but she must have been looking forward to going to the museum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But since when? Since when did the adults see potential in Yuri’s growth began to actively try taking her to exhibitions. Since when did they force-invite her to lectures by big-name artists? Since when did Yuri gradually begin to complain that it was too much for her. Their own failing, that Yuri stopped drawing, was because they were blinded by their greed for her talent and how they disregarded her carefree  personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sousuke?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sugawara-senpai’s voice brought me back to reality. It was quite astonishing for me to think about Yuri despite the fact that I was in a situation that should have made other men jealous. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. Shall we go inside?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had invited Senpai today despite her hectic schedule, I couldn’t waste her precious time. This was not the time to be thinking about Yuri. I renewed my determination to enjoy today to the fullest, and went home with a good inspiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I told you briefly on the train, you will be surprised when you actually see Kawabe-sensei’s paintings.” I implied before stepping into the museum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shohei Kawabe was a master of realist painting, he specialized in realism and replication of reality. Surrounded by paintings so realistic that they could be mistaken for photographs, Senpai awed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The advantage of realistic paintings was how “straightforward” they were. For example, it was said that Picasso’s paintings were difficult for the general public to understand, while realistic paintings were possible for everyone to distinguish between beautiful or not. Besides me, Senpai’s eyes lit up as she enjoyed a painting of a woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved that she was enjoying the exhibit, and I too, was able to fully immerse myself in the appreciation of the displayed paintings. I, who did not like to pompously talk about my knowledge and Senpai, who was concentrating on the paintings with more enthusiasm than I had anticipated. At first glance, our lack of conversation might have suggested that we were an awkward couple, but for me, it was this silence that made me feel comfortable and at ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having fully enjoyed Kawabe-sensei’s world, I was left with an urge to paint. I was glad I came here. Satisfied, we left the exhibition. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, the exhibition’s good. How about you, Senpai? Are you tired yet?” I asked as we stepped through the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m totally fine. I’m not sure… This was the first time I have been to an exhibition of such a famous artist, so it was quite overwhelming, no… just plain interesting! It was better than I had imagined!” Senpai agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Happy to see Senpai speak excitedly, I broke into a smile as we neared the exit. Then I stopped in front of a souvenir shop near the main entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shop featured products related to Kawabe-sensei as well as art albums by other famous artists and other items that were relatively easy to access for those interested in art. I think this was a clever business strategy on the part of the museum to encourage guests who were exposed to art to buy souvenirs while they were still in the mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The museum seems to also sell Sensei’s catalog, related books, postcards, and other small items. Would you like to buy something as a memento?” I suggested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought of showing Senpai around the store since this was her first time here. However, as we entered the store, I was drawn in by a watercolor painting masterpieces collection and leafed through its pages, entranced, forgetting my original objective. I had never been interested in watercolors because the materials and techniques were different from those of oil painting I specialized in. But as I flipped through the pages, the thought of trying watercolor out didn’t seem so bad. The album was considerably heavy to carry back to Maimori, but I decided to buy it anyway. I then searched for Senpai. She appeared to me having a hard time choosing between two collections by Kawabe-sensei, her eyes darting from one to the other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I was wondering which to buy. But the more I think about it, the more troubled I become. Only if Yuri’s painting I saw in elementary school was in one of these, then I would certainly buy it without doubt. After all, my favorite painter is no one other than Yuri.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For one day, I tried to forget about Yuri’s existence, to enjoy the exhibit without this bitterness spoiling it. Yet, why must I be reminded of how amazing her paintings were, paintings drawn by an elementary schooler that could change lives. In front of that spectacular talent, how do I hide my envy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl was a genius, a genius that doesn’t draw,” my voice trembled, “No… that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">refuses </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to draw. I hate it when you say that someone like her is even better than Kawabe-sensei who paints for living, or me who earnestly hone my skills every day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was always the same. When I lashed out in resentment, it only sounded pathetic and regretful afterwards. Senpai, who bathed in the limelight and planned to enter the entertainment industry in Tokyo even with her country background, was undoubtedly someone from “that side”. She couldn’t understand my petty struggle, she would just snicker at me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People who work so diligently that they could drown in their own blood don’t achieve their dreams. They just don’t. If every effort is rewarded, then no one would be crying,” I snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai said nothing back, but of course, what was there to say? That was the truth. That was precisely… That was precisely why I was struggling. That was why it was painful. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… that kind of hardworking person isn’t bad, at least to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up, struck by her words, and noticed her gentle grip on my fingertips. There was no man whose heart didn’t skip a beat when his hand was entwined with the long and slender fingers of such a beautiful person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, I wasn’t sulking. Stop treating me like a child.” My face might have reddened, or perhaps not, there was no way I would know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not trying to comfort you either. I&#8217;m just doing it because I want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our eyes met for a long time. I had no idea what Senpai was thinking nor her intentions. However, I wasn’t here to do this with her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remembering about that shy girl who would always reside in my heart, I gently withdrew my hands from hers. Senpai didn&#8217;t look displeased, but rather, she stared at me and asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were born and raised in Maimori? Yuri too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right. Yuri and I have been together since nursery school, and I&#8217;m sick of her. More than half of my youth is wasted on taking care of her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha,” she smiled, “ that sounds like a lot of work. I&#8217;m going to Tokyo right after I graduate from high school, but how about you two?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m aiming for an art college in Tokyo too, but Yuri… I wonder what she&#8217;s going to do. I don’t think she can survive without me, but then I also feel like she would be just fine living alone on a deserted island…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I think she just can’t survive in the society,’ was what I was going to say when–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By ‘Yuri’, do you mean Kashiwazaki Yuri-san?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprised by a low voice that could never be Senpai’s, I spun. There, a lanky man in black jacket was standing. Judging by how his hair was streaked by patches of gray, his age was probably a little over his fifties. No, not just any old man, I had seen him before. I had just seen him on a poster in front of the store, the artist hosting this very exhibition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked in confidence, yet my voice came out in a shrill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are…S-Shouhei Kawabe-sensei,… aren’t you!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I’m honored. Hmm.” His eyes found the album in Senpai’s hands. “I would be very happy if you buy it. There’s not much of it in circulation, a rare collection, so to speak. I’ll also sign it for you.” With that, he bent down to sign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt defiant at the balant marketing, or maybe at this person in general, he somehow had the aura that made me feel so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? W-wow!? Why are you here?” Senpai cried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? It’s my exhibition in my hometown, you know? Today is the last day too, why wouldn’t I come to see how things are going? Now, why don’t you answer my question?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I recall, a few moments ago, he mentioned a familiar name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you know her, Kashiwazaki Yuri?” I hesitated</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes, of course. I mean, I am, you know, a fan of hers.” he professed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bombshell dropped, stupefied, my eyes met with Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was one of the judges for a drawing contest she entered in her eighth grade summer break. I was blown away, to admit. ‘It was not something that a teenager could draw; there was definitely a ghostwriter drawing for her.’ was what I thought.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how vexing it was, that piece was imprinted into my mind too. Finally persuaded to draw by the offered highschool recommendation, she spent one remaining week of the summer break painting. Probably using the theory of how something familiar tended to be drawn faster, she drew a self portrait. From the singular strand of hair to the texture of skin, every element was impeccably captured by her realistic painting technique.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more time she spent, the more intricate the expression became. That was a painting that she spent one week of her summer break painting. No matter how hard she could have concentrated on the work, anyone would have a hard time believing that it was done in one week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hadn’t been the judge the next year, but when I heard that she submitted another work, I just had to go. And when I saw it, a sigh escaped my lips… Ah, of course I sighed in admiration. It was magnificent. Though it was drawn in a completely different style, it was breathtaking all the same,” he admired, “With the unlimited potential she possesses, I can’t help but have high hopes for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t believe that even Shouhei Kawabe held her in such high esteem. This time, the second painting Kawabe-sensei mentione, was an abstract creature from the depths of the sea. Overflowing with uniqueness and individuality, Yuri’s drawing received tons of support and won for two consecutive years in a record breaking landslide. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know the English word for genius?” asked Kawabe-sensei, fixing his gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><b>[TN:Original Japanese being “天才”, meaning prodigy/genius/talented]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Genius</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Then what about talent?”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Original Japanese being “才能”, meaning talent/ability]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Talent</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’, I think…” I faltered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Talent’, another word I hated, yet something yearned for more than anything. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not that good at English, but I could understand that many words. However, Kawabe-sensei chortled as if I had given the wrong answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess you could say that,” he said, “but I prefer the other word: ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’. In other words, talent can be seen as a gift from god.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you are saying that our skills are decided even before birth? No matter how much effort ordinary people put in, there’s no way to beat them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could already imagine how Kawabe-sensei would react to my insolent remark. Still, from my point of view, these ‘talented people’ deserved to be snapped at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, how would I know? But there is a saying that a genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent effort. That is why I want to set Kashiwazaki-san in the right environment and guide her to the right path.” agreed Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using that quote, Kawabe sensei skillfully evaded my question. With a fluid movement, he signed the album in his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let alone plan about her future, I heard that she hasn’t even picked up her paintbrush, even though it’s her second year of high school already. From my speculation, I’d say her lack of motivation is due to a lack of stimulation,” he noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How did you know that Yuri hasn’t been painting?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t look at me like that. There’s nothing sketchy about this. I am by no means a stalker of Kashiwazaki-san. I just asked Hiiragi-san about her career path a while ago. I heard that she does not seem to have any intention of going to an art college nor studying abroad. I know I am a complete stranger to her, but as someone who paints for living, and an old man who wants to see a bright future of the Japanese art world, I’m concerned about her future.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suppressing the urge to say ‘Getting out of your way to ask Hiiragi-sensei about Yuri, that’s quite stalkerish in itself’, I mulled over the fact that someone like Kawabe-sensei cared that much about a single highschool girl. Yuri, just how amazing could you be?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also asked the museum director to mail her tickets for the exhibition. Seems like she couldn’t come.” He shook his head. “I also mailed her my business card along with the tickets. Could you tell her that I am waiting to hear from her anytime and will spare no effort to help her with anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his hand placed on my shoulder, on his face a reassuring smile, I was even more offended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not your messenger boy,” I growled, “I’m Komiya Sousuke and one day, I’ll be a painter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawabe-sensei’s expression didn’t falter. Just like that, he went to another room with his staff. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the album signed, Senpai had no choice but to buy it. After Senpai finished her purchase, we left the store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it. It’s not just me, Yuri’s paintings are just that great, right?” marveled Senpai. All the while, she had been as silent as a Jizo statue. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Jizo statues are real cuteeee… what a useless TN]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Even Kawabe-sensei, who sees lots of artwork, had taken a shine to her… Just like what you experienced, her paintings capture hearts,” I agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was the aftereffect of Kawabe-sensei’s admiration that compelled me to reveal my honest feelings. I found myself praising her too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pencils, paintbrushes, crayon, you name it… whatever you give her, what she returns are masterpieces. Bold yet delicate, with a sense of motion that seems to leap out from the canvas any moment…I’m charmed by her paintings. The first time I saw her painting… I was awestruck… It was as if my fate had been sealed…Uh, don’t tell her about this, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that didn’t mean I approve of how she rested on her laurels and refused to make further effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oblivious of my dilemma, Senpai whispered in admiration, “You sure like Yuri al lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way. Never once have I had any romantic feelings for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? But you have an admiration sort of affection for her talent, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not that too! Definitely not!” I snapped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflexively, I had aggressively dismissed like how I would do when Yuri teased. That I admired her skill as a painter– was a fact that I myself never wanted to admit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because I had snapped at her, Senpai’s eyes widened in surprise. Shoot. That was unnecessary, it would only make her even more suspicious about our relationship. I needed to be calm… but once riled up, emotions could not easily settle down. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sorry I snapped! It’s not that you had offended me, it&#8217;s more of a habit! I just can’t help it!” Even my apology sounded forceful. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to apologize…So, what are we going to do next?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked my watch. Despite it being winter, there was still plenty of time left before sunset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to my plans, I was to invite Senpai for dinner, discuss the impressions of the paintings we saw and decide on which direction to proceed for the Kouji Exhibition. If I could start working on it by tomorrow then that would be a plus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” I hesitated, “You are quite busy, right? Then let’s go back to Maimori.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with that awkward exchange with Kawabe-sensei, how he had completely seen through my jealousy towards Yuri, I was in no mood to carry out the plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to shake off the black haze in my chest, I parted with Senpai after we got back to Maimori. Legarthicly, I dragged myself home, and using my last ounce of strength, I heaved myself onto the bed. Was it immediately after, or was it a while, I didn’t know, but noticing my phone vibrating, I checked the message. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Art museum? How luckyyy. I want to go there too! Did you have fun?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A message came from Utako. It was an innocent question, but it hit where it hurted. I clicked and the screen turned black. I closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if Yuri was having a good time doing stupid things and laughing like a fool while I toiled and suffered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help it, but just the thought of her irked me. Just what kind of childhood friend I was…?</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm” mused Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The following week, after school. Across the desk, my homeroom teacher, Yoshioka-sensei scowled at me, then at the printout once more. The title of the printout read, “Career aspiration”. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that You want to go to an art university in Tokyo… But have you decided on your specific dream for your future?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” I replied, “I like oil paintings, so I want to major in it. I also wish to make a living with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of all times, the school decided to hold a student-teacher meeting now. For the past record, the meeting did nothing but worsen my depressed state. The discomfort was because of the fact that I had never received a positive response to my future plans. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From your personality, you might not like what I am going to say… but as an educator, I need to say this. Art schools are bound to have two to three dropouts every year, even if you could manage it, it doesn’t mean that you could be a painter. Only a handful of people made it. To be honest, I don’t recommend it,” claimed Yoshioka-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoshioka-sensei was a biology teacher. Despite being outside his field of expertise, his statements weren’t wrong. But to me, who had already done a lot of research on my career path, it was a fact that I had already accepted a long time ago. I clenched my fists. Even though I had already expressed my passion, he had flatly rejected my resolve, my dream of pursuing a career in this field. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know Kashiwazaki has more achievements, but you are not far behind, and you have the confidence. However, Maimori is a small town, being confident just because you draw better than most people is no different than a frog in the well. There will come a day when you will be pummeled by the wider world. Do you still wish to advance on that path?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sighed, “Being stubborn is not going to take you anywhere, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not being stubborn. This is just who I am.” I locked my stare to his. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After exchanging stares for about five seconds, the stern-faced Sensei suddenly relaxed, his expressions softened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I already thought you would say that. You sure are adamant,” said Yoshioka-sensei, unable to keep amusement from his voice. He swept his pen over the printout, writing comments somewhat happily. “I haven’t talked to your parents yet, so I don’t know what they think about your future plans. However, if you fail to get into your desired university, whether you will be a ronin, or whether you are considering technical school, in these cases, you need to convince your parents. At such times, having a way with words will be important. You are quite persuasive and have a lot of achievements, right? But if you can present your future aspirations in a more concrete manner, it will be easier for me to support you.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Ronin, term for graduates who </b><b>failed to enter a school at the next level, and consequently is studying outside of the school system for entrance in a future year.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to past records, that response was good enough, so I obediently nodded in agreement. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to go to an art university, then you need to prepare for the practical exam fast. You are almost in your third year now, right? Face your dreams and consider things you need to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will,” I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believed I had been taking this seriously, yet why did adults around me only see it as a childish dream? Shoulders slumped, I left the room and headed straight to the art club.  There was no activity today, but several members were present, each of them painting. I made my way to the easel holding my canvas, put on my apron to prevent the paint from staining my uniform, and dipped my brush into the paint. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Colors, shape, and shades, you cannot paint unless you could envision where these elements were to be. I drew a breath. I stroked my brush. Carefully, carefully. I might be repetitive about this, but I put my love into every piece I paint. I ran my brush over the canvas, the painting taking shape, coming closer to completion. Yuri’s painting I covered was still as it was, still awaiting its creator. Naturally, every member of the art club, Hiiragi-sensei included, were all eager to see it completed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But no matter how I urged her to draw, she always refused, one way or another. According to her, “This painting is no longer fun to draw.”.  I tightened my grip on the paintbrush. What’s wrong with you? There’s no way someone who couldn’t even finish a painting could make a living of it.</span></p>

<p><b>[TN: Sousuke, I heard that Da Vinci didn’t finish lots of paintings] </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I could imagine her face as she said, “I don’t intend to make a living as an artist in the first place.”. My hands trembled. I didn’t think someone who left their work unfinished could be a decent member of society!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Damn you. I was the one who drew more painting, I was the one who put in more effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Why was it Yuri who received all the attention? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was it her that got all the praise!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Why!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, Sousuke, why do you seem on edge?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did I look like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aura of anger is flooding this room, and it came from you.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait. That comment could only come from one person…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuri!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a start, my head snapped up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I gaped, Yuri said, “Don’t be so loud, I would be in trouble if Hiiragi-sensei finds out. I went out of my way to find a day that there’s no club activity, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? My eyes swept the room; the other club members were already gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pouting, Yuri examined my painting. She was not the type to criticize other people’s drawing, much less giving pointers, but I was anxious about what she might think of my work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Sousuke, why are you usually drawing with a frown?” she asked, her eyes still on the painting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-why, you say… It’s quite painful when you are giving birth to something, right?” I parried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was decent for a spur-of-the-moment answer, perhaps a bit curt. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri tilted her head, then professed nonchalantly, “Hmph, that sounds difficult. Whatever the purpose, I only thought about whether I am enjoying it or not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t really understand what she meant, but what she said displayed our difference in class. She, a genius, I, an ordinary person. My eyes became hot. When did it start? When did I start prioritizing surpassing Yuri over having fun. When did my source of determination come from frustration, from my grudge against Yuri? I felt like screaming. Tears started collecting in my eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s how geniuses think? Good for you. You can draw anything with ease, win awards as much as you like, like it was nothing.” I shuddered. “Has art ever worried you!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes you become sober the moment you put those emotions into words. This time too, I regained my calmness just after I foolishly revealed my jealousy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eek! The realization hit me. That was totally presumptuous. At best, she would look at me in contempt…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned away in embarrassment, but her ultramarine blue eyes did not let me go. I cowered under her piercing gaze, as if she was judging me. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You have no idea of the pressure of having to draw nothing less than a masterpiece… nor the pressure of having to come up with an awe-inspiring concept. Despite you understanding none of that, you still…” </span></i></p>
<p><b>[TN:The text in italics were inaudible to Sousuke]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuri’s whispers were barely audible, the only thing I could make sense of was  “&#8230;Pressure&#8230;Despite you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, what did you say?” There was no way I could piece together what she meant by those three words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I asked her back, that piercing gaze earlier was nowhere to be seen. Instead, she placed her hand on my shoulder in an aloof manner. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t say anything? I didn’t come here to paint, I just wanted to check on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait? What do you mean?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned on her heels and said, “I meant it as it is. Now that I have seen your face, I’m going home, see you later.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Yuri!” I rose and gave chase. But at that moment Sugawara-senpai entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!? What was that? So you two are really like that!?” she gasped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I frowned. “How could you show up at the worst possible time again…” Then I remembered. “No, I was the one who asked you to come here… Well, I’ll repeat again, there’s no way I and Yuri are dating. I’m not interested in her as a girl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People like Senpai, who were neither too far nor too close, always found teasing our relationship funny. I ran my hand through my hair and then beckoned Senpai to sit. Today, I invited senpai over for the painting for the Kouji exhibit. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sousuke, you look a bit down. Do you want to talk about it?” said Senpai, concerned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those kind words were effective on my weakened spirit. The next thing I noticed was that I had asked Senpai for advice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a bit unsure about my future… You plan to go to Tokyo immediately after high school, right? Have you thought about getting a degree first?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. I haven’t thought about it at– all.” She flung her head back, staring at the ceiling. “My parents and homeroom teachers advised me to take the entrance examination, saying that it would be better to have something to back me up in case things didn&#8217;t go well. Insurance, you could say that. But I don&#8217;t need insurance. I only see a vision of success. If your passion matches your talent, what’s left to worry about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How she answered without a moment&#8217;s hesitation gave me goosebumps. I realized how frightening it was to see people who were aware of their talents, set goals, and pushed forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was so cool. If I were some manager, then I wouldn’t hesitate to hire her on the spot. She was someone that you could trust to do the job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… Well, you are not talented like me nor Yuri, so continue worrying, young man.” She patted my head, shattering my hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do I get the feeling that you would say that?” I sighed. Senpai giggled as I failed to brush away her hand on my head. </span></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, let&#8217;s get started. What kind of poses should I do? Could I just pose like how I would when modeling?” She changed the topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poses for photo shooting are usually to capture the beauty of that moment, but a portrait model is expected to hold the same pose for hours. You can go through poses that you are comfortable with, I will tell you to stop when I find the pose I want to draw.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What–, that&#8217;s pretty insulting. I don’t get tired that easily! Don’t you dare look down on me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that my taunt had worked on her, as Senpai appeared to be in full model mode. To admit, whatever pose Senpai took, it was eye snatching. After some troubled stops, I decided on a left-facing pose, irreverently similar to Johannes Vemeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring”.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: I’m not sure how Sousuke’s instructions were insulting to Senpai, the intricacies of Japanese culture, I think.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a deep breath, I ran my pencil across the canvas. In a normal one-on-one drawing of a person, the artist should have been the one to determine the painting, but when I let my guard down, perhaps it was because of her striking appearance, I found myself being led on by her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her beauty was beyond any expression. If I hadn’t steeled my resolve, I would have been drawn in by that alluring atmosphere of hers. But this is my painting, I wouldn’t let her determine my work, nor would I let her dilute my style in this painting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Draw. That was what I concentrated on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell into a trance. My hand and pencil as one. At this pace, I was sure that the result will be–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m bored already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wha–?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the word, my focus wavered. Then I realized that I was lost in my thoughts, it could have been a long time already. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was only five minutes when I checked the time.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/z6MR77H/BE1-FFDF0-B8-F1-4-A27-8616-0-E1768-A431-A1.jpg" height="500" width="350"</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Already? I’m sorry,&#8230; but could you please bear with it a little longer? We’ll take a break after finishing this part.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Painting modeling could be demanding work; that was why I was planning to have a break every twenty minutes to avoid Senpai becoming stiff. I was also going to play some music from the artist she had told me she liked. It was ignorant of me to be unaware of this possibility. Though Senpai might be a model, she was not experienced in model painting, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I think I’m the one who underestimated this… Can I at least chat with you?” She apologized.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine with me. But I don’t want to stop drawing, my replies might be terse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ok. Do you have a girlfriend, Sousuke?” She queried.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:What a great way to start a convo.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not yet.” My relationship with Utako was…special.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about a girl you like?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is. Utako Kashii is her name. She moved away at the end of the fifth grade.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was already tired of denying when Senpai asked about my relationship with Yuri, this was the chance of coming clean about everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?&#8230; There are many people who try to appeal to me by lying that they have no wife or girlfriend or whatsoever. You’re different. Quite high points you got with that answer.” Her expression seemed to soften.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For my part, I was simply stating a fact, but for some reason, she found that commendable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But why though. Why do I feel a bit queasy? Is it because you talked fondly of another woman in front of me?” she murmured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said you hate losing, right? And you also have the pride of a  popular model, so I can see why… Or do you like me?” I quickly joked in hope of lightening the mood. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe that wasn&#8217;t a good choice. Senpai tensed, then shot me a seducing glance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know…” She shrugged. “Which do you think it was?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t expect some advanced romantic tactic from someone who is still in love with his first love.” I brushed her off, turning my face away from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai’s laughter at my pathetic attempt of resistance reached my ears.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I hadn’t done well on English mock exams, I’ll do better next time! You too, Yu-chan, good work with the exam. Is Yuri okay?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When our conversation came this way, about tests and studying, Utako usually asked about Yuri. Reminded of how Yuri had been playing around the whole test period, I sighed as I typed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If she tries to, she can do it. But you know that she hardly does that. Her score was just enough to pass.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she was admitted by a recommendation for her talent in arts, she had the potential to become Maiei’s top students if she studied hard enough. However, Yuri’s present state…Sleeping in classes, skipping school, and turning in assignments late. In other words, barely scraping by. By being constantly put on edge by her behavior, Yuri’s parents had the most sincere of my respect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few hours after the rankings for the second semester final exam were posted. I strengthen my resolve to do my best to not only draw but also to study too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the troublemaker girl sat down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hear you are quite popular lately,” Yuri started sprouting her usual nonsense, pointing the straw of her beloved strawberry au lait at me. “‘Yuri, have you forgotten our promise?’ wasn’t it. I thought you were madly in love with Utako? Now you are just enjoying being seduced by Sugawara Kaede, forgetting about Utako, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My anger flared. Not because of her accusation, but rather because of how upsetting it was for someone like Yuri, who had seen how much I love Utako from up close, saying that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I still love her. How could I even forget her?” I hadn’t done anything wrong, so instead of cowering, I looked straight into her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Yuri, who was looking at me with her judging cat-like eyes, lifted the corner of her mouth and snickered. “Hmm. But Utako’s not here, right? I’m sure she wouldn’t know if you dally with other women for a bit. For an unattractive guy like you, I’m sure you’re cherishing your days with the popular model Sugawara Kaede. No?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trembled. “&#8230;What’s with you? What’s your point!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t her usual teasing. It was more provocative, more aggressive, she was pushing me. She was aiming for the kill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Depending on her next statement, I might just as well grant her wish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re aiming for me, aren’t you? That was the point of your cooperation, wasn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Who do you think you are, don’t be presumptuous,’ I bit my lip… I couldn’t. What she said was true. Owning no argument, I kept silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sousuke, can’t you keep your eyes on me?” She stared at me with those keen eyes of hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quite a self-centered order. I’m not your property,” I snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her statement earlier wasn’t out of jealousy, but rather something similar to a child being upset because her toy was taken. While I understood why she acted like that, our classmates didn’t, and a murmur had already spread through the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you two! Fishermen are coming to the Maimori Snow Festival! Wanna go see them?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From nowhere, Seino chimed in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because she was looking at her phone the whole time? Or was it because she knew us well? Seino appeared to be oblivious of the tension between us as she broke the news with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her interjection, I could finally catch a break. My anger towards Yuri receded, and I regained my composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? The TV’s coming? Of course I’ll go! I want to be on screennn!” beamed Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Happiness, joy, boredom, irritation. Under her tyranny, her every emotion was vented on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me getting along with Sugawara-senpai, she could whip out insults just with something like that. For now, she went full force on me, but the day she changed her target to someone else was bound to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her boyfriend or her husband in the future, I could already feel sorry for them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the blink of an eye, Christmas and New Year festivals were over. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wednesday, February 6th, the first day of Maimori Snow Festival&#8217;s sculpting period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the people participating in the name of Maiei High were only me, Igarashi, and Saegusa. I tried telling them that we were the chosen ones who were given special missions, but the freezing cold did a better job demoralizing us.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so cold that even with layers of inner shirts, down jackets, hats, and rubber gloves bore no effect. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-this is colder than I imagined…We really are staying here for three days?” The first complaint came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This may seem like the worst, but the real show’s after sundown. There’s never too many jackets to wear out here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time here for Saegusa, and she was already complaining. No wonder. The temperature in Maimori at this time of the year was basically below freezing point. Although there were several places to warm up inside the Maimori Sports Ground, the actual location for the festival, none of the devices were even in the vicinity of the sculpting venue. In this temperature, with a gigantic cube of snow two meters high, deep, and wide looming in front of us, no matter how much time spent planning the work, it just seemed impossible to create art from this thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s tough, but the sense of accomplishment you get when it’s finished isn’t something you get to experience often, so let&#8217;s go for it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snow sculpting work will be for three days, from today to the 8th, within the restricted time of 10:00 to 21:30. For school, we would be accounted for as an official absence. Since we had only three people, we had already discussed everything during our countless meetings. This event was basically a race against time, afterall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let’s get started!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fished out a bottle of color spray from the toolbox provided by the management.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first step of snow sculpting was to draw a perimeter. I placed one hand on the block, the other flipping through the plans. Then I started drawing the perimeter, lines and curves stretching from one edge to another. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The perimeter marking served as a blueprint indicating where to cut in. It was said that a single misplaced line could spell disaster for the entire work. Which… There were many discrepancies in mine, some major and had to be redrawn. There was still a long road ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. I think I’ll tap out here. Good luck, Igarashi.” Realizing my limitations, I gave up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be bummed, it wasn’t that bad. I’ll do my best!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, it was my and Igarashi’s job to roughly remove snow along the perimeter. If not for the coldness, I would have been damp with sweat as I wielded my scoop shovel, shoving it into the cube, carving. We proceeded cautiously, snow starting to pile at our feet. When the process was done, the results were quite impressive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Saegusa joined us as we began chiseling the finer parts, carving in with our chisels. Since it was her first year, Saegusa struggled a lot, carving out parts that she shouldn&#8217;t, making parts that should be symmetrical look uneven. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Komiya-senpai, how do I get this right?” she moaned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I’m not good at this either… Let’s try being more careful, using constant, subtle pressure?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was the second year for I and Igarashi, and we had somewhat remembered the process, our performance until now was far from satisfactory. I could proudly claim that we were doing this with care, but nothing of creating a striking work of art. To put it bluntly, “high school students did their best,” should be the reception for our sculpture, nothing more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It pained me to be able to offer only rudimentary advice like that. If Yuri was here, her hand would move with a frightening speed and accuracy, not to mention her otherworldly spatial awareness. She would have fixed the faults, turning imbalance into a flowing pose instead. She might even give us pointers of where to improve, where to cut and what shape would be made by doing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I fantasizing about? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slapped my cheeks hard with my gloved hands. Why was I even hoping for her to appear? It was precisely because of this, that I was still chasing her back. I needed to be more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of us worked together, filling in each other’s shortcomings, moving across the sculpture. Finally, the initial unevenness was less visible. While our skills were still poor, our sculpting skills improved considerably for only half a day. Perhaps it was because of the pressure, of how we desperately raced against time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around 16:00, as we were clearing the excess snow, Hiiragi-sensei arrived. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh, you’re doing pretty well”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re late! You said that you have classes, but wasn’t that only the first period?! Come and shove the snow for us!” I snapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snow fell mercilessly. In snow sculpting, you couldn’t leave the snow as it is, since it would freeze up and stick to the sculpture. Because of that, even during the sculpting process, we were not spared from having to clear off the snow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be so upset, Komiya. I brought you some refreshments, so let&#8217;s take a break.” he announced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After calling out the other two, Hiiragi-sensei revealed a box in his handbag. It contained several delicious looking cakes. We all gulped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I brought them online from a renowned patisserie in Ginza,” he explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our grumbles went silent, such was the principle of capitalism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for the food–!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We fought over the delicious ones and shared the decent ones. High-quality sugar consumed, my strength returned. When the night came, the heavy snowfall had hindered our sculpting. Alas, the first day ended with more progress than expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the second day, Saegusa had gotten the hang of the sculpting process. While she was still slow, she did a fine job. Both I and Igarashi also gave it our all. The second day passed favorably. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After three days of work, our snow sculpture of “Monomon”, the well-known anime character, came to completion.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 31st Maimori Snow Festival had been thriving since the first day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both local residents and tourists seemed to be enjoying the festival atmosphere. Since it was Maimori’s biggest event, the town went full-on festival mode. Stalls waffled with the scents of mouthwatering foods, amazake to the left, ramen to the right, with sizzling konamono and steaming nikuman around the corner. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: amazake, traditional sweet, low-alcohol Japanese drink made from fermented rice.]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: konamono, flour based dishes such as okonomiyaki or takoyaki.]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: Nikuman, Japanese-style steamed pork buns]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: What a barrage of TNs]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those were merely appetizers for the snow sculptures, the very representation of a snow country, the main event that all these tourists came here for. With the total of fifty sculptures placed at every interval, the fair ground was a sight to behold. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For our sculpture… According to our plan, it was supposed to be a simple, undetailed sculpture of Monomon. The awkward curves, the messy texture that was better off none existent. We concluded the sculpting process at that, before we ruined it. People could already recognize it as monomon anyway. But the fact that we lacked the skill and knowledge needed in sculpting only a single snow sculpture was obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter from which angle, the sculpture wasn’t something we could proudly present to others. But this was the result of our effort, we had done everything we could, there was satisfaction in that. </span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the fifth and the final day of the Snow festival. Igarashi, who wasn’t athletic in the first place, slumped against the folding chair she brought while Segasa rushed to massage her shoulders. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sooo tired…” she croaked in a voice that couldn’t possibly come from a highschool girl, “Every muscle hurts… Hahh, I think I have lost three kilos through the festival.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright? Don’t push yourself, you can go home now,” I reassured, “I heard that only one member has to attend the awarding ceremony, so I’ll stay… I’m sorry if I sounded like I was pushing you. If you insist then I suppose we could take a break in the resting area.” Was that too verbose, I wondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh–,” she groaned, “Ours won’t get any anyway, guess I’ll follow your word and go home. I think my anemia has just gotten worse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she mentioned it, she did look pale. I wanted to see her off, but I had to attend the awarding ceremony. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saegusa. I&#8217;m sorry, but could you accompany Igarashi home with me? Sorry, I know you&#8217;re tired too, but I just can’t let Igarashi go home alone in that state.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I will! Of course. I mean, you don’t need to apologize. That kind side of you, I… Ah, n-noting!” She turned to Igarashi. “I-Igarashi-senpai, let’s go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saegusa readily obliged my request, reaching for Igarashi’s bag with a blush. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Komiya. I’ll leave the rest to you,” said Igarashi, clasping her hands together apologetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah. Don’t sweat about it, get some rest… Really, I’m grateful for your hard work. Well, putting the quality of sculpture aside… I’m glad I participated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For two months, including the preparation period, we worked together toward a single goal. Perhaps it was because the strange sense of loneliness we carried, the bond we forged during the event was stronger than I had expected. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the two of them had already left, the celebration party was set to a later date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite everything, I was impressed by our results. Though, as the club leader, I needed to get more people to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi–, there you are, young man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said a woman, imitating the voice of an old man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she really think that I couldn’t recognize her voice? I was finally overwhelmed by the accumulated fatigue as I looked at the unexpected visitor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gehh…” came a sigh so feeble I didn’t want Utako to hear. “Yuri… and Seino too. What are you guys even doing here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had already told you before, hadn’t I? The Fishermen are coming to the festival; we are here for them,” explained Seino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t have anything to object to Seino, but Yuri… How dared she show up here after declining my request for her to participate. Did she even know what awkward was? If she came here thirty minutes earlier, when Igarashi was still around, there was bound to be bloodshed. Igarashi was quite aggressive when it came to Yuri’s attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re really lucky… If Igarashi hadn’t left yet, she would have cut you into pieces,” I mused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I have a sketchbook I keep in remembrance of Sousuke, so that should save my life,” laughed Yuri.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, isn’t that from last night’s movie? And I mean, sketchbooks are paper, right? So how will it protect you?” Seino retorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did the “In remembrance of Sousuke” supposed to mean? I ain’t dead!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And with this ‘Monomon’&#8230; This is worse than I expected. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I can make a better snow sculpture! I’ll make a special one just for you, Utako!’, was it? Let alone a special one for Utako, how could you talk so big with this performance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m surprised you could still remember that… Aside from that, I don’t have anything to say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t underestimate my recollection, okay? That near-proposal too, was at the festival, right?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have an amazing memory,” I sighed, “Why don’t you use it in studying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sing my praise. Admire me. Worship me. Give me your offerings.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do I have to? Don’t get carried away,” I chided her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we exchanged some nonsense, people gathered into a crowd in an eyeblink. Everyone seemed to be in a rush, many floundered amidst the mass. What might it be…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! There!” called out Seino, tiptoeing, “Isn’t that the Fishermen in the center?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the direction she pointed, two men stood out. Despite the freezing cold, the Fishermen wore suits. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Seino’s precise prediction of their direction via SNS, we were able to intercept their route just in time. Celebrity coming to Maimori was beyond rare, so onlookers continued to increase exponentially. Looking around, it was as if all the cell phones were directed at the Fishermen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being a celebrity sure is hard,” I appalled, “With all these social media, do they even have privacy? I can’t even imagine how stressful this is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but social media’s also how they get more fans. Besides, by posting them, they get free advertisements, you know? It also establishes a way to interact with fans. Kaede-chan’s doing this too, haven’t you seen it already?” Seino shoved her phone into my face, the screen showed Sugawara-senpai’s SNS profile. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, come to think of it, I&#8217;ve never checked it out before,” I recalled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sousuke’s an old man, don’t expect him to understand that kind of culture. It’s about time he starts balding and smelling like an old man,” said Yuri, her eyes still on the Fishermen. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you stop with that abusive language? You don’t even know how to use a smartphone.”</span></p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As they drew closer, I noticed that they were quite talkative, as expected of a comedian. The small, portly man was the Boke and the other, the burly man, was the Tsukkomi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: “Tsukkomi”, the straight man, and “Boke”, the funny man. These two were the roles in Manzai Comedy]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hahh, the homemade croquettes the lady gave me were delicious!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You eat too much! We came all the way here to the festival, but all you do is eat! You’re giving the viewers the impression that Maimori is all about food!”</span></p>



<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“It’s your fault for bringing me close to the food,” quipped the portly man, “but look at all these snow sculptures! Looks like we are finally in the snow sculpture area. Let’s go talk to the sculptors!”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The moment the portly man began looking for someone to interview, Yuri’s eyes lit up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Here! Hereee!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With her hand raised like what students do in classes, Yuri told a barefaced lie. All eyes that existed there simultaneously turned to Yuri, including the Fishermen’s.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Huh?!…You’re embarrassing me! Stop it!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But despite my protest, the Fishermen made their way here as Yuri continued to appeal to them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What an energetic girl! What grade are you in?” asked the portly man.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“High school second year! These two are my classmates!” reliped Seino.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Following her word, Fishermen’s eyes and the camera were turned our way. Under their stare, I tensed. Seino was completely out of her mind while Yuri still continued to talk to them nonchalantly. Repressing my fear of the camera, I forced myself to stand between Yuri and the microphone pointed at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“S-sorry for your inconvenience! These guys have nothing to do with the snow sculpting, they just want to be on screen! I’m sorry for wasting your time, please ignore these two!” I bowed, angle precise ninety. Hahh… Why did I have to do a follow up everytime. And given how immediate my response was, I guessed&nbsp; it had become a habit ingrained into my very existence. Would they think that I did this because I cared about Yuri? Better come up with an excuse that I can’t ignore people in need. I </span><i class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">didn’t</span></i><span class="calibre6"> want Yuri to start teasing me again.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Oh, I see. You seem to be having a day-to-day struggle. What a poor thing, want some booze? I’ll pay,” offered the portly man, his hand on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You idiot! Don’t offer alcohol to minors, especially on TV!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was nice to have one of the Fishmen holding me by the shoulder and brush it off with a joke. As soon as I began to feel relieved that it settled well, Yuri pushed me away and took up position in front of the camera again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Utakoo! How are you doing? I know you’re quite busy, so good luck in Tokyooo!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Everyone around me froze, even the burly man’s eyes widened in surprise. I broke a cold sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What a willful girl we have here. A girl like you’s gonna be a big shot. By the way, is this ‘Utako’ your friend?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, she is precious to me and this guy here,” she then asked the Fishermen, “You have female friends too right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm, yeah. There’s a lot going on here. And I heard that I’m quite popular… Wait, why are we talking about women at my turn!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The burly man’s long awaited tsukkomi brought laughter to the audience. I, too, laugh along with them, not because it was funny, but because Yuri admitted that Utako was precious to her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The conversation went on for a while, before they left after they finished filming.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ah&ndash;! That was a blast&ndash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“We even got pictures&ndash;. Oh, man, I’ve gotta upload them,” said Seino.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">They were both in a good mood. Well, being entertained directly by a world famous comedy duo was more than exciting.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I wonder if it will be on air. Looking forward to it&ndash;!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“They have a servicemind, so they talked to us, that’s it. You two are not even in the snow sculpting production in the first place. I’m sure talking to us wasn’t in their programme… One of them even offered me booze, no matter how much of a gag it was, I don’t think that would get on air,” I reminded them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ehh?! We won’t be on TV? I’ve talked so much!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When Yuri pouted, the snow sculptures began to light up. The light brought the sculptures to another level of beauty. Around us, the crowd cheered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her eyes fixed on the sculptures, Yuri muttered, “Christmas and Snow Festival lighting up is always a spectacle. That’s a lot of effort… Which reminds me, Sousuke, have you ever given Utako a Christmast present or anything?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Huh? I haven’t. Well, I did send messages on her birthday and other occasions though?… Umm, isn’t getting a present from a guy you didn’t even date a bit troubling?” I looked at their faces in confusion.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">They both looked at each other. While Yuri sighed amusedly, Seino tilted her head in confusion.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I mean, you two have feelings for each other, right? How would she be troubled when she got a present from someone she likes? It doesn’t hurt to try.” Seino might just as well slap me. No, being slapped might be a better choice. Her words just pierced my heart. “Whatever is fine, just find a reason to give her, I’m sure she would be happy. What are you even doing up until now, you insensitive virgin.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">They were mocking me, alright. But they did have a point. Even the glowing sculptures seemed to be peering at me, condemning, asking me, “What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri’s grin reflected in my downcast eyes. “Ah!” She looked at me as if she remembered something. “I think you already know this, but Utako’s birthday’s next week.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah, of course, of course… I’ll get her something this year, roger.” I pulled my hands up in surrender.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">What to give Utako on her seventeenth birthday was something I had never thought about before. A part of my brain started firing up, but short-circuited due to years of inactivity. Would stationery be too innocent? Could I pull jewelry off?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Perhaps concerned by the indecision on my face, Yuri dropped her playful tone. “Sousuke. Are you still in love with her?” She asked in all seriousness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">If it was any other question, I might hesitate a moment, but my love for Utako was something I could answer loud and clear, without the slightest of doubt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">There was no need to be reminded of her, for I could see her face every time I gaze at the stars. The precious memories of us three together, every cell in my body longs for her, for those days. Not a single day goes by without me thinking of her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The answer was already decided.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah, I still do.” I stood tall and proud. “I still love her, and will still love her no matter how far apart we are… I mean, didn’t you just ask me something familiar the other day? Like ‘So now you are just enjoying being seduced by Sugawara-senpai’, am I that untrustworthy in your eyes?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’m&nbsp; checking you up in Utako’s stead… Your devotion, whether it’s for painting or Utako, is a sight for sore eyes, you know?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her smiling face under the night sky was lit up by the colorful lights of the sculptures. Much to my surprise, I was mesmerized by her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&mdash;Yeah, it was always like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I was so focused on Yuri and her talent that I overlooked the most important things.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even the smallest of irregularity in our everyday life could destroy the bond we had made. We thought that our promise was absolute, that our bond was unbreakable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But it was more fragile than we knew.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I should have been more careful about that.</span></p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As expected, the Maiei High art club didn’t win any prizes. The director’s abstract comment “Let’s do better next year, carve with passion.” was the only thing we received. I asked Hiiragi-sensei to request for an instructor to give us technical guidance and help in increasing the participants. With that, the Snow festival came to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">A few days later, on a day with heavy snowfall. I was alone in the art club room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">There were no activities today, but I specifically asked Hiiragi-sensei’s permission to use the room. The deadline for Kouji was the end of March. I had already finished the sketch and the priming coat last time. If I could finish defining the shapes today, then I could manage the rest without bothering Sugawara-senpai anymore. In the silence of the art room, I made preparations quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Priming coat, the first layer of paint in oil painting]</b></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I could tell from the sketch alone, the sketch alone was enough to tell me that Senpai was the pinnacle of modeling, too good for me, even. If I could capture her beauty properly, then the first prize would surely be mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I needed to use this fortuitous opportunity to create a significant result. While Yuri dallied, I will win this competition. With this victory, I might finally get the confidence I longed for, this victory would be my debut as a painter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My ambitious thoughts must have drown out the knocking sound, for the next thing I know was&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sou, Suke. Phew~”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Wahh!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Senpai whispered my name then blew her breath into my ear. Upon seeing my reaction, Senpai bursted out laughing, her hands holding her sides.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What a reaction.” She shook with laughter. “Yahoo, sorry I’m late&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">At this time of year, third-year students rarely come to school except for those preparing for the second round of public university exams. Senpai, who did not take the entrance exam, was a rare case in Maiei High, and with her prioritizing modeling before school, she hadn’t come to school since New Year. Therefore, she was doing me a favor by coming all the way to school today.</span></p>



<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No, I’m not waiting. Rather, I would like to thank you for giving me time despite your busy schedule,” I thanked her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">According to Seino, “You know how amazing it is for Kaede-chan to be your model?! If this were a cabaret, you’d have to pay at least ten thousand yen! Per hour! Can’t we switch places?!”. Well, I wasn’t planning to take everything for a fact, Seino could be exaggerating at times. But the fact that Senpai gave me time despite her busy schedule was still there. I needed to be more grateful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm, you’re… cheerful today. By any chance, you’re happy to see me after a long while?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, it was fun to paint you, so I guess you weren’t wrong.” I replied.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I see, I see…” she nodded, “So I’m indispensable, right? So you need me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“So you were steering the conversation that way again. Why are you so persistent in teasing me?…” More considerate, Sousuke, more considerate! “But you might be right. I’m glad you agreed to be my model for the painting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I wonder if it was the romantic, golden rays of the setting sun that urged my grateful self to say that. I had even said things I normally wouldn’t. I had never been drunk, but I guessed this was what drunk people felt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I was just joking, but… fufu, you are so cute and honest. When you seem happy or when you agree with me… I somehow feel happy, you know? It was pleasant.”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Despite the list of nice words, Senpai seemed gloomier than usual. When I looked closely, she seemed listless.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Senpai… Are you okay? You seem tired.” The amount of her workload was already ridiculous, I didn’t want to force her on. Just as I tried to tell her that we could do this later, she just laughed it off.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Haha… Nghh, I’m tired, yeah. Well… It was just the normal stuff. I was targeted by those keyboard crusaders. Their slanders are… just a bunch of offensive made up stuff, things that made me go ‘What?’. It’s a bit unpleasant. Maybe it was a normal thing for a popular model, heheh. I mean, if you weren’t popular, then no one would attack you, right? So maybe it was proof of my popularity…” Senpai smiled weakly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She said it as if it was&nbsp; a matter of fact, but even some unrelated guy like me felt indignant. There was no way someone as passionate about her work as Senpai wouldn’t feel anything. No matter how confident she was, being exposed to such hostility could be obnoxious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She was already working and earning wages like any adult would, but she was still a highschool girl, after all. She was just one year older than me, yet she already carried the burden of an adult.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes, you are beautiful and popular. But I just can’t accept your logic. ‘I’m popular, so it can’t be helped’, really? Why do you have to put up with them? I’ll protect you from those scum.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN:Umm, what ‘bout Utako?]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yes, I was jealous of Yuri, but never had I thought of hurting her with that kind of unfounded foul words, especially to the public.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I could easily become one of them, had I taken even a single wrong turn somewhere in life? The thought terrified me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And why I was thinking about Yuri again. Senpai came all the way here, and I couldn’t even give her my attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Then I noticed her staring at me. Shoot, did I do something wrong?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ah, I found just the right body pillow.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Senpai came closer as she said that. From the back of my chair, she clinged to me reassuringly. With her soft mounds pressed against me, and her fragrant strands of hair touching my cheeks, against my will, my heartbeat went wild.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“‘I’ll protect you’, but how?” she whispered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Specifically…not yet. But I’ll do everything in my power.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&nbsp;Then I immediately became embarrassed by my own naive declaration.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thank you,” she muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After a pause, Senpai continued, “Sousuke, you’re always affable. You know, I hate those sympathizers, consoling me like they understand me. But with you… Sousuke, strange enough, I don’t mind when it’s you. Was it because I see no ulterior motive, or was it because I believe that you would speak the truth? Or was it simply because my judgment was blinded?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I felt my body becoming hotter every time her hot breath touched my ears. It was mind numbing. I already have Utako. I had to resist, otherwise I might do something I would regret.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“T-that I have no ulterior might be an assumption on your part. So if you keep this on…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Shut up. Body pillows can’t talk”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Ok…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke’s so genuine that he could love someone he hasn’t met for…” At the corner of my vision, Senpai counted with her fingers. “Five years? That faithfulness… Even if it isn’t for me, I instinctively want to spoil him… Was it Utako-chan? I’m so jealous of her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In this position, I couldn’t see her face, but her voice alone was enough to tell me that she was sullen. That was what I understood from spending time with her until now.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">And not just to understand, I believed that I knew her enough to do something about it.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even people who seemed to be perfect, with flawless performances, can have unimaginable suffering and frustrations. That was why I needed to come to grips with being relied on, spoiling me, as she put it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I tried to uncurl Senpai’s hands around my neck, then spoke in a soft voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“You don’t need to worry, you are attractive. And not just in appearance,” I reassured her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Worried by the silence, I leaned my head back to check on Senpai, but she only tightened her embrace.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Geh!” I yelped.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke&ndash;, you sure are good at this. Was all that stuff about still being faithful with your first love was for me to let my guard down?” interrogated Senpai.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Of course not. And it hurts, so please loosen up.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Despite my plea, Senpai brought her lips even closer to my ear. Her breath leaked at every word. Caressed by the hot breaths, jolts of electricity ran through my body.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“‘Loosen up’? You didn’t ask me to let go, did you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With the thoughts I didn’t even notice myself thinking being easily read by Senpai, my ears burned red. Enjoying my reaction, Senpai poked her head forward, examining my face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I like you, Sousuke. Your kindness, your dedication, your serious face, I like them all. And not just the good points, you know? Your sleepy face, your obsequious expression when drawing, that sulking face you made when talking about Yuri, all of it. Your entire existence, I love you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The thumping of my heart was awfully loud. Would Senpai notice? The anxiety was nerve wracking. That was certainly something that shouldn’t be said in such close range, certainly not in this position. This was like a hypnotic spell.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“…Would that send your heart pounding if I said that?” she added.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">So…that was just her teasing me, right?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Didn’t I just say don’t tease me like that? I don’t think all that excitement would be good for my health, both physically and mentally.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hahaha, I see. Well then, what a pity, guess I need to let you go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With a laugh, Senpai finally let go of me. She took a step back, then touched her bangs shyly, her face red.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Well, I think that goes for both of us.” She turned her face away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I kind of understood what she meant. I was sure there was another thumping from the chest pressed against my back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“U-uh, let’s get started, shall we? Senpai, can you sit on that round chair?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yes&ndash;, Komiya-sensei&ndash;!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Sensei could also be used to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, e.g., accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I said my thanks to Senpai who compliantly sat down, took a deep breath to reset my dazed mind while smearing the paint on the palette. After switching to painting mode I dabbed the thick brush, then divided the canvas with the intrinsic colors. To create shadows, I established the illumination and painted lighter areas. Over and over, layer and layer, I piled the colors. The canvas took shape, resembling Senpai in front of me more and more.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Unlike last time, Senpai did not talk to me. Senpai was very easy to draw and her perfect proportions made me want to draw her forever. Besides, her expression loosened, and somehow, became even more beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Better… More realistic, I told myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The feeling that I want to recreate her beauty on this canvas, I wondered if it was her charm as a model that made me feel like that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Sousuke, good luck with the competition.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Thank you. I will show my gratitude through the results. I’ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Just how fortunate I was, to be able to paint Senpai privately.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre6">[Today, that scary physics teacher was elated. He wasn’t even angry when the boys joked about his attitude, he even started telling how the kitten he adopted had finally taken to him. He said he was going crazy from how cute it is. We wasted more than half of the class. (lol)]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Reading her cheerful and ebullient message, I pondered. What Yuri and Seino said stuck in my mind. It was February 24th, Utako’s birthday was coming up tomorrow, every second counted. If I were to give her a gift, it was now or never.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Determined, I headed to the shopping mall, in my wallet were my life’s worth of savings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was Saturday, and naturally, being one of the few shopping malls in Maimori, it was crowded. With all these friends, lovers, and families, a lone man shopping seemed out of place. I wanted to be done with this and go home already, but a gift to Utako wasn’t something to be taken lightly. With conflicted feelings, I checked out the first store.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As I looked through the featured items in a certain brand-name store, I noticed a pair of star-shaped, sparkling earrings. Looking at it, I was sure that she would like something like this, an accessory with a star motif. Remembering that Utako hadn’t pierced her ear yet, I put it down and went in search of a similar necklace instead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But after scouring the store, the unit of the price just simply had one more digit of zero than my budget. As I twitched my mouth in grimmance&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Earlier today, my boyfriend was like, ‘What would you like for your birthday?’. Could you believe that? Isn’t it already next week? Aren’t you supposed to prepare earlier? Duh, just look at how rushed he is, super lame.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah, what a turn-off&ndash;. Can’t he do this properly? I mean I understand that it’s hard to do a surprise birthday. But just plain out ask your partner? That’s definitely out of the question. If you’re going to ask like this, then why don’t you just go on a shopping date.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I know, right? I said that I’d be happy with anything from Haru-kun, but depending on the gift, I might break up with him.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">College students? Working adults? It didn’t matter, the conversation between two women trailing accented perfume made me rise to panic. Being called lame despite being a week early?! Could women be any scarier?!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The shock was unbearable, but then I remember her gentle smile. The girl I fell in love with wouldn’t think that way, I reassured myself, straightening my back. Anyway, the price here was too high. I should go somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">After a long while, I finally found a general store that was affordable for a highschool student. There, I finally found a cute star-shaped hairpin that didn’t look cheap.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The star-shaped light sapphire was carved elaborately. Even though it sat on a simple, slender pedestal, it looked sparkling. By Utako’s standard, it might be a bit showy, but the more I look, the more I want to buy it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The only problem was, it was a hairpin.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Of course, there were many ways of using a hairpin, but the most prominent was to keep bangs in place. I just didn’t think Utako, who always kept her bangs long to avoid being seen, would want to wear them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">However, I want her to show her face with pride.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN:Isn’t this her birthday present?? Lol]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Utako was not only cute, but she also seemed fleeting. With those frightened eyes, she looked fragile, but she had the strength to challenge her dreams despite the difficulties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My own desire won over and I brought the pin. I asked the clerk to wrap it as a gift, and left the store in high spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">As I waited for the bus, being with all these couples didn’t seem as bad as before. Then my cell phone buzzed</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yeah? What’s up?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Huh? Sousuke, you’re outside? I forgot to tell you that the Fishermen was airing, the one at the snow festival!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Really?! What time?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“From 17:30 to 18:00… Haha! We’re on screen! Man! That’s my national debut!” she shrieked.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Did they make any cuts? Well, they might have edited it well, but… why don’t you record it?! No, please record it!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But Yuri went silent. No matter how many times I called her name she didn’t reply, leaving me alone with a sense of foreboding.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“…Ha&ndash;, It ‘s over! Recording? I didn’t. Let’s hope Marina took one.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My shoulders slumped in disappointment. I was the one who hadn’t been expecting the review to be aired, I deserved this. But it was still frustrating that I couldn’t see the precious experience of being on screen with my own eyes. In the end, I’m just another country bumpkin.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Well, I guess I now have one more topic to talk about with Utako.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Yuri, if it were you, what would you want for your birthday present?” I decided to ask the opinion of the woman(technically) on the other side.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“What? You’re giving me one? Then I want a 4D pocket”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Something human of the present can provide…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Then, enough money to live the rest of my life without working, a piece of land , and&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“All right, got it. Somehow, I’m relieved.” I sighed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It wasn’t helpful in the slightest, but it made me realize that there was no such gift that could satisfy everyone. Yuri was Yuri, Utako was Utako. If she was happy with the gift, then that was it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“That was about Utako’s present, wasn’t it? Relax, even if you give her some rock from the side of a footpath, I’m sure she’d cherish it like a diamond.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hmm… I’m not trying to be smug, but… Yeah, I agree with you”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“No, you’re a stubborn smug. Listen, don’t get stuck-up with that, Sousuke. Spend your life chewing on the fact that you’re a crazy lucky bastard who happened to meet a girl who shares your feelings. You’re superrr lucky.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t need Yuri to tell me that. I was already trying to cherish this miracle, to cherish Utako.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">We continued the chat for a bit after that, then hung up just as the bus arrived. On the bus, I sent a message to Utako.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre6">[A bit sudden, but could you tell me your current address? I’m going to mail you a birthday present.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Realizing that I couldn’t surprise people, and that I was not sure what her current address was, asking her address to ensure she would receive the present was the best option. After sending the message, my blood thrummed. I took slow deep breaths while gazing at the outside view.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Would that delight her? Or would she be turned off? With my heart filled to the brim with anticipation and anxiety, I waited for her reply. The wait appeared to be a bit long, it was a bit tormenting, but it wasn’t bad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yet, the date changed and there was still no response. I could no longer feel that way as worry kicked in. It was two in the morning. I wondered what happened, what had I done wrong? Had she taken an interest in another guy? Thoughts swarmed my head, each of them more excruciating than the last.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">In the end, no response from Utako came.</span></p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was now March but there was still no response from her. I sent her a follow-up message once. Both messages were marked as read, but not a single sticker returned. I even gathered the courage to call her on the phone, but of course, she didn’t pick up.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">For a while I was depressed, thinking that she hated me. But when her silence went on, I was worried that something happened to her, this fear grew stronger with each passing day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I also asked Yuri, but she too couldn’t contact Utako. My anxiety had reached its peak when Yuri admitted that, “By the way, I also sent her a congratulatory message, no response though.”. There is no way on earth that Utako would ignore Yuri’s message.</span></p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was a few days later when the agony ended.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My eyes opened wide when I saw the name displayed on the notification.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Hello? Utako? Thank god! I was worried, you know?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“You mist be komiya, richt? Cheers fur aye taking care o’ mah daughter. I’m kashii utako’s mother.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN:You must be Komiya, right? Thanks for always taking care of my daughter. I’m Kashii Utako’s mother.]&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">At the unexpected turn of events, my heart squeezed. A voice much lower and way more intimidating than what I had expected answered. Then I remembered her face, a middle-aged woman with noticeable dark circles around her eyes. I had seen her only once when Utako moved away, but I guessed it stuck in my mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Y-yes, my name is Komiya Sousuke. It’s a pleasure to talk to you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Haud oan, I’ll pat ye oan speaker… A&ndash;, hear me? Aah, fur keeping her company, that mist be ye. Cheers a lot. Weel, didn’t ask ye tae”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Hold on, I’ll put you on speaker… A&ndash;, hear me? Aah, for keeping her company, that must be you. Thanks a lot. Well, didn’t ask you to ]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her accented Kansai was enough to show her hostility. I knew it was over the phone, but I stood up, bowed, and replied as politely as I could.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Btw, I localize Kansai by using Scottish]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I don’t want to be estranged from her, so I keep in touch with her. I am terribly sorry if that caused you any discomfort.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Komiya-kun…, I’m sorry bit cuid ye forgoat aboot her awready? Ta fur bein’ a guid mukker tae her even though ’twas ainlie fur a short time. Bit don’t contact us in th’ future, ever. Farewell. ”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Komiya-kun…, I’m sorry but could you forget about her already? Thank you for being a good friend to her even though it was only for a short time. But don’t contact us in the future, ever. Farewell. ]</b></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I couldn’t believe my ears. That word of farewell rang in my head. Still failing to interpret its meaning, my mouth moved.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Please wait a minute!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I then heard a rustle on the other end. Utako’s faraway voice conveyed confusion.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her mother seemed to want to hang up immediately without wasting even another second. It appeared that her mother’s unreasonable hate of me ran deep, but not Utako herself. If that’s so, then I won’t back down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Please let me talk to her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She let out a vexing sigh, as if she knew I would say that. &ndash;“Haven’t ye awready?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Isn’t that your one-sided words? Excuse me, but I think you’ve been forcing yourself on Utako-san since a while ago. Your child is not a property&ndash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Says a bairn? Wha dae ye think yer talking tae, bein’ a’ heich ‘n’ mighty?! This’s how come men fae some countryside ur juist frogs in a weel! Men lik’ ye won’t accomplish anythin’! Gang bide yer lee in yer countryside, hook up wi’ boring wummin, ‘n’ bide yer glaikit lee!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: Says a child? Who do you think you are talking to, being all high and mighty?! This is why men from some countryside are just frogs in a well! Men like you won’t accomplish anything! Go live your life in your countryside, hook up with boring women, and live your stupid life! ]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">My earlier remark was rude, all things considered. However, I was astonished, bewildered, and terrified by how she turned on her heels and came at me at full force just because of that remark. With sharp verbal blades lunging at the slightest resistance, how could a child grow up in such an environment? It was as if I had taken a glimpse of how Utako was raised.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Mom, please. I want to say goodbye to Sou-chan for the last time. It will be over soon. Please.” Utako’s voice echoed in my ears. So far, she had only raised her voice in confusion, this was the first time she had said something. After her mother had ranted and raved, she supn words of her own.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“…On th’ condition that ye won’t contact him again. Fifteen minutes. Yer maw wull be in th’ living room. Ower time ‘n’ i’ll be richt back tae hing up fur ye. Clear?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">[TN: …On the condition that you won’t contact him again. Fifteen minutes. Your mom will be in the living room. Over time and I’ll be right back to hang up for you. Clear? ]</b></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">No more contact? Fifteen minutes? I was about to complain, but hesitated when Utako immediately said &ndash;“Yes I understand.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Was that fine with you, Utako? Saying goodbye to me wasn’t a big deal? I bit my lips as I listened to her mother’s footsteps retreating into the distance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Sorry, Sou-chan…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her sincere apologizing voice reminded me that this wasn’t the time to be grieving. She had summoned up all her courage against her mother and made time for me. This fifteen minutes, short though it was.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“My mom’s a bit&ndash; no, quite hysterical. She can get very aggressive when offended even in the slightest. I’m sorry you have to hear something like that.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“N-no. I’m fine. I was just a bit overwhelmed… But she did listen to your request, and I was in the wrong earlier, so she might just be very protective.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Thank you for your consideration. But I don’t want to waste time talking about this stuff, so can we cut to the chase. We only got fifteen minutes, so…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">With “this is the last time” hanging in the air, I have countless things I wanted to say, even more I want to ask. It was painful to leave her, heartbreaking to say goodbye, my heart throbbed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“What did she mean by that? Have I done something wrong?” The question I wanted her to deny the most, I asked it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Before that…I want to apologize for something first. I’m sorry I didn’t get back to you when you contacted me. I know it’s an excuse, but my phone was confiscated and…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“No, whatever with that, I’m glad you’re safe. I was so worried about you, you know,” I assured her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“I got to watch the Fishermen, you know. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you two moving, brings back memories,” she laughed weakly, “I love you two, seeing you reminds me of that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Of us being on TV, that was a normal conversation topic, but I had a queasy feeling. For her to broach the subject in such a short time, the problem must have been there.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“When I was in fourth grade, my parents got divorced… That made mom crazy. She thinks that if I do anything even remotely attention-grabbing or appear on my friends’s social networking sites, my dad will find me…and kidnap me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When she suddenly revealed her household situation, I ought to give her some response, yet I can’t move my mouth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“That’s why mom keeps tabs on me, searching hashtags and my name. Even a single picture means moving again. She won’t even listen to my pleas.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The way she talked about it, how verbose she was, the more I listened, the more it reminded me of her face when she was talking about stars. It was painful, my precious memory being overwritten by a painful one. The urge to cover my ears was terrible.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She broke off her speech once and then laughed powerlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“I have been actively keeping myself as inconspicuous as possible ever since. That’s why I start to blush immediately when the attention is directed at me. I also stopped making friends, it would just make me lonlier when moved anyway,” she explained.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I…see… So that’s why she said that. So it was because we talked about you…I’m really, really sorry…I…” I clenched my fists.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“No, it’s my fault! If…if I had been stronger, if I had had the courage to stand against mom, it wouldn’t have turned out like this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Utako didn’t blame me. But it was still my fault. Why? Why didn’t I…? If she wasn’t at the other end I would have screamed. A miserable howl, I held it in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Since the disvorce, mom does nothing but bad mouthing dad. Every day, every day, she made me listen. If I talk back even a little, she gets riled, when she does, she won’t even let me sleep. So I would just listen to her, nod along sometimes. That way, she’ll be all smiley again.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She went on, as if it was a matter of fact, but there was a strain in her voice. I felt as if I started to see the hardships she had to deal with.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“Swallowing your own thoughts like that, isn’t that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Yeah. That’s why I yearn for people like Yuri, people who follow their hearts. Living like that, just how wonderful, just how cool…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Now, she was looking up to Yuri, not me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Just like when she told me she loved the stars, she was looking up at something she couldn’t reach.</span></p>



<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">The realization struck me hard.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had always wanted to make myself look good. I had always wanted her to know more about me.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">But I had never thought about her or her feelings at all.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/T8dPHFK/000004.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I asked her why she like stars, I didn’t even try to find a deeper meaning to it</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When she said she admired Yuri, all I did was discredit her in jealousy. Why did she think so? That didn’t even cross my mind.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">That she was strangely shy, to an extent that she blushes at the slightest attention. She was shy, that was the explanation. I didn’t even search for any underlying cause.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">When I&nbsp; heard that she was moving from place to place across the country, I was doubtful, but I sought no more explanation. I just assumed that it was because of her mother’s work. If I had dived deeper since the start, I might have been more attentive, I might have come up with countermeasures. Things wouldn’t have turned out this way.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I had never tried to understand the meaning behind her words, let alone consider her feelings, was there even anything I could do now? I want her to stay with me, but what right do I have to say that, do I even deserve her anymore?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Regrets, that was a festival for later. She had given up on asking me for help.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">It was only natural, considering how I had treated her up until now.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“I’m really glad that I became friends with Sou-chan and Yu-chan. I really enjoyed my year at Maimori. That promise we made, it really gives me strength to go on. That’s why… I’m happy we met.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Her farewell would come next, the flow of the conversation told me that much.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Why?! From now on, never again?!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">No words from me would console her, I had never been able to understand her. No matter how sincere, she would just hear it as a superficial flattery. I had never been able to understand her, after all…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">&ndash;“Thank you for everything…Tell Yu-chan for me, give her my best regards… Tell her for me, will you?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She hadn’t rejected me, but I doubt ending our relationship officially like this was any better. Could there be any more painful way to say goodbye?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll tell her. I’m sure she would take it out on me. But I’m fine being on the receiving end of it. It’s my routine now.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Utako giggled apologetically. &ndash;“If we cut ties here, I’m sure she would forget about me soon. But… I won’t… I’ll never forget you two.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">She couldn’t stop her tears any more, but before I could say anything, the phone went dead. Overwhelmed by the sense of loss, I tried calling back, but she didn’t pick up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">So when she was out of my reach, it was this painful. The crushing grief told me that I love her more than I realized.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">I couldn’t say anything as she meekly obeyed her mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Yuri wouldn’t let anyone rein her in, she would have argued with Utako’s mother. Maybe she could persuade Utako to stand against her mother.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Even at times like this, I found myself thinking of Yuri. My gaze searched the ceiling, a sense of helplessness heavy in my heart.</span></p>
