<h2>Chapter 2: Our Blue</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>Every time I stepped into the second gymnasium, it felt like entering a secret hideout.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because of the surrounding walls, painted in a deep, somber shade. Or maybe it’s because the size was only about two-thirds of the first gymnasium. Or it could be that I was captivated by the impression of emptiness it exuded whenever I passed by.</p>



<p>Regardless, this place was filled with a peculiar silence and a sense of confinement, even within the school building. It might be the perfect place for moments like these.</p>



<p>About a week after the committee decision, during the seventh period, or more precisely, between a break between classes.</p>



<p>Me, Yuuko, Yua, Nanase, Haru, Kazuki, Kaito, and Kenta — the members of the Chitose team also known as the Class 2-5 cheering squad — gathered in the second gymnasium.</p>



<p>Today marked the first meeting of the festival committee for first, second, and third years. For the sports festival, each grade divided its ten classes into five different colors, forming vertically divided teams with two classes per grade, totaling six teams.</p>



<p>Naturally, the cheering squad followed suit. However, since there were no applicants from the science class in the same Blue Group, all of us from Class 2-5 became one team.</p>



<p>As soon as the break started, we immediately began our move, so it seemed like we were the first ones to arrive at the meeting place. For now, we sat cross-legged near the basketball hoop.</p>



<p>Kaito, unable to contain his excitement, opened his mouth, “Man, I’m getting pumped! The school festival is pretty much the only chance we get to do something with students from other grades outside of club activities.”</p>



<p>Haru responded with a exasperated look on her face, “Don’t go messing around with cute kouhais, okay?”</p>



<p>“Heh, sorry, Haru. But just so you know, I surprisingly have some popularity among kouhais and senpais.”</p>



<p>“Because they can see through your act when you’re with your peers.”</p>



<p>“Hey, isn’t that a bit harsh?!”</p>



<p>Kazuki, who had been sitting in a relaxed manner with his chin resting on his hand, spoke up. “Well, being in the second year does come with a lot of responsibility. I think we’ll naturally have more interactions.”</p>



<p>Yua chuckled, her voice carrying a playful tone. “So, the cheering captain and vice-captain will be chosen from among us, right?”</p>



<p>That’s why we arrived early, for this very reason.</p>



<p>In order to lessen the burden on the third-year students who were preparing for entrance exams, the festival committee mainly entrusted the central roles to the second-year students.</p>



<p>Regarding the cheering squad, as Yua mentioned, we would take charge of deciding the captain and vice-captain, as well as the performance theme, the choreography, and even the direction for the costumes.</p>



<p>Kazuki nodded and spoke up, “Well then, Saku, how about you as the captain for now?”</p>



<p>Since I had expected this turn of events, I didn’t hesitate to respond. “Yeah, if no one else wants to do it, I’ll take the role.”</p>



<p>Only Kenta and I were not part of any clubs in this group. From the beginning, I had already decided to take on a certain amount of responsibility. And it would be quite cruel to make Kenta the captain of the cheering squad. </p>



<p>No one seemed to object to that suggestion.</p>



<p>Kazuki continued, as if following a script, “Then, for the vice-captain…”</p>



<p>Instinctively, I glanced at Yuuko. Everyone’s gaze naturally gravitated towards her as well. Just like when we were electing a class representative, she would always be the first to volunteer in situations like this.</p>



<p>However, as if to disrupt the predictable pattern,</p>



<p>“──Yes, if Chitose is going to be the captain, I’ll be the vice-captain.”</p>



<p>Nanase raised her hand elegantly.</p>



<p>“”””EEEEH!?”””</p>



<p>Whose surprised voices were those?</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing their reaction, Nanase chuckled wryly and scratched her cheek. Looking at Yuuko, she spoke a bit bashfully, “Sorry, were you planning on taking the role after all?”</p>



<p>In response to those words, a calm answer came without hesitation.</p>



<p>“No,” Yuuko tilted her head a bit and smiled shyly, “I already get my hands full with the cheering dance and the class play. I might end up causing trouble for Saku, so I think it’s better if Yuzuki takes the role.”</p>



<p>Nanase raised her eyebrows in surprise, then nodded in understanding, “Alright, then leave it to me.”</p>



<p>After a brief pause, Nanase looked around at all of us and continued, “Is everyone okay with this?”</p>



<p>Watching their interaction in silence, Kazuki narrowed his eyes somewhat wistfully.</p>



<p>“Well, with Saku and Yuzuki, there’s nothing to worry about.”</p>



<p>Everyone nodded in agreement at his words.</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, a natural silence settled in, and I felt it deep within me.</p>



<p>In the past, without a doubt, Yuuko would have volunteered as vice-captain, and that would have been the end of it.</p>



<p>Nanase probably wouldn’t have raised her hand, and even if she had considered giving it a try, she would have observed everyone’s reactions first.</p>



<p>We’ve truly changed, haven’t we?</p>



<p>It felt fresh and strangely comforting, but also a bit lonely.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>After waiting for a while, a group of about ten third-year students entered the second gymnasium.</p>



<p>When we saw the person at the front, Kaito sprang up energetically, “Whoaaa, Nishino-senpai is joining the cheering squad too?!?!?!”</p>



<p>Asu-nee, with a hint of embarrassment, waved her hand and approached us.</p>



<p>Walking right behind her was Okuno-senpai. There were also others who I recognized from career counseling session and study camp, so they must have volunteered for the cheering squad as a close-knit group.</p>



<p>Following Kaito’s lead, we also stood up. Asu-nee smiled, as if tickled by the situation.</p>



<p>“Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you.”</p>



<p>We greeted her back one by one, saying “Nice to meet you” in return.</p>



<p>Perhaps because we had spent time together during summer camp and festival, the atmosphere was much more relaxed compared to the career counseling session.</p>



<p>Asu-nee leaned closer to me discreetly and whispered softly in my ear, “You don’t seem too surprised.”</p>



<p>“I somehow had a feeling we would end up on the same group.”</p>



<p>As I answered, she seemed slightly annoyed and continued, “Well, I had my own share of conflicts, you know.”</p>



<p>“I understand. Despite appearing calm, I’m actually really happy about it.”</p>



<p>My words weren’t just a casual remark to hide embarrassment; they were sincere and genuine.</p>



<p>Asu-nee had often mentioned how we couldn’t share the same times together, and I had carried that sense of loneliness with me for a long time. But now, by becoming part of the cheerleading squad together, we could actively participate in one of the biggest events of our school life.</p>



<p>This was our first and last chance to become groupmates.</p>



<p>Asu-nee seemed satisfied with my answer, and with a gentle smile on her face, she moved away. Seeing that, Okuno-senpai, who was standing nearby, approached me and struck up a conversation.</p>



<p>“We meet again, Chitose-kun.”</p>



<p>I felt slightly awkward in response, and this time I decided to retort playfully, “You had a cool exit during the summer camp, but you’re not so suave now, huh?”</p>



<p>Okuno-senpai let out a chuckle and continued, “Well, don’t say that. I also want to enjoy the remaining days of my school life.”</p>



<p>He had mentioned being rejected after confessing to Asu-nee, but it didn’t seem to have made things awkward between them. There was a refreshing tone in his voice, as if he had let go of something.</p>



<p>Although we had been at odds during the career counseling session, now I couldn’t really harbor any ill will towards him.</p>



<p>Lost in such thoughts, the bell signaling the start of class rang, and almost simultaneously, first-year students hurriedly rushed in with light footsteps.</p>



<p>Now, let’s begin the preparations for the festival.</p>



<p>Uncharacteristically, I adjusted my tie with a firm tug.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>The cheering squad consisted of approximately thirty members, comprising students from the first, second, and third years.</p>



<p>We decided to start with a simple self-introduction. Nanase and I stood in front, while the rest of the members sat in three rows according to their grade level, side by side.</p>



<p>Seeing them like this, it was quite a sizable group.</p>



<p>I cleared my throat and began to speak.</p>



<p>“Um, I’ve been entrusted with the position of the cheer squad captain. I’m Chitose Saku from Class 2-5. My goal is not only to snatch the championship trophy but also to have a fun and lively youth with this team. I’m counting on you all.”</p>



<p>I didn’t want to ramble on too much from the beginning; after all, it wasn’t a principal’s speech. After a brief introduction, to my surprise, a thunderous applause erupted, louder than I had anticipated.</p>



<p>“Wow!”</p>



<p>“Great job, Captain!”</p>



<p>“We’re counting on you!”</p>



<p>“Isn’t Chitose-senpai cool?”</p>



<p>“I’m glad I joined the cheer squad!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at the reactions of the senpais and kouhais. Since they were the kind of people who willingly joined the cheer squad, they were generally cheerful by nature.</p>



<p>Next, Nanase stepped forward.</p>



<p>“I’m Nanase Yuzuki, the vice-captain. Despite appearances, I hate losing, so we’ll aim for victory! Be prepared, as I’ll be strict with the kouhais and push the senpais without hesitation.”</p>



<p>Contrary to her strong choice of words, she accompanied them with exaggerated gestures and a playful tone, entertaining everyone.</p>



<p>“It’s more like a reward!”</p>



<p>“Please be strict with us!”</p>



<p>“Seriously, Nanase-senpai is too beautiful!”</p>



<p>“The Blue Team is the best!”</p>



<p>Following that, each person introduced themselves one by one, starting from the third year, then the second year, and finally the first year.</p>



<p>Generally, everyone spoke brightly and confidently. As the listeners became more engaged, the atmosphere became lively and harmonious, even though it was our first meeting. If anything, the only one who seemed a bit nervous was Kenta, but it wasn’t a problem, especially with the banter between Kazuki, Kaito, and him, which resulted in laughter.</p>



<p>After everyone finished their introductions, I spoke up.</p>



<p>“Thank you, everyone. So, from now on, the second-year students will mainly take the lead. However, would it be possible to have one representative each from the third and first years? They’ll participate in our discussions and practices, so we can consider their inputs. Keeping that in mind, does anyone want to volunteer?”</p>



<p>It seemed to be a customary practice each year. Gathering everyone together each time would be difficult, so generally, the second-year students would take charge while representatives from different grades would convey their opinions and decisions made through discussions.</p>



<p>For dances, we would first teach them the choreography, and then we would oversee the whole performance while relying on the representatives to cover any areas we might overlook and organize separate practices for each grade level.</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>She must have already made up her mind. Without hesitation, Asu-nee was the first to raise her hand.</p>



<p>“I’ll be the representative for the third year.”</p>



<p>The other senpais clapped their hands almost as if it were expected. Asu-nee had connections with our grade as well, so it seemed like a fitting choice.</p>



<p>“Alright then, Nishino Asuka-senpai will represent the third years. What about the first years?”</p>



<p>They would be thrown into a group with senpais from the second and third years. Honestly, it would be challenging for them, I thought. But then…</p>



<p>“Yes! I want to do it!”</p>



<p>A lively voice resonated.</p>



<p>Among the first-year students, the one with the most radiant presence eagerly raised her hand.</p>



<p>Not to put it in a peculiar way, but she had an appearance that could rival Nanase’s well-proportioned features, long and slender limbs. Despite the slightly oversized uniform, her figure was outstanding. She must be quite popular among her classmates.</p>



<p>“Oh, thank you. Um, you’re Nozomi, right?”</p>



<p>After I mentioned the name I remembered from the earlier introductions, she politely repeated it to me.</p>



<p>“Yes, I’m Nozomi Kureha from Class 1-5. Nice to meet you.”</p>



<p>Perhaps the first-year students had discussed it beforehand. They applauded warmly.</p>



<p>“Well then, Nishino-senpai, Nozomi-san, could you both come forward for a moment?”</p>



<p>Asu-nee stood next to Nanase, while Nozomi-san stood briskly beside me.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a refreshing scent, like that of a ripe lime, tickled my nostrils. Nozomi tilted her head and offered a smile that still carried a hint of innocence as she looked in my direction.</p>



<p>Since entering high school, I hadn’t had many opportunities to interact with kouhais, so I felt a slight ticklish sensation as I nodded lightly and turned to face everyone.</p>



<p>“Now then, allow me to reintroduce ourselves. I am Chitose Saku, the captain, Nanase Yuzuki as the vice-captain. Nishino-senpai as the representative for the third year, and Nozomi-san as the representative for the first year. I hope we can all work together and support each other towards the main event. Everyone, I’ll be counting on you.”</p>



<p>“Please take care of us!!!”</p>



<p>In the worn-out second gymnasium, voices filled the air with a vibrant shade of blue.</p>



<p>As I gazed at the unfamiliar faces, I felt my cheeks loosen, feeling reassured that everything would go smoothly.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>After that, we exchanged contact information and created a group LINE for the Blue Team cheer squad, then today’s gathering came to an end.</p>



<p>I think our meeting went fairly well.</p>



<p>When I watched the senpais and kouhais leaving the gymnasium, Nanase called out to me.</p>



<p>“Chitose, are you free tonight?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, is it about that thing?”</p>



<p>As I recalled my promise to cook for her, a slightly exasperated look came back at me.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to say it like I’m some nagging girl, you know.”</p>



<p>“Oh, was I mistaken?”</p>



<p>“If you’re offering to cook, then of course, I’d gladly accept your treat. But that’s not it. I meant about the upcoming plan. Shouldn’t we discuss it briefly together?”</p>



<p>“Ah.”</p>



<p>Feeling embarrassed by my silly misunderstanding, I instinctively scratched my cheek.</p>



<p>From this point on, we couldn’t proceed without deciding on the contents of our performance. Of course, we would consult with the others, including other second-year students, as well as Asu-nee and Nozomi-san. But before that, it was necessary for the two of us to have a discussion about the general direction.</p>



<p>Since I had no objections or specific plans, I lightly nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“Understood. Where should we meet?”</p>



<p>“At your place.”</p>



<p>“What time?”</p>



<p>“After club activities.”</p>



<p>“What do you want to eat?”</p>



<p>“Something you’ve never made before.”</p>



<p>“So, in the end, you’re still pushing for it, huh?”</p>



<p>As we headed towards the exit of the gymnasium, we casually piled up the necessary minimum conversation. Then suddenly, I noticed the sound of footsteps trailing behind us.</p>



<p>We stopped and turned around, finding Nozomi-san looking at us with a curious expression. Perhaps she had been waiting for the right moment to speak up.</p>



<p>Feeling a bit guilty, I spoke up, “Sorry, I thought we were the last ones here. Do you have any questions?”</p>



<p>As if my words hadn’t reached her, Nozomi-san continued to stare blankly, maintaining eye contact.</p>



<p>“Um, Nozomi-san…?”</p>



<p>Calling out to her once again, she finally snapped out of her daze and flashed a bright smile.</p>



<p>“I realized that I hadn’t properly greeted and thanked you, Senpai. So, from now on, I’m looking forward to working with you!”</p>



<p>By “thank,” she probably meant thanking me for allowing her to be the representative of the first-year students. She’s a serious girl, I couldn’t help but smile wryly.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to be so formal.”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san gently grasped her skirt with both hands as she spoke, “No, I really want to start over properly.”</p>



<p>I lightly nodded, understanding her intention, “Likewise, I look forward to working with you too. Since it’s our first time being in the cheer squad, I’d appreciate it if you don’t hesitate to suggest any ideas or proposals.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Then, Nozomi-san looked at Nanase and bowed her head slightly, “Nanase-san, I’ll be counting on you too.”</p>



<p>Nanase must be accustomed to dealing with kouhais in the girls basketball team. She responded in a casual tone.</p>



<p>“Sure, feel free to consult with me anytime if you have any problems. Like, if our captain keeps persistently hitting on you, for example.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Vice Captain, don’t implant biased ideas into an innocent kouhai.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay, you know. Despite how he looks, he’s kind to girls.”</p>



<p>“I’m kind to boys too!”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san couldn’t contain her laughter anymore and burst out giggling, “You two are really close, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>In response to her sincere words, Nanase and I unintentionally glanced at each other. For us, it was a familiar exchange, but when someone reacted like this, it felt a bit embarassing.</p>



<p>“By the way,” Nozomi-san tilted her head in curiosity. “I overheard you talking earlier, but are you living alone, Senpai?”</p>



<p>Although it would be awkward to reveal my family situation, there’s no need to hide it, so I casually replied.</p>



<p>“Yeah, once you get used to it, it’s pretty comfortable.”</p>



<p>Nanase chimed in to add an explanation, “And naturally, it has become a gathering place for our group of friends.”</p>



<p>She probably wanted to avoid any misunderstandings with a kouhai.</p>



<p>Nozomi-san seemed to accept that explanation at face value. “Oh, I see! Then, I’d like to visit sometime!”</p>



<p>“Huh, well…”</p>



<p>It would have been best to brush it off as a mere social courtesy, but lately, due to various things happening, my words got stuck in my throat.</p>



<p>If it were someone I was familiar with, I would have replied with a playful remark like, “<em>Sure, make sure to bring some cute underwear</em>.” But if she took it seriously from the first day, it would be quite troublesome.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Nozomi-san found out that Nanase was coming to my place after asking me so innocently, I was afraid that outright refusal would hurt her.</p>



<p><em>…Saku-kun needs your help.</em></p>



<p>As if pleading for assistance, I looked beside me. Nanase narrowed her eyes in exasperation and sighed softly. Then, she shrugged her shoulders slightly and responded on my behalf.</p>



<p>“Well, Nozomi-san, there was a hungry wolf in a certain place. It had lost its strength to go hunting and was crouching in its den. Then, if a pure white wild rabbit wandered in, what do you think the wolf would do?”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san put her index finger on her lips, looking bewildered for a moment, then spoke.</p>



<p>“Would it eat the rabbit?”</p>



<p>Nanase nodded solemnly, wearing a serious expression, “You’re the wild rabbit, and he’s the wolf leader. Got it?”</p>



<p>“I refuse to be a part of this!!”</p>



<p>Unable to hold back, I interjected, causing Nozomi-san to chuckle softly, her shoulders shaking with amusement.</p>



<p>“Then, Nanase-san, will you be eaten too?”</p>



<p>Caught off guard by her innocent question, I once again was speechless.</p>



<p>In that regard, Nanase remained composed. She stuck out her tongue with a playful, seductive tone in her voice.</p>



<p>“I’m a satiated wild wolf, so I won’t be carelessly eaten without any initiative.”</p>



<p>Unable to contain herself, Nozomi-san covered her mouth with her hand. While desperately suppressing her laughter, she spoke up.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I understand what Nanase-san meant. I just thought there was no need to worry after seeing the two of you, but it turned out I went too far.”</p>



<p>She bowed her head politely, making me feel somewhat guilty. Nanase also glanced at me with a slightly awkward expression, like she hadn’t spoken without thinking.</p>



<p>Maybe I was being overly cautious just because she was a girl I had just met. From now on, we would be working together as central members of the cheering squad. It was quite possible that my place would become a meeting spot for discussions.</p>



<p>Nanase nodded with a mature smile befitting a senpai.</p>



<p><em>That’s right</em>, I nodded back and opened mouth, “I prefer filling our stomachs with satisfying junk food rather than elegant sweets if you want to bring something over. That way, even the wolf will be content and won’t cause trouble.”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san’s eyes widened for a moment, then she lowered the corners of her eyes as if it had finally clicked.</p>



<p>“Understood, Senpai!”</p>



<p>Then, she turned her face away shyly and continued, “Um, Senpai, Nanase-san… If it’s okay, I would be happy if you called me by my first name, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Nanase and I exchanged glances, and we couldn’t help but chuckle at her innocence. It made me feel warm, is this how it would be if I had a little sister?</p>



<p>In order to make her feel as comfortable as possible in this place, I spoke up, “Let’s not be too formal, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Nanase, like a dependable senpai, followed up, “If anything happens, feel free to contact us, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Kureha raised her clenched fist lightly in front of her chest and said, “Yes, I’ll do my best!”</p>



<p>She smiled brightly, like bursting citrus.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>When the clamoring pot began to simmer down, I lowered the flame, and at that moment, a pleasant chime rang out, filling the air with a sense of relaxation.</p>



<p>“Come on in,” I called out, and Nanase appeared with a click, her face peeking through.</p>



<p>“Hey there.”</p>



<p>“Hey. I’ve already started cooking, so go ahead and take a shower first.”</p>



<p>When I said those words, I couldn’t help but self-mockingly wonder what I was saying. Well, after a club activity, she’d naturally want to wash off the sweat, and she probably had the same thought as me anyway.</p>



<p>I had indeed become less flustered by such matters.</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>Nanase placed her belongings on the dining chair and casually retrieved her own towel from the closet. It made me realize that having it readily available was already natural.</p>



<p>To adjust the cooking time, I asked her, “Do you want to wash your hair too?”</p>



<p>“Nah, I’ll just rinse off the sweat today.”</p>



<p>While saying that, Nanase, who seemed accustomed to the routine, was about to head towards the bathroom when she suddenly approached me, as if she was being pulled in.</p>



<p>Standing by my side, she sniffed lightly, “Hmm, the food smells even better than usual.”</p>



<p>“I’m cooking it in a clay pot. It’s my first time, so even if it gets a bit burnt, don’t complain.”</p>



<p>When I explained, Nanase’s cheeks softened, tickled by amusement.</p>



<p>“I expect a portion as well,” she murmured playfully before finally disappearing into the bathroom.</p>



<p>As usual, I turned up the volume on my Tivoli Audio.</p>



<p>I took out tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and garlic, gripping the knife firmly in my hand. I removed the tomato stems and roughly diced them, layered the lettuce leaves and cut them into slightly thicker shreds, and then minced the onions finely.</p>



<p>For the garlic, I took two small cloves, cut off the root, crushed them with the flat side of the knife, and peeled off the skin.</p>



<p>I poured a generous amount of oil into the heated iron frying pan, tilting it slightly before adding the garlic. I kept it over low heat, carefully watching as the aroma started to rise. Once it reached the point just before burning, I quickly removed the garlic and roughly minced it.</p>



<p>Next, I sautéed the onions, and once they turned a light brown, I added the ground meat.</p>



<p><em>Clatter</em>, the bathroom door swung open.</p>



<p>The clay pot had begun its cheerful chatter, its faintly fragrant scent wafting through the air. I turned off the flame, if I let it steam a little longer, it would turn out just right. Probably.</p>



<p>When the ground meat was cooked through, I sprinkled it with a pinch of salt and pepper. Then, I added the minced garlic and, with a dash of improvisation, I added sweet chili sauce, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce, tasting frequently to adjust the seasoning. Since it was slightly sweet, I added just a tiny drizzle of soy sauce.</p>



<p>After scooping up a spoonful and savoring it in my mouth, I concluded that it was good enough and turned off the heat.</p>



<p><em>Rustle</em>, the curtain separating the living room and the bathroom opened.</p>



<p>Nanase emerged with a refreshed face and spoke, “I’ve finished a bath, or rather a shower.”</p>



<p>When I prepared a flat plate to serve the food, I replied. “In about a month, it might start getting cold for showers.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll buy some bath salts.”</p>



<p>“You’re planning to soak and relax in the bathtub, huh?”</p>



<p>Nanase approached and casually rested her hand on the stool near the kitchen. At that moment…</p>



<p>“──Ah!”</p>



<p>I inadvertently let out a word.</p>



<p>Nanase, who was about to pull the stool closer and sit down, froze in place.</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>She looked at me with a slightly anxious gaze. An aching silence settled, like a throbbing pain.</p>



<p>That stool was placed there with gratitude towards Yua. It wasn’t like she had explicitly forbidden anyone else from sitting on it, but when I saw Nanase about to take a seat, I couldn’t help but feel incredibly disloyal. For a split second, a sorrowful image of Yua’s face flashed in my mind.</p>



<p>Of course, Nanase had no ill intentions. It was my fault for not putting it away in advance.</p>



<p>Eventually, it was Nanase who broke the silence. With utmost care, she gently placed the stool back in its original position using both hands.</p>



<p>“Can I relax on the sofa instead?”</p>



<p>She turned around as if nothing had happened. I watched her receding figure, her steps light and intentionally exaggerated.</p>



<p><em>──I’m sorry,</em> I whispered in my heart.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>When I lifted the lid of the steamed clay pot, the glossy grains of rice stood plump and abundant. To my relief, there were no signs of scorching; only a faint brown tint on the surface where the pot had made contact with the flame.</p>



<p>Pushing aside the embarrassment from earlier, I opened my mouth, “Nanase, how much would you like?”</p>



<p>“A large serving, of course!”</p>



<p>Her voice, as bright as Haru, prompted a wry smile as I replied, “I thought you were conscious about calories.”</p>



<p>“Well, I didn’t think Chitose would be into girls who act all dainty in front of boys.”</p>



<p>“Touché.”</p>



<p>I scooped rice onto a flat plate and topped it with the minced meat and onions I had stir-fried earlier. I arranged lettuce and tomatoes on the side and sprinkled finely shredded meltable cheese as a finishing touch. Carrying the plates, I retrieved the soup I had prepared earlier from the refrigerator. </p>



<p>After two spoons and barley tea were arranged on the table, I settled into the dining chair.</p>



<p>Sitting across from me, Nanase eagerly spoke up, “Now then, what’s on the menu at Chitose Diner today?”</p>



<p>“We have taco rice and chilled edamame potage. Both are being served for the first time to our esteemed customer.”</p>



<p>Loud, exaggerated applause echoed in response, “Ohh!”</p>



<p>“And just so you know, you may not have the chance to taste the latter ever again, so please savor it slowly.”</p>



<p>“Huh, why?”</p>



<p>“…It was more troublesome than I had imagined.”</p>



<p>I had used the hand mixer Yua had left behind, and it turned out to be quite a hassle. The memories of painstakingly extracting the edamame resurfaced, and I slumped my shoulders.</p>



<p>“At the very least, I don’t think I would make it for myself.”</p>



<p>Nanase covered her mouth and chuckled softly. Narrowing her eyes, she spoke in a teasing tone.</p>



<p>“So, is it for my sake then?”</p>



<p>Blushing, I averted my gaze, mumbling my response.</p>



<p>“…Didn’t you make a katsudon for me during summer vacation? This time, as a way of showing my gratitude, I thought I’d take on the challenge of making something you might like.”</p>



<p>Pausing momentarily, I let out a small laugh to deflect the awkwardness.</p>



<p>“Well, I must admit that my culinary imagination hit a limit with taco rice as the main dish.”</p>



<p>When I looked at Nanase, she appeared frozen, wearing a somewhat bewildered expression. Even as I tilted my head in confusion, she blinked repeatedly, seemingly unable to recover.</p>



<p>“…Nanase?”</p>



<p>I called out her name, tapping her shoulder. Finally, she snapped back, her eyes softening.</p>



<p>“──Hehe, I’m happy,” she said with a smile that seemed unusual for Nanase.</p>



<p>Feeling embarassed, I scratched the back of my neck, “Let’s dig in, Nanase.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>“Well then, you first.”</p>



<p>“Thank you for the food!”</p>



<p>Nanase’s gaze darted around, and as a result, she reached for the chilled edamame potage first. By the way, just to create a more authentic vibe, I had served it in a glass cup. Using a wooden spoon, Nanase brought a spoonful of soup to her lips.</p>



<p>Whether she took my words to heart or not, her lips moved slowly, savoring the taste on her tongue before eventually swallowing it.</p>



<p>She looked at me with a surprised expression, “No way, I can’t believe Chitose made this.”</p>



<p>“Hey, what do you mean by that?”</p>



<p>Nanase stuck out her tongue playfully, “Sorry, sorry, I didn’t mean to tease you. It’s just that your cooking has this rough charm that’s typically boyish, but this tastes like something you’d eat at a fancy restaurant.”</p>



<p>“Well, I did reference several ‘restaurant-style’ recipes for this.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, thank you.”</p>



<p>She shyly expressed her gratitude, then placed her hand on the plate of taco rice this time. She must have been considerate because I cooked it in a clay pot, and started by avoiding the toppings and simply ate the white rice.</p>



<p>“It’s soft and sweet. That slightly browned part — it really gives off the impression of being cooked in a clay pot.”</p>



<p>Observing her reaction, I responded with a proud grin, “Not only this is my first time cooking rice in a clay pot, but since I ran out of rice, I bought some ‘Ichihomare’ rice as well.”</p>



<p>I followed Nanase’s lead and tried eating just the white rice. Until now, I had always been a loyal fan of Koshihikari rice, but this one was just as delicious.</p>



<p>Next, Nanase indulged in the taco rice along with its toppings.</p>



<p>“Mmm, delicious! But this has the comforting flavor of Chitose Diner.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s because I exhausted all my energy making the edamame soup. For the taco rice, I just glanced at the ingredients and steps, relying on my instincts for the seasoning.”</p>



<p>When I explained, she giggled and her shoulders shook playfully. Feeling relieved by her positive reaction, I also dug into the taco rice.</p>



<p>For a first attempt, it wasn’t half bad. It included vegetables, and the preparation was simple, so I could see myself making it again.</p>



<p>“It might be nice to top it with a soft-boiled egg or add some mayonnaise or Tabasco.”</p>



<p>Muttering to myself, Nanase responded with an exasperated tone, “Whether it’s Hachiban or this, Chitose, you sure love toppings and variations in flavors.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it great to have different ways to enjoy things all at once?”</p>



<p>“Lately, I’ve oddly started sprinkling shichimi on miso soup too.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s cool. Let’s give it a try together.”</p>



<p>“We’re already doing that, you know…”</p>



<p>While exchanging these small conversations, I voiced my concern.</p>



<p>“By the way, even though you have a significant role in the play, were you okay with taking on the position of vice-captain as well?”</p>



<p>Nanase responded as if it was no big deal. “I could throw that question right back at you.”</p>



<p>“Well, unlike me, you have club activities, right?”</p>



<p>Moreover, she mentioned that they were approaching the qualifiers for the Winter Cup. I didn’t know the specifics, but it was probably like a crucial basketball tournament similar to the Spring Koshien district competition.</p>



<p>If that was the case, she wouldn’t have the luxury of dedicating time to school events.</p>



<p>Nanase paused her meal and murmured softly, “Don’t worry, I don’t intend to neglect basketball. I’ve been observing Haru lately, and it’s made me reflect on a few things.”</p>



<p>Her sincere tone and gaze made me realize that I had been unnecessarily concerned.</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>I replied honestly, and she responded with a somewhat provocative remark. “Are you dissatisfied with me as your partner?”</p>



<p>“Not at all. You’re as dependable as ever.”</p>



<p>“That’s good then.”</p>



<p>Nanase took a sip of barley tea and then cautiously shifted to the main topic. “So, how should we proceed with the cheer squad?”</p>



<p>As we discussed during homeroom, it seemed that Nazuna would smoothly lead the class play while using Atomu as her assistant.</p>



<p>First, they would collaborate with members of the Literature Club to create a rough script. The main actors — me, Yuuko, and Nanase — were invited to a group LINE chat, where we could offer our opinions if needed. Until that part was more or less finalized, it seemed best to focus on the cheer squad for now.</p>



<p>I pondered for a moment before speaking up, “Regardless, our first step should be to establish the concept.”</p>



<p>Just as the ‘creation’ team would create a giant object that matched the team color, the cheerleading squad would express their individuality through performances.</p>



<p>According to Kurasen, for example, the Blue Team in the past had concepts like “sky”, “little mermaid”, “youth”, or “tears”. If we could associate any of those concepts with our own colors, we’d have quite a bit of freedom in interpreting them.</p>



<p>Nanase nodded in agreement. “For now, let’s have a discussion among us second-years, Nishino-senpai, and Kureha.”</p>



<p>“I’ll create a chat room just like the class group chat. We should quickly decide on the concept and then focus on song selection, choreography, and costumes.”</p>



<p>“Agreed. By the way, Chitose, do you have any ideas at this point?”</p>



<p>I pondered for a moment before replying. “When I think of the color blue, I naturally associate it with the sky and the sea, but what about the Earth?”</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t it turn into an incredibly solemn dance?”</p>



<p>“<em>Garigari-kun</em> (A famous Japanese popsicle).”</p>



<p>“Wow, that sounds suddenly cheap.”</p>



<p>“Then how about a pool?”</p>



<p>“I can only think of dancing in swimsuits…?”</p>



<p>“Hmm.”</p>



<p>“You have a look that suggests it would be worth to try.”</p>



<p>Setting jokes aside, I thought to myself. While I didn’t know what kind of performances our senpais had done in the past, I felt like an overly abstract concept might be difficult to convey to the audiences. It would be ideal if we could find something that instantly evoked the color blue and was easy to express through dance.</p>



<p>I cleared my plate of taco rice and looked up, “Well, it seems like it would be faster to discuss this together with everyone.”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Nanase agreed, finishing her soup cleanly. She placed her glass down and continued, “It was truly delicious. Thank you for the meal.”</p>



<p>“Are you satisfied?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I’m full.”</p>



<p>“I see, so that’s where the nutrients go.”</p>



<p>“You fool.”</p>



<p>Together, we carried the plates to the sink, and Nanase started doing the dishes. I stood next to her, holding a dishcloth.</p>



<p><em>Splash, scrub, swish, rinse.</em></p>



<p>Nanase was efficiently washing the dishes, then I received them and wiped away the water, all the while continuing the conversation.</p>



<p>“By the way, aside from Asu-nee, it’s a relief that Kureha seems easy to work with.”</p>



<p>Nanase glanced at me for a moment and replied in a playful tone. “Someone seems quite smitten, don’t they?”</p>



<p>“Give me a break, that’s not what I meant.”</p>



<p>“…Sorry, that was a bit tasteless.”</p>



<p>“…I wonder if Kureha-chan has a boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Hey now.”</p>



<p>Although I responded casually, it seemed to be taken more seriously than I expected, so I decided to tease her a bit. We exchanged glances and burst into laughter together.</p>



<p>Upon reflection, Kureha was undeniably as beautiful as Nanase, standing proudly beside her. </p>



<p>But… I smiled wryly.</p>



<p>At this point, I couldn’t see other girls in that way. And when she approached me with such a carefree attitude, it made me think of her as nothing more than a little sister. Well, in the first place, it was disrespectful for me to have such thoughts about her in the first place.</p>



<p>Nanase finished washing the dishes and wiped her hands with a towel before asking, “Chitose, can we move the table a bit?”</p>



<p>“Sure, but what are you going to do?”</p>



<p>Without understanding the reason, the two of us grabbed each end of the table and and moved it against the wall. Nanase headed to the bedroom and returned, cradling the crescent-shaped light she had given me as a birthday present, her expression filled with affection.</p>



<p>She placed it on the relocated table and plugged it into the socket, illuminating the room with its soft glow. When she dimmed the other lights in the room, the crescent moon faintly floated in the living room.</p>



<p>With a slight smile, Nanase extended her hand. “I promise I won’t touch anything unnecessary. Can you lend me your phone?”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to reassure me, I’m not worried in the first place.”</p>



<p>As I handed her my phone, she casually positioned it so that I could see the screen and began operating it. Despite saying I wasn’t worried, this was just like Nanase.</p>



<p>She opened a music app that I had signed up for but rarely used, and started searching for something. Perhaps she found the song she was looking for, as she glanced mischievously at me from beneath her lashes.</p>



<p>“Prince, do you know how to dance?”</p>



<p>“Do you think I do?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you think it would be lacking if the captain and vice-captain stumble through the basic steps?”</p>



<p>“Am I the Prince or the Captain? It’s getting confusing.”</p>



<p>After Nanase tapped on the smartphone, a seductive male vocal began to play, filling the air with his allure. The display read “Mary Jane,” a fitting choice by Nanase.</p>



<p>A slight smile tugged at the corners of my lips. “Are you in the mood for a leisure time with old songs playing during our cheering session?”</p>



<p>“Our Snow White might have a ball to attend, you know?”</p>



<p>“Well then, we’ll need to prepare a glass slipper as a prop.”</p>



<p>“And they must be glass slippers that I can’t fit into.”</p>



<p>This was undoubtedly one of Nanase’s playful gestures, a game without any profound meaning, yet it had a singular significance.</p>



<p>Echoing a conversation from a long-forgotten night, Nanase spoke.</p>



<p>“Shall we dance tonight?”</p>



<p>“Yes, let’s dance.”</p>



<p>So I, too, would return to that springtime.</p>



<p>To say that I had no hesitation would be a lie.</p>



<p>To acknowledge that there was shyness within me, it would become a habit.</p>



<p>It was through these repetitions that we arrived at this moment, wasn’t it?</p>



<p>Someone whispered in my ear.</p>



<p>“Stop pretending. You already know.”</p>



<p>Shut up, I understood even without being told. However, I couldn’t reach my destination by evading it.</p>



<p>Within these moments, I searched for those hidden meanings.</p>



<p>So that someday, I could give a name to this feeling────</p>



<p>Amidst the dimly lit space illuminated by the crescent moon, a boy and a girl transformed into a pair of counterfeit prince and princess.</p>



<p>I extended my right hand extravagantly and placed my left hand gracefully on my waist.</p>



<p>Nanase grasped my right hand with her left, and her spare right hand gently resting on my shoulder.</p>



<p>Our cheeks drew near, careful not to touch, careful not to separate.</p>



<p>I wrapped my left hand, dangling in midair, around Nanase’s waist.</p>



<p>And then, we took the first step.</p>



<p>Without any rehearsal, our steps overlapped in an irrevocable manner, revealing that we were kindred souls.</p>



<p>From our hearts, achingly close yet missing each other, I could feel Nanase’s heartbeat. The gap between our cheeks, like an excuse lying in between, was so evident, impossible to conceal.</p>



<p>Swaying within the distance where even the sound of blinking could be heard, our gazes still refused to meet.</p>



<p>We danced in a whimsical fashion, twirling as if by some unspoken agreement.</p>



<p>Even if our Snow White were to have a grand ball, even after knowing that the happily-ever-after wouldn’t come for us, still, we continued to play our parts.</p>



<p>Nanase recited her lines as if on a stage.</p>



<p>“Mirror, mirror…”</p>



<p>Leaning back slightly, she gazed up at me with watery, enchanting eyes, like a bewitching witch casting a spell.</p>



<p>“Who is the fairest of them all in this world?”</p>



<p>It felt as though she was posing that question directly to me, so as not to be inadvertently deceived, I averted my gaze and brought our cheeks closer once more.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>


<p>It was a little past 19:00 on the following day when class 2-5 cheer squad, along with Asu-nee and Kureha, had gathered at “Orebo Station,” a local chain in Fukui near our school.</p>



<p>This place was like a combination of a typical convenience store, bento shop, and cafeteria. Adjacent to the convenience store area, a wide array of freshly cooked side dishes and bento boxes were neatly displayed, perfect for takeout or enjoying right there in the eat-in corner.</p>



<p>Moreover, the cafeteria offered reasonably priced set meals that you could order for almost the price of pocket change, so whenever I felt too lazy to cook, I would often come here.</p>



<p>We had planned to get takeout and head to the nearby park if there were other customers around, but fortunately, the eat-in corner was empty.</p>



<p>Preparing for the school festival felt like a race against time. Kenta, Asu-nee, and I, being the only ones not involved in any club activities, would likely have more opportunities to gather like this in the evenings for a while.</p>



<p>By the way, it seemed that Kureha was part of the track and field club. I was surprised to hear that she specialized in the 100-meter dash and even participated in the Inter-High.</p>



<p>After purchasing our meals, we entered the eat-in corner.</p>



<p>The guys went for dishes like katsudon and curry from the in-store menu, while the girls opted for Orebo’s famous buffet. They received a special container and could freely choose from a selection of rice, fried rice, pasta, and various side dishes such as chicken with daikon radish and <em>nikujaga</em> (braised meat and potatoes). In other words, they could create their own personalized bento.</p>



<p>We secured two four-person seaters, with Kazuki, Kenta, Kaito, and Haru sitting at one, and Yuuko, Yua, Asu-nee, and Kureha occupying the other. Nanase and I took seats at the nearby counter.</p>



<p>Last night, I had asked everyone to think about the concept for our performance. It was uncertain if any good ideas would come up overnight, but discussing it together would likely lead to more creative brainstorming than simply pondering over it alone.</p>



<p>For now, we began eating, each at our own pace.</p>



<p>Sitting at the counter meant having our backs turned to the booths, so I swiftly finished my bowl of chashu ramen and turned to face everyone.</p>



<p>Before diving into the conversation, I took a bite of the spam and rolled egg onigiri that we had ordered together. It looked more like a giant sushi roll the size of a girl’s fist than an onigiri, with spam and rolled egg as its filling. Even just one of these provided a great sense of satisfaction, making it a staple product at Orebo that the boys often bought on their way home from club activities.</p>



<p>I cleared my throat before speaking up, “While we’re eating, does anyone have any ideas?”</p>



<p>Haru, who was currently munching on her spam and rolled egg onigiri, was the first to respond. Just to clarify, I didn’t think that’s the kind of food that would fit in with a buffet.</p>



<p>“Yes, how about Pocari Sweat!?”</p>



<p>“I totally get what you mean, but it might end up resembling a commercial. You know, the kind where people dance in school uniforms.”</p>



<p>“Welp, I couldn’t think of anything else.”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Asu-nee raised her hand next.</p>



<p>“Yes, Asu-nee?”</p>



<p>“Um, how about ‘Blue Bird of Happiness’…?”</p>



<p>“Ah, so that’s another perspective.”</p>



<p>“Since it’s based on an original fairy tale, it might be easier to find inspiration.”</p>



<p>I think it’s not a bad idea. As the only senpai among us, she probably put a lot of thought into it.</p>



<p>Yuzuki, who had just finished her meal, turned to face Asu-nee and nodded, “Yeah, I think that’s a good one. Let’s keep it as one of the options. What do the others think?”</p>



<p>Next, Yua raised her hand, “How about an aquarium?”</p>



<p>I nodded approvingly and replied, “That’s great. It’s more concrete and easier to visualize than the sea.”</p>



<p>“We could wear colorful and fluttery costumes like tropical fish and do a dance that makes it seem like we’re swimming together.”</p>



<p>“Indeed, let’s consider that as well.”</p>



<p>Yua scratched her cheek shyly, “I just remembered a funny metaphor that Yamazaki-kun mentioned back at Takokyu.”</p>



<p>“Me! Me! Me!” Yuuko energetically raised her hand, “Something blue!”</p>



<p>Nanase responded to her suggestion, “Oh, I see. That’s an interesting idea.”</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek before asking, “That phrase sounds familiar, but what was it again?”</p>



<p>Nanase chuckled and explained, “It’s like a traditional custom at weddings. There’s this thing called ‘Something Four’ that they say brings happiness when the bride wears it. Something old, something new, something borrowed, and then something blue.”</p>



<p>“So, the concept is…?”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s innocent smile brightened, “Yes, a wedding!”</p>



<p>Suddenly, an awkward feeling washed over me, and I averted my gaze.</p>



<p>It was reassuring, in a way, that she was still the same. Perhaps she just mentioned it because it genuinely came to mind, but after everything that happened, didn’t that concept feel too heavy?</p>



<p>I wondered if I was overthinking, so I glanced at everyone to see their reactions. Except for Nanase, who’s smiling wryly, it seemed like everyone else was puzzled about how to respond.</p>



<p>Yuuko looked around with a wandering gaze, her expression perplexed, “Huh?”</p>



<p>After a while, </p>



<p>“────!!!”</p>



<p>She finally connected the dots between everyone’s reactions and what she said. She blushed and lowered her head.</p>



<p>Then, she slowly raised her head and said in a voice reminiscent of a lost puppy.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Saku.”</p>



<p>For some reason, her demeanor appeared so endearing, and I tried to brush it off with a casual remark.</p>



<p>“No, I actually think it’s a clever idea.”</p>



<p>Then, to break the awkwardness, I turned to the only kouhai who seemed unaffected by it.</p>



<p>“Um, Kureha, did you come up with anything?”</p>



<p>Kureha, who had been quietly observing the situation, pointed to herself in surprise.</p>



<p>“Me?”</p>



<p>Yeah, sorry for being such a pathetic senpai.</p>



<p>“I think everyone’s suggestions are stylish and wonderful…”</p>



<p>By the way, it seemed that on the evening of the cheer squad’s introduction, we all received polite greetings from her, including me and Nanase. Somehow, we quickly became familiar enough to address each other by first names, which was a relief because it saved us from being overly formal.</p>



<p>She must have considered it beforehand.</p>



<p>Kureha opened her mouth without showing any signs of hesitation, “I’m also thinking about the sea, so how about pirates?”</p>



<p>“────OOOOHH!”</p>



<p>Everyone’s voices unintentionally overlapped.</p>



<p>Kureha continued with a carefree smile, “I would love to see senpais in actions!”</p>



<p>“Pirates, huh? That’s a good idea,” said Nanase after contemplating for a moment, “With swords and props, it could become quite spectacular, and the costumes would be easy to imagine.”</p>



<p>Kureha spoke excitedly, “Yes! Senpai can be the captain, and Yuzuki-san can be the vice-captain!”</p>



<p>I nodded, “Indeed, if we incorporate fight scenes, it would be easy for everyone to understand and get excited.”</p>



<p>Kazuki seemed enthusiastic too, “Saku can do a backflip or a somersault, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s been a while since elementary school, but with some practice, I should be able to manage it.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s face brightened, and she crossed her arms in front of her chest, “If Senpai and Kazuki-san intersect from left and right like this and perform, it will be so intense!”</p>



<p>Kaito flexed his muscles as he spoke, “If we’re pirates, I’ll swing around a massive spear or an axe!”</p>



<p>Kureha earnestly responded to each suggestion, “It definitely suits you, Kaito-san!”</p>



<p>Kenta muttered under his breath, resting his hand on the bridge of his glasses.</p>



<p>“Hmm… me as a pirate. Not bad at all.”</p>



<p>“Um, Kenta-san…?”</p>



<p>It seemed like a strange switch had been flipped inside him.</p>



<p>Haru chuckled, folding her hands behind her head, “Oh, I agree. Actions speak louder than alluring dances.”</p>



<p>Kureha scratched her cheek with a hearty laugh, “I always thought girls would play the role of being protected, but Haru-san seems eager to fight.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee smiled faintly and spoke, “Hehe, it’s going to be an exciting adventure.”</p>



<p>Kureha sighed with relief, gently stroking her chest, “I’m glad. I thought the concept of pirates might be a bit barbaric for Asuka-san.”</p>



<p>Yua lowered the corner of her eye with a soft chuckle, “Kureha-chan, thank you for the idea.”</p>



<p>Kureha shyly lowered her gaze, “But Yua-san, I also thought your idea about aquarium would be beautiful!”</p>



<p>Naturally, everyone’s gaze converged on one person. Seemingly having completely switched her mood, Yuuko raised her fist high, true to her character.</p>



<p>“Alright, everyone, ready!”</p>



<p>In response to her call, we all raised our fists in unison.</p>



<p>“”””READY!!!””””</p>



<p>Someone bursts into laughter, and colorful flowers bloomed with mirth.</p>



<p>Kureha raised her fist halfway, her eyes widening in surprise, “Wait, is it really okay? Even for you, Yuuko-san?”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>And so, we instinctively reached for our drinks and stood up.</p>



<p>Nanase cleared her throat with a small cough. In what seemed to be an imitation of a vice-captain, she spoke in an exaggeratedly low voice.</p>



<p>“With that, ladies and gentlemen, we hereby form our pirate crew.”</p>



<p>When Nanase glanced my way, I caught her intention and deliberately crafted a sharp and poised expression. With an unnecessarily pompous tone, I whispered my lines like an actor on stage.</p>



<p>“Spanning across the seven seas, let’s paint over the five colors with the hue of blue.”</p>



<p>And so, I proudly raised the Regal Freshness.</p>



<p>“Sail forth, you scoundrels!”</p>



<p>“Oooooohhhhhhh!!”</p>



<p>The sound of plastic bottles and cartons resonated, creating a symphony that was uniquely ours, an anthem of vibrant blue heralding the beginning of our adventure.</p>



<p>Foolishly cheerful, refreshingly cool, it pervaded the air with a sense of clarity. Though we lacked rum or champagne on our ship, cider and Pocari would suffice.</p>



<p>Together with our usual crew, senpai and kouhai alike.</p>



<p>This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or so I believed.</p>



<p>Next year, the school festival would come around again, but Asu-nee wouldn’t be there. And unless fate took an unexpectedly favorable turn, even Kureha would wear a different color next year.</p>



<p>For this one and only voyage, I didn’t want to leave any room for regrets.</p>



<p>Hand in hand, we ventured deeper and deeper into the boundless sea of blue.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8</strong></p>


<p>As we left Orebo, the clock had already struck 9 p.m.</p>



<p>Thinking about going home and finishing my homework, I couldn’t help but feel the burden on the club members.</p>



<p>I glanced at the kouhai standing beside me and spoke up, “You alright? You must be tired.”</p>



<p>Kureha, who seemed a bit down, quickly put on a bright smile, “Not at all! Despite appearances, I have confidence in my stamina.”</p>



<p>“Well, as long as you’re okay, but make sure not to push yourself too hard.”</p>



<p>Nanase, who had overheard our conversation, chimed in, “Chitose, could you take Kureha home?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, sure.”</p>



<p>Considering the time and the fact that she’s a female first-year, it felt a bit awkward to let her go home alone.</p>



<p>Kureha waved her hand in surprise, “Oh no, you don’t have to go through the trouble.”</p>



<p>Nanase gave a wry smile at her innocent reaction and continued, “Well, this kind of thing is more like a privilege than an obligation for senpais.”</p>



<p>Pausing for a moment, she directed a slightly provocative gaze towards me.</p>



<p>“And it would be nice for someone to show off in front of their cute kouhai, right?”</p>



<p>It was clear that she had prepared this excuse for Kureha’s sake.</p>



<p>Playing along with Nanase’s words, I replied, “Escorting a younger girl home is a dream every high school boy has.”</p>



<p>Kureha chuckled softly, as if finding it amusing, “Does that include you, senpai?”</p>



<p>I jokingly responded, “Oh, well, I suppose I wouldn’t mind taking advantage of this opportunity.”</p>



<p>Kureha blushed slightly and lowered her gaze.</p>



<p>“Then, I’ll make your wish come true, Senpai!” She said, bursting into a bright smile.</p>



<p>Yuuko, Yua, Haru, Asu-nee, the guys, everyone watched this scene with warm gazes.</p>



<p>Well, Kureha was like the MVP of the day, after all. A small token of appreciation is well-deserved. Thanks to her suggestion, we were able to swiftly overcome the issue that could have dragged on endlessly. </p>



<p>Perhaps Nanase and I were thinking along the same lines. Nanase, who had just unlocked her bicycle, glanced at me as if she had suddenly remembered something.</p>



<p>“How should we proceed from here?”</p>



<p>“We should decide on the song, dances, and costumes as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>Without making those decisions, we wouldn’t be able to start the full rehearsals or the production. However, it would be quite burdensome for everyone to stay behind until this late after club activities every day.</p>



<p>As I pondered for a moment,</p>



<p>“Alrighty then!”</p>



<p>Yuuko raised her hand as if she had come up with something. Looking around at everyone, she continued.</p>



<p>“If it’s alright with you all, how about having sleepover at my house this weekend?”</p>



<p>“Wha…?”</p>



<p>My voice and Nanase’s overlapped.</p>



<p>Certainly, I thought it would be more efficient to set aside dedicated time for everyone, but it still felt awkward to invade someone’s house with this many people.</p>



<p>Nanase scratched her cheek apologetically and looked at me, “Wouldn’t it be too much of a bother… right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I agree.”</p>



<p>I wanted to suggest doing it at my place, but while it would be fine for everyone to gather and have a discussion, it would be a bit cramped for all of us to sleep over.</p>



<p>Yuuko nonchalantly spoke up, “Don’t worry! My parents are away on a trip!”</p>



<p>And with a slightly embarrassed tone, she added, “It happens occasionally, so I’m used to it, but being alone on the weekend is still lonely…”</p>



<p>Nanase and I exchanged glances. If Kotone-san and the others weren’t there, it might not be too much of a bother as long as we tidied up properly and went home afterward.</p>



<p>When I struggled to answer, Yuuko continued as if a thought had just struck her.</p>



<p>“But we might have to prepare our own meals. And I doubt we have enough futons for everyone…”</p>



<p>Scratching the back of my neck, I replied, “Well, if it’s just the food, we can always buy from Texas Hands or something…”</p>



<p>Texas Hands was a pizza chain originating from Fukui. By the way, the reason I said “buy” instead of “order” was that if you picked it up yourself or ate it inside the store, even just one pizza would be half price.</p>



<p>It’s not that uncommon these days, but Texas Hands was apparently the first to start this service nationwide.</p>



<p>Just then, Yua opened her mouth and said, “If it’s just a matter of food, I can cook. I don’t think I can make anything elaborate with so many people, though.”</p>



<p>Nanase said with a slightly embarrassed tone, “If it’s not bother, I could help too.”</p>



<p>I continued, “As for futons, the guys can just crash on the floor during this season.”</p>



<p>Looking at Kazuki and the others, they nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“Is everyone okay with their club activities?”</p>



<p>Haru responded to my question, “Nana and I have practice on Saturday morning, but Sunday is off because Misaki-chan has some things to do.”</p>



<p>Judging from everyone else’s reactions, it seemed like they were also available. Asu-nee and Kureha both had excited expressions on their faces. Well, this kind of excitement was to be expected during a school festival.</p>



<p>“Alright then…”</p>



<p>I paused for a moment, glanced at everyone’s faces to confirm.</p>



<p>“Let’s do it! The Blue Sea Pirates’ sleepover!”</p>



<p>“Yeeeeeeahhhhhh!”</p>



<p>And so, we raised our fists in the air once again, this time under the night sea.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9</strong></p>


<p>After bidding farewell to everyone in front of Orebo, it was just me and Kureha leisurely walking along the riverside path.</p>



<p>At this hour, I truly felt the end of summer approaching.</p>



<p>The cool air gently brushed against my cheeks, creating a pleasant sensation. Even the wheels of my mountain bike, which I pushed alongside, seemed to be relaxing with a creaking sound.</p>



<p>Kureha spoke apologetically, “I’m sorry, I should have come by bicycle too.”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind walking. However, during the preparations for the school festival, we’ll be moving around a lot, so having a bike might be more convenient.”</p>



<p>“Yes, I’ll keep that in mind!”</p>



<p>“There’s no need to be so formal.”</p>



<p>I, Yua, Asu-nee, and even Yuuko, who usually commuted on foot or got a ride from Kotone-san, had come on bicycles today, which was quite rare.</p>



<p>Kureha had ridden with Kaito from the school to Orebo, but he seemed genuinely happy as he pedaled, so there was no problem at all.</p>



<p>I could sense Kureha’s gaze on me from the side.</p>



<p>“Still, being able to have a nice chat with a senpai like this is a privilege.”</p>



<p>Out of habit, for a split second, I almost started to suspect the hidden meaning behind her words. But when I saw her innocent smile directed at me, any excessive self-conscious thoughts melted away, leaving only a sense of guilt.</p>



<p>Though she was the kind of silent beauty that made it a bit difficult to approach, when interacting with her, there was a youthful innocence befitting a kouhai. Maybe I hadn’t quite grown accustomed to that contrast yet.</p>



<p>I smiled wryly and spoke up, intending it as casual small talk, “Why did you join the cheering squad, Kureha?”</p>



<p>“Because you and the other senpais were there, of course!”</p>



<p>To my surprise, her answer came unexpectedly.</p>



<p>“W-We…?”</p>



<p>I was taken aback and involuntarily responded with a dumbfounded expression.</p>



<p>Kureha continued as if it were obvious, “Yes! Senpai, you guys are really noticeable at school, you know? There are a lot of first-year students, regardless of gender, who are hidden fans or admire you.”</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek while averting my gaze, “…It’s embarrassing to hear that so directly.”</p>



<p>Unabashed, Kureha continued, “That’s why when rumors started spreading that senpai and the others had joined the cheering squad for the Blue Team, the competition in our class became really fierce.”</p>



<p>Her straightforward gaze tickled something inside me, so I changed the subject.</p>



<p>“By the way, thanks for today. Without a clear concept, we wouldn’t have been able to make any progress, so I appreciate your help.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s face instantly brightened up, “No, thank you! I never expected my idea to be chosen, so I’m really happy!”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it difficult being the only first-year student?”</p>



<p>“Not at all! All the senpais are friendly and kind.”</p>



<p>“I see, that’s good then.”</p>



<p>While I knew Asu-nee, who was acquainted with everyone, would be fine, Kureha was meeting them all for the first time. Despite thinking that her carefree attitude would help her fit in, I still had some concerns.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a tranquil silence fell, accompanied by the gentle sound of water ripples. The air carried the scent of a September night, not as rich as summer yet not as dry as autumn, spreading its essence everywhere.</p>



<p>And then, the silhouette of my kouhai swayed in the moonlit shadows.</p>



<p>“Hey, Senpai?”</p>



<p>She pulled at my sleeve, and when I stopped, Kureha stood right beside me, peering closely into my face. Her long, supple eyelashes blinked like stardust, and a breath escaped her lips, teasing mine with a tingling sensation.</p>



<p>Kureha pursed her lips slightly, lowering the corners of her eyes like a delicate crescent moon brooch.</p>



<p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>Her words carried an air of maturity, exuding a sensuality reminiscent of night cherry blossoms blooming as the sun sets.</p>



<p>“──So that I can catch up to the senpais, and be accepted as part of the group.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t find the right words to respond to her. Kureha casually moved her gaze away from my face as if nothing happened.</p>



<p>“By the way, I’m really looking forward to the sleepover, senpai!”</p>



<p>Finally returning back to her usual tone, I felt relieved and then spoke up.</p>



<p>“Yeah, you can expect delicious meals from Yua.”</p>



<p>“I’m sure they’ll be amazing!”</p>



<p>“But there’s one thing,” I added, as if reminding her. “Everyone already considers you as part of the group, Kureha.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, I’d be really happy if that’s the case.”</p>



<p>The relationship between us, a senpai and a kouhai girl was clearly vague, still beyond my comprehension. I quietly chuckled at myself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10</strong></p>


<p>And so, the Saturday afternoon arrived.</p>



<p>I stood in front of Yuuko’s house. It had a modern design with a predominant white color, accented with touches of black and wooden materials. There was a garden spacious enough for ten people to perform a small choreographed dance, and among the considerably large houses in Fukui, it was quite impressive.</p>



<p>Although I had walked her home countless times from last year, this was my first time stepping inside.</p>



<p>If I lingered too long, hesitation would surely creep in. So, I tried to relax and pressed the intercom button.</p>



<p>In that instant, as if she had been eagerly waiting, the door swung open.</p>



<p>“Saku!”</p>



<p>Yuuko, dressed more casually than usual, rushed out with an air of urgency. She dashed over to me in a flurry.</p>



<p>“Hey, be careful. You might trip if you’re that flustered.”</p>



<p>Ignoring my words as if she didn’t hear them, she opened the gate and hurriedly stepped outside, swiftly closing it behind her.</p>



<p>She took a slight breath, then tightly gripped my hand with both of hers.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” Her eyes, glistening with the threat of tears, looked up at me, “I forgot about a precious promise.”</p>



<p>In that moment, I instantly grasped the meaning behind her abrupt words.</p>



<p>Because I had remembered the exact same thing last night.</p>



<p><em>“──Someday, when a special moment comes.”</em></p>



<p>The words I had casually uttered on our way home in April resurfaced in my mind. Certainly, everything between us had changed, and perhaps the special day we had envisioned back then had taken a slightly different form.</p>



<p>Yuuko tightly sealed her lips and then, with a timid and hesitant manner, began to speak.</p>



<p>“You know, if Saku…”</p>



<p>But before she could finish her sentence, I interrupted her.</p>



<p>“──Thank you. It seems you’ve cherished it as well, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>If Yuuko hadn’t brought it up herself, I could have pretended it never happened. Those words that spilled into the sentimental border between day and night could easily have been buried deep in the pocket of forgetfulness for ten years, and no one would have been troubled.</p>



<p>Yet, Yuuko referred to it as a precious promise.</p>



<p>If the dusk of that day still lingered within both our hearts…</p>



<p>I smiled mischievously and said, “Let’s turn these two days into a special memory for everyone. For now, maybe we can just leave it at that.”</p>



<p>Yuuko pressed her lips together tightly, as if to hide her embarrassment, and her eyes softened with an endearing look.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I agree.”</p>



<p>She softly spoke, and then, unable to contain her emotions any longer, her cheeks relaxed,</p>



<p>“──Someday, until I become your ordinary.”</p>



<p>She smiled shyly with a hint of a giggle.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>11</strong></p>


<p>As Yuuko led me inside the living room, I was immediately struck by its spaciousness.</p>



<p>I had always thought my own home, despite being a bit extravagant for a single person, had a generous layout, but this place seemed to be more than double that size.</p>



<p>Contrasting the white-themed exterior, the interior exuded a calming atmosphere with its wood accents. The seating area, where sofas and a television were arranged, sat slightly lower than the surrounding space.</p>



<p>Although I felt a bit intimidated by the luxurious-looking audio set, the familiar melodies of J-POP hit songs playing from it made me relax a little.</p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p><em>Tap, tap, tap.</em></p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed the familiar sound that I had grown accustomed to throughout the summer, and my gaze shifted.</p>



<p>I vaguely recalled it being an island kitchen type. Standing in the independently separated space that resembled a floating island at the edge of the living room, Yua greeted me.</p>



<p>“Good afternoon, Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>Observing her in her apron, I responded, “Hey, you’re early. Are you preparing for lunch, by any chance?”</p>



<p>“I thought some people might be hungry, like Yuzuki-chan and Haru-chan after their club activities, so I made some just in case.”</p>



<p>“By the way, I had a feeling it would turn out like this, so I came on an empty stomach.”</p>



<p>Yua chuckled shyly, “Kotone-san said that we don’t need to pay her anything and just use all leftover ingredients. So, for lunch, we have improvised Japanese-style pasta.”</p>



<p>Yuuko reacted to those words, “Seriously, Mom always buys too much pasta.”</p>



<p>I chuckled wryly and said, “Don’t worry. With the group we have today, even if you boil enough to feed an army, they’ll devour it all.”</p>



<p>The three of us exchanged glances and burst into laughter, when suddenly the intercom rang.</p>



<p>“Coming, coming.”</p>



<p>Yuuko hurriedly went to the entrance, and after a while, she returned with Asu-nee by her side.</p>



<p>Wearing the same white dress and a retro leather Boston bag as when we went to Tokyo together just a few months ago, it felt strangely nostalgic. Asu-nee glanced at me and Yua, then shyly spoke up.</p>



<p>“Hello, sorry to intrude.”</p>



<p>Her words seemed to carry the meaning of not just entering Yuuko’s house but joining our class 2-5 circle, causing a gentle smile to form at the corners of my lips. Since I had mostly been alone with Asu-nee when we met, there was indeed still a slight sense of unfamiliarity.</p>



<p>Seeing her fidgeting and looking restless, I took her Boston bag and lined it up with my own backpack in the corner of the living room.</p>



<p>“What’s in that bag?” I asked, and Asu-nee raised the plastic bag she had been holding.</p>



<p>“Oh, right. It’s nothing special, but it’s a little treat for everyone.”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s face immediately lit up with excitement. “Oh, how wonderful! What is it?”</p>



<p>Perhaps feeling a bit embarrassed by Yuuko’s exaggerated reaction, Asu-nee blushed slightly and scratched her cheek as she answered. “Um, there’s PapiCo, Chupa Chups, and various other ice creams like Choco Monaka Jumbo.”</p>



<p>“Oh, those are Kaito’s favorites! Let’s all eat them during our break later!” Yuuko said, her face beaming with joy as she took the plastic bag and happily headed towards the refrigerator.</p>



<p>I turned to Asu-nee, who was standing there somewhat lost, and said, “For now, why don’t we sit down until everyone’s here?”</p>



<p>In response to my words, she glanced at Yua for a moment before replying. “Yes, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything I can help with.”</p>



<p>We sat down on the sofa with a little space between us, and Asu-nee, who seemed restless, said, “Is this how you guys always gather?”</p>



<p>I stifled a laugh and lightly shook my head. “If you mean gathering at Yuuko’s house with friends, then this is my first time too. I think the only one who’s been here before is Yua, although I don’t think she ever stayed overnight.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee’s face relaxed a bit. “I see. I’m not sure if I can call myself a friend…”</p>



<p>She looked at Yuuko and Yua for a moment. Seeing Asu-nee’s bashful smile, I couldn’t help but interject with a wry smile. “Well, friends should be fine.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee, still feeling a bit shy, continued in a somewhat timid tone. “It’s my first time staying over at a friend’s house.”</p>



<p>Seeing her so excited like this, I thought inviting her to the cheering squad was really a good idea.</p>



<p>Teasingly, I said, “We’ll have a pillow fight at night, you know.”</p>



<p>“You get rough on the bed, I don’t want to.”</p>



<p>“Please stop using phrasing that could lead to misunderstandings.”</p>



<p>As we were engrossed in our conversation, it seemed like someone else had arrived.</p>



<p>It was Kureha, who entered alongside Yuuko. She wore an oversized, loose-fitting short-sleeved hoodie paired with a pleated skirt of a shorter length.</p>



<p>After taking a glance at everyone in the living room and then at Yuuko standing beside her, Kureha spoke up with enthusiasm. “Nice to meet you all! I’ll be counting on you for the next two days!”</p>



<p>She politely bowed towards us.</p>



<p>In response, Yua, Asu-nee and I each returned the greetings.</p>



<p>“Yeah, nice to meet you.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be counting on you too, Kureha-chan.”</p>



<p>“The pleasure is all mine, Nozomi-san.”</p>



<p>Kureha lifted her head and flashed a mischievous smile. Then, raising the box she had been holding in her hand, she opened her mouth. “I also brought some treats!”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s face lit up instantly. “Oh, it’s from Mister Donut!”</p>



<p>According to some information I had come across before, Fukui apparently had the highest number of Mister Donut stores per 100,000 people in Japan. Regardless of whether that’s true or not, it was indeed a classic treat since childhood.</p>



<p>Whenever there were family gatherings or club celebrations, those lively occasions with a large number of people, it was quite common to have a table filled with Texas Hands pizza and Mister Donut.</p>



<p>Lost in thought about these things, Kureha continued. “What flavor do you like, Yuuko-san?”</p>



<p>“Coconut chocolate!”</p>



<p>“I’ve got it covered!”</p>



<p>“And what about you, Kureha?”</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s all about the donut pops! I’m greedy, so I want them all!”</p>



<p>As she said that, the two of them chuckled together. After exchanging a few more words, Kureha put down her belongings and approached us.</p>



<p>Standing nearby, she seemed to be pondering something with a slightly perplexed expression.</p>



<p>After I exchanged glances with Asu-nee, I decided to speak up.</p>



<p>“I know it might be weird coming from me since this is not my house, but why don’t you just sit down?”</p>



<p>Kureha, still wearing a perplexed expression, responded. “Choosing between sitting next to Senpai or sitting next to Asuka-san… It’s the ultimate dilemma.”</p>



<p>My eyes met Asu-nee’s once again, and this time, a small laugh escaped my lips. I wondered what she was hesitating about, so it was apparently something like that.</p>



<p>Asu-nee chuckled softly, her shoulders shaking with amusement.</p>



<p>Resting my hands on the sofa, I suggested, “If that’s the case, should we shift a little? Sitting in the middle would solve the problem, right?”</p>



<p>In response, a stern palm was directed towards me. “No, that feels like avoiding the choice, so it’s fine!”</p>



<p>“You’re exaggerating.”</p>



<p>After contemplating for a while, Kureha made up her mind, “I’ve decided. I want to sit next to Senpai!”</p>



<p>With a swift motion, she plopped down energetically. Her short pleated skirt fluttered slightly, and I hurriedly averted my gaze before speaking.</p>



<p>“Kureha, did you bring a change of clothes?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why do you ask that?”</p>



<p>“With that skirt, it’s impossible for you to dance, right?”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes widened for a moment, and then she hurriedly pressed down on her skirt.</p>



<p>With a gaze that expressed more guilt than embarrassment, she spoke, “Did I… spoil the view for you, Senpai?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like you spoiled the view, but I haven’t really taken a close look, so—don’t pinch my side, Asu-nee, it hurts!”</p>



<p>When I glanced at Asu-nee, she had turned away with a huff.</p>



<p>“Wait, wasn’t that the correct admonition as a Senpai?”</p>



<p>“You do have those moments, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“Are you sulking because she didn’t choose to sit next to you?”</p>



<p>“I’m not sulking.”</p>



<p>Kureha, who had been watching our exchange with keen interest, hurriedly spoke up. “Wait, Asuka-san, you’ve misunderstood. It’s not what you think.”</p>



<p>This time, it was Asu-nee who became flustered. “Ah, sorry, Nozomi-san. It was just a joke, so don’t worry about it.”</p>



<p>Since we rarely had the chance to talk in the presence of others, both of us unintentionally brought our usual banter into the conversation. If Kureha heard our conversation just now, it wouldn’t be strange for her to think that Asu-nee was angry with her.</p>



<p>I also needed to reflect on that, I thought with self-deprecation.</p>



<p>As I pondered over this, Kureha, for some reason, opened her mouth again, her eyes showing more embarrassment than apologetic.</p>



<p>“Asuka-san, you’re incredibly beautiful, so if I sat next to you, I’d be too nervous to say anything… That’s why I sit next to Senpai.”</p>



<p>I see, so that’s why she chose me.</p>



<p>“…Huh? Hold on, what do you mean? Hey, kouhai!”</p>



<p>Asu-nee and Kureha exchanged glances then burst into laughter.</p>



<p>Asu-nee, with a tickled expression spoke. “Thank you. But I think the word ‘beautiful’ is meant for someone like you, Nozomi-san.”</p>



<p>“No, no, that’s not true at all. I really think Asuka-san was born to wear a white dress!”</p>



<p>When I listened to their playful conversation, feeling somewhat left out, Asu-nee turned to look at me.</p>



<p>“It means Nozomi-san feels safe when she’s next to you.”</p>



<p>In response to those words, Kureha beamed with a radiant smile. “Yes! I want to stay by Senpai’s side forever!”</p>



<p>“That’s great to hear!”</p>



<p>As I went along with her enthusiasm, a sense of relief washed over me. Kureha, who I had initially thought was a bit too serious, had quickly opened up.</p>



<p>Although it wasn’t solely because I was her senpai or the captain of the cheer squad, I hoped that being a part of this group would create irreplaceable memories for everyone.</p>



<p>Kureha, who had been giggling with Asu-nee, suddenly glanced in my direction. Did she perhaps think I was genuinely feeling down?</p>



<p>But then, she placed both hands on the sofa and scooted closer, pressing herself against me. At a distance where our body warmth mingled, Kureha opened her mouth.</p>



<p>“Just like you see Asuka-san as your senpai, to me, you are my senpai.”</p>



<p>In a voice brimming with earnestness, I lightly thought that there was no need to worry because it was just a joke.</p>



<p>“Well, I suppose so. Though I’m not as beautiful as Asu-nee.”</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re teasing me. Well, then I have something to say too.”</p>



<p>And then, in that moment of silence,</p>



<p>“──Hey, Saku-nii?”</p>



<p>Kureha’s voice, in a sensuously captivating tone, sent shivers down my spine. I looked at Asu-nee, and she looked at me.</p>



<p>Kureha spun her words with a smoothness that made it seem as if she weren’t the least bit perturbed.</p>



<p>“Please, don’t treat me like a child.”</p>



<p>Her faint, narrowed eyes and slightly parted lips left me speechless. As I pondered how to react, Kureha nonchalantly returned to her usual tone.</p>



<p>“Just kidding. I just envied the relationship you two have and thought to imitate it.”</p>



<p>I exchanged a glance with Asu-nee and scratched my cheek. “Please spare me from being called that.”</p>



<p>Honestly, I still wasn’t quite used to this side of Kureha, like during our walk home the other day or now. While her appearance may be that of a kouhai, there were times when she had an unexpectedly alluring aura that caught me off guard.</p>



<p>Perhaps, as she herself had claimed, it was just a joke, or maybe it was the fluctuation of adolescence, where one oscillates between being a child and an adult.</p>



<p>Either way, it seemed like it was a kouhai’s duty to playfully tease their senpai like this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>12</strong></p>


<p>Then, one after another, Kazuki, Kaito, and Kenta arrived, followed by the girls from the basketball club.</p>



<p>Nanase raised one hand lightly in front of her face and spoke. “Sorry, because of someone, club activities dragged on a bit.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, Haru retorted with a frown. “It’s because Nana provokes me until the very end, right?”</p>



<p>Well, they probably got all fired up as usual and had a match or something.</p>



<p>Nanase apologetically handed over a plastic bag. “Here, Yuuko. Since we could only stop by a convenience store, it’s just a random snacks.”</p>



<p>Yuuko happily accepted it. “Thank you! I didn’t prepare anything myself, so this helps.”</p>



<p>Ignoring their exchange, Haru headed straight to Yua. She must have spotted the pasta that was almost ready because she opened her mouth with a delighted expression.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki, you’re absolutely right!”</p>



<p>Nanase responded with a relaxed smile. “Of course. Uchi will definitely have something prepared for us.”</p>



<p>“Phew, I was so hungry, I was about to stop by for a beef bowl on the way.”</p>



<p>“But seriously, coming with such expectations, is that a typical girl behaviour?”</p>



<p>“Too late for that. Uchi, I’ll take the large serving!”</p>



<p>Yua nodded with a smile at Haru’s words. “Sure, eat a lot.”</p>



<p>After that, we all cooperated to prepare plates, chopsticks, spoons, and drinks. We gathered around a large coffee table placed in front of the sofa and sat directly on the carpet.</p>



<p>I suddenly remembered the baseball team’s training camp and felt a nostalgic sensation. Even though we were used to seeing each other every day, just the fact that we were staying overnight together made it all the more exciting, and it was quite intriguing.</p>



<p>I think a training camp had a slightly different atmosphere from school events like summer study camp or field trips. Sitting around the same table with close friends, eating the same meal, practicing together, and sleeping together. It was a continuation of our everyday life, yet it felt closer than usual, so there was a slight awkwardness. </p>



<p>However, there were those who got overly excited, some who try to act as usual but unconsciously become more aloof, and some who just naturally be themselves. This blend was the essence of a training camp.</p>



<p>Well, this was much more glamorous than the group of gloomy faces from those days, though.</p>



<p>I cleared my throat and opened my mouth.</p>



<p>“Now then, with gratitude for the blessings of heaven and earth, and especially to Yua-chan, let’s start by filling our stomachs.”</p>



<p>Everyone joined their hands and followed along.</p>



<p>“”””Thanks for the meal!””””</p>



<p>What Yua had prepared was a Japanese-style pasta with pork, perilla leaves, chopped pickled plums, and thinly sliced onions.</p>



<p>I twirled the pasta around my fork and took a bite. The base flavor seemed to be soy-based broth, perhaps with a hint of white miso.</p>



<p>Even though it’s not surprising that it tasted delicious, the combination of rich and refreshing flavors melded perfectly, appealing to both men and women. Knowing Yua, she must have considered that aspect as well.</p>



<p>It’s truly admirable, I couldn’t help but smile wryly.</p>



<p>Yuuko, Haru, and Nanase, who had all tasted Yua’s homemade cooking before, spoke up one after another.</p>



<p>“Uchi, you should teach my mom this recipe next time!”</p>



<p>“Hey, is there more for seconds?”</p>



<p>“As expected.”</p>



<p>Next, Asu-nee responded. She savored the dish slowly, and for some reason, her eyes narrowed with a fleeting touch of melancholy before suddenly breaking into a smile.</p>



<p>“Uchida-san, it’s truly delicious.”</p>



<p>Yua responded shyly. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t make anything more elaborate with this number of people.”</p>



<p>Normally, she would serve a salad and soup as well, so she probably felt a bit unsatisfied with herself.</p>



<p>Asu-nee muttered softly, her gaze lowered. “It’s troublesome when you say it’s not elaborate…”</p>



<p>As if to drown out her words, Kaito shouted;</p>



<p>“Whoooooaahhhhhh!” With a slightly crumbled expression, he continued, “This is the first time I’ve eaten a dish cooked by a girl other than my mom.”</p>



<p>Beside him, Kenta was even on the verge of tears, “I’m glad I’m alive…”</p>



<p>Yua smiled awkwardly, “You two are exaggerating.”</p>



<p>A thought crossed my mind, so I spoke up. “Leaving Kenta aside, haven’t you ever eaten it before, Kaito?”</p>



<p>It had been about a year since Kaito became friends with Yua. I felt like there must have been some opportunity to try her cooking somewhere…</p>



<p>But for some reason, Kaito glared at me intensely, as if I were his mortal enemy. Furrowing his brow and twisting his mouth, he spoke;</p>



<p>“Huh? Are you really the one saying that?”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Feeling insecure because you have no luck with girls?”</p>



<p>At my words, Kazuki chuckled softly. “Saku, what if Kaito asked you to let him have a bite of the bento Uchi made for you?”</p>



<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, that’s my bento. I won’t give it to him!”</p>



<p>“What if Kaito asked you for a taste of the side dish Uchi prepared when he visited your house?”</p>



<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, that’s my dinner. I won’t give it to him!”</p>



<p>“You see, it’s like that.”</p>



<p>Ah, finally understanding, I looked at Kaito while scratching my cheek. “It’s an opportunity that may not come again. Enjoy your meal today.”</p>



<p>“Shut up!”</p>



<p>Kureha, who seemed to have been eagerly waiting for our banter to end, opened her mouth. “Yua-san, this is the best pasta I’ve ever eaten!”</p>



<p>Yua chuckled and touched her cheek. “Thank you, Kureha-chan. If you’d like, I’ll find another opportunity to make something more elaborate for you someday.”</p>



<p>“Really!? It’s a promise then!”</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” Kureha tilted her head curiously. “Are you and Yua-san dating, Senpai?”</p>



<p>“──Wha!?”</p>



<p>I managed not to blow pasta out of my nose. <em>Good job, me.</em></p>



<p>Yua waved her hands frantically and responded, “N-No, we’re not dating!”</p>



<p>With a bewildered expression, Kureha replied. “But you make bentos and dinner for him everyday, right? And Senpai, you live alone, don’t you?”</p>



<p>Well, now that she put it that way, it did make sense. If an unaware kouhai only heard this information, it’s no wonder they would misunderstand.</p>



<p>Kureha continued, as if she had just remembered something. “Also, I’ve seen you two walking home together.”</p>



<p>She must have already known about us from the beginning, so it wasn’t strange for her to have witnessed such moments. Seeing Yua struggling to explain, I decided to answer in her place.</p>



<p>“I was leading a rather indulgent lifestyle, and Yua couldn’t stand it, so she’s been lending me a hand. When we walk home together, it’s usually for grocery shopping.”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed to accept that explanation easily. “I see. Yua-san, you really are as kind as your name suggests!”</p>



<p>“Oh, come to think of it,” she added. “Senpai, have you and Yuzuki-san already broken up?”</p>



<p>She really dropped a bombshell so innocently. I chuckled wryly.</p>



<p>I wasn’t particularly flustered since I had a vague idea about this. The rumors about our fake relationship had reached even the first-year students ears, huh?</p>



<p>Nanase, who met my gaze, nodded silently. It seemed like she wanted me to let her handle the explanation herself.</p>



<p>I nodded back, and Nanase lowered her eyes, her expression tinged with sadness.</p>



<p>“I didn’t want Kureha to know about it… But, he dumped me so terribly.”</p>



<p>“Is that so!?”</p>



<p>“That’s not it, she’s not my ex-girlfriend,” I interjected immediately, causing Kureha to look at Nanase with a perplexed expression.</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry,” Nanase chuckled softly, placing her hand over her mouth. “I was being bothered by someone troublesome back then. Chitose helped me out by pretending to be my boyfriend and serving as my bodyguard.”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed slightly apologetic as she looked down. “I see, so even someone as beautiful as Yuzuki-san has had experiences like that. I’m sorry for bringing up unpleasant memories.”</p>



<p>Saying that, she bowed her head.</p>



<p>Nanase’s lips curled into a small smile. “It’s alright. If anything, it’s more of a fond memory for me.”</p>



<p>Kureha seemed relieved and changed the subject. “By the way, I went to watch Senpai’s match, Haru-san and Yuzuki-san’s!”</p>



<p>“””Really…!?”””</p>



<p>My voice, Haru’s and Nanase’s overlapped in surprise.</p>



<p>“Yes! I mentioned it to Senpai before, but I’m a fan of all of you!”</p>



<p>This time, I responded with genuine astonishment. “My match was at the prefectural stadium in July. What about Haru and Nanase’s matches?”</p>



<p>“It was when they had practice matches in our gymnasium in May and July.”</p>



<p>Both matches were ones I attended. There was a decent number of spectators, and for the former one, I spent a lot of  time to search for Nanase’s basketball shoes. Above all, I was so focused on the game that I didn’t recall seeing Kureha at all.</p>



<p>Well, to be fair, I wasn’t particularly good at remembering people’s faces, I chuckled wryly. After all, I didn’t even remember Atomu, who I competed against in the prefectural tournament in middle school.</p>



<p>Haru reminisced with a nostalgic tone. “It was during May when Nana was on fire.”</p>



<p>Kureha looked puzzled. “Nana…?”</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry, it’s the court name in basketball. I’m Umi, and Yuzuki is Nana. It’s a common practice in girls basketball to use code names so that the opponents don’t catch on to our tactics and instructions. But it became meaningless when everyone remembered them, so it’s more like a simple tradition.”</p>



<p>“But it’s so cool!”</p>



<p>“Well, calling each other by those names outside of matches usually leads to ninety percent of the time provoking a fight.”</p>



<p>“The relationship between Umi-san and Nana-san is really wonderful. It has that unique feel of a team sport.”</p>



<p>Haru casually replied. “Thanks! In that case, we’ll come watch your tournament next.”</p>



<p>“Really!? I admire both Haru-san and Yuzuki-san so much as fellow female athletes, so I’ll be super motivated!”</p>



<p>“Great! We’ll cheer for you with all our might.”</p>



<p>Kureha let out a gentle smile, her lips loosening with a sense of delight, before suddenly lowering her gaze.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry! I got carried away and ended up talking too much in front of all of you…”</p>



<p>As I glanced around, everyone was looking warmly at the kouhai girl.</p>



<p>To borrow Kureha’s words, it would be strange not to be excited during the first overnight training camp spent with admired senpais.</p>



<p>There was a time when I, too, was a kouhai like that.</p>



<p>The strict senpai who occasionally revealed innocent expressions during regular practices, the cool senpai who inexplicably became lively during matches, and the female manager senpais who usually went about her work calmly but turned out to be more talkative than I had imagined…</p>



<p>Kouhais and senpais, and the senpais above them.</p>



<p>They were like a gradient of different temperatures, drawing shades of sky blue, azure, and ultramarine. Certainly, the dynamics between kouhais and senpais in high school would be different from those between college students or working adults.</p>



<p>As I pondered these vague thoughts, contemplating how to offer some words of reassurance,</p>



<p>“Hey, Kureha?”</p>



<p>Yuuko, who had been quietly observing the situation, spoke up.</p>



<p>“Tell us what you want to ask, the things you want to say, more and more, okay?”</p>



<p>Praying, pledging, and embracing with kindness.</p>



<p>“So we can get to get to know you and for you to get to know us, even after the school festival is over.”</p>



<p>As if filling memories into a tin time capsule.</p>



<p>“Let’s become friends who can still gather together even after we graduate.”</p>



<p>Yuuko smiled earnestly.</p>



<p>Kureha closed her eyes, savoring those words, and her face bloomed with a sweet smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>13</strong></p>


<p>After finishing lunch, Nanase and I quickly took care of the dishes. We pushed the dining table and chairs to the side, and everyone gathered in a circle on the floor.</p>



<p>Finally, the official start of our training camp had arrived.</p>



<p>There were three main things we wanted to decide over these two days: the dance and song for our performance, as well as the costumes.</p>



<p>First, we would discuss the general direction together. Standing in the center of our circle, I raised a large plastic bag and spoke up.</p>



<p>“Since we talked about incorporating fight scenes, I went to the 100-yen store and picked out some props that might work.”</p>



<p>Flipping the bag over, a variety of toy swords, knives, bows, spears, scythes, axes, pistols, and shields spilled out. I prepared several sets of each, just in case. They might be a bit cheap-looking to use in the actual performance, but they would certainly help us visualize the choreography.</p>



<p>“””Wow!”””</p>



<p>The boys were the first to react.</p>



<p>I picked up a sword and spoke. “Heh, I’ve always been a fan of the protagonist wielding a sword.”</p>



<p>Kaito enthusiastically stood up. “For me, it’s an axe! Axe all the way!”</p>



<p>Kenta pushed up his glasses and smirked. “I’ll gladly take the scythe.”</p>



<p>Kazuki chimed in with a mischievous expression. “Give me a pair of pistols.”</p>



<p>After handing each person their desired weapon, I suggested, “To grasp the image better, shall we try some light choreography?”</p>



<p>The boys nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>Ignoring the girls who were watching us skeptically, we grabbed our shoes and headed outside from the living room. There was a spacious wooden deck outside, with beautiful green grass spread across the entire yard.</p>



<p>The girls reluctantly followed suit and joined us outside. The six of them settled down on the wooden deck, sitting in a row.</p>



<p>And just as I was retying the laces of my Stan Smith sneakers,</p>



<p>“──An opening!”</p>



<p>Kaito lunged at me from behind. I blocked his axe swing with the sheath of my sword and shouted.</p>



<p>“Hey, that goes against the way of the samurai!”</p>



<p>Kaito smirked, his smile filled with defiance. “Unfortunately, I’m a pirate, you see.”</p>



<p>“A pirate like you shouldn’t go talking all clever.”</p>



<p>I jumped back, adjusting my stance, and drew my sword. Throwing the sheath aside, I held the sword diagonally in front of my face.</p>



<p>“This ruffian shall be rusted by the blossoms of Chitose Saku, the Moon in the Dawn.”</p>



<p><em>Hahaha!</em> I heard Yua burst into laughter.</p>



<p>Kaito raised an exaggerated eyebrow and stuck out his tongue in a rough manner. He lifted the axe onto his shoulder with his right hand, while his left thumb pointed towards the ground.</p>



<p>“Hyaaa! I’ll settle my long-standing grudge right here!”</p>



<p>Beside him, Kenta, who had been quietly looking down, adjusted his scythe. With an eerie gleam in his glasses, he spoke softly.</p>



<p>“Can you hear it? The voice of the praying mantis that whispers ‘<em>sever their heads.’</em>“</p>



<p>Kazuki twirled the pistols in both hands before tucking them into his holsters. Dangling both hands lazily, he smirked cynically.</p>



<p>“Now, let’s begin the midday dance party. I’ll make sure you dance gracefully.”</p>



<p><em>Thud, thud</em>. Yua pounded her fist on the wooden deck.</p>



<p>Suddenly, my boy spirit surged with excitement, and I declared, “Are you prepared? Show gratitude to your family, sweet words to your lover. For instance, bid farewell to someone you love.”</p>



<p>Kaito adjusted his grip on the axe and replied. “Unfortunately, I don’t believe in thinking about what happens if I lose.”</p>



<p>Kenta flashed his scythe with a sharp sound. “I’m accustomed to loneliness.”</p>



<p>Kazuki said with a soft smile. “In my presence, anyone who utters such lines ends up with better ventilation on their forehead.”</p>



<p>In the corner of my vision, Yua coughed a bit and clung to Yuuko beside her.</p>



<p>I poured an overwhelming aura of hostility into my sword and proclaimed, “Now, let’s settle this once and for all.”</p>



<p>“””Ready!”””</p>



<p><em>Clang.</em></p>



<p>In that moment, with pride in our prey, as we took the decisive step that separated life and death…</p>



<p>“””Come on, boys!!!!”””</p>



<p>“””Sorry!!!!”””</p>



<p>By the way, we got scolded a lot after this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>14</strong></p>


<p>Regaining our focus, we exchanged the weapons in our hands and trying out various moves and gestures in a spontaneous manner.</p>



<p>When we began to grasp the general idea, Nanase spoke up. “It might be better to narrow down the types of weapons.”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement and replied. “Yeah. Having too many options might make it flashy, but it could lose its overall coherence.”</p>



<p>“And smaller weapons like knives or pistols might not be suitable. Long-range weapons like swords or spears would be more easily recognizable, even from a distance.”</p>



<p>Haru, who had joined the group of boys midway through, added, “Besides, if we turn it into a free-for-all fight, it won’t look like a dance anymore. Maybe it’s better to pair up, like one boy and one girl, and synchronize our movements.”</p>



<p>Hearing that, Kureha raised her hand and looked over at me, saying, “I want to be paired up with Senpai!”</p>



<p>“If the reason is that you’ll get too nervous to dance with Kazuki, I’ll firmly dismiss it.”</p>



<p>“Oh no, it’s not like that at all!”</p>



<p>“That was so stiff.”</p>



<p>Nanase chuckled, lightly touching her lips. “Isn’t it fine? While we can decide on other combinations later during the overall practice, if we’re doing a paired dance, we need two people to demonstrate. I was planning to do it myself, but why not give it a try, Kureha?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>I deliberately provoked her with a challenging tone. “Can you keep up with me as my partner?”</p>



<p>“I’ll do my best to keep up!”</p>



<p>“Alright then, I’ll bestow upon you the name ‘<em>Sakuzuki Chitose</em>.’”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s not necessary.”</p>



<p>I met Kureha’s slightly withdrawn gaze and chuckled softly. Well, since we have this opportunity to mix things up, it wouldn’t be bad to pair up with someone from a different grade.</p>



<p>“Everyone, how about taking a short break?”</p>



<p>Yua appeared at the entrance of the living room, her face peeking in. On the serving tray, there were cups of barley tea with floating ice cubes.</p>



<p>Yuuko followed suit and stepped out onto the wooden deck. “Nishino-senpai brought some ice cream for us to enjoy! Kaito, there’s even a jumbo chocolate monaka!”</p>



<p>“For real!?”</p>



<p>Asu-nee giggled, her shoulders shaking with amusement. “I bought a little extra, so feel free to help yourselves.”</p>



<p>And so, we each received our barley tea and ice cream. The girls settled on the wooden deck, while the guys sat directly on the grass.</p>



<p>I took sips of barley tea, feeling drowsy as I laid down. Above me, fluffy cumulus clouds floated in the sky, reminiscent of August. The well-maintained grass exuded a pleasant earthy fragrance.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, club training camps were like this too. There would always be massive buckets filled with ice-cold barley tea, and we’d scoop it up with cups and drink directly from them.</p>



<p>Lost in these nostalgic memories, I surrendered myself to the moment, until…</p>



<p>“Senpai!”</p>



<p>Kureha crouched down beside me, peering inquisitively. Looking up from this angle, I could see once again her well-defined features.</p>



<p>By the way, all the girls had changed into comfortable attire for easy movement. Kureha had followed suit, but…</p>



<p>“Hmm? Why are you averting your gaze?”</p>



<p>As a result, she had come out wearing a lavender sports bra that revealed her navel—or rather, her entire midriff—and super short shorts. It was impossible to miss the well-defined shape of her breasts, which seemed to be on par with Nanase’s, and her skin tone was so fair that it was utterly captivating.</p>



<p>Yua gently advised her to wear a thin hoodie, which she put on, but the zipper was fully open, so it didn’t really serve much purpose.</p>



<p>By the way, Kenta and Kaito seemed to find the sight a bit too stimulating and still couldn’t bring themselves to look directly at her, even after some time had passed.</p>



<p>I knew that some women would wear such outfits to the gym or while jogging, and it never particularly affected me. But seeing it on a girl I knew well made me realize that it was an entirely different story.</p>



<p>“Why are you… in that outfit?”</p>



<p>Kureha tilted her head in confusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/168075.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“Senpai, are you embarrassed?”</p>



<p>“More like perplexed, to be honest.”</p>



<p>If this were Nanase, well, I mean, I would definitely be thrown off, but I think I could accept it. It was precisely because Kureha usually came across as an innocent kouhai that the contradiction left me at a loss, and it filled me with an indescribable sense of guilt for sensing her femininity.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, she continued nonchalantly. “Since I’m in the track and field club, I don’t really mind.”</p>



<p>I finally started to understand, to some extent. “Oh, right. Female athletes dress like that during competitions.”</p>



<p>“Yes! In fact, I could make it even shorter if you want.”</p>



<p>I sat up abruptly. Indeed, if I thought of it as a track uniform, it became somewhat easier to accept, albeit not completely. Still, I tried not to let my eyes wander too much.</p>



<p>“So, what’s up?”</p>



<p>“Here, this is for you, Senpai.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>She pressed half of a popsicle against my cheek. Kureha grinned and spoke. “Let’s share it, half-and-half with your PAPICO.”</p>



<p>“Oh, sure.”</p>



<p>I split my PAPICO into two and handed her one half. Perhaps due to leaving it for a while, a droplet fell from it and landed on Kureha’s neckline. I quickly averted my gaze in a fluster.</p>



<p>“Senpai, thank you for earlier,” Kureha said in a sincere tone.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>Kureha wore a smile tinged with apology. “For the pair dance, I was being selfish.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. As Nanase mentioned, someone had to demonstrate during the group practice anyway.”</p>



<p>“Senpai, wouldn’t it be better for you to dance with Nanase-san or someone else?”</p>



<p>“You’re not still hung up on this ex-lover thing, are you?”</p>



<p>“Of course not! It’s pure curiosity!”</p>



<p>Suddenly, my honest feelings took shape in words and rolled off my tongue.</p>



<p>“Well, maybe it’s a relief that you volunteered, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Regardless of who I danced with, I would have ended up with some complex emotions. I knew the day where I had to decide would come eventually, but at least for the school festival, I wanted to enjoy it with innocent delight. In that sense, having a kouhai as a partner was quite comfortable.</p>



<p>I chuckled and added provocatively. “By the way, I’m a sore loser. If we’re going to do it, we’ll be the most outstanding pair during the actual performance.”</p>



<p>Kureha’s face lit up as she pulled her mouth from the PAPICO and happily replied. “Yes, I’ll help you with that!”</p>



<p>“Hold on, when did our roles switch?!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>15</strong></p>


<p>After our break, we returned to the living room and gathered around the low table to decide on the music first. We figured it would be quicker to come up with specific choreography once we had a song to work with, since we already had a general idea of the direction for the dance.</p>



<p>The performance time was set at seven minutes or less. While going over the time limit would result in point deductions, as long as we danced to a track that fit within that timeframe, we didn’t have to worry too much about it during the actual performance.</p>



<p>By the way, there were no restrictions on the number of songs we could use. So, basically, we would select several songs that matched our theme and merge them together through editing.</p>



<p>As I contemplated these matters, Asu-nee took the lead. “If we’re going with a pirate theme, it should be fairly easy to imagine the music, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>Seeing everyone nod in agreement, she continued. “For example, ‘He’s a Pirate’ or ‘We Are!’ are both classic choices.”</p>



<p>The former was a hit song from a famous pirate movie, while the latter was the theme song of a beloved pirate anime. Even though we weren’t part of the generation that experienced them in real time, we would recognize them immediately upon hearing them.</p>



<p>To be honest, the same songs were the first ones that came to my mind.</p>



<p>Haru asked with a slightly embarrassed expression. “Sorry, but what was the first one again?”</p>



<p>Although I had looked it up beforehand, not many people would remember it by its title alone.</p>



<p>I hummed the tune in place of Asu-nee. “De-de-den-den, de-de-den-den, de-de-den-den-den-den-den…”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Kenta, who had been observing the exchange, raised his voice happily. “If we’re talking about BUMP, a band that King often listens to, ‘Sailing Day’ was also the theme song for one of the anime movies!”</p>



<p>Asu-nee and I exchanged glances involuntarily.</p>



<p>“Oh, really?”</p>



<p>“Now that you mention it, the lyrics fit perfectly.”</p>



<p>Yuuko energetically raised her hand. “Here, here, how about ‘Yo Ho’?”</p>



<p>“”Ah!””</p>



<p>Asu-nee and my voices overlapped. Certainly, when it came to pirates, nothing else could fit as perfectly as that.</p>



<p>Next, Yua gently raised her hand. “Although it’s not exactly pirate-themed, how about ‘Imperial March’ right before the battle begins?”</p>



<p>It was a song from a universally popular sci-fi movie, known as the iconic theme of the antagonist. It might be perfect for creating a sense of tension.</p>



<p>“I see, that could work.”</p>



<p>As I said that, Haru interjected once again. “Sorry, but how does it go again?”</p>



<p>“It goes like, ‘Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.’”</p>



<p>“I completely understand now.”</p>



<p>“But isn’t it a bit too mainstream?” Yua asked, a hint of hesitation in her voice.</p>



<p>“No, not at all. ” I shook my head. “For events like this at school, I think it’s more exciting to choose songs that everyone knows rather than something too niche. It’s the same for the band’s stage performance at the cultural festival, right?”</p>



<p>“Indeed, we usually play the popular songs of the year.” </p>



<p>Nanase, who had been been scribbling something with a pen all this while, opened her mouth.</p>



<p>“I’ve come up with the general flow of the performance…” she said, pushing the snacks aside on the coffee table and spreading her notebook open in the center.</p>



<p>“Roughly speaking, it goes like this; ‘Setting Sail,’ ‘Voyage,’ ‘Encounter with the Enemy,’ ‘Battle,’ ‘Victory Dance,’ and ‘Feast.’ How does that sound?”</p>



<p>A moment of silence followed as we gauged each other’s reactions, and Kureha was the first to speak up.</p>



<p>“It’s perfect! Yuzuki-san, you’re amazing!”</p>



<p>Seeing Nanase’s flattered reaction by Kureha’s enthusiasm, Kazuki joined in.</p>



<p>“It allows for variations in pace and creates opportunities for highlights. Plus, the story is easy for the audience to follow. Isn’t it great?”</p>



<p>I joined in as well. “With ‘Setting Sail’ and ‘Voyage’ followed by ‘Encounter with the Enemy’ and ‘Battle,’ it essentially consists of four parts. It fits well within the time frame too.”</p>



<p>Kaito scratched his head, appearing somewhat uncertain.</p>



<p>“Can I say something? Even if we refer to them as enemies, we’re the only ones dancing, right? If it’s just a staged fight, we could all engage in swordplay or something similar, but how do we represent allies and enemies?”</p>



<p>Nanase responded with a troubled expression. “Yeah, that’s the tricky part. We can create movements that seem like we’re swinging our swords at imaginary enemies, but it would be more spectacular if we actually clash.”</p>



<p>Casually munching on a Pocky, Haru spoke up. “Why not simply divide roles into enemy and ally? It’s that simple.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, Yuuko tilted her head. “But if we do that, the side that loses won’t be able to do the ‘Victory Dance,’ right?”</p>



<p>“Oh, right.”</p>



<p>“May I suggest something?” Slightly raising her hand, Asu-nee spoke up. “What if we change the ‘Victory Dance’ to the ‘Reconciliation Dance’? Would that work?”</p>



<p>“””Ooh!”””</p>



<p>The chorus of voices resonated in agreement.</p>



<p>Nanase hummed, pondering the idea for a moment before opening her mouth. “That’s a great idea. We could divide ourselves into two pirate crews, led by Captain Chitose and me as the Vice-Captain. After a battle, we reconcile, and in the end, we all dance together.”</p>



<p>Yua interjected, as if struck by inspiration. “We could even express it through our costumes. After the reconciliation, we can all wear the same accessories.”</p>



<p>Nods of approval circled the group, and it was my turn to summarize the plan.</p>



<p>“Alright, so we’ll split into Chitose’s Pirate Crew and Nanase’s Pirate Crew for the ‘Setting Sail’ and ‘Voyage.’ It should be possible to convey this simply by having the two teams separate. Next, the two factions will face each other in the ‘Encounter with the Enemy.’ Finally, we’ll perform the ‘Reconciliation Dance’ and enter the ‘Feast’ together.”</p>



<p>“””Agreed!””” The voices chorused in unison.</p>



<p>Asu-nee casually tucked her hair behind her ear and continued. “With this, we can also determine the direction for the dance and the music, right? For ‘Setting Sail’ and ‘Voyage’, we want to capture the excitement of embarking on a new adventure.”</p>



<p>I responded, “Based on the songs we’ve considered so far, ‘We Are!,’ ‘Sailing Day,’ and ‘Yo Ho’ seem fitting.”</p>



<p>Nanase jotted down notes in her notebook as she continued. “The transition from the ‘Encounter with the Enemy’ should have an intense and weighty atmosphere, so ‘He’s a Pirate’ and ‘Imperial March’ could work here. If we include a paired dance, it can be integrated in this part and the following ‘Reconciliation Dance.’”</p>



<p>Asu-nee smiled faintly. “With this flow, it might feel like a serious battle, so we could also bring ‘We Are!’ or ‘Sailing Day’ into this section to give it a more manga-like vibe.”</p>



<p>“””Indeed.”””</p>



<p>As we continued overlapping our voices, a nagging question rose within me.</p>



<p>“But if we want to include paired dances in the battle part, practically speaking, we’d want the same pairs as in the ‘Reconciliation Dance,’ right?”</p>



<p>Furrowing her brow, Nanase contemplated the question for a moment before responding. “True, it would be more efficient for practice that way.”</p>



<p>“But would it look visually okay for boys and girls to engage in sword fighting together?”</p>



<p>“And even if it’s between girls, wouldn’t it be somewhat intimidating?”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s true…”</p>



<p>“But then again, if that’s the case, it’s a bit unnatural for the captains, meaning Chitose and I, not to fight. We also need distinct costumes that clearly differentiate us.”</p>



<p>“Um…” Interrupting our conversation was Kureha, who had been happily observing the flow of our discussion. “I have a compromise proposal. How about incorporating a tag team match concept?”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>



<p>“For example, Senpai and I could face off against Yuzuki-san and her partner. That way, the issue would be resolved, wouldn’t it?”</p>



<p>I exchanged glances with Nanase and spoke up. “Adding more people might make the dance a bit complex, though.”</p>



<p>“But if we can pull it off, it could be really cool.”</p>



<p>“Of course, the girls would also wield weapons, right?”</p>



<p>“Well, nowadays it’s not trendy for girls to just be protected.”</p>



<p>“You’re absolutely right.”</p>



<p>I turned to Kureha and said, “Well done, we’ll go with that!”</p>



<p>“Yes! Please reward me later!” Kureha replied with enthusiasm. “And for the ‘Reconciliation Dance,’ how about changing the tempo and choosing a relaxed, mature song?”</p>



<p>“Me, me, me!” This time, Yuuko raised her hand enthusiastically. “Can I suggest something for the ‘Feast’ part too?”</p>



<p>She glanced around at everyone’s faces, brimming with excitement, and started her proposal.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having listened to everything,</p>



<p>“How interesting,” I couldn’t help but mutter.</p>



<p>While we still needed to confirm if it would be approved as part of the cheering squad’s performance, personally, I thought it was a great idea. There might not even be any precedents for it.</p>



<p>Looking at Nanase, she blushed slightly and muttered, “Honestly… I kind of want to try it.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee seemed even more enthusiastic than I expected. “I’m gonna discuss it with others when we get back home.”</p>



<p>Yua might have heard about it in advance from Yuuko. She smiled gently, watching how things unfolded.</p>



<p>Kureha appeared full of motivation. “I definitely want to see that!”</p>



<p>Haru chuckled. “Well, things will work out somehow.”</p>



<p>Kazuki, Kaito, and even Kenta nodded with intrigued expressions.</p>



<p>I cleared my throat and thrust my fist forward. “Since we’re doing this, let’s make it a spectacular feast!”</p>



<p>“””Ooooooh!”””</p>



<p>We bumped our fists together, fueling each other’s excitement.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>16</strong></p>


<p>And then, we quickly discussed the direction for the costumes. Since there was a general understanding of the pirate theme, it didn’t take us long to decide. Above all, Yua took the lead when it came to making the costumes.</p>



<p>“Well then, I’ll compile the basic pattern and instructions. If there are any difficult parts, we can search the internet or consult the members of the handicraft club.”</p>



<p>Unlike the class play, where specific costume teams were assigned, in the cheering squad, everyone had to practice their performances, so there’s no dedicated costume team. After sharing the image and key points to remember, we were all responsible for making our own costumes.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it seemed that the boys who couldn’t sew well often relied on their parents or the girls for help.</p>



<p>As if Yua could read my mind, she looked over at me. “Oh, Saku-kun, about yours…”</p>



<p>Before she could finish her sentence, Kureha’s voice cut in. “If you’d like, shall I make your costume, senpai!?”</p>



<p>She must have remembered that I lived alone. Fixing a loose button was one thing, but when it came to making costumes, I honestly lacked confidence.</p>



<p>I had already planned to humbly ask Yua for help from the beginning, and I was sure she was about to offer her assistance.</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek and replied. “Kureha, can you sew?”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t say I’m extremely skilled, but if I have patterns and instructions, I can manage something like costumes for the sports festival. But…”</p>



<p>Kureha paused, her gaze shifting towards Yua. She must have realized that she had interrupted the conversation.</p>



<p>Looking apologetic, she continued, fidgeting slightly. “If Yua-san is willing to do it, I believe she’ll do a much better job…”</p>



<p>Yua smiled gently, a flicker of understanding in her eyes. “That was my intention, but maybe I should ask you instead, Kureha-chan? I’ll probably end up making Yuuko-chan’s costume as well.”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s cheeks softened without any trace of embarrassment at Yua’s words. “Hehe, I’m counting on you, Uchi.”</p>



<p>Yua looked at Kureha and added, “Kureha-chan, if you ever need help or have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime.”</p>



<p>With that, I raised one hand. “Though it’s a bit embarrassing as a senpai, can I rely on you, Kureha?”</p>



<p>Kureha leaned closer to me and replied. “Yes, gladly!”</p>



<p><em>Clap</em>, our hands met.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>17</strong></p>


<p>Now, we were finally delving into the intricate choreography of our dance.</p>



<p>First, we tentatively chose songs and purchased them online. Kenta brought his laptop, and with it, he roughly extracted and pieced together the necessary parts for us.</p>



<p>The timing seemed to fit just right.</p>



<p>While Kenta was editing, Kazuki, Kaito, and I went to a home center called “Waihome,” located right next to Wai Plaza. We procured wooden sticks of suitable length, serving as makeshift swords for each of us. We opted for these instead of cheap toy swords from the 100-yen store, which would easily break during our intense sword fights.</p>



<p>Returning to Yuuko’s house, we headed outside once again. For now, it was me, Kazuki, Kaito, Nanase, Haru, and Kureha—the sports-oriented group—gathering in the yard, each holding a wooden stick.</p>



<p>The others sat on the wooden deck, tasked with finding useful references from movies or YouTube videos.</p>



<p>By the way, the first performance we watched was by the cheering squad “JETS” from Hokuriku Commercial High School. They served as the inspiration for the movie and drama adaptation <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>“Cheer☆Dance.” Not only were they the best in Japan, but they also achieved an incredible feat by winning the US National Cheerleading Championship five times in a row. I believe it’s hard to find anyone in Fukui who wasn’t familiar with them.</p>



<p>Rumor had it that their advisor was an alumnus of Fuji High School and had experience as a cheerleader during school festivals. Those fond memories seemed to have played a role in the creation of JETS, evoking a strange sense of familiarity.</p>



<p>To be honest, their level was far too high for us to imitate, but we grasped the image of coordinated movements by a large group quite well.</p>



<p>And so, with music playing in the background, we started brainstorming ideas together.</p>



<p>Except for Kenta’s perfect imitation and <em>otagei</em> dance, none of us had any significant experience. Thus, we were prepared for a considerable struggle. There was a real possibility that we wouldn’t be able to finalize everything within these two days.</p>



<p>However, once we actually started, I was surprised at how smoothly things progressed. If I might say so myself, the sports-oriented group made a significant contribution.</p>



<p>Without referencing anything in particular, we casually threw out suggestions.</p>



<p>“Don’t you think this sword swing looks cool?”</p>



<p>“Then, how about dodging it like this?”</p>



<p>“Shouldn’t the footwork be more elegant like this?”</p>



<p>“What if we crouch, spin, and strike with our feet?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say such dangerous things casually. In that case, I’ll jump and avoid it.”</p>



<p>“Jumping straight up is fine, but wouldn’t it be more impressive if we jumped over the opponent as well!”</p>



<p>Ideas kept flowing one after another, like an unstoppable stream.</p>



<p>As we began seriously contemplating them, I realized just how incredibly enjoyable this was. It felt like we were engaged in a discussion that every boy has fantasized about at some point during their childhood.</p>



<p>The support from the wooden deck team was also reassuring. Asu-nee primarily provided movie references, Yuuko shared idol and dance vocal group videos, Yua found clips of fellow high schoolers, and Kenta contributed moves and choreography from anime.</p>



<p>We would then replicate and combine them…</p>



<p>Before we knew it, by the time the sun began to set, we had almost finalized all the parts except for the “Reconciliation Dance” and the “Feast.”</p>



<p>Wiping the sweat off with a sports towel, I opened my mouth. “We’ll manage somehow.”</p>



<p>Kaito followed suit. “But seriously, doesn’t this look pretty cool?”</p>



<p>While sipping the barley tea that Yua had prepared, Kazuki remarked, “It’s a bit challenging, though.”</p>



<p>Quickly, Kenta interjected. “A bit challenging?!”</p>



<p>Yua tilted her head, wearing a perplexed expression, “…It might be quite difficult to memorize.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee was stumbling over her words. “Right, left, right, right, down…?”</p>



<p>Yuuko held both arms in front of her chest. “I don’t really get it, but it was amazing!”</p>



<p>Haru chuckled while scratching her temple. “Are we perhaps being too greedy?”</p>



<p>Nanase also wore a somewhat apologetic expression. “Things got out of control somewhere along the way.”</p>



<p>Indeed, there was no denying that it had turned into a dance with a strong sports team vibe due to the energetic tuning from the hardcore sports-oriented group. If Kenta, Yua, Asu-nee, and Yuuko couldn’t keep up, similar sentiments might arise from other cheer squad members during full rehearsals.</p>



<p>I glanced at everyone and spoke up. “If it seems too challenging to continue like this, should we make it a bit easier?”</p>



<p>Just as I voiced those words────</p>



<p>“Let’s do it!”</p>



<p>“””We’re in!”””</p>



<p>Yuuko, Yua, Asu-nee, and Kenta’s voices resounded.</p>



<p>Kureha encouraged them from behind. “I’ll support you with all my might!”</p>



<p>We all exchanged glances and burst into smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>18</strong></p>


<p>“Come on, Chitose, be more elegant.”</p>



<p>“Mister, your hold on the waist is too weak.”</p>



<p>“Saku, make sure to gaze at Kureha!”</p>



<p>“If you get embarrassed, it’ll ruin everything.”</p>



<p>“Saku-kun, don’t embarrass Kureha-chan.”</p>



<p>“You guys are just enjoying yourselves, aren’t you!!!!!!”</p>



<p>And so, we were brainstorming the choreography for the “Reconciliation Dance.”</p>



<p>As for the “Feast” that Yuuko proposed, it wasn’t something we could finalize within today or tomorrow. But once this part was settled, we could say we accomplished the main objective of our training camp.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I couldn’t help but think…</p>



<p>It made sense for Kureha and me to be the models for the partner dance part, but the spectators had been quite noisy since earlier.</p>



<p>Particularly the girls, taking advantage of Kureha’s good-naturedness, kept making unreasonable demands one after another.</p>



<p>That’s when Nanase spoke up. “Okay, right there, do the princess carry.”</p>



<p>Before I could even complain, Kureha gently placed her hands around my neck.</p>



<p>“Senpai, please catch me, okay?”</p>



<p>She leaped without a shred of doubt, and I had no choice but to catch her. Her soft thigh nestled against my left arm.</p>



<p>Kureha held on tightly, and her already emphasized chest due to the sports bra pressed against me. Despite trying not to be conscious of her being my kouhai, being in such close proximity inevitably made me realize she was a woman.</p>



<p>Kureha looked up at me with slightly moistened eyes. “Senpai, am I too heavy?”</p>



<p>I tried to maintain a calm demeanor, disregarding the warm breath on my neck, and replied with a casual remark.</p>



<p>“Even if there were five more Kurehas, it wouldn’t be a problem.”</p>



<p>Kureha narrowed her eyes playfully. “Hehe, then pour all of those five into me.”</p>



<p>Saying that, she released the hand that was around my neck, and her head drooped as if she was trying to rest it on my right arm like a pillow.</p>



<p>Her glistening neck and the exposed area of her chest, damp with sweat, became even more apparent, causing me to inadvertently avert my gaze.</p>



<p>“Hey, this isn’t some cozy hammock, you know.”</p>



<p>“Hehehe, your arm makes a nice pillow, senpai.”</p>



<p>“It just makes me look like a murderer carrying a dead body.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed that Nanase, Haru, Yua, and Asu-nee were all giving me dry glares.</p>



<p>“No more princess carries, then.”</p>



<p>“…The humiliation from that other time came rushing back.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, this is pretty embarrassing for us too.”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“Then why did you make us do it?!”</p>



<p>As I retorted, I gently lowered Kureha down. The lingering warmth from her flushed body remained on my arm.</p>



<p>“Joking aside.” Nanase spoke up. “Can you see the choreo clearly now?”</p>



<p>Kureha’s voice brimmed with joy. “Yes!”</p>



<p>Nanase seemed slightly apologetic as she continued. “Both of you must be getting tired, but could you dance through it once?”</p>



<p>I lightly nodded in response. “Sure.”</p>



<p>Kureha, who still seemed full of energy, followed up. “Alright! Leave it to us!”</p>



<p>In reality, I truly believed she was an exceptionally talented kouhai. Not only did she excel in club activities, displaying impressive results, but she also possessed exceptional athleticism and a remarkable ability to learn quickly.</p>



<p>Moreover, her nature was incredibly open-minded. She willingly followed along with the senpais’ various choreography attempts without a hint of reluctance. On top of that, she was incredibly friendly and had quickly melded with everyone, despite having only known each other for about a week.</p>



<p>Nanase operated the computer, and a mellow dance number began playing.</p>



<p>“Senpai, please take care of me.”</p>



<p>Taking her outstretched hand, we simultaneously started stepping to the beat.</p>



<p>Our movements were even smoother than that night when I danced with Nanase, intertwining like shadows in the moonlight.</p>



<p>Eventually, we both opened our arms wide, and then Kureha spun and nestled into my chest. Her delicate back felt scorching hot, and an intoxicating fragrance wafted from her nape.</p>



<p>Turning together in a fluid motion, Kureha entrusted her body to me.</p>



<p>As I gently placed my hands on her waist to support her, deep down in my heart────</p>



<p>I had been searching for the reason behind the persistent sadness that haunted me.</p>



<p>“Senpai, please look at me properly.”</p>



<p>Feeling the soft swell of her chest pressed against me, a sudden, overwhelmingly small and pitiful answer rolled down.</p>



<p>Ah, I see. Even though I was dancing with a younger girl, all this time, I had been chasing after someone’s shadow. Even that might be nothing more than a refined excuse to hide my ugly emotions.</p>



<p>If the person before me were someone else among <em>them</em>…</p>



<p>If it were another man dancing with one of them…</p>



<p>Holding hands, leaning close, gazing into each other’s eyes, exchanging warmth────</p>



<p>Just thinking about it made me despise myself.</p>



<p>Even now, someone’s face remained blurry in my vision.</p>



<p>That’s why, looking into my kouhai’s eyes, I smiled as a senpai should.</p>



<p>During those moments, it felt as if I could delay something, much like the colorless September itself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>19</strong></p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(Nanase)</strong></p>



<p>I wish I hadn’t yielded.</p>



<p>I detest that part of me that thinks that way from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(Haru)</strong></p>



<p>We were supposed to be partners.</p>



<p>So why am I not the one standing beside him?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(Asuka)</strong></p>



<p>I should have spoken up like that girl.</p>



<p>But I couldn’t bring myself to speak up like she did.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(Yua)</strong></p>



<p>I truly wanted to make the costume for you.</p>



<p>In your room, sitting on my chair.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>20</strong></p>


<p>As the pair dance took shape, the surroundings were bathed in the hues of twilight.</p>



<p>After making various adjustments to the choreography, both Kureha and I ended up lying side by side on the grass, exhausted.</p>



<p>Before we knew it, the sky was adorned with scales of clouds resembling mandarin-flavored cotton candy. As I absentmindedly stared with my mouth slightly agape, my stomach let out an unexpected growl.</p>



<p>Kureha burst out laughing beside me.</p>



<p>Suddenly, everything seemed comical, and without uttering a word, we found ourselves shaking with laughter.</p>



<p>After a while, a voice reached us. “You’ve worked hard, Saku. You too, Kureha.” And there, by my cheek, a bottle of Pocari was placed gently.</p>



<p>Yuuko, crouching above us, looked down with a bright smile on her face. Her hair, shorter than I had imagined, fluttered in the evening breeze, and I couldn’t help but be momentarily captivated by the sight, still unfamiliar to me.</p>



<p>Kureha, who had risen to her feet before me, spoke. “Yuuko-san, thank you for your hard work too!”</p>



<p>Yuuko let out a soft chuckle and replied. “Your pair dance with Saku was amazing, so perfectly in sync.”</p>



<p>“Really!? I’m so happy to hear that from you, Yuuko-san!”</p>



<p>I also sat up and took a sip from the Pocari.</p>



<p>Yuuko rested her cheek on her hand and continued. “Hehe, I got a little jealous.”</p>



<p>Kureha playfully responded. “Even if Yuuko-san asked, I won’t switch with you after practicing this much!”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s tone remained natural. “Okay, take care of Saku for me. He’s the type to push himself too hard, so keep an eye on him.”</p>



<p>Kureha blinked in surprise, then her expression softened. “Understood! If he seems burdened with something, I’ll snatch him away, even if I have to do it forcefully!”</p>



<p>I chuckled wryly and scratched my cheek. “Please spare me, especially in front of a kouhai.”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s eyelids drooped slightly in response. “It’s precisely because you’re in front of a kouhai that I’m even more worried.”</p>



<p>“Well, I surrender…”</p>



<p>Kureha observed our exchange with an intrigued expression.</p>



<p>As we were chatting, Nanase approached and looked at me.</p>



<p>“Shall we take an early dinner break?”</p>



<p>“Let’s do that. I’m so hungry I could eat a horse.”</p>



<p>Yua, who had been listening to our conversation from behind, opened her mouth with a hint of apology.</p>



<p>“Since we have this many people, would curry be okay?”</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s a classic for training camps, and I was actually hoping for it.”</p>



<p>“By the way, I have a little favor to ask…”</p>



<p>Yua approached me with small steps and whispered softly in my ear.</p>



<p>“You see…”</p>



<p>Her whisper reached my ears, causing my shoulder to twitch involuntarily.</p>



<p>“We’re running short on ingredients. Ideally, I should go buy them myself, but it seems we won’t have enough rice with just the rice cooker, so I thought of cooking it in a clay pot. I have to keep an eye on that, so…”</p>



<p>Ah, is that all? I was taken aback.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. I’ll quickly go to Lpa and come back. Can you give me a list of what you need?”</p>



<p>“Sure, sorry about this. I didn’t want to trouble anyone since everyone must be tired.”</p>



<p>She must have known that Kureha and I were the ones most likely to take action without much thought.</p>



<p><em>“─From now on, can I be a bit more selfish?”</em></p>



<p>I recalled the words she finally spoke during that twilight.</p>



<p>In the first place, it was strange for her to try to take care of everything from grocery shopping to cooking on her own, but even so…</p>



<p>If this was Yua’s modest way of being selfish and she believed she could rely on me…</p>



<p>The change that occurred after that summer slowly warmed my heart.</p>



<p>Perhaps Kureha overheard our conversation, she tilted her head in surprise. “Senpai, are you going to Lpa?”</p>



<p>I smiled and answered her question. “Yeah, Yua seems to be making a delicious curry. I’ll just be getting the ingredients.”</p>



<p>Kureha raised her fists in front of her chest. “Then I’ll accompany you!”</p>



<p>“It’s not a big enough task to require help. We’ll probably be practicing late into the night, so take a little rest now.”</p>



<p>“That’s exactly why I want to go with you, Senpai!”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“If I’m left behind by everyone I admire, I won’t be able to relax. So, I’d rather help you, senpai.”</p>



<p>“You really have some guts, huh?”</p>



<p>Yuuko and Nanase, who had been observing our exchange, smiled knowingly.</p>



<p>Yua tilted her head and said with a chuckle. “Well then, Kureha-chan, I’ll be counting on you too.”</p>



<p>“Yes! With pleasure!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>21</strong></p>


<p>After finishing our grocery shopping on the first floor of Lpa, we ended up with a decent amount, all things considered. We even added tea, water, and sports drinks, so all in all, it was a good decision for the two of us to come together.</p>



<p>Carrying plastic bags in both hands, I spoke up. “Thanks for coming with me, Kureha.”</p>



<p>Kureha, holding a bag in one hand, responded. “Not at all! I had fun imagining what it’s like when you and Yua-san go shopping like this all the time.”</p>



<p>“If Yua were here, we would have ended up with just two bags. I got carried away and bought unnecessary things.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I can see that.”</p>



<p>Engaging in such an ordinary conversation, we were enveloped in the lively atmosphere of Lpa on a weekend, stretching out endlessly. There were parents holding hands with their little children, groups of high school students, fashionable couples, and smiling grandparents passing by nonstop.</p>



<p>The sweet custard from Beard Papa’s mixed with the savory sauce from Gin Dako, blending with the aroma of the glossy floors in McDonald’s and Mister Donut. The air was filled with a distinctive Lpa scent that couldn’t be described in any other way.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a cute sound caught my attention, and I glanced at Kureha. While pressing her belly with her free hand, she shyly opened her mouth.</p>



<p>“Um… Senpai, would you like to have something to eat?”</p>



<p>This time, it was my turn to burst into laughter. “Then this will be our little secret. Yua would scold us for eating before a dinner.”</p>



<p>“Yes, it’ll be just between the two of us!”</p>



<p>“What do you want to eat?”</p>



<p>“Taiyaki!”</p>



<p>“That’s an interesting choice. How about Sakura Tea House, then?</p>



<p>“Yes, please! I used to visit there with my grandma as a child to buy taiyaki as a souvenir.”</p>



<p>Sakura Tea House was a shop that sold Japanese-style fast food, such as okonomiyaki, taiyaki, and dango. Among them, takoyaki seems to divide people’s preferences between those who like the crispy outside of takoyaki from Gin Dako and those who prefer the fluffy and creamy takoyaki from Sakura Tea House.</p>



<p>I chose taiyaki with cream filling, while Kureha opted for the red bean paste. We left Lpa and headed out.</p>



<p>By the way, when I tried to pay for both, she strongly insisted on paying her share and, in the end, even stuffed some small change into my pocket.</p>



<p>With the plastic bags hanging from the handlebars of my mountain bike, we walked along the serene country road. As I took a bite of the taiyaki, the cream filling gave me a comforting taste.</p>



<p>The sky, on the verge of twilight, was gently tinged with purple, translucent like an amethyst. The fully ripened rice stalks gracefully bowed their heads, bidding the evening greetings.</p>



<p>A light truck, its cargo bed loaded with yellow plastic containers, happily traced its way homeward, making a cheerful clatter.</p>



<p>It was a Saturday night, calm yet somehow jubilant.</p>



<p>“Senpai, ahh~”</p>



<p>Kureha, pushing her red Trek cross bicycle next to me, skillfully offered me a taiyaki.</p>



<p>It felt a little awkward being fed by a kouhai, but considering that both my hands were occupied, I took a bite.</p>



<p>The nostalgic sweetness of the azuki beans gently spread in my mouth.</p>



<p>I wondered when was the last time I had this. Since I didn’t usually eat overly sweet things, I rarely had azuki beans when living alone.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, when I was little, I often had five-piece packs of anpan as a snack. In summer, the fridge always had azuki ice cream bars, which Dad liked, and Mom used the leftover mochi to make sweet red bean soup on New Year’s. When we visited Grandma’s house, we would often buy karinto manju from the Gomimen-ya near Lpa as a little gift.</p>



<p>Though it should have blended into my daily life, there were tastes that I gradually forgot if I didn’t consciously remember them, and for some reason, it brought a slightly melancholic feeling.</p>



<p>“Are you the type who eats the tail first, Kureha?”</p>



<p>When I asked, Kureha playfully narrowed her eyes mischievously.</p>



<p>“Well, if I eat the tail first, you won’t be able to escape from me, right?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say scary things over a taiyaki.”</p>



<p>I passed her my cream-filled one instead.</p>



<p>Kureha compared the taiyaki and my face, then she asked. “Please say ‘ahh’ properly.”</p>



<p>“Alright, alright, ahh.”</p>



<p>Finally satisfied, she took a big bite, and I couldn’t help but chuckle before speaking. “I’m sorry about earlier.”</p>



<p>She must have immediately understood what I was referring to. Kureha answered with a slight, bashful gaze.</p>



<p>“I had so much fun dancing with you, Senpai, but at some point, it felt like your mind was somewhere else and I felt lonely.”</p>



<p>A sense of guilt welled up in me at her unusually somber tone.</p>



<p>“Would you like another bite of taiyaki?”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Kureha’s eyes pleaded with me, silently conveying something.</p>



<p>“Alright, ahh.”</p>



<p>“Here you go.”</p>



<p>As I watched her happily devoured the taiyaki, a sense of relief washed over me.</p>



<p>“I was lost in thought, or rather, I was contemplating something.”</p>



<p>“What about?”</p>



<p>Savoring the last bite of taiyaki, I crumpled the wrapping paper in my hand.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s my own weakness, I suppose.”</strong></p>



<p>I knew I shouldn’t be talking about something like this with a younger girl like Kureha. But for some reason, in front of her, I let my guard down ever so slightly. Perhaps it was because she was a familiar presence, who seemed to be apart from the problems that lingered in my heart.</p>



<p>This time, she seemed puzzled by my words. After tilting her head in confusion, Kureha suddenly stopped and lowered the kickstand of her crossbike. Softly, as if catching me in a princess carry, she gently spoke up.</p>



<p>“──Senpai, you’re allowed to run away, you know?”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>I unintentionally let out a foolish voice, as if my inner thoughts had accidentally slipped out.</p>



<p>Kureha continued like it was nothing.</p>



<p>“Well, Yuuko-san also asked me to do this. If you’re burdened with something, if you’re troubled and alone, I’m here to listen!”</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat relieved and convinced, I lowered the kickstand of my mountain bike.</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>



<p>“Though I don’t think I can be of much help.”</p>



<p>“Just having that sentiment makes me happy. Thank you.”</p>



<p>Kureha lowered her gaze and bashfully scratched her cheek. “I’ve said it before, but I want to be a part of your group, Senpai.”</p>



<p>“I’ve said it before too, but everyone already considers you part of the group.”</p>



<p>“Really? In that case…” As she spoke, she giggled and extended her pinky finger. “It’s a promise, okay? Don’t exclude me from the group.”</p>



<p>“I promise. I won’t leave you out of the group.”</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I answered and gently entwined my pinky finger with hers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>22</strong></p>


<p>Upon returning to Yuuko’s house, a delightful aroma of sautéed onions wafted through the living room.</p>



<p>In the kitchen, Yua and Nanase were standing side by side. As Nanase had mentioned earlier, she must be helping out as much as she could. Yua seemed to be in charge of curry and rice, while Nanase took care of the salad.</p>



<p>Kureha and I approached them, carrying plastic bags. Yua looked up, her eyes meeting ours.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Kureha-chan, Saku-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, no problem.”</p>



<p>“We’re at your service!”</p>



<p>Carrots, potatoes, extra onions, and pork were in the mix. Today’s meal seemed to be a simple homemade curry.</p>



<p>By the way, I believe the reason pork was chosen was that it’s economical for this number of people, and it was my personal favorite that I often got to enjoy thanks to her generosity. When eating out, I tended to choose beef, but for some reason, pork felt more comforting at home.</p>



<p>I handed half a head of cabbage to Nanase and said, “Just so you know, I’m quite particular about shredded cabbage.”</p>



<p>The two in the kitchen exchanged glances and burst into laughter.</p>



<p>While sautéing the onions, Yua’s lips curled into a smile. “See? I knew Saku-kun would say that.”</p>



<p>Nanase shrugged, appearing exasperated. “You didn’t complain about it the other day.”</p>



<p>She must be referring to the time when she made katsudon for me.</p>



<p>“Well, even I know how to pick my battles depending on the situation.”</p>



<p>“And what about the shredding that time?”</p>



<p>“It was finer than I expected, but it still falls a step short from reaching Saku-kun’s standards.”</p>



<p>“Geez, you’re such a nitpicker.”</p>



<p>Yua opened her mouth, seemingly amused. “Just take your time, and you’ll be fine.”</p>



<p>Nanase nodded and began peeling off the cabbage leaves.</p>



<p>“I’ll try to be more careful. I don’t want someone saying, ‘<em>It’s still too thick,’</em>“</p>



<p>“Indeed, let’s strive for improvement.”</p>



<p>“Just go over there, Chitose.”</p>



<p>“Alrighty then!”</p>



<p>Taking in the scene in the living room as I was told, it seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves in their own way.</p>



<p>Yuuko sat alongside Kaito at the dining table, engrossed in something on their tablet. Kureha hurriedly approached them, curiosity brimming in her voice.</p>



<p>“Yuuko-san, Kaito-san, what are you watching at?”</p>



<p>Despite all the fuss about being nervous and such, she seemed perfectly fine even if left alone.</p>



<p>Kenta had already found a free spot and was eagerly learning dance moves from Kazuki. Asu-nee and Haru sat together on the sofa, engaged in conversation.</p>



<p>Quite an unusual pairing, I thought, and made my way toward them.</p>



<p>I approached the two, their backs bouncing with enthusiasm, and called out to them. “Mind if I join?”</p>



<p>Asu-nee turned around and upon seeing my face, she couldn’t contain her laughter.</p>



<p>“Huh? What is it?”</p>



<p>When I asked, her shoulder slightly shook as she covered her mouth with her hand. “Well, sorry about that. Welcome back.”</p>



<p>Haru smirked provocatively. “We were just having a lively discussion about you. Care to join?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not ideal, but…” Taking a seat beside them, I continued. “You didn’t go and fill Asu-nee’s head with unnecessary things, did you?”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? I merely shared what I already knew about you.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. That’s a relief.”</p>



<p>“Where does that confidence of yours come from, anyway…”</p>



<p>Asu-nee finally seemed to have calmed down and spoke up. “I was just asking what you’re like at school.”</p>



<p>Haru added with a smirk. “And also, what you’re like when you’re with Nishino-senpai.”</p>



<p>“…I guess I’ll go join Kenta and Kazuki.”</p>



<p>A gentle smile graced Asu-nee’s lips.</p>



<p>“By the way, it’s amazing how seriously you’re aiming for the national tournament. Until I started thinking about my future, I just went through high school without finding something like that. You, Aomi-san, who’s fully embracing your life as a high school student, shine brightly in my eyes.”</p>



<p>Haru waved her hand hurriedly. “No, no, from my perspective, I genuinely admire Nishino-senpai’s decision to chase your dreams and go to Tokyo.”</p>



<p>She paused for a moment, glanced at me for some reason, then quickly averted her gaze and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“There are various things that you have to leave behind, right? Like the familiar hometown, family, um, friends… Aren’t you afraid of losing those things?”</p>



<p>“I’m terrified, absolutely,” Asu-nee responded without hesitation. “Sometimes, I waver between feeling that this is the right path for me and wondering if there could have been another way.”</p>



<p>Those words were somewhat unexpected. In my eyes, it only appeared that she was unwaveringly pursuing her dream.</p>



<p>Asu-nee wore a gentle smile and asked, “What about you, Aomi-san? What will you do after graduating from high school?”</p>



<p>In response to that question, Haru lowered her gaze and tightly clenched her fist.</p>



<p>“I’m also uncertain.”</p>



<p>“I see,” Asu-nee said. “During the career counseling sessions, you were saying about going to university as long as you could still play basketball. Have you found a new dream?”</p>



<p>Haru nodded hesitantly. “Yes. But no matter how much I try to hold onto everything, there will always be something I have to give up, like distance or time… something that I must let go.”</p>



<p>I didn’t recognize the expression on her face.</p>



<p>There was a time when we were close like halves of a whole────</p>



<p>But now, unbeknownst to me, Haru was transforming into a person I didn’t recognize, along with Asu-nee.</p>



<p><em>“Don’t leave me out, okay?”</em></p>



<p>Those were Kureha’s words at the edge of twilight. I could understand that sentiment, at least a little now.</p>



<p>Asu-nee gently spun her words, as if offering a handkerchief.</p>



<p>“It’s unbearable, isn’t it? These kinds of situations.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s unbearable.”</p>



<p>Haru’s tone of voice seemed somehow more mature than usual.</p>



<p>For some reason, I found myself watching them, feeling left behind.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>23</strong></p>


<p>Yua’s curry and Nanase’s salad were ready, and we gathered around the low table once again.</p>



<p>“””Thanks for the food!”””</p>



<p>We each put our hands together and immediately picked up our spoons and chopsticks.</p>



<p>Nanase had prepared a simple green salad with shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes, and thinly sliced cucumbers arranged on a bed of lettuce. In the end, this kind of salad was the perfect match for curry.</p>



<p>I lightly squeezed the slender nozzle of mayonnaise and, since we didn’t have green perilla, I drizzled black vinegar and onion dressing instead.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed Nanase staring intently, waiting for my reaction, and I chuckled.</p>



<p>I took a bite of the shredded cabbage and grinned. “Mmm, a master’s level.”</p>



<p>In response to my words, Nanase made a small triumphant gesture. “Yeah!”</p>



<p>Next, I scooped up a spoonful of curry and savored it. The rich flavor spread throughout my mouth, as if it had been simmered overnight. It was Yua’s comforting homemade curry that I was familiar with.</p>



<p>Even though there were ten of us, she had thoughtfully placed a sunny-side-up on each plate. Beside my plate, there was, of course, a shichimi pepper blend as well.</p>



<p>Nanase exclaimed in surprise. “Wait, didn’t you just use a regular roux? How did it turn into such a complex flavor!?”</p>



<p>Yua answered naturally, without any false modesty. “I add various secret ingredients from what I have, but I think the most significant difference comes from the oyster sauce. Just a little bit can completely transform the taste.”</p>



<p>Nanase nodded in understanding. “I see, I never even thought about using oyster sauce since I’ve never used it before.”</p>



<p>Kureha, apparently not satisfied with just one taiyaki, continued to munch on the curry happily.</p>



<p>“Eating curry like this together feels like a training camp! It’s wonderful!”</p>



<p>Yua smiled gently and spoke. “There’s more if you want seconds, so eat plenty.”</p>



<p>Kaito, who had already finished about half of his curry, chimed in. “But seriously, haven’t we achieved enough during this camp? Although there’s still the ‘Feast’ part left, most of the important decisions have been made.”</p>



<p>Kazuki followed up on Kaito’s words. “With this, we might be able to gather the other members and start full team practice from next week.”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement. “Yeah, thanks to Yuuko’s suggestion.”</p>



<p>Yuuko tilted her head and responded with a smile. “Oh no, it’s all thanks to everyone. It turned into such a lively weekend.”</p>



<p>However, Kenta looked at me with a hint of uncertainty. “But before that, we have to master the dance, right…?”</p>



<p>“Well, if worst comes to worst, only those who already learned the dance might end up demonstrating it.”</p>



<p>“I refuse!”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was Asu-nee who raised her voice. While striking a cute fighting pose, she continued;</p>



<p>“I’m not that good at sports either, but let’s do our best together, Yamazaki-kun.”</p>



<p>Encouraged by her words, Kenta mimicked her and struck a fighting pose as well.</p>



<p>“Yes! Since we’ve come this far, we all want to dance together!”</p>



<p>Seems like Haru and Asu-nee had warmed up to each other a bit during the previous time, as the former grinned mischievously and provocatively added, “Nishino-senpai, Yamazaki, I’ll push you both until you’re perfect.”</p>



<p>“P-Please go easy on us…”</p>



<p>The feeble voices of Asu-nee and Kenta overlapped in an amusing way, and we all burst into laughter.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>24</strong></p>


<p>After finishing dinner, we moved to the familiar park where Yuuko and I always take a detour. As much as the garden was spacious, swinging sticks around with everyone would be quite risky.</p>



<p>At this hour, there wasn’t a single soul in sight, making it perfect for practicing with a large group.</p>



<p>We briefly reviewed the full choreography once, and then we started improving the precision of each individual part, starting from the “Departure and Voyage” section.</p>



<p>About thirty minutes into the practice, Nanase’s voice echoed from the top of the short staircase where Yuuko and I usually sat.</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Nishino-senpai, you’re falling behind.”</p>



<p>“Sorry!”</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Uchi, put more power into it.”</p>



<p>“Got it!”</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Yamazaki, stop looking around.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes, ma’am!”</p>



<p>We were currently practicing the sword dance part. We lined up in a row, marching while swinging our swords with synchronized movements.</p>



<p>By the way, Nanase oversaw the entire group from above, while I went around offering advice to each individual.</p>



<p>Overall, I think we’re making decent progress, but…</p>



<p>“Alright, everyone, stop! Take a break, hydrate, and relax a bit.”</p>



<p><em>Phew</em>, everyone let out a collective sigh of relief.</p>



<p>Nanase beckoned me over and said. “Hey, Chitose, can I talk to you?”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” I replied, having a rough idea of what she wanted.</p>



<p>I climbed up the stairs, and Nanase, in a mode that seemed more like a vice captain than a vice-squad leader, opened her mouth;</p>



<p>“Should we split into two teams?”</p>



<p>“That sounds like a good idea.”</p>



<p>“How about I and Mizushino take care of Kaito, Yuuko, and Yamazaki, and you and Kureha handle Haru, Uchi, and Nishino-senpai?”</p>



<p>“…I see, I think that’s a good arrangement.”</p>



<p>It was somewhat expected that there would be some variation in the progress of the choreography.</p>



<p>The ones who learned it smoothly were me, Nanase, Kazuki, and Kureha. Kaito and Haru had no problems with the overall movements, but their details were still rough. Yuuko was slightly behind the two of them but steadily improving.</p>



<p>And as they themselves had feared, Yua, Kenta, and Asu-nee were struggling.</p>



<p>As we descended the stairs, Nanase spoke up;</p>



<p>“From here on, let’s split into two teams: my team with Yuuko, Kaito, and Yamazaki, and Chitose’s team with Haru, Uchi, and Nishino-senpai.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing this, Haru and Kaito exclaimed.</p>



<p>“Am I going to be taught too?!”</p>



<p>“I’m in too?!”</p>



<p>Nanase responded with an exasperated tone. “Both of you rely too much on your physical abilities and dance based on intuition.”</p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>With a smirk, I told Haru. “I’ll push you relentlessly until you’re perfect.”</p>



<p>“T-The humiliation…”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but silently apologize. When I glanced at Nanase, she seemed to be thinking the same thing and stuck out her tongue playfully.</p>



<p>It’s true that Kaito and Haru’s dancing was rough, but with them, if we pointed out the details carefully, they should be able to adapt quickly.</p>



<p>Moreover, originally, it would have made more sense to switch Kenta and Haru, grouping the three who were struggling on this side for more efficient practice while the team with decent dancing skills could progress further in the choreography.</p>



<p>Not doing so was probably Nanase’s consideration.</p>



<p>By putting the proficient Haru and Kaito as the ones to be taught and dividing the less skilled Yua, Kenta, and Asu-nee into two teams, she ensured that they didn’t feel responsible for dragging everyone down.</p>



<p>I think this subtle kindness of Nanase’s was truly admirable.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>25</strong></p>


<p>And so, we resumed practice in our separate teams.</p>



<p>I clapped my hands to set the rhythm and raised my voice.</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Haru, make sure to stop at the right moment.”</p>



<p>“Got it!”</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Yua, open your legs wider there.”</p>



<p>“Alright…!”</p>



<p>“One, two, one, two, Asu-nee, your movements are too small because you’re too focused on following everyone.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>After a few repetitions, I could vaguely see some improvement.</p>



<p>“Okay, let’s stop for now.”</p>



<p>When I said that, Yua and Asu-nee placed their hands on their knees, breathing heavily to catch their breath. For the two who weren’t part of any sports clubs, I imagined that even simply moving their bodies for this amount of time was quite a strain, not to mention swinging the sticks that represent swords.</p>



<p>Watching them, I spoke up. “Need a little break?”</p>



<p>“”We’re fine!””</p>



<p>The powerful voices of Yua and Asu-nee overlapped, and I couldn’t help but let a smile slip onto my face.</p>



<p>Regaining my composure, I continued speaking. “Now, Haru-san.”</p>



<p>When I called her name, Haru frowned as if dissatisfied. “What is it?”</p>



<p>I cleared my throat and spoke in a teacher-like tone. “Listen, this isn’t a life-or-death situation.”</p>



<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Just because your movements stop, it doesn’t mean you’ll be attacked and struck.”</p>



<p>“I see!”</p>



<p>Haru lightly tapped her left palm with her right fist, while Yua, Asu-nee, and Kureha were tilting their heads in confusion.</p>



<p><em>Really</em>, I sighed and scratched my cheek.</p>



<p>For example, when I practiced my baseball swings, I imagined myself facing a pitcher. For Haru, even when she was practicing her shots alone, she’s probably conscious of the opposing team’s defense.</p>



<p>It was a quirk of hers, I suppose — an unconscious tendency to assume the presence of an opponent. It was difficult to explain, but it felt like she seamlessly connected all the choreography and kept moving without exposing any openings, as if she’s constantly in a match-like state.</p>



<p>I held the stick and continued demonstrating. “While each move on its own looks good, this is a dance, so unless you don’t stop at the right moments and synchronize with everyone, it will appear out of sync.”</p>



<p>“Understood.”</p>



<p>Haru should get the message with that. I cleared my throat again, purposely making it sound somewhat dramatic.</p>



<p>“Now, Yua-chan.”</p>



<p>“Um…” Yua looked at me anxiously.</p>



<p>“Cast aside your embarrassment.”</p>



<p>She seemed to have an idea of what I meant, and she shyly nodded with a blush, looking down.</p>



<p>“Sorry, it’s just that it’s not a movement I’m used to or do often.”</p>



<p>“It’s alright. If you were too used to slashing people despite not being in the kendo club, I’d be surprised.”</p>



<p>Yua puffed up her cheeks in response to that teasing remark. “Ugh!”</p>



<p>“Setting the jokes aside,” I continued. “It’s the most embarrassing to do these things while feeling shy. For example, in the band club, it would be like marching or the choreography we do for the school festival stage on the first day. It’s the same as that.”</p>



<p>“Now that you mention it, it does make sense.”</p>



<p>“Moreover, our theme is pirates. When you need to open your legs, do it wide open. When you need to strike, do it without hesitation. It’s okay if it looks a bit barbaric.”</p>



<p>Yua gripped the stick tightly and nodded firmly. “Got it. I’ll give it a try.”</p>



<p>I cleared my throat again and spoke up. “And lastly, Asu-nee.”</p>



<p>“Yes…”</p>



<p>“Your hands and feet are not in sync.”</p>



<p>“That’s harsh!”</p>



<p>I chuckled wryly and continued. “Kureha, could you show us an example?”</p>



<p>“Yes! With pleasure!”</p>



<p>Kureha confidently poised her stick.</p>



<p>“Watch carefully. One, two, one, two.”</p>



<p>Following the rhythm of my voice, Kureha gracefully stepped and swung the sword with elegance. Asu-nee watched her movements with a serious gaze.</p>



<p>When that part was over, I opened my mouth. “Thank you, Kureha. Asu-nee, that was a great example.”</p>



<p>While saying that, I held the stick myself this time. “In Asu-nee’s case, you tend to rely too much on your hands when swinging the sword. That’s why your steps are slightly delayed.”</p>



<p>I continued while demonstrating in front of her. “Swinging the sword and stepping forward should be done simultaneously. That way, you can shift your weight and swing more comfortably.”</p>



<p>“I see, that’s why I’ve been falling behind.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee poised the sword and swung it as instructed.</p>



<p><em>Swoosh.</em></p>



<p>The sound was noticeably better compared to before. Asu-nee’s expression brightened, and she looked towards me.</p>



<p>I grinned and said, “Once you can connect that to the dance, it’ll be perfect.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee nodded happily and began swinging the sword while retaining the newfound sensation.</p>



<p>“All right, shall we go through it one more time?”</p>



<p>Haru, Yua, Asu-nee, and Kureha exclaimed.</p>



<p>“”””YESSSSS!!!””””</p>



<p>Observing Nanase and the others, they seemed to be making good progress as well. Kenta was diligently learning the choreography with Kazuki’s guidance.</p>



<p>Suddenly, my eyes met with Nanase’s, and she gave me a cool wink.</p>



<p><em>This isn’t bad, </em>I thought.</p>



<p>Dancing with my friends in a corner of the park, like a deserted spot in the night where pedestrian traffic ceased.</p>



<p>The sweat flying, the exchanged glances, the voices filled with frustration, the smiles of happiness, they all seeped into the memories like drops of rain.</p>



<p>Perhaps for some people, it was just another school event that would pass by whether they gave their all or not. But for us, it was something we took seriously to the point that adults might find it laughable.</p>



<p>Of course, we wanted to win if we were going to do it, but more than that──</p>



<p>Beyond this summer, we were aware of just how irreplaceable this time spent together with everyone was.</p>



<p>Whether someone wished for it or not…</p>



<p>The end would eventually come.</p>



<p>There would be a time when we had to let go.</p>



<p>So while we could be together, we tried to capture as many unforgettable moments as possible, secretly taking them with us into the future.</p>



<p>“It’s so much fun, Senpai!”</p>



<p>Kureha, who stood next to me, exclaimed with enthusiasm.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it really is.”</p>



<p>I said that from the bottom of my heart, almost like a prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>26</strong></p>


<p>Knowing that we still had tomorrow, we wrapped up practice within a reasonable time.</p>



<p>As Kaito mentioned, it was a good start considering we only began practicing on the first day. Yua, Asu-nee, and Kenta, who had been worried, seemed to have grasped the flow quite well in the latter half, so we should be able to manage somehow.</p>



<p>On the short walk back from the park, walking behind everyone, Yuuko suddenly stepped up next to me. She fanned my face with her hand and spoke up;</p>



<p>“Good work, Captain.”</p>



<p>“Hey, cut it out. That tickles.”</p>



<p>I answered with a wry smile, and Yuuko continued;</p>



<p>“Thanks to you and Yuzuki, everything is going so smoothly.”</p>



<p>“We didn’t do anything special. It’s all thanks to everyone’s cooperation.”</p>



<p>Those words caused her to shake her head slowly. She smiled a little, looking slightly embarrassed.</p>



<p>“If I had been the vice-captain as usual, things probably wouldn’t have progressed so efficiently. It’s because Yuzuki is here that you can relax and not feel pressured to handle everything alone.”</p>



<p>She glanced at me, stuck out her tongue playfully, and lowered her head.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for causing so much trouble until now.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be silly. I never thought you were a bother.”</p>



<p>“Hehe,” A gentle voice followed. “I knew Saku would say that, but I wanted to apologize properly.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>Then, Yuuko’s profile, as she faced forward, appeared mature like that of a girl I didn’t know.</p>



<p>“Hey, Saku?”</p>



<p>“Hm?”</p>



<p>“I’m really happy in this moment.”</p>



<p>“Me too.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Saku.”</p>



<p>“Thank you too, Yuuko.”</p>



<p>“And also…”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Yua, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s weird, we’re thinking the same thing.”</p>



<p>“Because we bid farewell to this summer together.”</p>



<p>The two of us chuckled, swaying our shoulders lightly, as we watched everyone’s backs.</p>



<p>As if concluding the conversation, Yuuko murmured softly. “Let me stay by your side just a little longer, Saku.”</p>



<p>I unintentionally swallowed the words I was about to say and unknowingly raised the corner of my mouth, nodding quietly.</p>



<p>Truth be told, I wanted to convey the same thing.</p>



<p>Just a little longer, I wanted you by my side, Yuuko.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>27</strong></p>


<p>As we arrived at Yuuko’s house and stepped into the living room, I was surprised to find myself inexplicably relieved.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because we had spent such an intimate time together here, but even though it had only been half a day, there was a sense of comfort that felt like returning home.</p>



<p>Yuuko looked around at everyone and spoke up. “I’ve filled the bathtub, so let’s take turns getting in!”</p>



<p>Upon hearing those words, I exchanged a glance with Kazuki and scratched my cheek.</p>



<p>“Boys can shower last.”</p>



<p>Even Kaito followed up with an awkward expression. “Yeah.”</p>



<p>Kenta raised his hand swiftly. “Yeah, I agree!”</p>



<p>Yuuko tilted her head in confusion. “Why? You guys are tired, so you should relax and soak in the hot water.”</p>



<p>Nanase came to our rescue with a wry smile. “Well, if they say so, why not let them do as they please? Boys have their own circumstances, you know.”</p>



<p>She looked at us provocatively. Ignoring her gaze, I added with a final remark.</p>



<p>“And if possible, the girl who takes a bath last, please pull the drain plug.”</p>



<p>“””That’s right!!!”””</p>



<p>The four of us exchanged glances and let out a sheepish smile. The hot water left after all the girls have soaked in was no laughing matter.</p>



<p>Shrugging it off, Yuuko continued. “So, who wants to go first? It’s quite spacious, so I think two people can go in together.”</p>



<p>Nanase responded to that, “It’s not like a relay, but how about one person washes their body first, then when they get in the tub, the next person goes in?”</p>



<p>“Yeah! I think that works!”</p>



<p>Asu-nee, who had been listening nearby, joined in. “How about Hiiragi-san goes first? I think everyone would feel a bit reluctant otherwise.”</p>



<p>Yuuko waved her hands in a hurry. “Oh no, I’m totally fine going later!”</p>



<p>Asu-nee chuckled, “It’s very likely that everyone will be refusing like this, right?”</p>



<p>Yua, Nanase, Haru, and Kureha all nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“I see, in that case…” Yuuko looked around at everyone and spoke. “Let’s do it!”</p>



<p>She raised her voice cheerfully.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>28</strong></p>


<p>As Hiiragi-san headed towards the bath, everyone was relaxing in their own way.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, ever since I, Nishino Asuka, arrived here, my heart had been restless.</p>



<p>I’ve already told Saku-kun, but this was my first time staying over at a friend’s house, and moreover, it was with this dazzling group of people I had been only admiring from afar.</p>



<p>If only I had been born a year later, if only I were one of you… I couldn’t count how many times I had yearned for such a thing.</p>



<p>Being part of that circle, walking towards the same goal with the same vision, was undoubtedly the first and last thing I had always longed for.</p>



<p>Like an excited girl on her first school trip, I glanced around the living room with anticipation. Spending the night together with a large group felt like playing a game of scooping goldfish with Saku-nii at a festival.</p>



<p>There were numerous strings hanging in front of me, but I could only pull one at a time. I had no idea where they lead or what awaited at the end. If I chose something, I might miss out on an even more beautiful moment, or whatever I chose might become a treasure I would never forget.</p>



<p>How should I spend this night? Who should I talk to?</p>



<p>It would be nice to discuss how difficult the choreography was with Yamazaki-kun, and I was curious to hear from Mizushino-kun and Asano-kun about how Saku-kun acted when he was with the boys.</p>



<p>I wanted to ask Uchida-san about cooking and have a leisurely conversation with Nanase-san. I also wanted to apologize to Nozomi-san for being a bother during practice.</p>



<p>But, in the end, I found myself looking towards the garden.</p>



<p>──When I looked back on this time someday, I wanted to see as many of <em>you</em> there as possible.</p>



<p>After Hiiragi-san headed to the bath, I noticed that Saku-kun went outside without hesitation. He was holding a case for baseball bat.</p>



<p>Despite being in the middle of a training camp, he must have intended to keep up with his daily routine of swinging practice. He danced with Nozomi-san more than anyone during the day and exhausted himself guiding us at night, yet he was relentlessly strict with himself.</p>



<p>When I stepped onto the wooden deck with shoes in hand…</p>



<p>“Haru, how does it look?”</p>



<p>“It feels somewhat off to me.”</p>



<p>“What about this?”</p>



<p>“It seems like the power isn’t quite transmitting properly.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right. It’s better like this.”</p>



<p>“That’s it! The form I like.”</p>



<p>Saku-kun, engrossed in his practice swings, and Aomi-san engaged in conversation like it were second nature to them.</p>



<p>My heart, previously filled with excitement, was now shallowly wounded, as if a fragile paper cut grazes my fingertips.</p>



<p>You, baseball, and Aomi-san.</p>



<p>For me, it was combination that carried a slightly bittersweet feeling.</p>



<p>Ever since we reconnected around this time last year, Saku-nii and I have had various conversations about wanting to become a source of strength for each other. Soon enough, I sensed that the deepest wound was when he quit the baseball club.</p>



<p>But in the end, all I could do was offer a band-aid, while you refused to show me the scab you had hidden beneath it.</p>



<p>Only the girl standing in front of me forcibly peeled it away, properly disinfecting the wound.</p>



<p>Saku-kun noticed me and called out. “Oh, Asu-nee.”</p>



<p>Aomi-san, sitting cross-legged on the wooden deck, grinned and tapped the spot next to her.</p>



<p>“Nishino-senpai, want to release some pent-up frustration together?”</p>



<p>It seemed to be a playful retaliation for the critique during practice earlier.</p>



<p>“Hehe, that sounds like a wonderful way to spend the night at the training camp,” I replied, trying to act like a senpai.</p>



<p>Honestly, I didn’t understand a single thing about their exchange just now.</p>



<p>To me, Saku-kun swinging the bat looked no different from his previous form, and Aomi-san’s words were completely incomprehensible to me.</p>



<p>──But these two, they understand each other on a level that surpasses words alone.</p>



<p>You, who always tried to act indifferent, genuinely accepted Aomi-san’s words as they were, and there was nothing but ordinary trust between you two.</p>



<p>I think, deep down, this is how I wanted to be.</p>



<p>The gaze you directed towards Aomi-san, I wished it would be directed towards me someday.</p>



<p>“Asu-nee, if there’s anything bothering you, feel free to tell me.”</p>



<p>“Nishino-senpai, don’t hold back and spill it all out!”</p>



<p>“Alright, let this big sis take a look.”</p>



<p>An empty feeling of being left behind. Only my words slipped away, exposed to the September night sky.</p>



<p><em>──Swish, swish.</em></p>



<p>As if tearing through that dampness, a crisp and satisfying sound echoed in the dry air.</p>



<p><em>How cool, </em>finally, my cheeks naturally loosened up.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because we were just practicing dance a moment ago that I thought this way even more.</p>



<p>Maybe Aomi-san was thinking something similar. She, sitting cross-legged with her chin propped on her hand, muttered as if talking to herself.</p>



<p>“Still, baseball is an incredible sport, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Saku-kun seemed deep in concentration, oblivious to Aomi-san’s voice. I nodded subtly and opened my mouth. “Even just swinging that thin stick around made my arms ache.”</p>



<p>Aomi-san chuckled and replied. “Same here. I’ll definitely be sore tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Even you, Aomi-san?”</p>



<p>“Basketball uses completely different muscles. It’s inevitable, probably.”</p>



<p>For some reason, we both exchanged glances and burst into laughter together.</p>



<p>After our shoulders shaking for a moment, Aomi-san spoke up. “That guy, when he’s with Nishino-senpai, he has this childish expression, you know?”</p>



<p>I tilted my head in response. “I think that happens more when he’s doing sports with you, Aomi-san.”</p>



<p>Aomi-san flashed a smile that seemed somewhat resigned.</p>



<p>“The way he looks at me is the gaze he directs towards his teammate. But when he looks at Nishino-senpai, it’s the gaze he reserves for someone he admires.”</p>



<p>I pondered for a moment and shook my head. “The look he gives me is probably filled with nostalgia for the past.”</p>



<p>Aomi-san let out a short breath. “We both have our own struggles, don’t we?”</p>



<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>



<p>Perhaps she was trying to be considerate.</p>



<p>“I’ll head back inside,” Aomi-san said, standing up and turning her back.</p>



<p>When she took a step forward, she suddenly turned around with a faint smile, as if remembering something.</p>



<p>“I’m the type who doesn’t back down, even when facing a senpai.”</p>



<p>I responded, narrowing my eyes at her radiant smile. “And I’m quite good at playing the role of an older sister to my kouhai.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/168076.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Contrary to appearances, I had quite a strong competitive spirit.</p>



<p>Hiiragi-san, Uchida-san, Nanase-san.</p>



<p>There were wonderful girls around Saku-kun, but among them…</p>



<p>I didn’t want to be made to cry twice by Aomi-san, who reclaimed baseball for him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>29</strong></p>


<p>I bid farewell to Aomi-san as she returned to the living room and took a sword in my hand instead of a stick. Putting on my shoes, I stood up and positioned myself a little distance away, aligning my shoulders with yours.</p>



<p>Just like that girl, I could do it.</p>



<p>It seemed like Saku-kun finally remembered my presence, as he paused his practice swings and gently smiled.</p>



<p>“Asu-nee, if you push yourself too hard, it might affect you tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, just a little more. I’m aware that I’m lagging behind.”</p>



<p>“I see, take it easy then.”</p>



<p>And so, Saku-kun with his bat, and I with my sword, began our practice swings.</p>



<p>──<em>Whoosh, swish.</em></p>



<p>──<em>Swish, swish.</em></p>



<p>Quite pitiful sounds compared to yours.</p>



<p>My palms were turning red, and the skin felt like it was about to peel off. In truth, my arms were screaming in protest. But even so, this fatigue felt oddly pleasant right now.</p>



<p>To Saku-kun, it might seem like mere play. Yet, this allowed me to feel like I could touch the world where you fought, both in the past and surely in the future.</p>



<p><em>Above all else,</em> I thought.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a scene from that day at Higashi Park flashed back in my mind — the sight of being left behind. Saku-nii practicing baseball, and everyone supporting him.</p>



<p>──This time, I’m finally within that circle too.</p>



<p>With a firm stomp of my foot, I swung the sword with all my might, pouring all my current strength into it.</p>



<p>──<em>Swish.</em></p>



<p>For just a fleeting moment, it felt like I had come a little closer to you.</p>



<p>I unintentionally glanced at Saku-kun…</p>



<p>“Nice swing,” he said briefly, accompanied by a soft smile.</p>



<p>And then, we continued our swings in silence for a while.</p>



<p><em>──Swish, swish, swish, swish.</em></p>



<p>Your sound and my sound. They overlapped, resonated, and got absorbed into the night sky. Like holding hands, like touching shoulders, like embracing each other’s waists.</p>



<p>Though we couldn’t become partners, it felt as if we were dancing a secret duet. Surely, I had always dreamed of moments like these.</p>



<p>“Asu-nee,” Saku-kun spoke up. “Thanks for joining the cheering squad. I never thought the day would come when we could spend a night like this together, so I’m really happy.”</p>



<p>Your unusually genuine words, unadorned, seeped deeply into my heart. I should be the one expressing my gratitude, but…</p>



<p>Before I could find the right, clever words or express my sincerity,</p>



<p>“Ah, senpai, that’s not fair! Let me join too!”</p>



<p>Nozomi-san jumped out energetically from the living room. Unfortunately, your official partner had arrived.</p>



<p>I smiled wryly as I thought to myself.</p>



<p>When Nozomi-san jokingly mentioned Saku-nii, an indescribable sense of urgency overwhelmed me.</p>



<p>Just like how I called you “you (<em>kimi</em>)”, you were the only one who called me Asu-nee. Somewhere in my heart, I mistakenly believed that only I, who spent that youthful summer with Saku-nii, could call him Saku-nii.</p>



<p><em>“I want to be paired with senpai!”</em></p>



<p>If only I could convey it like this innocent kouhai girl. Would our relationship continue to evolve, taking on a slightly different form?</p>



<p>But in the end, we would always be circuitous. We would continue to intertwine words upon words, tracing every phrase.</p>



<p>Because I was certain that’s how the story would keep unfolding.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>30</strong></p>


<p>I, Aomi Haru, swiftly discarded the sweat-drenched T-shirt and shorts in the changing room. I removed the hair tie and wrapped it around my wrist, then shook my head vigorously. Next, I unhooked my bra, feeling disheartened by its modest size, and used the T-shirt to cover it.</p>



<p>As I glanced around, contrasting with my crumpled clothes that resemble discarded shells, I noticed the neatly folded outfit sitting in <em>seiza</em> position like a display in a shop.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but wryly smile, thinking that one’s personality truly showed in these small details.</p>



<p>As I took off my underwear and held a towel I brought with me, I opened the door to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>There was Yuzuki, leisurely stretching her legs in the bath. I had become accustomed to seeing her naked during our training camps. There’s no need for us to be shy around each other anymore.</p>



<p>I responded nonchalantly. “Yo.”</p>



<p>In the end, the bathing order was Yuuko, Uchi, Yuzuki, and then me. As mentioned, the bathroom was quite spacious, and even with the two of us, it didn’t feel cramped at all.</p>



<p>The lights were turned off, replaced by several flickering aroma candles that filled the air with a pleasant scent of bath salts. It was a different atmosphere from what I imagined, which made me chuckle.</p>



<p>“This is quite fancy, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“It seems Yuuko prepared it since this is a special occasion. I often do it at home too.”</p>



<p>“Yuzuki aside, I feel a bit out of place in this setting.”</p>



<p>“More than that, it’s amusing to imagine the boys coming in later.”</p>



<p><em>Indeed</em>, we looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>



<p>I hung the showerhead on the higher hook and turned the handle while standing. Cold water poured over my body before it turned warm, causing a slight shiver as I raised my face.</p>



<p>During this time of year, when the temperature was still high, taking a shower like this felt refreshing after moving around so much.</p>



<p>As I was enveloped in the gradually warming shower, </p>



<p>“You still have a great body.”</p>



<p>Yuzuki casually remarked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/168077.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>With a faint smile, I responded. “If you’re looking for a fight, can you do it before getting in the bath?”</p>



<p>I turned around, facing away from the showerhead, and looked at Yuzuki. Even though I had been mentally beaten down countless times before, her proportions still seemed unreal, like a joke.</p>



<p>“No, that’s not what I meant,” Yuzuki chuckled. “I meant your body is well-toned.”</p>



<p>Ah, I turned back to the showerhead once again, borrowing Yuuko’s shampoo and scrubbing it into my hair.</p>



<p>“I’m pushing myself hard in preparation for the Winter Cup.”</p>



<p>“It got delayed by about a month, right?”</p>



<p>“That way I’ll be ready to give it my all.”</p>



<p>Normally, the qualifiers would have started around this time, but it seemed the tournament schedule had been pushed back. But that didn’t matter; we just need to prepare for the upcoming matches.</p>



<p>I rinsed off the shampoo and cautiously applied a luxurious-looking conditioner, more expensive than what I usually used, to my hair.</p>



<p>“By the way, Yuzuki, why did you become the vice-captain?”</p>



<p>As a vice-captain, she embodied the qualities of a captain even more than the actual captain himself, so I never questioned her suitability for the role. Becoming the vice-captain would allow her to assist Chitose effectively.</p>



<p>However, there was one thing that puzzled me — she tended to shy away from taking the spotlight.</p>



<p>She became the vice-captain of the girls basketball team because almost everyone, including me, strongly recommended her for the position.</p>



<p>That’s why I found it intriguing. What kind of change in her mindset led her to volunteer as the vice-captain?</p>



<p>Yuzuki leaned her head against the edge of the bathtub, gazing absentmindedly at the ceiling, and responded. “I wonder why…”</p>



<p>It was not so much that she’s evading the question but rather contemplating it herself.</p>



<p><em>Splash</em>, Yuzuki opened her mouth. “Why did you easily join the cheering squad?”</p>



<p>She meant going as far as sacrificing basketball practice time. Since my reason was clear, I gave a straightforward answer.</p>



<p>“It’s for me to become stronger.”</p>



<p>“I see,” Yuzuki glanced at me briefly and mumbled. “I suppose I’m consciously and unconsciously influenced too.”</p>



<p>It felt awkward to ask whom she was referring to, so I didn’t bother.</p>



<p>“Then, Nana will surely become stronger too.”</p>



<p>I gathered my hair haphazardly with a hairband and began washing my body. Perhaps due to the excitement from swinging the bat recklessly, my arms felt strangely heavy.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I recalled the conversation I had with Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>Was it the intoxicating excitement that came with a training camp night, or was I just being foolish when I blurted out something unnecessary at the end?</p>



<p>Even for someone like me who was used to Yuzuki’s presence, Nishino-senpai was so beautiful that I couldn’t help but blush when I was in close proximity to her.</p>



<p>And to think that she and Chitose were childhood friends — no one informed me about that!</p>



<p>Was that even possible?</p>



<p>…Could it be that she was his first love?</p>



<p>Thinking too seriously about it would only bring me down, so I let the shower run down my nape and shoulders, washing away the foam from the body soap.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki, scoot over.”</p>



<p>When I said that, my partner made a dissatisfied face. “Aww, just when I was enjoying my space.”</p>



<p>“You always take forever in the bath.”</p>



<p>“Well, since your baths are so quick, can I have some of that extra time?”</p>



<p>Saying that, she reluctantly pulled her legs back.</p>



<p>Facing Yuzuki, I entered the bath, being careful not to let my hair, still coated with conditioner, touch the water.</p>



<p>Until recently, I would wash off the conditioner together with the body soap, but Yuuko told me that it was more effective to let it penetrate for a longer time. Using a hot towel would be even better, but I had already used it to wash my body today, so I had to go without it.</p>



<p>“Mmm, it feels so good.”</p>



<p>“You sound like an old man.”</p>



<p>As I absentmindedly stretched my legs, I accidentally poked my partner’s buttocks or thigh.</p>



<p>“Hey!”</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry.”</p>



<p>Apart from the large bathhouses we used during our training camps, I wonder how long it had been since I had shared a bath with someone in home.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a nostalgic feeling welled up inside me, and I spoke up.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, remember when we were little? We used to bring towels into the bathtub and make jellyfish, right?”</p>



<p>“Is this the kind of topic we should have while being surrounded by romantic candlelights?”</p>



<p>Despite saying that, Yuzuki loosened her lips and answered. “Yeah, yeah, I did that. I still remember that indescribable texture.”</p>



<p>“And when you sink it, bubbles come out.”</p>



<p>“And making horns with shampoo was also a classic.”</p>



<p>“It’s funny to imagine Yuzuki doing that.”</p>



<p>My partner gazed absentmindedly at the flickering candlelight. I usually didn’t pay much attention, but her profile and exposed skin, illuminated in this dim light, were unexpectedly alluring.</p>



<p>Feeling frustrated that I inadvertently got lost in staring, I formed a water pistol with both hands and took aim at Yuzuki.</p>



<p>Perhaps because it had been so long, I completely missed my target.</p>



<p>Yuzuki sighed in exasperation. “You’re terrible. Don’t extinguish the candle flame.”</p>



<p>As she said that, she formed a water gun with both hands and aimed it at me.</p>



<p>“This is how you do it.”</p>



<p>With a forceful “psssh,” hot water gushed out and directly hit my face.</p>



<p>“Ah!”</p>



<p>Not only was she accurate with her shots during basketball, but even in this playful act, huh? Since it had come to this, I thought about pouring water directly from a bucket, but…</p>



<p>As soon as I thought about it, a sudden sense of absurdness washed over me, and I burst out laughing.</p>



<p>It seemed my partner felt the same way, as the surface of the water began to ripple with her laughter.</p>



<p>After we had a good laugh, I opened my mouth. “When do you think we stop doing these things?”</p>



<p>Yuzuki narrowed her eyes, looking somewhat wistful. “Isn’t it when we can no longer stay as children?”</p>



<p>“That’s a surprisingly profound thing to say.”</p>



<p>“Hey.”</p>



<p>With a short exhale, I responded. “What does that make us, who were just seriously fighting with swords a moment ago?”</p>



<p>Yuzuki answered while gazing at the water she scooped up in her hands. “Still, don’t you want to stay a little longer as children?”</p>



<p>There’s a tone in her voice that somehow felt like a prayer.</p>



<p>I chuckled. <em>I see.</em></p>



<p>September of our second year. Our high school life had reached its halfway point, more or less.</p>



<p>Not just Nishino-senpai, but maybe our time to goof around like this with the others wasn’t as long as we thought.</p>



<p>Perhaps everyone, in some way, sensed that underlying loneliness, which was why we ended up being more exuberant than necessary.</p>



<p>Yuzuki suddenly spoke as if she had just remembered something. “Haru, what do you think of Kureha?”</p>



<p>“What do I think…?” I briefly recalled my experiences with Kureha and responded. “She’s incredibly beautiful, yet she’s also honest, earnest, considerate, adept, and has outstanding athletic abilities. I even feel like recruiting her into our club.”</p>



<p>Yuzuki’s cheeks relaxed for a moment. “Yeah, I agree.”</p>



<p>“Why are you suddenly asking about that…?”</p>



<p>Yuzuki averted her gaze. “It’s just a small self-loathing, maybe.”</p>



<p>With those words, the image of Chitose and Kureha’s paired dance suddenly came to mind.</p>



<p>Though we instigated it as a playful joke, when I saw the happy face of the kouhai being embraced by Chitose, a dull pain shot through me.</p>



<p><em>“…T-The humiliation.”</em></p>



<p>I tried to deceive myself with those words, but it wasn’t true. When I imagined Chitose holding me like that when I collapsed in the gymnasium, I felt embarrassed yet happy.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a sense of longing overwhelmed me.</p>



<p>Please, don’t embrace other girls like that.</p>



<p>I scolded myself, realizing how pathetic I was. It’s one thing to feel jealous of Yuzuki or the others, but to be resentful even of an adorable kouhai? How pitiful was I?</p>



<p>This feeling continued even during the final run-through. Chitose and Kureha moved in perfect sync, like partners who had been together for years. They looked cool, elegant, and beautiful.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but wonder why it wasn’t me dancing with him.</p>



<p><em>“If only you could look at me only, I wouldn’t ask for anything more.”</em></p>



<p><em>“If I could only look at you, that would be enough for me.”</em></p>



<p>I had been thinking such things just the other day.</p>



<p>Ah, I didn’t want to dwell on it anymore.</p>



<p>I was about to dive into the water without thinking, only to realize at the last moment that this wasn’t my own home and I still had conditioner in my hair.</p>



<p>Then, I glanced at Yuzuki’s face.</p>



<p>I wondered if a beautiful girl like her ever felt lost or pathetic like this. She was the one I wanted to confide in the most, yet the one I couldn’t share my true feelings with.</p>



<p>Even though our feelings were already transparent to each other, we still didn’t explicitly put them into words.</p>



<p>Because once we said them out loud, we would become something else.</p>



<p>Just like how the inside belonged to me in basketball, and the outside belonged to Nana. It was probably because if we lost that distinction, we would lose the drive to win as well.</p>



<p>Unaware of my thoughts, Yuzuki spoke with a calm voice.</p>



<p>“Nishino-senpai and Kureha must be waiting, so maybe we should head out soon.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>With that, I let the coldest water pour down from the showerhead, drenching my head.</p>



<p>“Hey!”</p>



<p>The water splashed onto Yuzuki, who was waiting behind me, and she smacked me on the back.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>31</strong></p>


<p>After quickly finishing my simple skincare routine and returning to the living room, Kaito eagerly spoke up as if he had been waiting.</p>



<p>“Oh, Haru, that was quite a long bath for you.”</p>



<p>“Don’t act like you know my bathing time.”</p>



<p>“I can pretty much guess without asking.”</p>



<p>Well, he was actually right.</p>



<p>Beside Kaito were Chitose and Mizushino, who seemed to have finished their practice swings, and Kureha was standing there too. It seemed like the four of them were discussing something.</p>



<p>As I wiped my still slightly damp hair with a bath towel, despite taking care to apply conditioner properly, I asked, “So, what’s up?”</p>



<p>Kaito chuckled and replied. “We were thinking of grabbing a late-night snack at Hachiban Ramen with this group, but Saku insisted that we wait for you or else you’ll definitely complain later.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, I glanced briefly at the clock in the living room. Clearly, it wasn’t the appropriate time for the girls to be all excited about eating ramen.</p>



<p>It’s not that it was dangerous at night or anything like that, but as Yuzuki would say, it was a matter of refinement. Besides, I had already eaten Uchi’s curry in a large serving and even had a bit of seconds.</p>



<p>I stared at Chitose and spoke. “What do you think you’re doing, treating a young lady like that?”</p>



<p>“What? You coming or not?”</p>



<p>“Well, I am.”</p>



<p>“I figured.”</p>



<p>As we exchanged casual and nonchalant conversation, inwardly, I couldn’t help but feel a flutter of excitement.</p>



<p>Even if the four of them decided to go without me, or if things ended up that way, I didn’t think I’d have any right to complain.</p>



<p>In my absence, you were thinking of me. That alone was enough for now.</p>



<p>“By the way,” I looked at the kouhai. “Are you coming too?”</p>



<p>Kureha brightened up instantly and replied. “Yes! I’ll join you.”</p>



<p>“It might strange coming from me, but are you okay with eating ramen at this hour?”</p>



<p>“Well, it will give Asuka-san a chance to take a leisurely bath, and besides, isn’t sneaking out with everyone during the training camp night what youth is all about!?”</p>



<p>She had a point, I smiled wryly.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, during last year’s summer training camp for the girls basketball team, we dragged a reluctant Yuzuki to a nearby ramen shop, only to be lectured by Misaki-chan later.</p>



<p>By the way, the reason wasn’t that we “violated team discipline”, but rather “why didn’t you invite me?”</p>



<p>Back then, I never imagined I would be so thrilled and concerned about things other than basketball. The court was my world, and my teammates were everything.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” Kureha tilted her head and looked at me. “Is it okay if we don’t wait for Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>“If I invite her, she’ll just give me a look like ‘Are you insane?’ Trust me, I’ve been through it.”</p>



<p>“I can totally see that happening!”</p>



<p>As I watched the kouhai happily frolicking around, surrounded by the senpais, I felt a sense of nostalgia.</p>



<p>There was a time when I, too, was an innocent girl.</p>



<p>As long as I had companions to share my aspirations and goals, it was enough for me. I would watch my female classmates who were infatuated with romantic pursuits with a jaded gaze…</p>



<p><em>I’m sorry for that time</em>, I whispered in my heart, not addressing it to anyone in particular.</p>



<p>At least on a night like this, I wish I could still be that unripe, youthful version of myself.</p>



<p>Before everything took on colors and lost its innocence.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>32</strong></p>


<p>Though it was still a bit early for midnight, Hachiban Ramen was unsurprisingly empty at this hour.</p>



<p>I ordered vegetable tantanmen for the first time in a long time, Mizushino went for the vegetable ramen with salt, Kaito opted for the vegetable chashu ramen with miso, and as usual, Chitose ordered a serving of tanmen with extra onions. Seeing that, Kureha also ordered the same dish.</p>



<p>The orders seemed to come out quickly, perhaps because there weren’t many other orders waiting.</p>



<p>Chitose turned to Kureha and said, “Listen, the key is to generously add vinegar and chili oil. That’s the refined way to enjoy it.”</p>



<p>“Yes!” Kureha responded obediently, which left me speechless.</p>



<p>“Don’t copy him so faithfully, Kureha, or you’ll choke.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, I love spicy food!”</p>



<p>“By the way,” Kaito chimed in. “Eating ramen outside at this hour feels like a guilty pleasure.”</p>



<p>Mizushino smiled and added, “It makes you suddenly realize that you’re experiencing an extraordinary night.”</p>



<p>Chitose, who was mixing his tanmen, said, “It’s great, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Even the boys seemed unusually sentimental.</p>



<p>But well, I understood. Compared to coming here with Yuzuki after the club activities, this feeling was different.</p>



<p>At a time that’s not the usual, with a slightly different group of people, we broke away from the usual circle and ate ramen together.</p>



<p>Why was it that such a simple act felt so special?</p>



<p>As I watched Chitose slurping his tanmen with relish, my eyes narrowed slightly.</p>



<p>Yuuko, Uchi, Yuzuki, and Nishino-senpai weren’t here. So at this moment, it was only me who was looking at you with affection.</p>



<p><em>Good grief</em>.</p>



<p>What’s with me suddenly being aware of this?</p>



<p>While I was lost in such thoughts, Kureha suddenly coughed.</p>



<p>I chuckled and handed her some water. “See, I told you.”</p>



<p>Kureha gulped it down and replied. “That surprised me, I underestimated the power of vinegar.”</p>



<p>I remembered feeling the same way when I took my first bite. Was that around May? It felt like such a distant memory.</p>



<p>“Hey,” As if prompted by a sudden thought, Kaito spoke up. “Do you have a boyfriend or anything, Kureha?”</p>



<p><em>Snap.</em></p>



<p><em>Knock.</em></p>



<p><em>Smack.</em></p>



<p>“Why on earth?!”</p>



<p>Chitose, Mizushino, and I each interjected with our own retorts.</p>



<p>“Take it step by step.”</p>



<p>“No one likes an overly eager guy.”</p>



<p>“Seriously, you have no sense of tact.”</p>



<p>“But isn’t talking about romance the norm on camp nights?!”</p>



<p>I let out a sigh at his pathetic voice.</p>



<p>I was surprised when I heard that Kaito had confessed to Yuuko. However, I could understand that he wasn’t taking advantage of her vulnerability to pursue a relationship. He might be an idiot, but he’s not that kind of guy.</p>



<p>I didn’t know the exact details, but I believe he was trying to stop the tears of the girl he had fallen for in his own way.</p>



<p>So, his intention in teasing the kouhai right now probably really was just to talk about romance, as he himself claimed, rather than trying to get back at her because Yuuko rejected him.</p>



<p>Even so, couldn’t he find a better way to broach the subject?</p>



<p>Kureha frantically waved her hands. “Oh no, no, I don’t have one!”</p>



<p>Perhaps after being teased so much, Kaito spoke frankly. “But Kureha, you must be popular with guys, right?”</p>



<p>“Well, I’m not really sure…” Kureha scratched her cheek, looking troubled. “I do get confessed to from time to time, though.”</p>



<p>Mizushino joined in with a teasing tone. “So, it happens quite frequently then?”</p>



<p>I continued, exasperated. “Of course it does. She’s like Yuzuki who’s had all the mischievousness and arrogance removed.”</p>



<p>“Hold on, Haru-san! Yuzuki-san will get mad at you!”</p>



<p>As I saw the reaction from the kouhai, my lips relaxed into a faint smile. Sometimes, this kind of banter wasn’t so bad after all.</p>



<p>Back when Kei-san was around, we often heard stories about love and romance in the clubroom. But lately, she had been more focused on serious practice and reflecting on our matches.</p>



<p>Besides, everyone had been through a lot this summer break and just recently found some peace. So, the atmosphere wasn’t really conducive to such playful topic.</p>



<p>I felt sorry for teasing Kureha, but when it came to the innocent love stories of our adorable kouhai, it would be perfect for livening up the camp night.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, maybe Kei-san was trying to bridge the gap with that lightheartedness.</p>



<p>…No, knowing her, it might have just been her plain curiosity.</p>



<p>As Kaito got carried away, he spoke up. “Don’t you ever think about wanting a boyfriend, Kureha?”</p>



<p>Leaning forward, Kureha replied energetically. “Oh, I’m actively looking for one!”</p>



<p>Mizushino had a mischievous expression on his face. “Oh really? But it seems like you’ve made quite a few guys cry, despite that.”</p>



<p>“Kazuki-san, watch your words!”</p>



<p>“So, you have high standards, huh? What’s your type?”</p>



<p>I chuckled at his forwardness. Chitose tended to throw light jabs all the time, so it was easy to forget, but now that I thought about it, Mizushino was the type to tease as well.</p>



<p>“Um,” Kureha pondered for a moment and then lowered her gaze. “Someone who would quietly offer me an umbrella on a rainy day.”</p>



<p>Mizushino smiled faintly. “Approved. That’s a clever answer.”</p>



<p>Chitose didn’t seem too interested in joining the conversation and had a calm look in his eyes as he watched Kureha.</p>



<p>I didn’t dislike that side of him either, but without his usual jokes, things felt a bit off-kilter.</p>



<p>I took on Chitose’s role and said, “Alright, Kureha, if you had to choose one of these three guys, whose face do you find the most attractive?”</p>



<p>“Huh?!” Kureha was visibly taken aback. “Um, is Haru-san not an option?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, so you’re counting me as a guy?”</p>



<p>“D-Don’t say mean things!”</p>



<p>I thought that just asking about her “type” would have multiple interpretations, so I added “face” to make it easier to answer. Since I wasn’t often the one teasing others in conversations like this, I found myself hesitating for a moment.</p>



<p>…Wait, would it be okay? It’s not like it would be difficult to answer, right?</p>



<p>Kureha paused, deep in thought, before suddenly lifting her gaze. She glanced at Kazuki, seemingly caught off guard, and quickly averted her gaze.</p>



<p>Turning her attention to Chitose, she said, “Since I’m paired up with Senpai, let’s go with that.”</p>



<p>She let out a bright, spontaneous laugh.</p>



<p>Without missing a beat, a dry retort followed. “Hey, we saw you looking at Kazuki first.”</p>



<p>“N-No way! I wasn’t!”</p>



<p>“That’s why you need to stop sounding so rehearsed.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Kaito let out a self-deprecating voice. “Hey, what about me? Can I be included in the options too!?”</p>



<p>We exchanged glances and burst into laughter. It was truly amazing how our short time together had allowed her to understand everyone so well.</p>



<p>With that, we quickly finished our ramen and left Hachiban. The cool breeze was more refreshing than expected, gently caressing our bodies still warm from the bath.</p>



<p>──<em>Chirp, chirp, chirp.</em></p>



<p>The quiet sounds of insects signaling the arrival of autumn echoed softly in the surroundings. On a rural road with barely a car passing by, we leisurely rode our bicycles. The rustling sound of swaying rice stalks resembled the murmuring of small waves.</p>



<p>It felt as though we were floating through the night on a tiny boat. Kureha rode beside me.</p>



<p><em>Clatter, clatter, clatter.</em></p>



<p>The overlapping sound of our wheels felt like it was carrying us to the next season.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>33</strong></p>


<p>As I, Nanase Yuzuki, finished my skincare routine, I returned to the living room only to find that Haru and the others were nowhere to be seen. Yuuko, Uchi, Nishino-senpai, and Yamazaki were sitting on the sofa, enjoying themselves while nibbling on some snacks.</p>



<p>It was the kind of scene you’d expect from a training camp, and I couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>



<p>I approached them and spoke up, “Nishino-senpai, sorry for taking so long. It took me more time than I thought.”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai turned around, wearing a smile that somehow seemed a bit more youthful than usual. “It’s alright. Time flew by while I was talking with everyone.”</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, where are the others?”</p>



<p>“They went to Hachiban together.”</p>



<p>“…Are they serious?”</p>



<p>Chitose, Mizushino, Kaito, and Haru didn’t surprise me, but Kureha joining them was unexpected. Despite I had seen her eating curry heartily, I still couldn’t quite fathom how she maintained her figure.</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai stood up and said, “Well then, Hiiragi-san, I’ll take a bath too.”</p>



<p>“Sure thing! Since Kureha already left, please take your time.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>I took a seat on the sofa, taking Nishino-senpai’s place. “Oh, Yamazaki didn’t go?”</p>



<p>In response to my words, Yamazaki chuckled. “I’ve been working hard on my diet, so if I tag along with King and the others, I’ll end up gaining weight again.”</p>



<p>I nodded deeply and extended my hands dramatically. “Oh, my friend!”</p>



<p>“What’s gotten into you all of a sudden!?”</p>



<p>Come to think of it, we usually spent a lot of time together as a group, so it was rare for us to have a chance to talk like this.</p>



<p>This was also one of the highlights of the training camp, I thought mischievously, and opened my mouth with a teasing tone.</p>



<p>“Yamazaki, you’ve grown.”</p>



<p>Yamazaki, apparently interpreting my words differently, replied with a smug expression. “Well, yeah. I’ve been doing my workouts and paying more attention to protein intake lately.”</p>



<p>“No, that’s not what I meant,” I paused for a moment and continued with a playful tone. “It’s not easy to be under the same roof with four beautiful ladies this late at night, right?”</p>



<p>Finally realizing my intention, Yamazaki turned bright red and averted his eyes. “H-Hey, stop it, Nanase-san! I’ve been desperately trying not to think about that!”</p>



<p>Finding his reaction amusing, I couldn’t resist teasing him a little more. “Yuuko and Uchi, and even me. We’re all in our pajamas after taking a bath.”</p>



<p>Yamazaki covered his ears with both hands, tightly shut his eyes, and shouted, “Naaaaah! I can’t hear you! <em><em><strong>¹</strong></em>Jyururirin jyururirin gokō no surikire kazaranaru suzukaze no suzumi kaze…”</em></p>



<p>By the way, Yuko was wearing a Gelato Pique T-shirt with a long-sleeved hoodie, striped shorts, and a headband. Uchi had on a satin blue pajama set adorned with white star patterns, and a Gelato Pique headband. As for me, I was in a Gelato Pique onesie with a hoodie.</p>



<p>Everyone was dressed the same as during our summer study camp.</p>



<p>Wearing shorts with this length was normal for me even in casual outfits, but pajamas have a looser fit, revealing a somewhat vulnerable side of myself.</p>



<p>Even as someone of the same gender, the first time I stayed over with Yuuko and Uchi, I couldn’t help but feel a little taken aback by their different, unguarded atmosphere.</p>



<p>To be honest, it might be a bit overwhelming for boys.</p>



<p>I chuckled and spoke up, “Just kidding, you can look over here like you normally would.”</p>



<p>In response to my words, Yamazaki stood up straight. Adjusting his glasses with a determined expression, he said in a mysterious, solemn voice, “No, for I am a man who lives by the way of the sword.”</p>



<p>With only those words, he swiftly grabbed a practice sword and headed out to the garden.</p>



<p>Oops, maybe I went a little too far.</p>



<p>Yuuko, who had been watching the exchange, pouted. “Seriously, you shouldn’t tease Kentacchi so much!”</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry.”</p>



<p>I must be getting carried away as well.</p>



<p>Of course, I wouldn’t make this kind of joke with the boys at school. But Yamazaki had long been part of our inner circle, so I unintentionally teased him in a way I would with Chitose and the others.</p>



<p><em>I’ll have to apologize later</em>, I thought, scratching my cheek.</p>



<p>Uchi, who had been silently watching everything, smiled calmly. “It’s okay, Yuzuki-chan. It’s true that he might be shy, but maybe he wanted to practice a little more, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“I see,” I regained my composure and said, “Then, shall we have a girls gathering until those guys come back?”</p>



<p>Yuuko’s face brightened up instantly. “We still have plenty of snacks! Including Mister Donut!”</p>



<p>“It’s not good to have them at this hour, though…” I said, but I couldn’t help myself and grabbed a chocolate-covered pastry.</p>



<p>Uchi got up from the sofa. “What would you like to drink, Yuzuki-chan? Coffee, tea, hojicha, hot milk, or you can have Welch’s juice like Yuuko-chan said.”</p>



<p>“Then, I’ll leave it to you. I kind of feel like having Welch’s after a long time.”</p>



<p>“Me, me, me!” Yuuko energetically raised her hand. “I’ll take care of the preparations!”</p>



<p>With a skip in her step, Yuuko headed to the kitchen. She returned with Welch’s grape juice that she poured into three wine glasses, carefully placed on the coasters lined up in threes.</p>



<p>Then, she flicked the main light switch by the entrance, casting a soft glow from the floor and ambient lights, enveloping us in a gentle radiance.</p>



<p>Returning to the sofa, Yuuko spoke with a hint of delight, “My mom always drinks wine like this.”</p>



<p>I quietly let my cheeks relax. “It’s nice and calming.”</p>



<p>Uchi followed up, “Your home has such a cozy atmosphere at night, Yuuko-chan.”</p>



<p>We secretly imitated adults, grasping the stems of our wine glasses. It was still too early for the ten-year promise we made during our trip, but we felt it was okay to be a little childish like this.</p>



<p>The act of playing pretend with Welch’s in wine glasses felt surprisingly sophisticated tonight.</p>



<p>Coughing lightly, Yuuko cheerfully said, “Yo-ho!”</p>



<p>“Yo-ho!”</p>



<p><em>──Cling.</em></p>



<p>The glasses lightly touched, producing a delicate sound.</p>



<p>Attempting to be sophisticated, I moistened my lips, but it naturally lacked the bitterness and acidity. It was a sweetness befitting our seventeen-year-old selves.</p>



<p>Yuuko suddenly got up and operated the stereo. Soft notes of a gentle folk guitar and harmonica began to play, carrying a bittersweet, melancholic melody.</p>



<p>“What song is this?” I asked.</p>



<p>Yuuko turned around and replied, “I played it randomly, but it’s ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/UyuqQ200z2c">Itsunomanika Shōjo wa</a>‘ by Yosui Inoue. Sorry, was it a bit gloomy?”</p>



<p>“No, I want to listen to it.”</p>



<p>As I listened attentively to the lyrics, a sense of sentimentality washed over me.</p>



<p>Yuuko, Uchi, Haru, and Nishino-senpai. Sometimes, when I saw the girls around me gradually growing more mature with each passing season, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of unease.</p>



<p>Was I the only one left behind in May, unable to take a single step forward?</p>



<p>Was I just continuing as Nanase Yuzuki, slowly and sluggishly, without fully becoming a child or an adult?</p>



<p>I didn’t know if that was right or wrong; it’s something I couldn’t quite grasp in my current state.</p>



<p>When I glanced at the face of the girl sitting nearby, it was as if I had inadvertently forgotten to lock the door to my heart, and words I shouldn’t have spoken slipped out.</p>



<p>“Hey, Uchi, have you been cooking at his place recently?”</p>



<p>Uchi tilted her head in confusion. “Um, you mean at Saku-kun’s house? The last time we went grocery shopping was at the end of summer vacation, so it was then.”</p>



<p>Even though I knew the answer without needing to ask, I knew that confirming it would only deepen the wound.</p>



<p>As expected, I was deeply hurt. How foolish of me.</p>



<p><em>“──Ah.”</em></p>



<p>The image of Chitose’s face came to mind, a mixture of agitation, guilt, and sorrow eventually turning into a sense of apology. I could imagine the continuation of the words he had chosen not to express.</p>



<p><em>“That chair belongs to Yua.”</em></p>



<p>I pretended not to notice and quickly turned my back, unsure of what expression I might be wearing.</p>



<p>Unlike me, who had eagerly prepared my own towel and indulged in childish nesting, Uchi was not the type of girl to do such things.</p>



<p>If that’s the case, then──</p>



<p>That was the special place he designated just for her.</p>



<p>For a moment, it felt as though I had been brutally confronted with the truth.</p>



<p>I had deluded myself into thinking that I had closed the distance a little by volunteering as vice-captain, but now I heard the sound of the ladder being pulled away beneath my feet.</p>



<p>In retrospect, there could be various reasons.</p>



<p>For instance, since Uchi cooked there regularly, it would be natural to have a chair available. Or maybe it was a gesture of gratitude for her role in connecting him with Yuuko. In reality, it might be something along those lines.</p>



<p>But still, I lightly bit my lip. If that was what Chitose truly felt inside…</p>



<p>Me, who was just intruding, and her, who was willingly accepted. It made me want to cry, just a little.</p>



<p>“Yuzuki-chan…?”</p>



<p>Finally, with Uchi’s voice tinged with concern, I snapped back to reality.</p>



<p>I hurriedly tried to cover it up with a chuckle. “Sorry, sorry. I was just reminiscing about how delicious the pasta and curry were and accidentally asked something weird.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see,” Uchi’s face relaxed with relief. “Um, actually, there’s something I wanted to ask you too…”</p>



<p>For some reason, she suddenly became fidgety and looked down.</p>



<p>Perplexed by her behavior, I tilted my head. “Of course, what is it?”</p>



<p>It was rare for Uchi to show this kind of attitude towards me. Could it be that there were difficult parts in the cheerleading routine that troubled her?</p>



<p>“Well…” Uchi raised her face as if she had made up her mind. She hesitated, moving her lips awkwardly and interlocking her hands on her thigh repeatedly. Then, in a barely audible voice, she muttered. “Could you teach me how to make your katsudon, Yuzuki-chan?”</p>



<p>“……..”</p>



<p>For a moment, I didn’t understand what she was saying. There was a brief silence before I finally grasped the situation.</p>



<p>“──Pfft!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t hold back and burst into laughter.</p>



<p>“Don’t laugh!”</p>



<p>Uchi blushed, looking embarrassed. Though I felt sorry for her, the amusement overwhelmed me and I couldn’t stop.</p>



<p>I thought she was going to say something serious, but it turned out to be about how to make katsudon. And it was Uchi, of all people, asking me.</p>



<p>Once the laughter subsided, I wiped away tears dramatically.</p>



<p>Uchi, who had been watching, pursed her lips and muttered in a sulky tone. “I debated for a long time whether to bring it up, and this is how you react.”</p>



<p>Trying to suppress another bout of laughter, I apologized. “Sorry, sorry. It was just so unexpected. But why all of a sudden?”</p>



<p>Uchi scratched her cheek bashfully. “Yuzuki-chan, you made katsudon for Saku-kun, right? He praised it a lot, saying it was really delicious, and it made me feel a bit hesitant to make it myself… But since Saku-kun likes katsudon, I didn’t want to keep it that way forever.”</p>



<p>Pausing for a moment, she hurriedly waved her hands and continued. “Of course, if you don’t want to, that’s totally fine! In that case, if Saku-kun wants to eat it, he can just ask you to make it for him.”</p>



<p>I understood the reason for her hesitation. That recipe was something I had carefully thought of while thinking about Chitose.</p>



<p>Trying to suppress the rising impulse, I clenched both of my fists tightly. But even so, I couldn’t hold back any longer.</p>



<p>“Uchi!”</p>



<p>I hugged her tightly.</p>



<p>“Eh, uh…?”</p>



<p>“What’s with that adorable reaction? Are you trying to be a perfect Yamato Nadeshiko?”</p>



<p>“Hey, Yuzuki-chan, you’re too close.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, you smell nice.”</p>



<p>“Don’t sniff my neck!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/168078.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>After playfully teasing her for a while, I finally let go of her and opened my mouth.</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s fine. Besides, Uchi, you’ve taught me so many cooking tips and secret ingredients. If I refuse now, wouldn’t that make me a bad person?”</p>



<p>Uchi’s eyes softened with relief. “Really? Thank you, Yuzuki-chan.”</p>



<p>She said that while awkwardly scratching her cheek. “Although I can’t guarantee the result, I actually thought about coming up with a delicious katsudon recipe myself. But it feels like I’m deliberately trampling on your precious memories.”</p>



<p>“Uchi…”</p>



<p>“So, I thought it would be best to learn your recipe, Yuzuki-chan. That way, Saku-kun can remember it every time he eats it.”</p>



<p>My heart warmed at her consideration. Truly, she was an incredible person.</p>



<p>How kind-hearted could she be?</p>



<p>She might be modest, but I think Uchi could easily make a katsudon that’s even more delicious than mine if she wanted to. But if she did that, Chitose would inevitably compare it to mine in his mind.</p>



<p>Uchi, for my sake and surely for Chitose’s sake as well, humbled herself to seek the most peaceful resolution.</p>



<p>I felt pathetic for having been jealous just a moment ago. It was only natural that Chitose would want to give her a chair.</p>



<p>I sighed deeply in my heart. <em>I’ve lost today.</em></p>



<p>Feeling refreshed, I let out a hearty laugh. “I’ll send you the recipes when I get home!”</p>



<p>“Thanks!”</p>



<p>Certainly, that recipe was something I had thought of with Chitose in mind, going through various trials and errors to complete it. But if this kind girl was willing to carry on our memories, there could be no greater joy.</p>



<p>And besides…</p>



<p>Just hearing the words Chitose had conveyed to Uchi already made me satisfied.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>34</strong></p>


<p>After chatting for a while, a thought crossed my mind and I spoke up.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, Yuuko. What were you talking about with Kureha after the pair dance?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Um…”</p>



<p>It didn’t seem like a particularly memorable conversation for her. She placed a finger on her chin and furrowed her brows, trying to remember.</p>



<p>Then, she suddenly slapped her knee. “Oh right, I told her to take care of Saku for me!”</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>Her unexpected words left me slightly puzzled. It was Yuuko we were talking about. I thought she would at least make a playful joke like, “I’m Saku’s official wife, you know!” or something like that.</p>



<p>Yuuko continued in a nonchalant tone. “Well, Saku is the captain of the cheering squad, and if he pairs up with a kouhai, he might end up overexerting himself again. Since Kureha is a reliable girl, I asked her to look after him!”</p>



<p>A sharp pain pierced my chest. Suddenly, I felt the loneliness of being left behind, and once again, I blurted out something unnecessary.</p>



<p>“Um, can I ask you something a bit sensitive?”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>“Weren’t you hurt watching Saku and Kureha dance together?”</p>



<p>Yuuko tilted her head in confusion. “Why would I be?”</p>



<p>“Why… well, because…”</p>



<p>I stumbled over my words unintentionally. Seeking solace, I glanced at Uchi, who for some reason, seemed slightly awkward, avoiding eye contact.</p>



<p>Yuuko continued in her usual natural tone. “It’s no surprise that a cute and talented kouhai is already looking up to him. Their pair dance was flawless, both of them looked so beautiful, and I couldn’t help but be captivated.”</p>



<p>She paused for a moment, then narrowed her eyes with a tender expression.</p>



<p>“It makes me want to dance with Saku like that.”</p>



<p>A pure smile lit up her face.</p>



<p>“──!!!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but hold my breath.</p>



<p>That’s right, I should have remembered, especially after feeling it so strongly.</p>



<p>Yuuko was no longer the carefree girl I once knew. Over the course of one summer, she surpassed me, leaving me behind and quietly became an adult.</p>



<p>She, who could openly express her feelings for Chitose without any pretense, was incredibly beautiful to the point where I wanted to avert my eyes.</p>



<p>And compared to me…</p>



<p>In that moment, even if it was just for an instant, I unintentionally thought,</p>



<p><em>“I should have never given in.”</em></p>



<p>Instead of acting like a senpai and allowing a kouhai to shine, I should have said, <em>“It’d be strange for the cheering captain and vice-captain not to be paired.”</em></p>



<p>But I ended up being Nanase Yuzuki once again, without learning my lesson.</p>



<p><em>“I want to be the kind of girl who can tell Saku that he’s cool.”</em></p>



<p>The conversation I had with Yuuko that night came flooding back to me.</p>



<p>I see, that’s the path you’re taking.</p>



<p>Then, what about me…?</p>



<p>No matter how many times I had resolved myself, when it was shown to me so vividly, I still wavered. As long as Nanase Yuzuki remained as Nanase Yuzuki, I would continue to repeat the same regrets.</p>



<p><em>“I should have taken his lips instead of his cheek.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I shouldn’t have sent him to Nishino-senpai and Haru.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I should have confessed my feelings when I was sneaking out while Uchi and Haru were inside the room.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I should have boldly declared my love for Chitose when Yuuko asked.”</em></p>



<p>Certainly, there were choices that would seem right to everyone, even to the point of exasperation, and choices that Nanase Yuzuki herself would believe to be beautiful.</p>



<p>However, those choices might not have been right and beautiful for me.</p>



<p>For example, like Uchi. To take a step back and support his happiness with unwavering love.</p>



<p>Or like Yuuko. To gaze straight at him and unconditionally love him.</p>



<p>But Nanase Yuzuki… simply, relentlessly….</p>



<p>She wouldn’t throw everything away to fulfill her love.</p>



<p>I never thought I would be crushed twice in one night.</p>



<p>My precious friends.</p>



<p>My formidable love rivals.</p>



<p>Even though I know I couldn’t become someone else, I still yearned for it. </p>



<p>Because as long as I was Nanase Yuzuki, you could only be Chitose Saku.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>35</strong></p>


<p>I, Uchida Yua, quietly felt a sense of shame as I listened to their conversation.</p>



<p>Yuzuki-chan’s words resurfaced in my mind.</p>



<p><em>“Didn’t it hurt to watch Saku and Kureha dancing together?”</em></p>



<p>Well, Yuuko-chan, I must admit, it did sting a little for me.</p>



<p>Perhaps since that night, or maybe even since that homeroom class, I had been avoiding acknowledging my feelings for Saku-kun.</p>



<p>It was terrifying to admit that it was love, so I had been deceiving myself with various words, saying he was someone precious to me, like another family member, someone I wanted to support by his side.</p>



<p><em>“─Can I be a little more selfish from now on?”</em></p>



<p>I spoke those words that day because I had a premonition.</p>



<p>Once I realized that I liked you as a boy,</p>



<p>Once I wished to be special to you as a girl,</p>



<p>──I would surely become selfish.</p>



<p>For example, I might feel jealous of Yuuko-chan, who was naturally by your side.</p>



<p>Or I might dislike the idea of Yuzuki-chan coming in and out of your house.</p>



<p>Or I might find it unfair to see you practicing with Haru-chan.</p>



<p>Or I might hope that you wouldn’t show an innocent expression in front of Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>But strangely, such dark feelings didn’t arise towards anyone.</p>



<p>Of course, I sometimes felt loneliness and sorrow regarding your relationship with other girls, but at least it was not directed as a negative emotion towards someone in particular.</p>



<p>I believe I found solace in that aspect of myself.</p>



<p>Perhaps the reassurance I felt from you giving me the chair played a significant role as well</p>



<p>However, earlier, while watching the two of you dance… No, more precisely, when I remembered that I let Kureha-chan take over making Saku-kun’s outfit,</p>



<p>──It felt like my place was being taken away.</p>



<p>Indeed, I regretted it.</p>



<p>Kureha-chan was considerate of me, yet I was the one who made the request.</p>



<p>Surely…</p>



<p>I had assumed that it was natural for me to make Saku-kun’s costume, and I had unconsciously imagined myself sitting in that chair, working on it. That’s why the anxiety suddenly welled up when I handed that role over to another girl.</p>



<p>When I recalled Kureha-chan’s innocent face as she sincerely complimented my cooking, I genuinely felt sorry from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>I fully understood that Saku-kun cherished her as his kouhai, and I was certain everyone felt the same, including myself.</p>



<p>However, just like Yuuko-chan, Yuzuki-chan, Haru-chan, and Nishino-senpai held their own special place in your heart────</p>



<p>At the very least, I wanted my place to be my place alone.</p>



<p><em>What a nasty girl I am now.</em></p>



<p>It seemed I couldn’t become as strong as Yuuko-chan, no matter how much I tried. I had decided to be a little more selfish, but this was not the kind of selfishness I had in mind.</p>



<p>As I pondered such things,</p>



<p>“Thank you for the bath.”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai returned to the living room.</p>



<p>She wore a smooth satin pajama set. It somewhat resembles mine, but hers was a simple design without patterns, with long sleeves and long pants. Despite the minimal exposure, an air of maturity emanated from her.</p>



<p>She remained strikingly beautiful, to the point where I couldn’t help but feel self-conscious.</p>



<p>Clad in my short-sleeved shorts pajamas with a star pattern, and even a matching headband like Yuuko-chan’s, I suddenly felt oddly childish.</p>



<p>“Uchida-san, mind if I sit next to you?”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai approached and gracefully narrowed her eyes.</p>



<p>Caught off guard, I hurriedly responded. “Yes, of course.”</p>



<p>As Nishino-senpai took a seat, a lavender-like fragrance lightly permeated the air. It was different from the shampoo and conditioner I borrowed from Yuuko-chan, so it might be perfume or body cream.</p>



<p>Sitting next to Nishino-senpai, I felt a slight discomfort as if I was intruding on Saku-kun’s usual spot.</p>



<p>I first caught sight of them around the end of September last year. At that time, I wasn’t close to everyone as I am now.</p>



<p>It was when Saku-kun, who had been fighting so desperately in the corner of the baseball field, quit the team and stopped approaching me completely.</p>



<p>During the first semester, I had treated him coldly, yet I found his absence oddly lonely and worrisome. But I knew there was nothing I could do, so I pretended not to dwell on those unresolved emotions and went on with my days.</p>



<p>Then, one day, I saw Nishino-senpai and Saku-kun sitting side by side on the riverbank.</p>



<p>You had an expression of complete ease, dependence, and even vulnerability. I remember laughing self-deprecatingly, imagining what it would be like if I were the one sitting there.</p>



<p>And thus began this past year since that night when you noticed me.</p>



<p>I averted my gaze countless times as Saku-kun and Nishino-senpai sat together and talked. </p>



<p>Because their relationship seemed like an ordinary presence I had envisioned.</p>



<p>Of course, I believe what Saku-kun felt towards her was more akin to admiration. But you, whenever something made you happy or sad, whenever you were in pain or lost, or even just when you simply wanted to talk to someone, you always seemed to search for Nishino-senpai’s figure first.</p>



<p>Like a child rushing to their mother in the kitchen when they come home for dinner.</p>



<p>Back then, I must have wanted to become that kind of family-like presence for you.</p>



<p>I recall the day when you introduced me to Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>It must have been during the deepening autumn. When my club activities were suspended, the two of us were walking home together.</p>



<p>Casually conversing, we strolled along the riverbank when I caught sight of Nishino-senpai reading a paperback book near the floodgate.</p>



<p>Almost simultaneously, or perhaps a bit earlier than me, I think Saku-kun noticed her too.</p>



<p>For some reason, an abrupt desire surged within me, urging him not to go. Before I could find the right words to hold him back, I blurted out,</p>



<p><em>“Hey, Saku-kun! By the way…”</em></p>



<p>However, the words imploring him to look at me were left trailing in the wind.</p>



<p>──Ah.</p>



<p>In an instant, Saku-kun dashed away, leaving me standing alone and watching his receding figure.</p>



<p>Eventually, Saku-kun returned, leading Nishino-senpai by the hand, and spoke innocently,</p>



<p><em>“I’ll introduce you, Yua. This is Nishino Asuka-senpai, a third-year. She’s often here talking to me.”</em></p>



<p>I was sure that there was no ill intent. You were merely introducing me to the senpai you admired, thinking it would be a nice gesture.</p>



<p><em>“Asu-nee, this is Uchida Yua. We’re in the same class and get along well. She takes care of me a lot and helps me with various things.”</em></p>



<p>I see, that’s how you saw me. Just a girl you get along with in the same class. Just someone who’s helpful to you.</p>



<p>…I knew I was being petty. Saku-kun merely introduced us equally.</p>



<p>But back then, I think I was overflowing with feelings I had never experienced before. I wanted to know you more, to be acknowledged by you.</p>



<p>Even if you didn’t see me as a girl, I just wanted you to allow me to stand by your side.</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai spoke gracefully.</p>



<p><em>“Nice to meet you, I’m Nishino Asuka. He often shares stories about you — how polite and dependable you are, Uchida-san.”</em></p>



<p>Her tone exuded an air of maturity, and I struggled to reply while suppressing my agitation.</p>



<p><em>“Nice to meet you, I’m Uchida Yua. Um, Saku-kun and I have somewhat similar circumstances, so we occasionally go shopping for daily necessities together and I cook meals at his place sometimes…”</em></p>



<p>How pathetic of me, I thought. Nishino-senpai was trying to be considerate of me, yet I was weaving words for my sake.</p>



<p><em>“I’m not just a classmate to Saku-kun,”</em> I wanted to say, as if justifying myself.</p>



<p>With a beautiful smile, Nishino-senpai softly replied,</p>



<p><em>“It’s like having another family member, what a wonderful and mysterious bond you have there.”</em></p>



<p>She handed me the words I longed to hear. With just that, everything was conveyed.</p>



<p>The reason why Saku-kun sought Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>The process where he slowly regained himself when he was feeling down. I was sure it was like this, gently patching up his wounds here, one band-aid at a time.</p>



<p>Returning to the present, I stole a glance at the person sitting beside me. Though I must have been lost in my thoughts for a while, she hadn’t particularly urged the conversation, merely gazing quietly outside as if she was listening attentively to this night.</p>



<p>Then, I mused to myself.</p>



<p>Saku-kun was always right by her side like this. Did he envision the beauty of her profile with its teardrop mole and the comforting scent that seemed to stop time somewhere in his heart?</p>



<p>Suddenly, Nishino-senpai looked my way. Perhaps because I had been so entranced, our eyes met in an instant.</p>



<p>Before I could even offer a shy childish smile, Nishino-senpai gently smiled back.</p>



<p>“Can I talk to you?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” I replied, turning my body slightly toward her. “I’m sorry, I was captivated.”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai chuckled. “I feel embarassed when you confess it so honestly.”</p>



<p>I lowered my gaze in embarrassment. “Your profile is just so beautiful…”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai gazed at me intently. “Your hair is lovely too, may I touch it?”</p>



<p>“Um, sure.”</p>



<p>Her fingers, smooth and polished like porcelain, gently combed through my hair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/168079.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Amidst her gentle touch and Nishino-senpai’s face now closer than before, I found myself a little flustered. It’s like a small child getting their head patted affectionately.</p>



<p>The lavender scent wafting from her neckline filled the air, making me a bit dizzy. Nishino-senpai’s fingers softly brushed against my earlobe.</p>



<p>“Mm…”</p>



<p>An unintended strange sound escaped my lips, and she quickly withdrew her hand.</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry. I got carried away with the petting,” she said, flustered in a way that wasn’t quite like her.</p>



<p>Trying to hide my own embarrassment, I chuckled softly. “No, no need to apologize. It just tickled a bit.”</p>



<p>Waving my hand to put her at ease, I felt relief washed over me as she relaxed her cheeks.</p>



<p>As Nishino-senpai toyed with the tips of her own hair, she continued. “Maybe I’ll grow it long again someday.”</p>



<p>“Was it long before?” I inquired, and she narrowed her eyes in a nostalgic manner.</p>



<p>“Yes, back when I was a kid.”</p>



<p>Her current short haircut was still mysteriously mature and enchanting, but I could imagine that long-haired Nishino-senpai must have been like a beautiful girl stepping out of a fairytale.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I found myself asking, “Why did you cut your hair?”</p>



<p>Without any hesitation, Nishino-senpai answered. “Do you know my relationship with Saku-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yes, you two were childhood friends, right?”</p>



<p>“If spending seven days together during summer vacation can count as childhood friends.”</p>



<p>Her choice of words reminded me of Saku-kun. I might not be as quick-witted with my responses, but I realized that they must have built up their relationship with such novel-like conversations. It was a bittersweet feeling.</p>



<p>“I used to call him ‘Saku-nii.’ He was the kind of boy who, when I wore my favorite all-white dress, would tell me to prepare a T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops for next year.”</p>



<p>I could easily picture that scene, and I couldn’t help but giggle.</p>



<p>“So, he had that side too even back then.”</p>



<p>With a soft smile, Nishino-senpai continued. “That’s why I thought it would be better to have this hairstyle if I were to walk beside Saku-nii. I cut my hair at the end of that summer.”</p>



<p>It reminded me of Yuuko-chan now, I think.</p>



<p>To let these two beautiful girls cut their hair like this, he really was something, wasn’t he?</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai smiled shyly. “In the end, after that summer vacation, we couldn’t meet anymore.”</p>



<p>I believe that was the moment when Nishino-senpai became just a little more mature.</p>



<p>“I think I’ll cut my hair too,” I murmured unintentionally.</p>



<p>Perhaps doing so could free me from these lingering feelings of uncertainty.</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai tilted her head curiously. “Uchida-san, your hair was shorter when we first met, wasn’t it?”</p>



<p>The memory of the childish self-introduction I recalled earlier made me a bit embarrassed. I averted my gaze as I replied. “Yes, I had just started growing it out back then.”</p>



<p>“In that case…”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai gently ran her fingers through my hair once more. Her voice was reminiscent of writing a letter in the dead of night.</p>



<p>“Prayers, wishes, yearnings, or perhaps someone’s gaze. You put something beautiful like that into combing your hair, right?”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>Smoothly flowing my hair through her fingers, she continued. “Girls change their hairstyles for those reasons, right?”</p>



<p>She narrowed her eyes with a tender look.</p>



<p>I see.</p>



<p>Both Yuuko-chan and the young Nishino-senpai cut their hair not to cast something away but to embrace positive and beautiful feelings. Just like I started growing it out a year ago with a wish in mind.</p>



<p>I softly combed through my now much longer hair with my fingers, making a resolve to treasure it.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Nishino-senpai.”</p>



<p><em>I’m sorry, Saku-kun. </em>I smiled wryly while thinking that.</p>



<p>Tonight, just for a little longer, I would intrude upon this comfortable place where you were.</p>



<p>“No,” Nishino-senpai shook her head briefly. “I should be the one thanking you.”</p>



<p>Now it was my turn to tilt my head in confusion. “Thanking me..?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>As she spoke, Nishino-senpai glanced around the living room. Without my noticing, Yuuko-chan and Yuzuki-chan had moved to the wooden deck, where they seemed to be watching Yamazaki-kun’s practice.</p>



<p>Confirming this, Nishino-senpai opened her mouth. “The first thing I want to thank you for is about the festival.”</p>



<p>“Ahh…!”</p>



<p>Finally, the story started to become clear.</p>



<p>The night before the festival, when I had decided to talk things through with Saku-kun and Yuuko-chan, I dialed Nishino-senpai’s number after obtaining her contact information from a senior in the band club.</p>



<p>I wanted everyone to reconcile properly and come back together. I felt that Saku-kun might feel a little lonely if Nishino-senpai wasn’t there, and that she herself would probably want to be there as well.</p>



<p><em>“Do you think it’s alright for you to go this far for Saku-kun, to do all this for him?”</em></p>



<p><em>“…I’m doing this for myself.”</em></p>



<p>I recalled the exchange we had over the phone.</p>



<p>My lips naturally formed a soft smile. That decision was not a mistake; I was now sure of that. If I had avoided contacting her for my own sake, I might not have been able to discover your feelings.</p>



<p>And perhaps, I would never have experienced this magical night of conversation with Nishino-senpai.</p>



<p>I chuckled softly in response. “It’s fine. You treated me to a Blue Hawaii shaved ice after all.”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai’s eyes widened slightly, and she said with a hint of understanding. “You’re not only kind but also strong, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>Continuing with a somewhat melancholic smile, she added. “If you hadn’t invited me, I think I would still have been wandering alone in that summer. And I probably wouldn’t have been able to decide to join the cheering squad either…”</p>



<p>Then, my eyes drooped slightly as I spoke. “I’m glad I invited you. Let’s do our best together again tomorrow!”</p>



<p>“Yeah! Both you and I still have a long way to go,” she replied, and we exchanged amused glances.</p>



<p>After sharing a good laugh, Nishino-senpai spoke in a gentle tone. “There’s one more thing. I know it’s not my place to tell you this, but I hope you’ll listen to it as words without ulterior motives.”</p>



<p>“Yes…?” I replied, not having any inkling of what she was about to say, silently waiting for her to continue.</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai gently closed her eyes and said, “Thank you for being by his side that night.”</p>



<p>She uttered the words as if tracing the past summer.</p>



<p>I could tell which night she was referring to. It was the night when everything abruptly changed, a night with no visible moon.</p>



<p>Ah, I see.</p>



<p>She cherished this September we arrived at after leaving behind that August, just like I did.</p>



<p>I dug up the clumsy truth from deep within my heart.</p>



<p>“I’ve always envied you, Nishino-senpai. That special place in the riverside where you two would spend time together…”</p>



<p>“Eh…?” Nishino-senpai looked surprised as she turned her gaze toward me.</p>



<p>I felt embarrassed and looked down, gently stroking the sofa. “It’s because Saku-kun always wanted to sit there, right next to you.”</p>



<p>A gentle smile spread across Nishino-senpai’s cheeks. “You say such funny things. Whether it’s on your way to school, on the way back, on days off, or even after going home, you’ve always been right there beside him, right?”</p>



<p>I scratched my cheek, feeling a bit flustered. “It’s just… it happened that way, I kind of invited myself…”</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai spoke with a slightly teasing tone. “Do you know? Except for Nozomi-san, I’m the only one who has never been inside Saku-kun’s home.”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>“That’s why that riverside became our special place. It was the only place where I belonged.”</p>



<p>Ah, I see.</p>



<p>I was taken aback by her revelation. She had been carrying such loneliness all this time.</p>



<p>“I was envious of you, Uchida-san, who could naturally be by his side, supporting him day by day.”</p>



<p>I think everyone could relate to wanting something they didn’t have. What might be a small, familiar ticket to oneself could be an irreplaceable key to a special place for someone else.</p>



<p>That’s probably why we tried to treasure the present so that we wouldn’t lose our own places.</p>



<p>With a calm heart, I opened my mouth. “May I also convey my gratitude?”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>I gently clasped my hands on my lap. “Thank you for being by Saku-kun’s side that autumn.”</p>



<p>I said it as if reminiscing about a distant season.</p>



<p>Nishino-senpai seemed to want to say something but restrained herself and then burst into laughter.</p>



<p>She chuckled while shaking her shoulders, and finally said, “Maybe we’re more alike than we thought.”</p>



<p>“I was actually thinking the same thing.”</p>



<p>“If we were in the same grade, do you think we could have become friends?”</p>



<p>“Even if we were in different grades, I believe we still could have been friends.”</p>



<p>“Will you teach me how to cook?”</p>



<p>“Yes, and in return, would you recommend me some good novels?”</p>



<p>“Why didn’t you ask Saku-kun, Yua-san?”</p>



<p>“How about learning to cook from Saku-kun, Asuka-senpai?”</p>



<p>We exchanged unfamiliar names and laughed together. It felt like we were sending bubbles from the depths of the sea towards the starry sky.</p>



<p>Last year’s autumn connected to this year’s summer, and gently, we turned the pages towards the next season.</p>



<p>In the future, I wonder if I ever look back on this night. The moment when Nishino-senpai became Asuka-senpai.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>36</strong></p>


<p>As I, Chitose Saku, returned home from Hachiban, I stepped into the living room to find Yuuko, Yua, Nanase, Asu-nee, and Kenta engrossed in a lively conversation on the sofa.</p>



<p>The girls were all dressed in casual and innocent-looking pajamas, which made Kaito, Kazuki, and I involuntarily avert our eyes. Yua had let her hair down from its usual tied-up style, and Kenta, amidst the group of girls, seemed remarkably manly as he confidently joined the group.</p>



<p>Kureha, the last of the girls, swiftly excused herself to take a bath.</p>



<p>“Senpai, who’s next?”</p>



<p>Before we knew it, she was back in no time.</p>



<p>Impressed, I couldn’t help but exclaim, “Wow, that was faster than Haru.”</p>



<p>“Yes! I don’t want to waste even a bit of moment with everyone!”</p>



<p>“That’s a commendable attitude.”</p>



<p>“By the way, I’ve already unplugged the bathtub, and just to be safe from any hazardous scenarios, I’ve blown out the scented candles.”</p>



<p>“””Good job!”””</p>



<p>Afterward, the four of us remaining guys played rock-paper-scissors, and in the end, it was decided that Kenta, Kaito, Kazuki and I would take a shower in that order.</p>



<p>When I emerged from the shower, it was already late enough to call it midnight. Considering tomorrow’s practice, it would be wise to call it a night. However, as I looked at everyone’s faces, it seemed like no one was willing to end the chat, as if trying to extend this night somehow, reluctant to let go.</p>



<p>Yuuko murmured. “I don’t want to sleep just yet.”</p>



<p>Nanase chuckled. “I know, it’s one of those nights.”</p>



<p>Haru followed, half-smiling. “Should we just stay up till morning?”</p>



<p>Yua showed a serene expression. “It’s been a long day.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee squinted playfully. “Indeed.”</p>



<p>And so, the four of us guys shared a sentimental, ambiguous smile with each other. Although someone had to suggest going to sleep, none of us wanted to be the party pooper, not even a crew of pirates like us.</p>



<p>It was almost as if everyone believed that unless we fell asleep, the night would never come to an end. As if we were all yearning to float on this sea together forever.</p>



<p>A tranquil silence permeated the room, lingering like a drowsy pause, as though it embodied our very selves at this moment — satisfied but unwilling.</p>



<p>But then, a dependable kouhai girl came to our rescue.</p>



<p>“Then, why don’t we all sleep together?”</p>



<p>We looked at each other in surprise. Kureha continued with an innocent look. “We can just lay out the futons here!”</p>



<p>Originally, the guys were planning to crash in the living room. I heard that the girls had set up their futons in Yuuko’s room, so it wouldn’t be much trouble to move those over here, a simple task, really.</p>



<p>However, I glanced at Nanase and hesitated.</p>



<p>“That’s…” I started.</p>



<p>Nanase wore a wry smile in response. “Well…”</p>



<p>“Um… What’s the matter?” asked Kureha casually. “It’s just a matter of whether you’re sitting here or lying down in a futon, right?”</p>



<p>Nanase opened her mouth with exasperation. “You see, Kureha, the biggest difference is whether you’re awake or asleep.”</p>



<p>Kureha remained unfazed as she replied. “Then, are you suggesting that you’d be eaten if you slept in front of Senpai, Yuzuki-san?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Nanase turned her gaze towards me. After a moment, she narrowed her eyes and said with a playful grin. “Nah, I doubt he’s got that kind of guts.”</p>



<p>“Hey, why are you looking at me?”</p>



<p>Haru jumped in. “You’re the kind of guy who gets shy over a simple massage.”</p>



<p>“Wanna experience a full-force foot massage?”</p>



<p>Asu-nee chipped in with a nostalgic tone. “You’re such a coward, huh?”</p>



<p>“I have morals!”</p>



<p>Yua encouraged me with her words. “Don’t worry, Saku-kun is just kind-hearted.”</p>



<p>“Your comforting words only pierces my heart even more though!?”</p>



<p>Finally, Yuuko asked Kureha gently. “Are you really not worried at all?”</p>



<p>“No, not at all!”</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s have everyone sleep together!”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Watching their exchanges, I sighed in exasperation.</p>



<p>Of course, both Kazuki and I, along with Kaito and Kenta, weren’t the type to suddenly become reckless fools just because we slept in the same room. Everyone understood that.</p>



<p>If anyone should feel the most anxious, it should be the newcomer Kureha, but she seemed completely unfazed.</p>



<p>I glanced at the girls to seek their approval, and each of them nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“…Shall we move the futons, then?” I muttered under my breath.</p>



<p>As if they had been waiting for my signal, everyone immediately stood up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>37</strong></p>


<p>The girls worked together to bring out the futons from Yuuko’s room, while the boys carried them into the living room. We pushed the dining table to the side and lined up five futons on the floor.</p>



<p>Since Yuuko had initially intended to sleep in her own bed, we were one futon short. However, Yua offered to share hers.</p>



<p>As for the guys, we made do with blankets, setting up makeshift beds around the sofa. By propping up the low table against the wall, we created a clear division between us and the girls, making it feel like separate spaces.</p>



<p>When Yuuko returned to the living room, holding a stuffed Shiba Inu plushie, I couldn’t help but speak up.</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s Shibamaru.”</p>



<p>Her voice brightened as she replied. “Yep! I always keep it by my side when I sleep.”</p>



<p>My cheeks naturally softened into a smile.</p>



<p>Asu-nee, who happened to be nearby, tilted her head. “Shibamaru…?”</p>



<p>Yuuko hugged the Shiba Inu plush, adorned with a scarf or bandana around its neck, and smiled happily. “Yes! Saku won it for me at the arcade. I always keep it by my pillow; it helps me feel at ease.”</p>



<p>Seeing Yuuko bashfully scratched her cheek, Asu-nee seemed to briefly lower her gaze, for some reason.</p>



<p>Then, she raised her head, donning a gentle smile, and the two of them continued their conversation as they headed towards the futons.</p>



<p>Incidentally, feeling a bit awkward, none of the guys entered Yuuko’s room, nor did we peek inside.</p>



<p>Regardless of who the person might be, it wouldn’t be proper for us to barge in and invade their private space before someone special arrived someday.</p>



<p>As I pondered these thoughts, an unexpected pang of melancholy tugged at my heart.</p>



<p>When I tried to find an excuse to this unexpected surge of sentiment, the answer came effortlessly.</p>



<p><em>“Regardless of who the other person might be…”</em></p>



<p>Ah, I see.</p>



<p>I should throw away the clichéd phrase “Who am I to say?” into the trash bin. Repeating such shallow self-loathing would only be a childish way of escaping the truth.</p>



<p>I decided to confront my feelings honestly.</p>



<p>If I had accepted Yuuko’s feelings, maybe I would have stepped into that room as her special someone on a special day.</p>



<p>But it didn’t happen, couldn’t happen.</p>



<p>So one day, someone else might walk through that door, a special person whose face I didn’t even know</p>



<p>Her voice that I loved so much, her smile, heart, body, past, future, and all the love she had to offer ─ it might all be devoted to another man.</p>



<p>Just the thought alone suffocated me with an unbearable weight in my chest.</p>



<p>If this feeling couldn’t be called love, then what else was there to name it?</p>



<p>Even so, I bit my lip softly, careful not to let anyone notice.</p>



<p>Whether I tried to imagine Yua’s, Nanase’s, Haru’s, or Asu-nee’s “one day,” it hurts just as much, making me feel scared.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I raised my head.</p>



<p>Nanase and Kazuki were engrossed in a lively conversation. Unintentionally, the words casually spoken in the gymnasium resurface in my mind.</p>



<p><em>“Shouldn’t you be prepared to choose something and let go of something else someday?”</em></p>



<p>I didn’t want to admit it, but it was true.</p>



<p>Kazuki, what would you choose, and what would you let go? Or perhaps, have you already made a choice and let something go?</p>



<p>As my eyes met Nanase’s, she excused herself from the conversation and approached me.</p>



<p>Kazuki, with a gentle gaze, watched her back as she walked away.</p>



<p>Nanase spoke. “Chitose, what time are you getting up tomorrow?”</p>



<p>“It’s quite late now, so maybe around nine would be fine?”</p>



<p><em>I wonder, will there come a day when the false love will transform into a genuine one?</em></p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s all wake up at our own pace and do whatever we want.”</p>



<p>“You seem like the type who’d wake up at the same time every day even on occasions like this, Nanase.”</p>



<p><em>Will the day come when Nanase and Chitose return to being Yuzuki and Saku?</em></p>



<p>“Stop saying that; it’ll be embarrassing if I’m caught snoozing away.”</p>



<p>I wish September would never end.</p>



<p>I wish the trees never change colors.</p>



<p>I wish the first night could never bring the second morning.</p>



<p>A soft yawn resonated in the air, and someone else followed with a heavy rubbing of their drowsy eyelids, causing sleepiness to cascade like a chain reaction.</p>



<p>It was about time to bid everyone good night.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>38</strong></p>


<p>After taking turns brushing our teeth, we returned to the living room. The sight of scattered futons in the room resembled a night during a camp.</p>



<p>The girls eagerly crawled into their sleeping spots. After a game of rock-paper-scissors, Kazuki and Kenta settled on the sofa, while Kaito and I opted for the rug.</p>



<p>Resting our heads on cushions acting as makeshift pillows, we covered ourselves with blankets. Perhaps they were aired out during the day, as a warm and gentle scent of sunlight lingered.</p>



<p>Yuuko, who stood in the middle of the living room, spoke up. “By the way, are there any of you who can’t sleep with music on?”</p>



<p>Various responses like “Mm-mm,” “It’s fine,” or “I prefer it that way” were murmured in response.</p>



<p>“Alright, then I’ll set a timer,” she said as Haruka Yunokawa’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGAqMl5wElk">BLUE FRIDAY</a>” started playing from the speakers.</p>



<p>Then, like a midnight candle, Yuuko added, “I’ll leave only a small light on.”</p>



<p>There were moments when you truly felt like you were staying at someone else’s house. For example, the scent that greeted you at the entrance, the time dinner was served, the menu and dressings used for salad, the fragrance of shampoo and conditioner in the bath, the temperature of the air conditioning, and the music that softly drifted into your ears.</p>



<p>Or the lighting when it was time to sleep.</p>



<p>I usually prefer complete darkness, but some people felt uneasy unless there’s at least a nightlight on, like a soft bulb.</p>



<p>──Perhaps because it made them feel less alone when they woke up in the middle of the night.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure how Yuuko usually was in this regard.</p>



<p>It could simply be consideration for someone staying in an unfamiliar house, or she might always sleep with a small light on.</p>



<p>Either way, I think it’s not a bad idea. It’s like a lighthouse guiding us through the midnight darkness.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kaito, who was lying a bit away, whispered in a voice too soft for the girls to hear. “Hey, Saku.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Yuuko is cute, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“…I agree.”</p>



<p>He didn’t say anything more.</p>



<p>Kaito rolled over and turned his back.</p>



<p>With my hands interlocked behind my head, I gaze absentmindedly at the ceiling.</p>



<p>Even though we were all in the same room, I couldn’t see the expressions of Yuuko, Yua, Nanase, Haru, Asu-nee, Kazuki, Kaito, Kenta, or Kureha. They might have already closed their eyes, lost in thoughts about a certain boy or a girl, or perhaps immersed in their own emotions.</p>



<p>Occasional faint sighs and rustles of clothing filled the room, creating an oddly restless yet warm ambiance.</p>



<p>“Hey, Saku, are you awake?”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, Yuuko called my name. It made me feel strangely flustered, and I responded with my usual playful remark.</p>



<p>“I’m already asleep.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, you’re so silly. Saku is here.”</p>



<p>“Well, obviously.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right here.”</p>



<p>The familiar Yuuko and the unfamiliar Yuuko, like switching between yesterday and today, coming and going.</p>



<p>An exasperated Nanase spoke up. “Enough flirting.”</p>



<p>Kazuki let out a deliberate sigh. “The kiddos should be fast asleep by now.”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Kenta followed. “Get lost in your nightmares.”</p>



<p>While still facing away, Kaito mumbled softly. “Count me in.”</p>



<p>Yua chuckled with a troubled smile. “Yuuko-chan, you’re too close.”</p>



<p>Haru sounded somewhat delighted. “Ah, come on, you guys are so noisy, I can’t sleep.”</p>



<p>A chuckle echoed, this time from Asu-nee. “It seems everyone still wants to bask in the afterglow of this gathering.”</p>



<p>Kureha spun with an amused tone. “Nothing has truly ended yet; it’s all starting from here.”</p>



<p>The night chuckled softly, like a cradle rocking gently.</p>



<p>In a drowsy haze, I hummed softly.</p>



<p>On a night like this, anyone would want to keep their eyes open until they were the last one awake. There was a desire to hear every tiny word spoken, to savor every lingering blink, every hushed conversation that spills like sweetness, or even every gentle turn in bed.</p>



<p>For fear of regretting the tiniest detail missed.</p>



<p>Yet, the more I resisted, the more my vision blurred like ripples on water.</p>



<p><em>Tick, tock, tick, tock.</em></p>



<p>The ticking of the second hand resonated loudly, its rhythmic beat lulling me into slumber.</p>



<p>Gradually, in place of a goodnight, a gentle sigh slipped out from someone. One by one, they piled on, like a soft lullaby.</p>



<p><em>Hhh, hhh, hhh, hhh.</em></p>



<p>Gradually, my eyelids became heavier. At the edge of my consciousness, as it slipped through my grasp, I pondered.</p>



<p>Why couldn’t we stay like this forever?</p>



<p>Forgetting about being boys or girls, lying side by side with pillows in the same room.</p>



<p>Someone picking up where someone else’s dream left off, so we could all dream the same dream.</p>



<p>Counting sheep together, one, two, three.</p>



<p>Just drifting, forever, through this night.</p>



<p>──How I wish we could stay drowning in this beautiful blue at the age of seventeen.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>39</strong></p>


<p>After waiting for Kureha to return, we left the house, being careful not to wake anyone up.</p>



<p>Though the night seemed to be gradually fading, it was still dark outside. The stars flickered in the sky, like tiny beacons of light.</p>



<p>The temperature wasn’t bone-chilling in our T-shirts and shorts, but the air felt cooler than I had anticipated at this hour. Kureha, beside me, still wore her short pleated skirt, but she had donned an oversized Adidas nylon jacket on top.</p>



<p>Outside the house, we stretched our backs and took in a deep breath, filling our lungs with the pre-dawn air. It was crisp and pure, untainted by anything else.</p>



<p>Not a soul could be seen around us. Only the faint sounds of newspapers being delivered punctuated the silence, hinting at the imminent dawn not too far away.</p>



<p>Though I didn’t intend to do it every day, waking up early felt strangely refreshing.</p>



<p>As we started walking aimlessly together,</p>



<p>“Senpai, could we make a quick stop at the park where we practiced yesterday?”</p>



<p>Kureha spoke as she walked alongside me.</p>



<p>“Sure, no problem.”</p>



<p>We didn’t have a specific destination in mind anyway.</p>



<p>I bought canned coffee from a nearby vending machine and entered the park. As if she had been waiting for this, she opened her mouth with delight.</p>



<p>“Just one night has passed, but it already feels like such a distant memory.”</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s because you stayed awake the whole time?”</p>



<p>“Hey! Don’t be so blunt!”</p>



<p>Although I teased her, I could still understand her sentiment to some extent. Yesterday was a day filled with excitement and joy, as though we condensed a whole summer vacation into one day.</p>



<p>Oddly enough, I felt relieved that I hadn’t completely awakened from the dream-like atmosphere yet. Maybe it was because the first face I saw upon waking was Kureha’s.</p>



<p><em>Ah, I am in today, continuing from yesterday.</em></p>



<p>Perhaps the presence of a different kouhai, someone other than the usual, was the one teaching me that.</p>



<p>Lost in my thoughts, I was suddenly interrupted by the sound of Kureha’s nylon jacket rustling as she rushed ahead.</p>



<p>“Senpai, over here!”</p>



<p>Following her beckoning, I stopped at a short staircase connecting the playground and the field. She plopped down and patted the spot next to her.</p>



<p>“Senpai, have a seat here.”</p>



<p>It was the usual spot whenever I took a detour with Yuuko. I was about to suggest sitting on the bench instead, but Kureha preempted me.</p>



<p>“I heard that you and Yuuko-san often sit here and chat. I wanted to experience that feeling for myself, just a little,” she said, blushing slightly as she brushed her cheek.</p>



<p>I inexplicably felt relieved and replied. “Oh, did Yuuko tell you about it?”</p>



<p>“Yes! She said, ‘<em>Saku and I always have our little chats here.’</em>“</p>



<p>I chuckled, thinking that if I refused after she knew all that, it would come off as rude. After all, she was just a kouhai, not some other girl.</p>



<p>I mocked myself for being so cautious lately.</p>



<p>I sat down next to Kureha, offering her a black can of iced coffee and a cafe latte.</p>



<p>“Which one do you prefer?”</p>



<p>Kureha pondered for a moment before answering. “By the way, Senpai, which one do you like?”</p>



<p>“It’s morning, so I’m slightly in the mood for black coffee.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll have black coffee!”</p>



<p>“Hey now.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but retort as I handed her the coffee can.</p>



<p><em>──Chirring.</em></p>



<p>Kureha casually slipped her hand into my pocket. From the sound of it, she was probably giving me the exact change for the coffee.</p>



<p>I sighed, a little exasperated. “You could just let me treat you nicely on such occasions.”</p>



<p>Kureha narrowed her eyes playfully. “Hehe, your pocket is warm, Senpai.”</p>



<p>“Don’t poke my thigh, it tickles.”</p>



<p>Nonchalantly pulling the tab open, Kureha looked my way.</p>



<p>“Cheers!”</p>



<p>“It’s still before dawn, you know,” I said while clinking our cans together.</p>



<p>Taking a sip of the cafe latte, the sweetness permeated my senses, and I realized how thirsty I was. We had chatted so much before falling asleep.</p>



<p>If I were at home, I’d have water by my bedside or simply rinse my mouth after waking up and opening the fridge. But when staying at someone else’s place, I often forgot these familiar daily routines.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because I was being mindful not to disturb anyone by waking up early, but it was strange how I’d naturally behave differently if this were a hotel or an inn.</p>



<p>Maybe I just didn’t want to intrude on someone else’s space thoughtlessly. Could my mind still be a bit foggy from sleep?</p>



<p>It’s pointless to think about such things.</p>



<p>Yuuko mentioned yesterday that we could freely drink whatever was in the fridge. Considering Kotone-san’s personality, she probably meant it literally. Yet, it still felt awkward to freely open the fridge and take whatever I wanted. Even Yua, who was in charge of cooking, always checked with Yuuko before using any ingredients.</p>



<p>On the other hand, hotels or inns were places for everyone, not someone’s personal space, so you could behave somewhat normally in such places.</p>



<p>It’s just like us, I think.</p>



<p>We respected each other’s spaces, setting boundaries and not crossing them.</p>



<p>For example, the cheering squad was a place for everyone, and for Yuuko, this staircase was her place with me.</p>



<p>Taking a sip of the black canned coffee, Kureha made a slight face. “Senpai, what kind of conversations do you have with Yuuko-san here?”</p>



<p>I narrowed my eyes, evading a direct answer. “Well, all kinds of conversations, really.”</p>



<p>“Since when?”</p>



<p>“About a year and a half, I guess.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite a long time.”</p>



<p>“Feels short too, in a way.”</p>



<p>Kureha chuckled, seemingly amused by something. “You guys are truly kind and close, aren’t you, Senpai?”</p>



<p>I replied, accepting her words. “Well, you’re already part of that group too.”</p>



<p>For some reason, my casual remark elicited a firm response,</p>



<p>“──No, I’m not.”</p>



<p>She stated those words with a resolute voice.</p>



<p>“I can’t be part of your circle, nor do I want to be.”</p>



<p>Caught off guard by her abrupt refusal, I fell silent, unsure of how to respond.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing my confusion, Kureha softened her expression, leaning closer with her hands on the stairs.</p>



<p>“I want to remain as everyone’s kouhai, just like I am,” she said, looking up at me with a shy smile.</p>



<p>“I see,” I replied. “Shall we take a little walk then?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I’d like that.”</p>



<p>We stood up, and I crumpled the empty can with a gentle crunch before tossing it into the trash bin.</p>



<p>It was a morning shared with a kouhai. A secret moment while everyone else was still asleep.</p>



<p>Only the fading stardust in the sky watched over us.</p>

<p>It was a morning shared with a kouhai. A secret moment while everyone else was still asleep.</p>



<p>Only the fading stardust in the sky watched over us.</p>

<p>“Eh, Chitose? Kureha…?” </p>



<p>—————————————————</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>41</strong></p>


<p>And so, Kureha and I walked together along the nearby rice field path.</p>



<p>The night was gradually fading away. The sky transitioned from a damp indigo hue to a lapis lazuli blue, with autumn-touched scale clouds drifting lazily overhead. The impatient headlights of cars rushing along the national highway slowly increased, and the signs of the awakening town were everywhere.</p>



<p>The distant mountains lined up like the boundary between yesterday and today, their outlines shimmering into view. The once chilly air now embraced my skin, and the scent of earth and rice stalks grew richer.</p>



<p>As we walked side by side, Kureha casually spoke up. “By the way, Senpai. Last night, you seemed lost in thought. Did something bother you?”</p>



<p>I had no specific recollection, so I tilted my head, and she continued.</p>



<p>“Right after we finished moving the futons. You had this melancholic expression, like you were struggling with something.”</p>



<p>Finally, it hit me. It must have been when I was pondering all those tangled thoughts about love, thanks to the association with Yuuko’s room.</p>



<p>Impressed by her keen observation, I felt a slight embarrassment for being so easily read by my kouhai.</p>



<p>I decided to speak honestly. “Sort of… It’s like I’m stuck in a state of stagnation, for better or worse.”</p>



<p>“Stagnation?” she inquired, scratching her head.</p>



<p>“Yeah, this summer, a lot of things settled down. It’s good that things have fallen into place, but precisely because of that, I can’t seem to take the next step forward.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but wonder what I was discussing with a kouhai, but Kureha’s words made me realize something.</p>



<p>Indeed, this September had been tranquil and fulfilling, and that’s why I felt a bit melancholic.</p>



<p>I wondered if staying this way was alright or if I should move on. It seemed like I had been contemplating this for a while.</p>



<p>Kureha tilted her head, gazing at me with a serious glint in her eyes.</p>



<p>“Senpai, do you want to break free from this stagnation? From this melancholy?” she asked.</p>



<p>As I gazed into the distant sky, I clenched my fist tightly and muttered softly. “Truth is, I don’t really want to break free, but I know I have to.”</p>



<p>It was something I had known from the beginning. September could only ever be September, a space that wasn’t quite summer but not fully autumn. If I settled here, I feared I would never be able to leave.</p>



<p>“Hey, Senpai?” Suddenly, Kureha’s little finger entwined gently with mine, like a promise. “Your wishes are my wishes too.”</p>



<p>With those words, she effortlessly undid the knot and took a step, then another, and another, before turning back to me.</p>



<p>“That’s why, all of it… I’ll blow it all away for you.”</p>



<p>With her index finger raised high towards the eastern sky, she declared. “I’ll show you just how I can make it all vanish!”</p>



<p>Her laughter bubbled up, infectious and radiant.</p>



<p>And in that very moment…</p>



<p>──A bright crimson sun rose from the horizon.</p>


<p>The grass, the rice fields, the waterways, the buildings, the towers, and the clouds — all were painted in a vibrant vermilion hue, as if the night was being repainted.</p>



<p>The dozing hands of the clock awoke with a sharp click.</p>



<p>The seasons would change, and so would we. Would we move into a true autumn or return to lingering summer, or perhaps…?</p>



<p>It was like magic; I was captivated by the sight. At the center of it all stood a stunningly beautiful kouhai girl, surrounded by the fulfillment of someone’s wish and, at the same time, someone else’s wish left behind.</p>



<p>Kureha brought forth the morning.</p>



<p>For some reason, that’s what I thought.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>42</strong></p>


<p>We returned to Yuuko’s house and each of us snugly wrapped ourselves in blankets and futon to get some much-needed rest once more.</p>



<p>Kureha seemed to have finally had a good dream too. When I woke up, enticed by the scent of miso soup, she was curled up, emitting adorable sleeping sounds while being watched over by Yuuko and the others.</p>



<p>We waited for Kureha to wake up and then savored the onigiri and miso soup that Yua had prepared. Amidst the mishmash of oddly-shaped but incredibly appetizing servings, I learned that Haru had also lent a hand in the kitchen.</p>



<p>In the morning, we reviewed what we practiced yesterday at the park. After returning to Yuuko’s place for a quick soba lunch, we continued our practice together in the afternoon.</p>



<p>By the time the sun began to set, everyone, including Yua, Asu-nee, and Kenta, had almost perfected the dance routine.</p>



<p>As we finished the final run-through, I exchanged glances with Nanase, and I spoke up. “Yeah, we nailed it, right?”</p>



<p>Nanase nodded confidently. “Absolutely. Let’s aim for victory.”</p>



<p>Hearing that, Kenta dramatically collapsed to his knees. “I-I thought I was going to die…”</p>



<p>With her arms slumped, Yua chuckled wryly. “I doubt I can make dinner tonight.”</p>



<p>Asu-nee swung her hand playfully. “Guess I won’t be able to carry any books either.”</p>



<p>Even Kazuki had beads of sweat forming on his forehead. “But well, somehow we made it.”</p>



<p>Kaito rubbed his nose with a grin. “It’s gonna be a blast when we all perform together.”</p>



<p>Haru, who was sipping on a Pocari Sweat, joined in. “Well, we still have that ‘Feast’ part left.”</p>



<p>Yuuko raised both fists in front of her chest. “We’ll be just fine! Because we’re together!”</p>



<p>And naturally, all eyes turned to our youngest member. In response to their expectations, Kureha raised her fist in determination.</p>



<p>“Now, everyone, together—”</p>



<p>Like the signal for departure on a ship or the sound of a starting pistol, she shouted;</p>



<p>“Yo-sorooo!”</p>



<p>“”””Yo-sorooo!!!””””</p>



<p>Even though we were all exhausted, our energetic voices echoed through the park. The warm rays of the setting sun acted as spotlights, illuminating everyone.</p>



<p>As we playfully stacked wooden sticks that we imagined as swords, I couldn’t help but wonder…</p>



<p>Perhaps, at this moment, we were all immersed in this pleasant lukewarm water, just like this twilight.</p>



<p>Maybe we’re merely standing still, dipping our toes in, enjoying each other’s company.</p>



<p><em>Even so</em>, I relaxed my shoulders.</p>



<p>Thinking back to the intense August when we all felt like we couldn’t stay the same────</p>



<p>Having a September where everyone could be themselves felt like forgiveness.</p>
