<h2>Chapter 2: A Pool Date with the Princess</h2>

<p class="calibre5">Golden Week had begun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We were at an amusement facility on the outskirts of town called Crown World.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This was my first time visiting Crown World.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I still vividly remember asking my parents to take me when it first opened, only to be turned down because ‘it would be crowded.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, I never went after that, but I really want to tell that version of Hakuba Ouji who cried in frustration back then:</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Five years later, you’ll be playing at the heated swimming pool with the girl you like.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Crown World was celebrating its fifth anniversary this year, and it seemed that they were hosting a grand event, attracting many visitors.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And here I was, glaring at Takashi Harukawa in the changing room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t glare at me like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“As expected of the ace of the soccer team, huh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His physique wasn’t like that of a bodybuilder, but there was not a trace of unnecessary fat on him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His body was one that would likely be popular with women.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but feel envious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wish I had such an ideal body type.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I stared at my own body in the mirror provided in the changing room. Pathetically slender…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, we gave up on a date for just the two of us and came here with an oddball couple along with Harune-chan, making us a group of five.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I would’ve loved to come alone with Himegi-san, but this time, a part of me felt relieved that we weren’t alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Kanako’s boyfriend stared intently at a part of my body and said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So you really are a guy…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Damn it, I won’t forgive him!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve decided not to forgive anyone who makes fun of my name or appearance, no matter who they are.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I stared right back at his crotch as if to return the favor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Phew, I win…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I gently patted his shoulders and said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a triumphant look on my face, I encouraged him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ugh!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After changing, I took the disheartened Takashi Harukawa out of the changing room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, showers that would refresh our bodies welcomed us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah&mdash;&mdash;! Unlike the ones at school, this is warm water!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“True, the temperature is just right and it feels good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After cleaning ourselves up, we decided to wait near the entrance for Himegi-san and the others to come out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We wouldn’t miss each other if we stayed here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s been since the opening that I last came here.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san had said something similar to Takakyun as well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I heard you met Natsumi Onē-chan. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">His sudden words caught me off guard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I met her…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Takashi Harukawa is Touka Himegi’s childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, it’s easy to imagine that he would also be close to her sister, Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, I thought he would know more about Natsumi-san’s illness than I do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His somber expression seemed to confirm this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To be honest, there are times when I wonder if it’s okay to be playing around like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although there’s no need to compare, I have no doubt he’s feeling even more regretful about the situation than I am.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I’ve decided to act as usual, even if it’s hard. I think that’s what Natsumi Onee-chan would want.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t think his perspective is wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I were in his position, I would probably make the same choice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was surprised by his words. To think he would thank me…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you for meeting Natsumi Onee-chan and for putting up with the unreasonable demands of my whimsical childhood friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that Takashi Harukawa has a good grasp of the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If someone else were Touka’s boyfriend, I think I would have forced them to break up. I’m really glad that my rather foolish childhood friend ended up with you, Ouji-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He may be speaking harshly, but his expression was incredibly calm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One way or another, just as I consider Kanako important, his soft expression conveyed that Touka Himegi is also an irreplaceable and important friend to him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I apologize for asking this of you, Ouji-kun, but I’d like you to indulge my high-maintenance princess’s silly requests until the end.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I nodded slightly at his earnest words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And with that, he deeply bowed his head to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san has a great childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I decided to consult him about something that’s been bothering me as he lifted his head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Takakyun, can I ask you something?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san apparently chose me for three reasons. The first is that Natsumi-san likes me, and the second seems to be that she thought I wouldn’t refuse. But she didn’t tell me the third reason. Do you have any idea what it might be?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although Himegi-san corrected it for two reasons, I believe there are three. Why did she close her mouth about the third reason?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. I think Touka was hesitant to say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hesitant?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe she felt bad about putting you through all this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So you’re saying she want me to do something for her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, as much as it pains me to admit, I can’t do it. But you might be able to.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Something only I can do?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Meeting you made both Touka and Harune-chan a bit better. Thanks to you, they’ve started to smile a little more.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Even the old lady and that gruff old man seemed more lively after meeting you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t think that’s because of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s definitely because of you. Ouji-kun, do you understand why the Himegi family has become a little more lively?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Sorry, I have no clue.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pondered for a moment, but no answer came to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing this, he tells me the answer with a refreshing smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;It’s because you resemble Natsumi Onee-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I resemble Natsumi-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re impulsive, careless, bad with money, and you love playing pranks on people. You’re just like Natsumi Onee-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know if Natsumi-san is a careless person who’s bad with money, but sadly, all the words Takaki-kun just said apply to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t this where you’re supposed to compliment me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seeing you perform magic so earnestly at Harune-chan’s recent birthday party reminded me of how Natsumi-nee-chan used to be when she was cheerful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey-hey, is this your way of giving me straightforward praise?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I heard from Kanako why you continue doing magic.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, that chatterbox…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi Onee-chan is a person who loves making others smile. She’s the type who would put herself last just to make someone who’s sad feel better. Aren’t you the same?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s with that? Are you sure you’ve got it right?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, like I said before, let’s have as much fun as we can today. I’ll assist Kanako and Harune-chan to the fullest, and you’ll do the same for Touka.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And with that, he firmly grabs my right shoulder, swaying me from side to side, and starts singing a cheer song I’ve never heard before.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey-hey, stop it! I really hate this athletic club vibe! What’s this cheer song anyway?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course, it’s the Nankai Hawks’ cheer song!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why baseball??? Aren’t you in the soccer club?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahahaha! You lose if you care!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Oh, come on!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I grab his shoulder, and we start singing the cheer song together without a care for who’s watching.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought he was a wonderful guy for being able to play the fool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even when things were tough, the man beside me never lost his smile, and I genuinely respected Takashi for that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But would this also someday be just a page of our youth?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, his words saved me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Overthinking doesn’t suit me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, I should enjoy what’s right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I should also face Himegi-san properly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if we’re a fake couple, I’m Himegi-san’s boyfriend now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…What are you two doing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From behind, I heard a familiar beautiful voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around, there stood Himegi-san and the others in swimsuits, staring at us with puzzled eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whoa! I had all sorts of imaginations about what kind of swimsuit she’d wear, but I never expected a string bikini…</p>
<p class="calibre5">And it’s not even a floral or polka-dot pattern but a card pattern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was utterly captivated by Himegi-san’s unexpected charming look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite her youthful, pretty face, her body was more voluptuous than anyone else’s.</p>
<p class="calibre5">White bikini Touka also had quite the impact, but this swimsuit might just be more stunning in a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At least, it KO’d me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I always liked competitive swimwear that showed off the body lines, but from today, I think I’m converting to team bikini.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Contrary to my awe, Himegi-san was pressing her forehead with her hand, struggling with a headache.</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘It’s a sight that makes my head hurt,’ she said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The three of them looked at us as if they had witnessed something suspicious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune, Chikada-san. Let’s leave these idiots and have fun, just the three of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sounds good.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And with that, they spun around, turning their backs on us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanako, don’t leave me behind!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-wait! Waaait~~~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then we hurriedly chased after them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the morning, the five of us enjoyed ourselves, and at a well-known burger shop in the pool area, we had a delicious set menu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the afternoon, it was decided that Touka Himegi and I would pair up while Takakyun, Kanako, and Harune-chan would form a trio.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We were climbing the stairs right now, holding a double float to experience the water slide.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, this water slide at Crown World boasts the longest length in Japan, roughly equivalent to a fifteen-story building in height.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m somewhat good with heights, so when I see phrases like ‘Japan’s No.1 experience’ written, it gets me a little excited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, the view from the top of the stairs is quite something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was admiring the view, Himegi-san, who was climbing ahead of me, suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Huh? What’s wrong? We haven’t even reached halfway to the top yet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I think I should turn back.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I can’t handle heights.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? You mean you’re afraid of heights?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my question, she nods.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t believe she has a fear of heights.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you’re afraid of heights, then why did you want to slide in the first place?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one who initially proposed sliding down this water slide is this very girl, who now has a pale face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was the one who declared so enthusiastically that she would slide…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Because Harune seemed to be enjoying it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now that she mentions it, Harune-chan did look like she was enjoying the water slide alone this morning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I thought if my sister could do it, then maybe I could too. But, alas, it seems impossible.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She unilaterally decides to give up and announces her retirement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I look back. Behind us, there’s a long line of couples and families waiting to slide down this water slide.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, there’s a long line in front of us too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s easy to imagine that turning back on this narrow staircase would cause considerable inconvenience to the people behind us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems the only option now is to continue climbing the stairs and slide down the water slide as planned.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This time, it’s entirely Himegi-san’s fault for trying to show off. Let’s muster up some courage and slide.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, no, no! Abstain, I give up!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san clings to my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a pretty huge contrast, considering she’s usually so calm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I make her stand and respond with a smile, ‘Alright, let’s go up!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I then proceed to push her reluctant back and make her climb one step, then another, up the stairs.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah&mdash;&mdash;! I can’t turn back now! We’ve reached a height where even going down is scary!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Interestingly, the higher we go, the more hesitant to go down she becomes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess she really can’t handle heights.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Look! Harune-chan and the others are waving at us!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I say this and point towards Harune-chan and the others floating on inflatable rings on the water’s surface.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, wave back! Hey!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, absolutely not! There’s no way I’m letting go of my hands!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you saying that you want me to let go your hand?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s not!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sure, sure.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I deliberately peel her hand off the handrail and grab her wrist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wai-wait! I’m scared, don’t take my hand off the handrail!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ignoring her terrified protest, I wave back to Harune-chan and the others with a smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll remember this, you sadistic Ouji!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san curses me in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing her scared expression gives me a sort of twisted pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe I truly am a sadistic Ouji.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, we finally reached our destination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once the people in front of us slide down, it will be our turn.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now all that’s left is to slide!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That smile of yours is annoying.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahahahah! This is so much fun! Ow!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I get a light slap on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seems like I got a little carried away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, front or back, where would Himegi-san like to sit?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…sorry for hitting you. You sit at the front, Ouji-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since she asked so cutely, I decided to sit at the back, going against her wishes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m the kind of guy who likes to mess with the girl he likes.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000002.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, it’s our turn. We set up a two-person inflatable ring on the slide.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, Himegi-san freezes in place, intimidated by the force of the flowing water.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“After considering various things&mdash;&mdash;I decided I’m going home!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“In that case, let’s just slide down and go back home.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I catch her as she tries to flee and make her sit on the inflatable ring.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait-wait! I said I’d sit at the back! I said so, didn’t I?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san is panicking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I ignore her and sit behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“God, please protect me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems she’s resigned herself to fate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She quiets down, clasps her trembling hands, and begins praying to the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s quite overdramatic for someone who’s just going down a water slide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san turns to face me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Wow, her face is so close.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Feeling embarrassed, I avert my eyes from her teary gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hold me tightly around my waist… please.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She pleads with a blushing face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hesitate momentarily, but then wrap my arms around her waist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Tighter, much tighter…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How about now?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Even more, more!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If she insists that much, I have no choice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s better!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hug Himegi-san’s waist tightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“――Annh!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait, did she just… let out a suggestive sound?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, what? Did she just moan in front of all these peopl?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…w-what are you doing, touching me there?!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huuuh?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s… that’s unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I swear by all the gods, I haven’t touched any part other than her waist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t squeeze my belly, but press closer to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is this okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You know, we’re trying to be serious here, but I can’t help but think that to the onlookers, we’re just a silly couple being overly affectionate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, it’s kind of embarrassing…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you ready?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A staff member asks in a casual tone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We nod at the staff member.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My heart is pounding. Himegi-san must be feeling the same, albeit for different reasons.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I think about this, the wind carries a pleasant scent that tickles my nostrils.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess this is the smell of Himegi-san’s hair and body…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just like Touka-san, she has the sweet scent of soap.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The red light starts flashing, and the adjacent green light comes on.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, let’s go!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With the staff member’s shout, we’re off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment we launch, water hits my face directly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Noooooooo!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s… quite loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, the water slide isn’t as fast as I’d imagined, and it doesn’t whip us around from side to side, nor is the slope steep enough to be scary.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The ‘Japan’s No.1 experience’ claim was a letdown.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to summarize my feelings about the water slide in one word… disappointing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah&mdash;&mdash;aaahhh! Ahh! No-no-no! Please no!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Frankly, her screams are more frightening than the slide itself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So fast! It’s too fast! This is crazy!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Are you Tetsuro Degawa (Comedian) or what?!</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I’m mentally making these quips, we reach the bottom and splash into the water.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Ahh! I swallowed water! I swallowed water! I will never ride this again!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She gets up and starts hitting me to relieve her stress.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ow, ow, ouch… Please stop taking it out on me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t scared at all, but for her, it seemed to be a terrifying experience that brought her to the brink of tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Given how scared she was, the person who designed this water slide must be quite satisfied.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Great, it was a good experience, wasn’t it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I give a thumbs-up to her, who looks utterly exhausted, with a beaming smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I hate it! I’m never going to ride it again!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Want to go one more time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;You fiend, Ouji! I would never go on it again even if I die!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I grab Himegi-san’s hand and climb out of the pool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just then, Harune-chan comes running over, her swimsuit’s frills fluttering.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onii-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan leaps energetically into my arms, and I gently catch her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune-chan, be careful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She beams a friendly smile at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s such a cute girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onii-san, I want to hear your thoughts on the water slide!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My thoughts on the water slide, huh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I glance briefly at the drained Himegi-san and say,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…it was loud, I guess.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, my ears are still ringing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">After enjoying the pool, we decided to wrap things up as planned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since the guys are done changing, we’re quietly waiting near the changing room entrance for the girls to come out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I’m exhausted!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll definitely have sore muscles tomorrow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You did swim a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Looks like I’ll sleep soundly tonight.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In contrast to me, who is worn out, Takakyun seems to be bursting with energy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not for nothing that he’s the ace of the soccer team.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pull out my smartphone from my pocket and open my messaging app.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I send a message to Touka-san, who is likely waiting quietly at home, saying, ‘I’m heading home now.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">The message is marked as read, and a white frog character sticker I’ve seen somewhere before pops up in response.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it your parents?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s not.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, really? Then who is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s being rather inquisitive.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…My future wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just kidding.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, here’s some advice from me. If you’re going to cheat, be prepared to die. Touka is quite the jealous type…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what he said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry. I’m all about Himegi-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know, you sometimes pick really straightforward words without any sense of embarrassment.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Same goes for you. Also, here’s some advice from me. Kanako is also the jealous type, so if you’re going to cheat, do it with determination.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry. The other day, she almost put me in a flaming oil bath.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s a misunderstanding… but lots of things happened…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While we were having this stupid conversation, Himegi-san and the others, who had finished changing, appeared from the entrance and ran over to us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san then bows her head towards us with a slightly apologetic look.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. The roads seem to be crowded, and it looks like the car won’t arrive for another hour.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Given that we’re getting a ride for free, I have no complaints.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Actually, I feel more apologetic for causing someone else the trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll buy some coffee from a vending machine later and give it to the maid who’s our driver as a token of appreciation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No need to worry about it. What should we do to kill time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It would’ve been nice if there was a family restaurant around…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, there aren’t any places near Crown World where we could spend time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only options within the facility are a billiards table and a small game center.</p>
<p class="calibre5">None of us feels like changing back into swimsuits to play in the pool again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That leaves us with two options: playing billiards or going to the game center.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune wants to play games!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan enthusiastically raises her hand and gazes at the game center.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m also tired, so maybe simple games would be a better choice than billiards.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kanako and Takakyun, why don’t you two go play billiards?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Takakyun and the others had been considerate at the pool so that Himegi-san and I could play together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now it’s my turn to give this quirky couple some alone time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that in mind, I suggest they play billiards.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, we’ll kill time at the game center.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you say, Takakyun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, Ouji, but I’ll go play billiards with Kanako.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright, let’s meet back here in fifty minutes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two of them head to the counter, arms linked with smiles on their faces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two of them head to the counter, arms linked with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Watching this harmonious couple, I wondered to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is this what they call ‘strange bedfellows’?” (TN: irony at seeing an unlikely couple get along so well.)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you’re going to say that, Onī-san, it would be more like ‘two birds of a feather’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Harune-chan, that was a joke to lighten the mood.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m lying. I genuinely got it wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, then you should be able to explain what ‘strange bedfellows’ means, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, let’s head to the game center!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I get home, I’ll look up the meaning of ‘strange bedfellows (呉越同舟)’ in the dictionary on my smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that said, we arrived at the game center.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sadly, the place is almost empty, with just one family and a female employee inside.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune wants to play racing games!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Up to 500 yen, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No splurging.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“500 yen will be gone in an instant! Ten minutes and it’ll be used up!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan vehemently protests to her sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ignoring her sister’s complaints, the older sister takes out a 500 yen coin from her pink wallet and hands it to Harune-chan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune also wants to manage her own money…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite her dissatisfied expression, Harune-chan tightly grips the 500 yen coin and heads to the change machine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Watching my sister-in-law trudge slowly, I feel a bit sorry for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Later, I’ll secretly share some of my modest funds with her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The older sister seems interested in the prizes from the claw machine, staring intently at the stuffed animals through the glass.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she gazes at the plushies, I can’t help but think that Himegi-san is really cute.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I’m captivated by her, a “ping” sound comes from my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems someone has sent a message to my smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I take it out and look at the screen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, it’s from Natsumi-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had thought it would be a message from Touka-san, but it turns out it’s from the eldest daughter of the Himegi family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We had exchanged contact information when we last met.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since then, we’ve been in touch quite frequently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I reply to her message.</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Did you have fun at the pool?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Yes, it was fun.】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【That’s good to hear.】</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, Natsumi-san sent a stamp of a white frog character that I had seen somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is this character popular in the Himegi family?</p>

<p class="calibre5">【By the way, Hakuba-kun?</p>
<p class="calibre5">【What is it?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Could you send me some swimsuit photos of my sisters?】</p>

<p class="calibre5">A sincere request came from a pervert.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【I don’t have anything like that, okay?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【What? You haven’t taken any swimsuit photos?? Are you a coward? Normal people would take hundreds of pictures on their smartphones, right???】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Normal people don’t engage in perverted activities!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s only natural, but if there were idiots taking pictures of girls in swimsuits at the pool, they would certainly be handed over to the police.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Is Natsumi-san suggesting that I should get arrested???】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【The swimsuit appearances of my sisters are worth that much!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, what is this person talking about?</p>

<p class="calibre5">【I can’t help it. Let’s compromise with pictures of my sisters in their casual clothes. Come on brother-in-law, go take pictures of my sisters in their casual clothes secretly and make an offering to this Natsumi Oneechan!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what she said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think it’s a good thing this person is not a brother but a sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Natsumi-san were a brother, undoubtedly, her two sisters wouldn’t even speak to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【I won’t take any secret pictures!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Coward! Pitiful Prince! I am thoroughly disappointed in you!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why do I have to be insulted like this?</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Fine. I’ll send it if I get permission from both of them.】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【That won’t do! I want to see natural shots of them!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wow, what a selfish person…</p>

<p class="calibre5">【&mdash;&mdash;I’ll come and haunt you if you don’t!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【…fine.】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s not like they’re revealing swimsuit photos, and the person I’m sending the pictures to is technically their own older sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, she’s a magnificent pervert, but she’s not a stranger; she’s actually their sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It doesn’t feel like a big problem, so let’s go along with this perverted sister this time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【By the way, what are Touka-chan and Harune-tan wearing? Tell me!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Himegi-san is wearing a light black knit sweater with blue three-quarter-length jeans.】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Wooowww! And what about Harune-tan?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Harune-chan is in a T-shirt and checkered shorts.】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Super casual! Just like my Harune-tan would be!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Um, The person I’m communicating with is really Onē-san, right?】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is it possible that I’m actually messaging with some perverted guy?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That suspicion is starting to creep in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Hakuba-kun, let’s turn casual photos of my sisters into action figures!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Based on what she’s saying, it’s definitely the real Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After finishing the racing game, I snap a photo of Harune-chan, who is currently engrossed in a drumming game.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since Harune-chan is concentrating on drumming, she doesn’t notice me taking the photo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I managed to capture the candid shot that Natsumi-san wanted&mdash;a lively picture of Harune-chan energetically drumming away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sent the photo to Natsumi-san, then she read it immediately.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Nice, great! Harune-chan’s smiling face is wonderful! Hakuba-kun, you have a talent for photography!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Thank you.】</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t help but feel a bit manipulated by Natsumi-san, but I’m also flattered by the compliment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【So, shall we move on to Touka-chan next?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Alright.】</p>

<p class="calibre5">To fulfill Natsumi-san’s request, I discreetly approach Himegi-san and snap a photo of her profile as she gazes at the plush toys in a claw machine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I sent that photo to Natsumi-san again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Wow! The wife is smiling at a stuffed animal! Ouji-kun, it’s the best shot!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">I also think it’s the best shot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, I guess ‘the wife’ is referring to Himegi-san as my wife.</p>

<p class="calibre5">【Now, get me a close-up of Touka-chan’s butt!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【…what?】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【I want to see the cute butt of the second daughter, who will carry on the Himegi family legacy!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【No way, that’s impossible! I’ll get killed if I’m caught!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Give it your all, like your life depends on it!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【Ah, my smartphone battery is down to 0~~】</p>
<p class="calibre5">【You’re lying, you coward!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although my smartphone battery still had plenty of charge left, I couldn’t keep up with Natsumi-san any longer, so I turned off the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh… Seriously, what an incredible person…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I let out a big sigh and put my smartphone back in my pocket.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">I let out a big sigh and put my smartphone back in my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I approach Himegi-san, who is staring intently at a stuffed animal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you want it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I don’t particularly want it, but this little guy keeps looking at me with round eyes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san, that’s what people generally call ‘wanting’ something…</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, she’s not honest about certain things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The stuffed animal that Himegi-san was eyeing was a white frog character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This guy, you’ve been encroaching on my life lately…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have no choice. Let’s welcome Hakugaeru-kun into our home.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, she inserts a 100-yen coin and starts playing the crane game.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Comical music starts to play, and the crane arm moves jerkily in sync with the lever that Himegi-san is operating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you play crane games often?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s been five years. Right, this will be my second time since my first play here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…here we go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She says that and presses the crane game button.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The three-pronged arm lowers and firmly grabs the head of the white frog.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, you think you can get it? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Be quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“S-sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was seriously angry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, the arm lifts the white frog up into the air,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It slips out of the crane’s grasp and falls back into its original spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is just as I suspected.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The crane arm loosens when it reaches its highest point, making it extremely difficult to win the plush toy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unfazed, Himegi-san inserts another hundred-yen coin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“….how was it…I wonder?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san mumbled something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t hear it well due to the noise, but she seemed to have asked me a question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…uh, sorry, I didn’t catch that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon hearing this, she visibly scowls.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed like it was an important question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m really sorry. Could you please say it again?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…So, how…did my…swimsuit look?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps feeling shy, Himegi-san’s face turns slightly red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not wanting to let me see her reaction, she turns away and gazes at the yet-to-be-won plush toy, feigning indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It then occurred to me that I hadn’t actually complimented her swimsuit out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is a big mistake on my part as her boyfriend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himegi-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to throw away my cherished Shiramori Yuki photobook!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shiramori Yuki is a popular idol of our generation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was such a huge fan that I would immediately go to the bookstore whenever a new Shiramori Yuki photobook was released.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She has a figure that can stand toe-to-toe with Himegi-san’s.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Today, I’ve encountered something even more amazing than Yuki-chan, to whom I’ve devoted my youth to. Yes, it’s you, Himegi-san! I want to thank you for how incredible you looked in your swimsuit!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, I get chopped.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t lump me in with girls who are just outlets for s*xual desires!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Outlet? All I do is admire Yuki-chan’s swimsuit photobook and imagine spending a summer vacation with her before going to sleep!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I swear to God, I’ve never looked at Yuki-chan with lewd intentions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I think you are having lewd fantasies about her…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…But Himegi-san, you’re even lewder!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll knock you out! In any case, that compliment&mdash;only gets a fifty!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“O-okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems I went about complimenting her the wrong way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himegi-san, would you wear today’s swimsuit again? I’d like to see it at the beach if possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seemed that this way of complimenting her was better; I didn’t miss the brief moment her expression softened into a smile.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000013.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">It may not have been a perfect score, but it seemed to have touched Himegi-san’s heart a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While we were having this conversation, another plush toy fell loosely from the crane game arm.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Mmm… Well, there’s still time. Let’s enjoy the game at a leisurely pace.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She then pulls another hundred-yen coin from her wallet for another retry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” ….. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sadly, I can already foresee what’s going to happen next.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then&mdash;thirty minutes later.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;Bang!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Don’t hit the machine!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“B-but! I’ve spent ten thousand yen!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I told you, you should have stopped when you reached a thousand yen!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, even after spending ten thousand yen, she still hasn’t won the frog plush toy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san has lost all sense of when to stop and is engrossed in the crane game.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s definitely the type who shouldn’t be allowed to gamble.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ouji-kun, I’m going to get some change. Keep an eye on this frog plushie so nobody else takes it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems she still wants to continue playing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, I’m not too worried.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I doubt anyone else would want this rather unappealing frog.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you still doing it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan appears with a puzzled expression, having finished her game.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“She can’t seem to quit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Harune only spent five hundred yen… This is what you’d call a double standard.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re absolutely right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really have no words to counter that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Touka-nee, while you’re messing around, you’re lowering your little sister’s opinion of you.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You already spent a lot of money. I’ll ask the clerk to move it to an easier position to grab.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I suggested that too, but she vehemently refused.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seems determined to win it on her own power without anyone’s help.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the record, I did offer various pieces of advice, but she snapped, ‘I can’t focus, so be quiet!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since then, I have remained silent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What a ridiculous sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Harune-chan coldly gazes at the frog plushie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It must be frustrating for her, to watch her sister frivolously spend money while she only spent five hundred yen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Harune-chan, play with this money.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;rip rip rip!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, Onī-san… that wallet…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“T-that’s so cool!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So it seems.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It appears that, just like me, this kid has a real understanding of the essence of style.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A true connoisseur of taste.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I think that in five years, Velcro wallets will be all the rage worldwide.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow! Onī-san, you’re living in the future! You are visionary!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, yeah. I’m so ahead of the times that ordinary people just can’t comprehend it. More importantly… here’s some pocket money for Harune-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I take a thousand-yen bill from my wallet and give it to Harune-chan as a gift.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Is this okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yay! I love you, Onī-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan is overjoyed and leaps into my arms.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh, oh! What is this?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like I could give anything to this kid!</p>
<p class="calibre5">If she were to demand a hundred thousand yen card, I would undoubtedly withdraw the money from an ATM and run to the card shop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Harune-chan stares at me with an expression as if she wants to say something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Onī-san reminds me of Natsumi-nee.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A long time ago, I also received some money from Natsumi-neesan at this game center. The look on Natsumi’s face at that time and Onī-san’s face now are the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I should say something, but the words just won’t come out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder how much sadness and bitterness this small girl harbors.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that this grade-schooler will have to part with her sister in the not-so-distant future made my heart feel like it was about to burst.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With such thoughts, there was no way I could say anything that could comfort her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that’s right. I need to thank Onī-san. Thank you for helping with Harune’s birthday party.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Harune-chan bows her head slightly and voices her thanks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsumi-nee was also happy to see me playing the violin. I played the violin without running away, and it was really great.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the original timeline, Harune-chan’s birthday party was canceled because she herself ran away from home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…The future Harune-chan must have been tormented by deep regret and sorrow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I have to thank Touka-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m grateful that this girl, who smiles at me so innocently, could avoid a timeline where she suffers, even if it’s just a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, here’s some advice for Onī-san from Harune.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Advice?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Here, Onī-san should get the stuffed animal! If you do, Touka-nee will also come to like you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Imagine it! Getting the stuffed animal gracefully and giving it to Touka-nee!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I imagined it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Winning the stuffed animal and giving it to Himegi-san…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…And then, being allowed to kiss and even touch her chest!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, that’s jumping too far ahead. At most, you might get a kiss on the cheek!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wooowww!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now that she put it like that, I’m suddenly motivated!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, Onī-san, let’s play it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I decided to challenge the crane game with my spare 100-yen coin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With this, I have only 12 yen left in my wallet…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onī-san, do you have any experience with crane games?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Actually, this is my first time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s surprising.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right; surprisingly, I’ve never played a crane game before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve always thought that spending money on convenience store lotteries or gachapon (capsule toy machines) is far more productive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, you’re guaranteed to win something if you buy it, even if it’s a small thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I’m setting aside that philosophy and bet this 100-yen coin for my beloved this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I insert the 100-yen coin and operate the lever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…There’s a tiny gap between the head and the crown. If I aim for that&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow! Amazing-Amazing! You got the stuffed animal for 100 yen!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t believe I got it in just one try…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Heh! It seems I’ve discovered yet another one of my talents.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onī-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Harune-chan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” ” Yay! ” “</p>

<p class="calibre5">We high-fived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Onī-san, Touka-nee is back!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I quickly hide the Hakugaeru-kun stuffed animal that I just won behind my back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When she comes closer, I’ll show her the stuffed animal I got and surprise her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Himegi-san stands next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In her hand is a mountain of 100-yen coins in a medal cup.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What on earth is she planning to do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">How many times is she planning to play???</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san, Himegi-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I lightly tap her shoulder with my finger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ta-dah! I got the stuffed animal for you! (Smugface.jpg)”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I proudly held up the stuffed animal that I had been hiding behind my back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here you go! (SmugOuji)”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hand the stuffed animal to Himegi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she looks back and forth several times between the Hakugaeru-kun in my hand and the now-empty crane game and points to Hakugaeru-kun with trembling hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What? Huh? …don’t tell me, you got the stuffed animal?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My beloved honey! I’m unworthy because I can’t present you with a hundred billion roses. Please forgive me (DramaticOuji).”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, I magically popped a single red rose from my empty right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san trembles and blushes at my cool words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ha! Seems like she’s so moved she’s lost for words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, I offer her the red rose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…You thief!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait…What???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Did I mishear? Did she just call me a thief?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, in my sixteen years of living, no one has ever called me a thief to my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">More importantly, was her trembling and blushing not out of happiness but anger at my actions?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That stuffed animal was supposed to be mine!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san stomps her feet like a child on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was the very picture of rage, genuine fury, and absolute indignation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’m sorry. (DowncastOuji)”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I asked you to watch over things, but I never asked you to win that stuffed animal!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Uh, err, ahhh… Harune-chan!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Realizing I couldn’t calm Himegi-san’s anger, I decided to seek help from the younger sister, Harune-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I turned around to look for where Harune-chan was.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What? Where? Harune-chan!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I turn around, Harune-chan is gone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, she’s now playing air hockey with some unknown girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What a clever kid, sensing danger and escaping immediately.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Put it back! Put the stuffed animal back where it was!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Staff&mdash;&mdash;! SOS! SOS!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">***</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Welcome back, Ha-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I opened the front door of our house, Touka-san in an apron welcomed me inside.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You look tired.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san gives a wry smile upon seeing my worn-out expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… I was tired, but seeing you in an apron rejuvenated me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Charming lines like that are six years too early for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So it seems.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, in six years, I’ll say it as much as I like.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…By the way, Ha-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why is ‘thief’ written on your forehead?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No comment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t bring myself to say that it was written as a punishment by the JK version of her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did you have fun at the pool?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I show Touka-san the screen of my smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh! It’s Harune and me hugging Hakugaeru-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the smartphone screen were two people, each holding a differently colored Hakugaeru-kun, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, Himegi-san spent twenty thousand yen just to win that stuffed animal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m a bit worried that she’ll get scolded by her parents later for such a wasteful expense.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I plan to send this photo to Natsumi-san later as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Please do.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’ll surely be pleased.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“For now, let’s have dinner. Ha-kun, go wash your hands.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, Touka-san gracefully turns around and heads toward the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka-san’s outfit oddly enough resembled what Himegi-san wore today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, a navy blue knit sweater with blue jeans.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I looked at her retreating figure, a thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see, so that’s the… future butt of the second daughter who will take on the responsibilities of the Himegi household…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indeed, just as Natsumi-san said, it’s a truly magnificent butt.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can’t be helped. I’ll also send a photo of her butt.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that thought, I aimed my smartphone’s camera at Touka-san and took a snap.</p>

<h2>Touka Himegi: Reminiscence 3</h2>

<p class="calibre5">It’s been almost a year since my sister left this world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alone, I stood before her grave.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I knew it… you really are gone….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought I had come to terms with it, but seeing her grave makes it undeniable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, you’re not anywhere in this world anymore…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. I haven’t visited in so long…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In my defense, I couldn’t come here with a pathetic look on my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But today, I have good news that would make Natsumi-neesan happy…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There are many things to talk about, but first, I’ll do some cleaning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, I quietly cleaned my sister’s grave.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The grave was not as dirty as I had imagined.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Surely, either Mom or one of the maids has been visiting regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels hypocritical coming from me, who neglected this place for so long, but I felt a little relieved knowing someone had been maintaining it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I get home, I’ll have to thank the person who has been tending to the grave properly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I place yellow sunflowers, my sister’s favorite, in the water basin and offer her favorite pudding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry it’s imported sunflowers…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, lighting the incense with a lighter, I bring my palms together and face the grave.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nee-san, everyone is doing fine…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">These words probably won’t reach my sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe this may be nothing more than just an empty act.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But even so, I believe that this simple act of bringing my palms together is the only thing we, the living, can do for her, who has passed on.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Nee-san, there are many things I must apologize to you for today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family broke the promises we made with you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family trivialized your death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family learned nothing from your passing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We continued to fail, using your death as an excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The year since you’ve been gone has been incredibly difficult.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『The most terrifying caves hide the greatest treasures.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s a saying Natsumi-neesan often used.</p>
<p class="calibre5">True to that saying, it’s been a year of confronting the weight of responsibility and reevaluating what’s truly important.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family has reflected and turned over a new leaf.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We took a roundabout way, but I think we finally understand what really matters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So please, give our family another chance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, let us keep the promises we made with you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because, within this year, I have come to understand the gravity of responsibility and obligation… And at the end of that responsibility lay the real treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s the answer we’ve arrived at, after all our trials and tribulations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Harune, she’s seriously practicing the violin now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The girl who despised even looking at a violin since that birthday is now happily playing it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Dad and Mom were on the verge of divorce, but now they’re incredibly close.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You won’t believe it, but they even went on a date together recently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even that idiot Takashi is doing well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s currently working part-time feverishly to buy a gift for his girlfriend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Also… Nee-san, I have someone I like now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ultimately, the reason Harune started playing the violin, the reason our estranged parents are now reconciled, the reason I made up with a childhood friend I’d fought with&mdash; it’s all thanks to him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s pathetic, but I don’t think things would have turned out this well if it were up to me alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s okay.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found something far more important than my silly pride.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the sake of what’s truly important, my own pride seems irrelevant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“He has a complex about his name, he’s kind, funny… and in some ways, he reminds me of you, Nee-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, don’t worry about me, I’m doing well…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The one I like… I wish he could have met you, Nee-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I imagine you two would hit it off right away because you’re so alike.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mind drifts into fantasies.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but imagine introducing him to you and seeing you jump for joy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also found myself thinking of how thrilled you’d be if Hakuba-kun showed you one of his magic tricks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;But that’s an unfulfillable dream.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;It’s an impossible wish.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I guess it’s still a little lonely without you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ever since I met him, I’ve been chasing an unattainable illusion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe I’m seeking happiness beyond what I deserve now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll come again…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Next time, I’ll bring him along.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I gave a light wave to the gravestone and turned my back on her.</p>
