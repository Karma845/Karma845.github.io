<h1>Prologue: A sad school romantic comedy about a former protagonist who became a mob character</h1>


<p class="calibre5">Until I was in high school, I didn’t think of myself as a mob character in any way. In fact, I even thought that I was close to the main character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, after I became a high school student and met that guy, I realized that I was just a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I met Ryoma Ryuzaki, I was reminded that I was a minor character due to my meeting with the …… harem-like protagonist.</p>



<p class="calibre5">　And I became a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">　I ended up living an boring school life, where I couldn’t tell a story, and I was always absent-minded in the corner of the classroom.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Today, too, I was looking at the girls I used to love from the corner of the classroom.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Ryoma Onii-chan? Let’s go buy a swimsuit together.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">A small girl with black hair tied in two pigtails was sitting on Ryuzaki’s lap. She was my younger stepsister.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Our birthdays were only a few months apart, but I was born a few months earlier than she was, so I was her older stepbrother. Since my parents remarried when I was very young, we have been like brother and sister.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My stepsister, Azusa Nakayama, who used to be very fond of me, was completely obsessed with Ryuzaki. It was heartbreaking to see her trying so hard to get his attention.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, a while ago, she used to spoil me like that ……, but lately we don’t talk much anymore, and I was a little sad.</p>



<p class="calibre5">” It’s only May. Isn’t it too early for swimsuits?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What? But I want Ryoma to see me in a swimsuit. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Well, I want to see it!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki is laughing while patting Azusa’s head. Azusa was also smiling happily.</p>



<p class="calibre5">They were making out in the middle of the classroom even though it was break time. Azusa was a shy girl, so she wasn’t really good at drawing attention. But because she loves Ryuzaki, she’s pampering him like that, regardless of whether it’s in public or not.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was terribly painful to see that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“But it’s okay, isn’t it?　It’s a little early, but you can at least look at it.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The one who leaned forward in defiance of Azusa was a beautiful young girl with long black hair. She’s a childhood friend of mine.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yuzuki Hojo. She’s small in stature, but has a nice body and is popular with all the boys at school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She is popular with all the boys at school. “Actually, my …… b*****s have gotten a little bigger,” she said. That’s why the swimsuit I bought last year doesn’t fit …….”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, really?　Hmmm, the swimsuit is …… that’s a big deal.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yuzuki must have had a complex about her large b*****s. However, in an attempt to be liked by Ryuzaki, even if only a little, she makes comments that emphasize her b*****s.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was a painful experience for me to see her trying to change herself to be loved by the person she loves.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Ryu-kun’s lewd. You really want to see a girl in a swimsuit, don’t you? If that’s the case, why don’t you just tell me honestly that you want to see it? ♪”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The one poking Ryuzaki’s cheek with excitement was a girl with bright blonde hair that looked good on her. She was my best friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Asakura Kirari. She was a gal, or rather, a girl with an overall flamboyant atmosphere. Her b*****s weren’t as big as Yuzuki’s, but she wore her school uniform loosely, so you could see a little of her chest. Her skirt was also too short, and for a high school boy in his adolescence, it was a sight for their eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay to tell us ~ ♪ Look, Ryu-kun … Be honest.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“… I want to see it. I want to see a girl in her swimsuit!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Do you want to see my b*****s? If so, I can show you.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">　With that said, Kirari deliberately bent forward and showed her chest to Tatsuzaki.I’m sure Tatsuzaki can see even the intimate parts … I can’t see it from my perspective, but since he had a d***y look on his face, I figured it all out.</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… Until high school, she was a more mature girl. To be precise, until the day of my high school entrance ceremony, she kept her black hair in a bun. She also wore glasses, and was a normal girl who wore her school uniform properly. She and I were pretty much on the same page, and we chatted a lot. …… When she met Ryuzaki at the entrance ceremony and learned that he liked flashy girls, she completely changed her image.</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… When I see Kirari abandoning her old self to become the type of person the person she loves likes, it still makes my heart ache. That girl I once liked was nowhere to be found.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(… Damn it.)</p>



<p class="calibre5">I clench my fists under my desk.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In the past, until I became a high school student, it was me who was in the position of …… Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was on good terms with those three people, and I should have been with them all the I thought I was good friends with the three of them and was always with them, but …… now I’m completely out of the loop.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve always thought of myself as a protagonist.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I had a cute stepsister, a beautiful childhood friend, and a good and charming best friend. I thought I was going to have a great time with the three of them in high school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But reality is cruel.</p>



<p class="calibre5">At the entrance ceremony of my high school, Ryuzaki stole everything from me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The three guys that I liked have become completely obsessed with Ryoma Ryuzaki. In addition, to add to the annoyance, …… Ryuzaki seems to be a “harem protagonist,” and there are many more girls around him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In addition to the three, there are a number of other girls in class, such as the small girl who looks like a small animal, the senior student council president, and the leader of the kendo club in the same year.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And even now, in addition to the three of them, there is one more member of the Ryuzaki harem.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“This is why I’m going to go look at swimsuits after school. …… Would you like to go too, Shiho?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki turned around and looked back. In the seat directly behind him sat a girl named Shiho Shimotsuki, a childhood friend of his who seemed to be the oldest member of the Ryuzaki harem.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She had probably been sleeping with her head down for a long time, but when Ryuzaki called out to her, she looked up as if she was bored. She seems to have Scandinavian blood and her lightly pigmented hair is very beautiful.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She is a fragile, or rather …… delicate, transparent girl, like glasswork.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It is not an exaggeration to say that she is the bestlooking girl in the school. She is Ryuzaki’s childhood friend. I wonder how lucky he is with women.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Were you asleep again? You always look sleepy, Shiho.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He seemed to be trying to pet her, but she gave him a slight look of disgust and lightly brushed his hand away.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………what?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then she asked him what he wanted with a blank expression.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m not sure if she doesn’t talk much or not. She is usually very quiet and never speaks until she is spoken to by others.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Even when she is spoken to by her childhood friend, Ryuzaki, she only says the bare minimum like this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seems that Ryuzaki really loves her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Perhaps more than the three girls I love, …… or any of the other girls, Ryuzaki is probably more in love with Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In fact, he even went out of his way to ask her to go shopping with him now.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Usually, Ryuzaki doesn’t ask girls out on his own. He is always passive, with the exception of Shimotsuki. She was the only one that Ryuzaki always asked out.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki’s answer is always the same.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“………… no.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Two sounds were uttered and she dropped her face down again. She buried her face in her arm pillow and went to sleep.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what she’s thinking, but I strongly felt her intention, not to go.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Really? Then I’ll ask you out again some other time, okay?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I guess Ryuzaki is used to being rejected. He immediately turned his face back and returned to his conversation the other three.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Watching these scenes from the corner of the classroom was the daily life of …… me, Kotaro Nakayama.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s been about a month since I entered high school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve been spending my days like this since I first encountered Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel lonely.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The people I loved so much were crazy about someone else. It was too painful to even try to look good.</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I became a high school student, I realized that I was not the main character.　Apparently, I was a “mob character”.</p>



<p class="calibre5">A minor role in the story, unable to create any story. Or perhaps I was a tool to make the characters more appealing.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I must have played a supporting role for Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ m just a tool to explain that the hero Ryoma is attractive enough to make the three heroines …… Azusa, Yuzuki and Kirari fall in love with him, who were trapped by the false hero called me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wanted to have a …… girlfriend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wanted to make the person I loved happy and have them make me happy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But it’s unlikely to be possible again.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m not going to be able to do that again, because the girls I loved have already fallen in love with someone other than me.</p>



<h2 class="site-title">Chapter 1: The Silent Girl Becomes Talkative Only in Front of Me</h2>







<p class="calibre5">I suddenly realized that school was already over.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As I walked home alone, my mind was filled with thoughts of those girls.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Azusa and her friends are probably on a date with Ryuzaki right now. ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not just my stepsister Azusa. My childhood friend, Yuzuki, and my best friend, Kirari, all went shopping with Ryuzaki. In addition, they were going to try on swimsuits. …… The thought of Ryuzaki seeing the three of them in their swimsuits was enough to damage my brain.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, I’m not in a position to be jealous anymore.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">This is probably the resentment of an ugly mob character. I really can’t get over the fact that Ryuzaki is able to do things that I couldn’t do. I guess that’s what they call a ‘harem protagonist’.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m home!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I came home, I was alone, of course.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My parents are away on vacation, so I’m living with my stepsister, Azusa. Until a while ago, I was always with Azusa. I’m sure we loved each other as a single family, but after meeting …… Ryuzaki, Azusa became obsessed with him and began to despise me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">You can’t blame her for that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not unreasonable for high school students in their adolescence to become obsessed with someone they love.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s my fault.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If I couldn’t keep Azusa’s heart intact, I shouldn’t be so rude as to wish for something else.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Now that I’m free, what should I do?</p>



<p class="calibre5">I had a math assignment to complete, so I headed to my room to get it done.</p>



<p class="calibre5">　…… I used to study together with my best friend Kirari.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The night before the exam, we were both on the verge of passing, so we stayed up all night studying hard. I’ll never forget the feeling of our hands high-fiving after passing the exam.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to interact with her again.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, I forgot my textbook.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wondered if it was because I was thinking about something negative.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The bad things come in waves, and to my surprise, my math textbook was not in my bag. I was in trouble. …… The printouts for the assignment were quite difficult, so I couldn’t do it without the textbook.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In a situation like this, it would usually be easier to borrow it from my neighbor Yuzuki or my stepsister Azusa, but we haven’t been talking much lately, so it was awkward.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It couldn’t be helped. It’s a bit far, but I’ll go to the school to pick it up.</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s what I thought and went outside. I walked to the nearest bus stop and was about to take the bus, when I realized that I had left my wallet at home.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Forget it. Let’s just walk. ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was already tired. I know it would be faster to go home to get my wallet, but I was in the mood to walk, so I decided to walk.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My school, Hakuun Daini High School, is about an hour’s walk away. I could have walked there, but by the time I got there, it would be already past 5pm.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(It’ll be past 6:00 p.m. when I get home. ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">What should I eat this evening?　</p>



<p class="calibre5">In the past, my childhood friend Yuzuki would come over to my house to make dinner, but that hasn’t been the case lately. My stepsister, Azusa, seems to be staying at Ryuzaki’s house and treating him to dinner, and I’m eating alone more often than not.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve been eating alone more and more. Well, I guess I should just eat something. At worst, I wouldn’t die even if I didn’t eat.</p>



<p class="calibre5">With that in mind, I headed for the classroom. Most of the students were already gone. The only ones who were left were those who were doing club activities.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(I wonder if Azusa and the others are having fun right now. ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">While thinking about this, I opened the door to the classroom.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I thought there would be no one there, but there was a girl inside …….</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Eh? Shimotsuki …?)</p>



<p class="calibre5">The seat right behind Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">There, a white-haired girl was lying face down, breathing in her sleep.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Nnya…… fumuu.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is asleep, breathing a cute tune.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wondered if she was sleeping soundly. She was talking faintly in her sleep.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(What should I do, ……?　Should I wake her up?)</p>



<p class="calibre5">For the time being, I will take out the math textbook from my seat.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was hoping that Shimotsuki would sense my presence and wake up, but she was fast asleep.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wondered if I should just pretend I hadn’t seen anything and go home.　 From the way Shimotsuki has reacted so far, it seems that she does not like to be woken up. Even when it was her childhood friend Ryuzaki, her reaction to being woken up was not good.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, I don’t really know what she is thinking because she is always expressionless.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Well, it doesn’t matter if people hate me. I’m a mob character anyway.)</p>



<p class="calibre5">Rather than being hated, I felt guilty about leaving her like this and going home.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If Shimotsuki continues to doze off, and returns home late, and is attacked by a suspicious person,……, I feel unnecessary worry.</p>



<p class="calibre5">This is how cute this Shiho Shimotsuki girl looks.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She has such good looks that even Ryuzaki, who is not in need of a woman, can’t help but admire her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Probably, it would be better to go home while there is still daylight as much as possible.</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s what I thought, so I decided to wake up Shimotsuki, ready to be hated.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hey. School is over.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I tried to be low-key at first.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki remains asleep.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Muhehe …”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wonder if she’ s having a very happy dream. She has a lazy smile on her face. I was a little nervous to see her smile, which I don’t usually see.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Damn, I feel kind of bad for looking at her. ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t trying to look at her, but I felt guilty for seeing her sleeping face. I reached out my hand to wake her up quickly, but then I remembered what happened earlier and stopped.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Come to think of it, Shimotsuki wasn’t very good at being touched, was she? ……)</p>



<p class="calibre5">When Ryuzaki tried to pat her head, she didn’t like it and brushed his hand away.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think she’s not very good at being touched. Even her childhood friend Ryuzaki was rejected by her, so she must be really bad at it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Thinking this, I decided to shake the desk lightly.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As I shook it, I called out to her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hey. If you don’t get up soon, the sun will set.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">This time, I tried to shout a little harder. That was all I could do, and it seemed that I had finally succeeded in reaching Shimotsuki’s consciousness.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“………… Huh?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">At the same time as her distracted voice leaked out, she slowly looked up.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">She was about to drool, but then she must have remembered that she was at school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She hurriedly covered her mouth and looked at me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her face was a little …… red, unlike her usual expressionless face.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Did you …… see that?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’ll lend you my …… handkerchief.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I offered her a handkerchief from my pocket, which she hurriedly took and wiped her mouth.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, thank you …… I showed you something embarrassing.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She looked away, perhaps embarrassed.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As I watched her, I was taken aback.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(This is the first time I’ve seen Shimotsuki speak more than a few words. ……!)</p>



<p class="calibre5">Apparently, something was wrong with her ……, or rather, she seemed different from usual.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">In the past, she was unresponsive and uncommunicative in front of Ryuzaki, but now she seems a little different.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry I woke you up so suddenly.　But it’s after school. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What…? …… I’m sorry for having you wake me up.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki bows her head obediently.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The gesture was so unexpected that I was stunned once again.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I didn’t expect to be thanked.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“‘……?　What’s up with you? You look surprised.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">No, because …… I always thought of you as a quiet girl, but it turns out you’re not.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“You have a funny face. You look like my dad, who laughs when he’s fed steak in bed. Mom loves him so much that she makes him too much food in the morning, doesn’t she? Can’t you just put yourself in my place and let me get along with you? ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is much more talkative than I expected.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s what was so strange&ndash;</p>




<h2 class="site-title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 2: The Harem protagonist’s childhood friend likes to talk.</strong></h2>



<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s getting late. …… Thank you so much for waking me up. I tend to sleep too much at school. … I mean, it’s boring, isn’t it?　There’s nothing to do but sleep. But at home, I stay up late, you know? I enjoy a lot of TV, anime, online games, and so on.”</p>


<p id="calibre_link-829" class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki, whom I had thought to be a quiet person, was very talkative and told me many things even though I hadn’t asked her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-830" class="calibre5">“But if I come home late, my mom and dad will be worried. I know I”m already in high school, so I don”t think a 6 p.m. curfew is a very acceptable time for me. …… I wish they”d leave me to my own devices. Don’t you think so?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-831" class="calibre5">“Huh? Yeah, yeah. …… Yeah, maybe.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-832" class="calibre5">In the classroom after school, a beautiful white-haired girl is looking at me, smiling and laughing. I felt as if I was dreaming.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-833" class="calibre5">“Oh, you never told me why. Hey, why are you surprised? Did I do something to surprise you? If so, I would like to apologize, but it would be strange to apologize without knowing the reason.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-834" class="calibre5">“Yes, there’s no need to apologize, but …… you’re always so quiet, I didn’t expect you to talk so much.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-835" class="calibre5">I told her how I honestly felt.</p>



<p class="calibre5">　But she’s flabbergasted.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… Quiet?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-836" class="calibre5">Her face looked like she was asking, “How do you know I don’t talk much?”. So I continued my explanation</p>



<p id="calibre_link-837" class="calibre5">“Well, I’m your classmate, so I see you every once in a while. …… Most of the time, you’re asleep, and when you do talk, it’s just one word, so I assumed you didn’t talk much. …… I thought you were quiet.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-838" class="calibre5">Maybe she doesn’t know me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t recognize me because I’ m a mob character and I’m always in a fog of people. So, I figured that she was confused by the fact that a complete stranger knew who she was, but that seemed to be only my negative thoughts.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-839" class="calibre5">” I know you’re my classmate, I know you’re number 25, Kotaro Nakayama, and I know that like me you don’t have any friends and you’re always in a daze.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-840" class="calibre5">“Oh, really?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-841" class="calibre5">I was surprised.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was most surprised that such a cute girl knew such a simple guy like me. But she laughed good-naturedly and patted me on the chest.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-842" class="calibre5">“Oh, are you making fun of me? I’m not that stupid. …… I’m sorry! I’ve always wanted to try this. I don’t have any friends, so I’ve been longing for this kind of playfulness.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-843" class="calibre5">The poke on my chest made me a little nervous.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And more than anything, seeing that quiet, icy beauty smiling with a red face like a tomato made me feel embarrassed.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-844" class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki was perhaps a little excited.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-845" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-846" class="calibre5">“It’s fun to chat with you like this. Today is a wonderful day. …… I was sleeping and Nakayama-kun spoke to me. I’m not very good at talking to people, so I waited for a long time, you know?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-847" class="calibre5">“Huh?…..”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-848" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-849" class="calibre5">“How about …… Naka-chan then? Oh, no. She looks like an idol from a fleet game. Nakayama-kun doesn’t look like an idol, so how about …… Can I call you Happy Taro-kun? Hmm, that sounds like a snack of cabbage.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-850" class="calibre5">I’ve never seen a girl think of a nickname with such joy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I also think I’ve never seen anyone talk so quickly at once.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-851" class="calibre5">I also thought it was quite rare for the conversation to go off on a tangent in so many different directions.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-852" class="calibre5">“Isn’t Shimotsuki …… supposed to be a quiet person?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-853" class="calibre5">Back to the topic at hand. She knew me. If that was the case, why was she upset when I said she was quiet?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-854" class="calibre5">She gave me a better explanation than what I was looking for.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-855" class="calibre5">“I’m not a quiet person.　I’m not a quiet person. …… Well, I don’t have any friends, so I just don’t get a chance to talk to anyone. I’m also a little shy……, but I love chatting with people like this. It’s rude to call me a quiet .”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-856" class="calibre5">She poked me on my chest again. I think it’s a bit misdirected to call it joking around. …… It’s probably true that she didn’t have any friends.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-857" class="calibre5">This girl’s talk was too one-sided.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-858" class="calibre5">She said so many things in rapid succession that I didn’t have time to interrupt her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-859" class="calibre5">If that’s the case, why was she so quiet in front of …… that guy?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-860" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-861" class="calibre5">“But Ryuzaki talks to you a lot, why haven’t you talked to him so far? I’ve watched you from time to time, but I’ve never seen you talking to Ryuzaki.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-862" class="calibre5">I forcefully insert the topic into our conversation. I had to do that, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to end Shimotsuki’s speech.</p>






<p id="calibre_link-864" class="calibre5">And that’s what I’ve always wanted to ask her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… She told me why she was so talkative only in front of me.</p>







<p id="calibre_link-866" class="calibre5">“Ryoma Ryuzaki…………”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-867" class="calibre5">The moment I mentioned that name, the color disappeared from Shimotsuki’s face.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-868" class="calibre5">She reverted back to the transparent and cold girl that I always see, and said this in an emotionless voice.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-869" class="calibre5">“Please don’t tell anyone. …… I’m really not fond of that guy. He talks to me a lot, he’s been next to me since I was little, and he’s creepy.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-870" class="calibre5">“Eh !?”</p>




<p id="calibre_link-872" class="calibre5">The reason seemed to be simple.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The main character of the popular and harem protagonist, Ryuzaki, probably liked his childhood friend, Shiho Shimotsuki, who hated …… him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-873" class="calibre5">“I’m not a fan of those who cheat on others. I like boys who are straightforward and honest. …… I like boys who are naive, quiet, and kind enough to listen to me.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-874" class="calibre5">Furthermore, he was messing up.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I see … she hates people who unfaithful.</p>




<p id="calibre_link-876" class="calibre5">If so, it seems that Ryuzaki’s feelings will never be rewarded.</p>

<h2 class="site-title">Chapter 3: Childhood friends do not always become heroines</h2>


<p class="calibre5">In the classroom after school, a white-haired girl spun her words.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Glowing in the reflection of the sunset coming through the window, she looked somewhat divine.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-950" class="calibre5">Her skin, her hair, and her being were all transparent, and looking at her made me feel somewhat restless.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-951" class="calibre5">It’s hard to find a girl who is so out of touch with the world.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I had expected her to be quiet, cool and as cold as ice.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But in reality, she was completely different.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-952" class="calibre5">“It’s true that Ryuzaki-kun and I have known each other since childhood.　But that doesn’t mean we were close. …… We only live in the same neighborhood, and I don’t remember us playing together much, nor were our parents close to each other.　I don’t know if you can call this a childhood friendship.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-953" class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is quite a talker.</p>



<p class="calibre5">No, it is not quite that. She is a very vocal girl.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-954" class="calibre5">“I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence that we went to the same high school. I never consciously wanted to go to the same school as him. I don’t know if he had any other options.　It’s creepy, he always asked me where I’m planning to go to high school, it’s like he’s stalking me.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-955" class="calibre5">No, I don’t think he’s a stalker. …… I think Ryuzaki likes Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was curious to see how she would react if I told her that, but I thought that was indeed unfortunate.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-956" class="calibre5">By the way, it’s not Ryuzaki. It was Shimotsuki who was pitiful.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Fate is awful. I have the right to choose, but why does it keep trying to get to me like that? …… Ugh, I feel a shiver run down my spine. I don’t like the sound of his voice. …… It sounds like an insensitive, self-centered person who can’t perceive the feelings of others.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-957" class="calibre5">I know it sounds harsh, but it seems that she understands the true nature of Ryuzaki because they are literally childhood friends connected by their decaying relationship.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-958" class="calibre5">It is true that he is insensitive. Especially when it comes to love, he’s very unaware of it. Even when my stepsister, childhood friend or former best friend like him, he can’t read their feelings. I think he’s dense and dull.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-959" class="calibre5">That’s what Shimotsuki doesn’t seem to like about him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-960" class="calibre5">“People who use such a tone hurt a lot of people. But that’s not a problem that can be dismissed as being dull, and I think it also requires a greater effort to understand the feelings of others. …… Ugh, that gives me the chills. If he liked me, I’d have to carry the grief of all the other girls. It’s hard, and I feel like crying when I think of all those girls who won’t get their reward.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-961" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki held her arms together and rubbed them as if she was really cold.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-962" class="calibre5">Yeah ……, after all, Ryuzaki might like you, right? I can’t say that. I felt that if I said it, Shimotsuki would probably have a stroke.</p>





<p id="calibre_link-964" class="calibre5">I think that’s how much she dislikes Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-965" class="calibre5">“So, although we’re childhood friends, we’re just acquaintances, okay? Pfft. Oh, that was just how I show my anger. My mom says it’s ‘cute’ when I do it like this, but I wonder if she’s right. I don’t think it works very well.”</p>





<p id="calibre_link-967" class="calibre5">…… She’ s very talkative.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-968" class="calibre5">She was so quiet in front of Ryuzaki, still it was surprising.</p>






<p id="calibre_link-970" class="calibre5">” You were just being unsociable because you’re not fond of Ryuzaki, but the real Shimotsuki is like this.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was surprised, but I couldn’t help but understand.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m not a fan of Ryuzaki either. It’s a personal grudge, because the people I loved were taken away from me, so I don’t think it’s strictly the same feeling as Shimotsuki.</p>





<p id="calibre_link-972" class="calibre5">But if that’s the case,……, then there was still a question.</p>





<p id="calibre_link-974" class="calibre5">“Then why did you show your true colors to someone like me?　I don’t think I’m someone who’s attractive enough to be liked by Shimotsuki.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-975" class="calibre5">Why did it have to be me?</p>



<p class="calibre5">I just happened to be in the classroom after school. It was a shame to show the real Shimotsuki to such a person.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-976" class="calibre5">Why did they give me a special look to this loser who was such a mob character and couldn’t even hold together the hearts of the people who he loved ……?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-977" class="calibre5">Seeing me in such a negative mood, Shimotsuki smiled happily.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Apparently, there is a good reason&ndash;</p>



<h2 class="site-title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 4: The Person, they love, loves the Person, who likes me</strong></h2>







<p class="calibre5">Why is Shimotsuki so talkative only around me?</p>



<p class="calibre5">She told me why.</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1047" class="calibre5">“You know, I have very good hearing.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1048" class="calibre5">I instinctively lean forward.</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1050" class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>






<p class="calibre5">“I mean it literally. I was born with good hearing, so I can usually tell by the sound of a …… person’s voice or heartbeat what kind of feelings they are having. That’s why I don’t like Ryuzaki-kun. The sound he makes is dull and harmless, just background noise.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1052" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s ears twitched, as if she had a nerve connection. She continued to talk, showing off her impressive skills in a low-key way.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1053" class="calibre5">“In this respect, your sound is very delicate. I can hear the sound of sadness, pain and sorrow. At the same time, I also hear a strange sound like strong grudge. Ummm, that’s a strange sound. It’s creepy. It’s interesting how they all work together in harmony to create these sounds.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She shuffled her feet and closed her eyes to listen.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She closed her eyes and listened, as if she was checking my sound.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1054" class="calibre5">I’ve been looking for an opportunity to talk to you like this for a long time. …… Wow, Nakayama-kun is just what I expected. He participates in a lot of my chatter ….I don’t think we’re a bad match.”</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1056" class="calibre5">…… She’ s saying a lot of complicated things.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In short, this girl…</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1057" class="calibre5">“You mean you like me?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1058" class="calibre5">“That’s the best way to sum it up.　It would be more pleasant to say that we seemed to have good chemistry.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1059" class="calibre5">Apparently, that’s what she meant.</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I heard those words, I …… became aware of a swirling dark emotion in my chest.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1060" class="calibre5">(The childhood friend that Ryuzaki likes, likes me……!)</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s as though I succeeded in getting back at him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1061" class="calibre5">A wicked feeling boiled up in my chest. I know I shouldn’t think like that, but I couldn’t help it.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1062" class="calibre5">It was as if I had taken away the loved one of the person, who had taken away the people I loved.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I felt such a sensation, and at the same time, I felt pity for myself for thinking such a thing.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1063" class="calibre5">I’m sure the girls hated me for having such a personality,…… and as I was thinking about such strange things, Shimotsuki unexpectedly put her hand on my chest.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1064" class="calibre5">“Yeah and …… Nakayama, you sound so weird sometimes. I hear a sound that is riddled with self-loathing, or rather …… that makes me want to cry when I hear it. It’s like a kitten purring desperately in a cardboard box on a rainy day.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1065" class="calibre5">I wondered if she was checking the sound of my heart.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The touch of her thin, small fingers make me feel a little nervous.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1066" class="calibre5">Seeing me like that, she laughed again.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1067" class="calibre5">“I have a habit of wanting to cheer up people who are sad. Nakayama-kun looks like you’ re in a lot of pain. …… I’d be happy to cheer you up, even if only a little. It’s not a problem. I grew up with a wonderful mom and dad who loved me a lot, so I’m full of love. If I keep getting so much, God will get angry, so I’ll share some of it with you.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1068" class="calibre5">I was taken aback by Shimotsuki’s smiling face as she said this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I thought she was a girl with a unique view of the world.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1069" class="calibre5">But there is also a feeling of joy in being liked by such a girl…….</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not that I’m trying to get back at Ryuzaki, but it’s pure joy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1070" class="calibre5">“I’d also like to make friends with you, talk to you, play games with you, if you’d like. I’ve been so lonely and I’m starving for friends. Also, sometimes they make you have a partner in class or something. I’m not good at that either, and I need help.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1071" class="calibre5">“I feel like there’s a lot …… going on here.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1072" class="calibre5">Rather, I feel that there is more going on here.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1073" class="calibre5">But I couldn’t be happier if such a wonderful girl would be my friend.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1074" class="calibre5">“I look forward to working with you from now on, Nakayama-kun.”</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1076" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki innocently reached out her hand to me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m not sure if I should grab her hand or not……, but by then Shimotsuki had already grabbed my hand forcefully.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1077" class="calibre5">“It’s so rude to hesitate.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1078" class="calibre5">When I saw her cheeks puff out, I couldn’t help but relax.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1079" class="calibre5">“Sorry. Pleased to be with you.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1080" class="calibre5">I said, and shook her hand tightly.</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s how I made a friend.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1081" class="calibre5">The person I was meeting, was the person I grew to love, …. the person I love&ndash;</p>



<h2 class="site-title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 5: My First Friend</strong></h2>


<p class="calibre5">And so, I made a friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My first friend in high school was a beautiful girl who was so out-of-this-world that I thought I’d never have a relationship with her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1148" class="calibre5">“Well, don’t do it. It’s time like this if you’re crazy about chatting … It’s almost dark, and it might be very dangerous for a girl to walk alone during this time. By the way, my friend Nakayama. What do you think?”</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1150" class="calibre5">“What do you mean, what do you think?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1151" class="calibre5">“I’m asking if I should be allowed to go home alone at a time like this. Do you think Nakayama-kun, a reasonable boy who just became my friend, will leave me, a beautiful girl, go home alone?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1152" class="calibre5">“I’ll walk you home …….”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t ignore such a blatant demand for a walk home.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1153" class="calibre5">“But wouldn’t you hate it, if someone saw you walking alone with me?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I thought to myself, “If I’m such a mob character, I won’t be able to balance the cute heroine, Shimotsuki.” That’s what I thought, but it doesn’t seem to matter to her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1154" class="calibre5">“I don’t understand why you think I don’t want to. I don’t understand why you are so negative when all I want to do is go home with my friends. Do you want me to comfort you? Alright, good boy, why don’t you come home with me?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1155" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki stands up and pats me on the head.</p>



<p class="calibre5">No, wait a minute … I don’t want that.</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1157" class="calibre5">I mean.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1158" class="calibre5">This person looked like she didn’t want Ryuzaki to pat her head, but I wonder if it’s okay for her to pat me. …… No, it’s not. It’s not that she doesn’t like the act of being patted, it’s simply that she doesn’t want to be touched, because she doesn’t like Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1159" class="calibre5">This girl seems to have a weakness for Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I thought it was kind of rare to have a childhood friend heroine who rejects the popular and harem-oriented hero.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1160" class="calibre5">Normally, the heroine would take the initiative to become a member of the harem.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1161" class="calibre5">“Come on, let’s go. I’ve always wanted to go home with my friends like this. It’s so nice to be a student. …… Hey, what do you want to talk about? I have a lot of hobbies, even though I may look like this.　I like games, anime, TV, anything. Ah, but, you know, no comics and novels, okay? I’m not very good at reading and writing.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1162" class="calibre5">As she leads me on her way, she continues to speak in rapid succession.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1163" class="calibre5">I’m not sure if this is really a conversation, but it’s interesting to hear what kind of things Shimotsuki is interested in.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1164" class="calibre5">Surprisingly, she likes subcultures. No, it’s not surprising. It seems that hobbies that used to be called otaku a long time ago are becoming more common nowadays.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1165" class="calibre5">“But first, you know what? It’s a little strange to call you “Nakayama-kun” when you’re my friend. …… It’s more convenient to have a nickname. What do you think? Do you have any suggestions, Nakayama-kun?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1166" class="calibre5">And it seems that Shimotsuki is obsessed with nicknames.</p>



<p class="calibre5">For her, a friend seems to mean a person who calls someone by a particular nickname.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1167" class="calibre5">“Hmmm, what should we do?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1168" class="calibre5">We walked out of the school gate and down the street.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Speaking of which, where does Shimotsuki live? I don’t know where she lives, but since I said I’d walk her home, I’ll have to follow her home, wherever she goes.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1169" class="calibre5">I’ll be alone when I get home anyway.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t have to worry about the time.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1170" class="calibre5">“I think anything is fine.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1171" class="calibre5">“It doesn’t matter what. Nakayama-kun is so unaffected. …… He’s just like me when Ryuzaki-kun is next to me. You can’t be that boring, okay? Meh.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1172" class="calibre5">“…… That would mean that Shimotsuki is a boring person, is that okay with you?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1173" class="calibre5">“You’re right. I’m a very boring person in front of Ryuzaki-kun, but I think it’s a little strange that he talks to me like that. What’s so good about a girl like me who’ s unsociable and doesn’t talk? Is it the face? Then why doesn’t he just thank my mom and dad for giving me those genes instead of me?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1174" class="calibre5">I think you’re missing the point a little.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe she has a disease that kills her if she doesn’t talk to me all the time. We talked the whole way home. It was strange because she seemed to be enjoying talking even though I was only giving her a few cues in between.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1175" class="calibre5">But it seems that Shimotsuki just likes to talk, not that she’ s good at it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Since then, we’ve been going off on too many off-topic conversations and haven’t been able to talk about the main topic. In the end, we couldn’t even decide on a nickname.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1176" class="calibre5">“Oh? It looks like we’ ve already arrived at my house. …… It’ s so much fun to chat with friends. The always boring way home went by so fast and I think I got a little excited. Thank you for keeping me company, Nakayama-kun.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1177" class="calibre5">Smiling, she shook my hand one last time.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She said she was shaking hands with me, but this girl seemed to be very close to her friends. It was unexpected and made me nervous.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1178" class="calibre5">“See you tomorrow.”</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1180" class="calibre5">“Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow …”</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1182" class="calibre5">With a final wave, she walked into the house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The Shimotsuki family was a house like any other. I thought she might have come from a rich family because of her out-of-this-world appearance, but she seemed more normal than I thought.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1183" class="calibre5">“I should go back too …….”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1184" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s house was quite close to the school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s only about fifteen minutes away and since it’s in the same direction as my house, I can walk straight home.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1185" class="calibre5">I was already used to walking home alone.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Today, thanks to Shimotsuki……, my walk was easier than usual.</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 6: The talkative Shiho-chan is very shy</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">When I wake up in the morning, I make sure that my stepsister, Azusa, is not next to me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It had become a daily routine for me. It’s been a long time since I felt her warmth, although she used to sneak into my futon when I was sleeping until junior high school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… staying over again today?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I didn’t see her in the other room beside me, so she was probably staying at Ryuzaki’s house. Come to think of it, are the Shimotsuki family neighbors of the Ryuzaki family? Maybe I passed by them yesterday when I was walking Shimotsuki home?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, so what?</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I prepare for the morning in silence. I haven’t eaten breakfast lately. It’s a pain in the a*s to prepare it myself.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s times like this that I realize how much I appreciate my parents. My parents were out of town on a business trip, but I wanted to see them for the first time in a long time.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe I’m starving for the warmth of someone.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In the past, there were girls who were close to me. My stepsister, Azusa, my childhood friend, Yuuki and my best friend, Kirari, ……, I thought we had a good relationship, but it seems I was wrong.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My life changed completely when the girls found someone they liked.</p>



<p class="calibre5">They’ re at the age where they fall in love. It’s understandable that they would be obsessed with someone, but the fact that he’s the harem protagonist, Ryuzaki Ryoma, is a little troubling.</p>



<p class="calibre5">This is not even jealousy ……, it’s just resentment.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s also a grudge, almost like the sad backstabbing of a mob character who can’t even be jealous.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Huh …… school, let’s go.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">There’s no point in being alone and aimless.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I left the house a little early. I took the bus to the school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But today was not my lucky day.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Just as I arrived at the school, I came across Ryuzaki flirting with his harem members.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was on my way from the school gate to the school building.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The girls were flirting without regard to the fact that they were being watched by others.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wish I didn’t have to be the one to see it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Get Ryoma’s right hand!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, that’s not fair. Then I’ll take his left hand!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">” Eh~? Where would I get one? Then, your back!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hey, this is heavy! I can’ t walk!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I felt like my brain was going to melt just by looking ……</p>



<p class="calibre5">I would have loved to have that done to me, but …… that dream never came true. Looking back, the girls were not very outgoing with me. Maybe they were just hanging out with me due to habit, and I didn’t really feel special to them.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I felt like my brain would get messed up if I kept looking at them, so I walked quickly past them.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I got pretty close to them, but they didn’t notice me. …… I was very sad about that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I guess I’ve become a mob character to them.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I am one of the many others, a part of the background, an existence that doesn’t matter whether I’m there or not.</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I realize this, I feel a sense of emptiness.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Just when I was about to become negative, I thought, “I’m just a piece of trash who can’t make anything out of my life. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I arrived at the classroom and took a seat.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As if she had been waiting for that moment, a girl walked up to me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The transparent silvery-white hair fluttered. She was so beautiful that I had the illusion that particles were dancing in her path, …… drawing gentle lines.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, good morning, …… good morning!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The only thing is that she seems to be acting a bit suspicious.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She was so talkative yesterday, but her mouth doesn’t seem to be working so well today.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, good morning ……, what’s up?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I called out to Shimotsuki as she came up to me, leaving behind her lovely footsteps.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(TLN: ( ・◇・)？)</p>



<p class="calibre5">She looks around and puts her face close to my ear.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I get a close-up of her beautiful face and I almost backed away.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was sitting on a chair so I could only lean back, but Shimotsuki moved closer as if to say that it didn’t matter.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then she said in a quiet voice.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“It’s not that I’m shy. I’m just too nervous to talk in front of other people. ……. I’m just a little cautious. In my previous life, I must have been an animal that was very territorial.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her moist breath brushed against my ear.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(TLN: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ )ԅ(‹o›Д‹o›ԅ)</p>



<p class="calibre5">It tickled me and I couldn’t help but laugh at her remark, because it was funny.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I see. Shimotsuki is a shy person, huh?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I see. So that’s why she can’t talk loudly and behaves suspiciously.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, she’s never going to admit it. She was shaking her head, as if she really didn’t want to be thought of as shy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“”No, no, no, it’s different!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t persuade her, because I couldn’t properly express myself.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">The talkative Shiho-chan seems to be very shy&ndash;</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 7: Intrusive Good Intentions are the Privilege of the Protagonist</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">My brain, which had been on the verge of melting since morning, seemed to be regenerating.</p>



<p class="calibre5">My mind was very troubled, but thanks to Shimotsuki talking to me, I was able to feel very calm.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1317" class="calibre5">Ah, …… that’s right, yesterday I became friends with this girl.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not that I forgot, but …… it slipped my mind because I was thinking about Azusa and the others.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1318" class="calibre5">When I’m thinking about bad things, I usually can’t think of anything positive. Maybe that’s what I was doing a short while ago.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1319" class="calibre5">“Oh, I’ m not shy. I’m not shy. …… You’re right, I don’t get nervous when I’m with my family. It’s also fine when it’s just the two of us alone……, but it’s still hard to get used to being watched by strangers.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1320" class="calibre5">Maybe she wanted to argue, but Shimotsuki was talking close to my ear. However, no matter how hard she tried, no matter how many excuses she made, she still looked shy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1321" class="calibre5">I think she is a bit of a shy person, or perhaps a introvert.</p>



<p class="calibre5">　</p>



<p class="calibre5">And from what I heard yesterday, she seems to have very keen hearing. She has a good ear, right?　Maybe that’s why she’s so concerned about the presence of others.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1322" class="calibre5">It was when, I was thinking about that.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1323" class="calibre5">At last, the Ryuzaki group, who had been flirting outside the school building, seemed to have arrived at the classroom.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1324" class="calibre5">“Hey, I’ve been feeling your b*****s for a while now, you know?”</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1326" class="calibre5">“You’re touching, right? You’re touching ~”</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1328" class="calibre5">“Well, Azusa’s b*****s are so small that it’s almost impossible to tell.　I have bigger b*****s than she does.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1329" class="calibre5">“B*****s aren’t about size, are they? The shape is also important ~ ♪”</p>






<p id="calibre_link-1331" class="calibre5">What in the world are they talking about? ……Suddenly, high-pitched voices spread, and everyone in the classroom looked at Ryuzaki and the others. But the girls were oblivious to their surroundings and kept flirting with him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1332" class="calibre5">“Hey, Ryoma-niichan? Tell me who’s the best?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1333" class="calibre5">“Who is the best, … I can’t decide&ndash;“</p>





<p id="calibre_link-1335" class="calibre5">That’s when it happened.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki’s gaze turned to me. I think he was looking for Shimotsuki. It’s always Shimotsuki that he’s chasing with his eyes.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1336" class="calibre5">And Ryuzaki saw it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki, his childhood friend, with her face close to my ear.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1337" class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1338" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1339" class="calibre5">Even though he hadn’t finished his conversation with Azusa and the others, he walked right up to us.</p>



<p class="calibre5">His eyes were intense as he stared at me. The hostility in his eyes was so blatant that it baffled me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1340" class="calibre5">“Oh, hey, Shiho? What’s going on? It’s rare to see you awake, since you’re usually asleep all the time. If there’s something wrong, I’ll help you.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1341" class="calibre5">He seemed to be in a rush, angry, or upset.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In response to Ryuzaki, who spoke to her with such an attitude, Shimotsuki …… instantly erased the color from her expression.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1342" class="calibre5">After all, she seems to be extremely uncomfortable with Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Just by talking to him, the lovely face that she had been showing me until a moment ago suddenly turned cold.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1343" class="calibre5">“………… not really.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1344" class="calibre5">Then she said only one word and turned away.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1345" class="calibre5">She was back to the quiet, ice-like Shimotsuki I had always seen.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1346" class="calibre5">However, the insensitive Ryuzaki doesn’t understand Shimotsuki’s feelings.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1347" class="calibre5">With his usual smug attitude, he is trying to impose his one-sided good will.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1348" class="calibre5">“How can there not be something? It’s unusual for Shiho to talk to strangers. …… Look, when you’re in trouble, it’s better to turn to someone who knows, right? Don’t be shy.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1349" class="calibre5">Ryuzaki tried to touch Shimotsuki’s shoulder in a friendly manner.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, she stepped back as if rejecting him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seemed like she was hiding behind me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1350" class="calibre5">Then, naturally, I would have to face Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1351" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1352" class="calibre5">” Uh, ……? I’m sorry. My childhood friend Shiho seems to have caused you trouble.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1353" class="calibre5">Then Ryuzaki looked at me with his head tilted.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1354" class="calibre5">The look on his face was like, “Was there a guy like this in my class?”. He looked as if he wanted to say that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Such an attitude made me feel as if my mind was turning cloudy and black. …… Such an image struck me.</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 8: The moment when the main character first recognizes a mob character</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">Oh, he didn’t even know who I was.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The protagonist didn’t even have mob characters in his field of vision.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(TLN: Bruh he be playin life in 4:3)</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was so frustrated by this that I then became …… annoyed.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1423" class="calibre5">“Don’t you know my name? It’s been over a month since the entrance ceremony, and you don’t even know your fellow classmate’s names?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1424" class="calibre5">My voice became agitated.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t control myself. I’m sure I’ m trying to stab Ryuzaki to death with the barbs of my words.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was about to say something I shouldn’t have, when I couldn’t control my frustration.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I know you, don’t I? You’re Ryoma Ryuzaki, right? You’re the one who’s good-looking, gets good grades, cooks well, and has lots of friends.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1425" class="calibre5">I know the protagonist-sama, because I’ m a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Or rather, he’s my classmate. I know his name regardless of whether he’s a protagonist or a mob character.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1426" class="calibre5">We’re on equal footing, he and I. We’re the same people, freshmen in high school.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1427" class="calibre5">“Can you at least remember their names? It’s rude to your classmates,” I nearly said something I wouldn’t have said under normal circumstances.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1428" class="calibre5">It’s not that I’m trying to pick a fight with him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But I feel like saying something unnecessary to this guy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1429" class="calibre5">That’s how much I dislike Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But the one who stopped me from doing so was that girl.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1430" class="calibre5">“Hai!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1431" class="calibre5">As if to step in between us.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Despite her obvious shyness, it was Shimotsuki, who was standing next to me watching the scene, who mustered up the courage to speak up loudly.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1432" class="calibre5">She seemed to have noticed that something was wrong with me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She interrupted me and then squeezed something into my hand.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1433" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1434" class="calibre5">“I’ll give this back, okay?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1435" class="calibre5">What she gave me was the handkerchief I had lent her yesterday.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I remembered, that I had lent it to her because she was drooling in her sleep.　 Then she said something to me in my ear.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1436" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1437" class="calibre5">“Calm down. You’ll get miserable, if you act like that. Here, I’ll share my feelings with you. …… I’ll see you later, okay?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1438" class="calibre5">With that, she went back to her seat.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Watching her go, I clutched the handkerchief and …… felt the faint warmth of Shimotsuki. The warmth soothed my rough heart.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1439" class="calibre5">Through the handkerchief, I felt as if her kind feelings were flowing into my body. ……</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1440" class="calibre5">That’s right. There’s nothing to be solved by venting my frustration.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It”s not like I can get anything by being angry here.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1441" class="calibre5">“…… Uh, what do you mean?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1442" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1443" class="calibre5">I guess he doesn’t know what’s going on. Ryuzaki was looking at me and Shimotsuki alternately with a puzzled look on his face.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was about to get annoyed again when I saw his face, but I took a small breath and regained my composure.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1444" class="calibre5">Yeah, I’m okay. There’s no point in fighting here.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m just a mob character anyway. It’s not like anything is going to change if I stand up to the protagonist.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1445" class="calibre5">So, as usual, I’ll just play it off.</p>



<p class="calibre5">With a fuzzy smile, I’ll become a part of the …… background like a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And that’s okay. It’s all right, because my feelings for the people I loved will never be reciprocated.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1446" class="calibre5">“I lent her my handkerchief yesterday. I just got that back, nothing special.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I say something appropriate and shrug my shoulders.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then, this time, I spoke a little more firmly.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“My name is Kotaro Nakayama. I’m a part of the same class as Ryuzaki. …… It would be great, if you could remember me.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1447" class="calibre5">I proclaimed this and glared at Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was at this moment that he finally recognized my existence.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1448" class="calibre5">He glared back at me strongly.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1449" class="calibre5">“Oh, I memorized it……. I’m looking forward to working with you, Nakayama.”<br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1450" class="calibre5">With that, Ryuzaki went back to his seat. I looked at his back and took a breath.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1451" class="calibre5">It was a close call, and I almost exploded.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s very misplaced to get angry with Ryuzaki in the first place.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1452" class="calibre5">I’m just a loser.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1453" class="calibre5">I should have been a mob character and kept quiet.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1454" class="calibre5">Besides, I almost caused trouble for Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1455" class="calibre5">I’ll have to thank her later for helping me out.</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 9: The silent Girl uses her expressions to speak</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately for the talkative Shimotsuki, she seemed to be shy and reserved and rarely spoke to me in public.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1524" class="calibre5">Even when class started and break time came around, she didn’t come over to me. I guess the reason she came to me in the morning was to return my handkerchief. She doesn’t talk to me unless she has something to say.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1525" class="calibre5">My seat was at the back of the class on the hallway side, and Shimotsuki’s seat was at the back by the window. Right in front of her was Ryuzaki, with Azusa and Yuuki sitting around him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1526" class="calibre5">The so-called protagonist’s seat was occupied by Shimotsuki. Well, I think Ryuzaki is more of a protagonist than Shimotsuki, but it seems the rule was not triggered by the seat change.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1527" class="calibre5">Anyway, I guess Shimotsuki and Ryuzaki really do have a rotten relationship. It’s strange that their seats are so close to each other.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki is not very good at talking to Ryuzaki, so she sleeps face down all the time to prevent him from talking to her too much.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1528" class="calibre5">That’s why Shimotsuki didn’t have a chance to talk to me in class this morning.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, I am concerned about the fact that she keeps glancing at me …… like she wants to say something, but she doesn’t come to me, so I don’t really understand.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1529" class="calibre5">As I was tilting my head, I was unexpectedly spoken to by a boy sitting next to me. His name was Souma Hanagishi. He was a classmate and an acquaintance that I only talked to once in a while. With a curious look on his face, he handed me a piece of paper.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1530" class="calibre5">“Nakayama, it came from someone nearby. …… It’s rather refreshing to get a letter in high school, isn’t it?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1531" class="calibre5">During math class, Hanagishi speaks to me in a whisper so that the teacher standing at the lectern won’t notice. What is the letter? I had no idea, so I accepted the letter, expressing my gratitude.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1532" class="calibre5">I took out the paper contained in a cute letterhead.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1533" class="calibre5">On it, “Dear Nakayama-kun” was written in cute round characters like an elementary school student.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1534" class="calibre5">Or rather, I’m curious about the hiragana. …… Since it is a name that uses only kanji learned in elementary school, I don’t think it’s difficult.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1535" class="calibre5">While thinking about this, I read through the words inside.</p>



<p class="calibre5">There was something like this written on it.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1536" class="calibre5">“Good Morning, Lunch, let’s eat. From “Your Friend”.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1537" class="calibre5">…… I see. The sender is Shimotsuki. She was the only friend I had in this class, so I knew right away.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1538" class="calibre5">But it was hmmm …… strange that she was a high school student but her writing was poor or …… strange. She doesn’t use kanji robustly, and her sentence structure is just weird. The round characters are cute, but unfortunately I didn’t feel any intelligence.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1539" class="calibre5">But I understood what she was trying to say.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She asked me to have lunch with her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1540" class="calibre5">Of course I agreed. I usually just eat the pastries I bought, at my seat during my lunch break, so it was no problem.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1541" class="calibre5">The only problem is how to reply. …… Should I send a letter to her as well?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1542" class="calibre5">But, as I thought, exchanging letters at this age is embarrassing.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wondered if there was any way I could tell her. I looked at Shimotsuki. Then I saw her glancing at me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1543" class="calibre5">She had her head on her hands, making it look like she was concentrating on the class, but her eyes were looking at me every few seconds. Because of this, I was also making eye contact with the students seated between me and Shimotsuki, but every time I did, they immediately looked away, which made me very suspicious of their behavior.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1544" class="calibre5">…… Shimotsuki may look perfect, but she’ s pretty clumsy in some ways. I feel that there are a lot of things that are quite wrong with her, in terms of human interaction at least.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1545" class="calibre5">Well, it is convenient, if she is looking at me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1546" class="calibre5">(Okay)</p>



<p class="calibre5">　</p>



<p class="calibre5">I made a sign with my index finger and thumb and gave the “OK” sign.</p>



<p class="calibre5">A few seconds later, Shimotsuki looked at me, so I guess she got the message.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1547" class="calibre5">As proof, Shimotsuki’s expression clearly brightened, so I was sure she got the message. She usually doesn’t talk much, but I think she easily shows her emotions in her expressions.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1548" class="calibre5">She was obviously happy to be eating lunch with me. …… She was cute, after all and I was happy to see her.</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 10: The Silent Girl is bothersome</strong></h1>




<p class="calibre5">As soon as the lunch break started, Shimotsuki came over to me, leaving behind a trail of carefree footsteps.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1613" class="calibre5">“Ch-ch-check this out ……!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, I’m not sure what she’s trying to say. It seems that she’ s getting shy, and she’s too nervous to speak.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s quite unusual to be shy just because of the presence of others.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1614" class="calibre5">Perhaps as a countermeasure, Shimotsuki suddenly offered me a note. I reflexively accepted the note, which read, “Follow me.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1615" class="calibre5">It seems she had prepared it in advance. …… It’s kind of cute.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1616" class="calibre5">“Okay.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1617" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1618" class="calibre5">I nodded and Shimotsuki snickered a little smugly. She looked like she could easily communicate without talking to me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1619" class="calibre5">I guess she’ s already acquired a taste for the art of writing letters. I am sure I will be receiving many more letters like this in the future.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1620" class="calibre5">And so, I followed Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her footsteps sounded very light, perhaps due to the low coefficient of gravity she was subjected to. Her steps were fast, and if I wasn’t careful, I might lose her, so I followed carefully.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1621" class="calibre5">What I found was a place where there was no sign of anyone at all.</p>



<p class="calibre5">A corner behind the school building. It was a blind spot and I was surprised that such a place existed.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1622" class="calibre5">“This is my secret place, you know? You see, it’s completely empty. I always eat my lunch here. I’ve always wanted to have lunch here with my friends one day. …… One of my dreams has come true.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1623" class="calibre5">When the two of us were alone, Shimotsuki became instantly talkative. I am grateful that she explains things to me before I ask.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1624" class="calibre5">“It’s a quiet place, isn’t it?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1625" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1626" class="calibre5">“I know, right? I have been alone since I was born. I’m good at finding places where there are no people. The only place I can eat lunch more quietly than here is in the teachers’ restroom.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1627" class="calibre5">However, I was a little afraid that I could sense the darkness of Shimotsuki in every word she said.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She seemed innocent enough, but she might be carrying a lot of dark traits.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1628" class="calibre5">“The toilet is not a place to eat food, though.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1629" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1630" class="calibre5">With a wry smile, I tried to open the bag of buns I had bought that morning.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, I couldn’t eat it yet due to the fact that Shimotsuki was staring at me like she wanted to say something.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1631" class="calibre5">“Hmm? Hey? Huh?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1632" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1633" class="calibre5">“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1634" class="calibre5">She was staring at me so much that I couldn’t help but ask her why.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As if she’d been waiting for that moment, Shimotsuki began to speak vigorously.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1635" class="calibre5">“…… Hey, Nakayama-kun, you talk to me when I talk to you, but why did you pretend to be someone else in the classroom?　I was really looking forward to it, you know?　I was expecting you to come up to me every break time and talk to me while wagging your tail like a puppy, but all you do is mope around like a koala. It’s like I’m the only one who likes you. It’s unfair as a friend. I want you to talk to me more in class and I want you to love me as a friend.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1636" class="calibre5">It seems that she was dissatisfied with my attitude in the classroom.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I want to apologize for that. But before that, I want to say something.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1637" class="calibre5">“Love is …… a heavy word.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1638" class="calibre5">It was like a lover. And it is quite a heavy type.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think Shimotsuki is asking too much of our friendship. I really wanted to be a little more casual with her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1639" class="calibre5"></p>



<p class="calibre5">“After I spoke to you this morning, I suddenly realized. I thought, ” What?”. So, I waited for you, but you didn’t talk to me. I wrote you a note. That’s okay, because it was very fun, but you have to be more active, okay? I’m a very lonely person.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. ……”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1640" class="calibre5">I was expecting her to be quiet and unemotional like ice, but when I saw her, I realized that she was very human.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1641" class="calibre5">“I’m not very good at writing, so it was really hard for me. …… Well, the letter was more fun than I expected, so I’ll keep doing it, okay?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1642" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1643" class="calibre5">“It seems that the cause of that elementary school-like note was Shimotsuki’s language skills. Come to think of it, yesterday she said that she can’t read manga or novels because they have weird sentences in them. …… Hmm?　Could it be that this girl is quite a little silly?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1644" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1645" class="calibre5">I’ve always assumed that because she looks good, she’s also smart. I sensed that she reeked of clumsiness.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1646" class="calibre5">“But it’s great that you can say you’re sorry. I forgive you. From now on, you have to be more patient with me, okay? You’re my friend, so you have to talk to me a lot, okay? Okay, that’s enough. Lecture over.”<br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1647" class="calibre5">And it seems I was being lectured.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I see, this is the reason why I felt like, I was being watched in class. I guess she wanted to lecture me the whole time. …… After finishing her various comments, Shimotsuki looked very refreshed.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1648" class="calibre5">The quiet girl may be a troublesome and annoying person.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yet, I found that part of her attractive, which made me wonder…</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 11: The Sense of Distance as Friends</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">“Come on, let’s go and have lunch, don’t be sad because you’ve been lectured. I’m starving. School is boring and dull, but lunch is the only thing that’s really nice.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">No, I’m not feeling sad about it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seemed to Shimotsuki that I was. She rubbed my back in a comforting way. I feel like I’m being treated like a child. …… Oh well.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Shall we sit down? Oh, maybe you’re too germophobic to sit outside? If that’s the case, you can stand, but I’ll have to keep looking up and my neck will get tired.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry, I’ll sit down.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The back of the school building is deserted. Shimotsuki sits down on a step. I sat down next to her, with a good distance between us.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The distance between us is about one meter. I thought this was the kind of distance between me and Shimotsuki, but …… it seems to be a little too far.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“”Hey, hey, look at this. Don’t you think my bento looks delicious?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She approached me at once.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The distance between us was only about 10 centimeters.</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Isn’t this close?)</p>



<p class="calibre5">We are so close that our bodies touch when we move. But that seems to be how Shimotsuki feels about the distance between her and her friends. She was not aware of the closeness at all and continued talking as if it was natural.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“My mom is very good at cooking, and without any favoritism from our family, it’s really delicious. …… Oh, would you like to try some egg rolls? We make it sweet, but even if Nakayama-kun is a picky eater, he will find it delicious. That’s how good my mom is at cooking. Here you go. Don’t be shy, okay? Ahh.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">This time, she offered me an egg roll with her chopsticks like a lover.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What? Hmm?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">We’re friends, right?</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not like we’re dating in Shimotsuki’s mind, is it?</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve never confessed or been confessed to anyone in my memory, though I’m flattered by that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, then what is this closeness?</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seems like Shimotsuki adores me to the point where I can’t really understand her concept of a friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s only been two days since we became friends, but …… I wonder if this girl was really starving for a friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If that was the case, I felt a little self-conscious about turning her down.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“You’re not going to eat it? It’s so good. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then, when she gave me a sad look, I couldn’t reject her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Yes, thank you. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">So I ate the egg roll she offered me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It tasted …… good, I think. To be honest, I didn’t really understand it. I think I was confused because it was the first time I had ever been approached like this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“How is it? Is it good? Isn’t my mom amazing?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I just nodded my head as Shimotsuki asked for my opinion.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I think it’s amazing. It tastes delicious.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">” I know, right? There’s nothing my mom can’t cook. She loves my dad so much that she always puts a lot of effort into cooking for him. And I get to reap the benefits of that, too, which makes me very happy.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki seems to be more pleased when her mother is praised than she is when she is praised herself.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She must be a kind girl who loves her family. Knowing this side of her makes her even more attractive to me. That’s why I was embarrassed to have acted like a lover with such a girl.</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 12: Coincidental Encounters are a Characteristic of the Protagonist</strong></h1>



<p class="calibre5">Even after finishing her lunch, Shimotsuki still seemed to have more to say.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I just listened and occasionally gave her a nod or two, but her stories had a strange charm that made me listen to them.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t have any pretense or punchline like comedians do.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But that doesn’t mean that the contents are random.</p>



<p class="calibre5">What I can say is that Shimotsuki’s stories contain a lot of her emotions. She talks vividly about what she felt and how she feels about trivial things.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe that’s why I never get tired of listening to her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was thinking that it would not be a bad idea to continue to listen to Shimotsuki until the very end of the lunch break…….</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Shimotsuki shut her mouth.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her small ears twitched, and then she instantly lost her expression.</p>



<p class="calibre5">With a transparent complexion, Shimotsuki whispered in a low voice.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“There’s a disgusting sound. …… It’s the sound I hate the most in this world.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know what she was talking about at the time.</p>



<p class="calibre5">A dozen or so seconds later, I saw the person who had come to us and realized the reason for her statement.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, Ryoma Oni-chan. I didn’t mean to call you here. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What’s the matter though? It’s still in the middle of lunch, so please hurry up, okay? I want to eat the bento that Yuzuki made for me, it’s delicious.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Two people, a guy and a girl, suddenly arrived at the back of the school building. They didn’t seem to have noticed us sitting in the corner yet and they were facing each other, trying to talk about something.</p>



<p class="calibre5">They were people I knew well.</p>



<p class="calibre5">One was my stepsister, Azusa Nakayama.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The other was someone I disliked, someone Shimotsuki had a deep dislike for.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Ryuzaki ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but mutter his name.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He has black hair, black eyes, and a medium build, not much different from me in terms of features. However, he has an overwhelmingly gorgeous appearance and aura. It’s an aura that only a person with absolute confidence in himself can produce.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Why is Nakayama here ……, hey!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">And then he looked at us and as soon as he knew she was there, his expression changed.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Shiho ……, what are you doing with Nakayama? Just the two of you, what’s going on?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was probably because Shiho Shimotsuki, whom he liked, was sitting side-by-side with a guy.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">The girl liked by Ryuzaki, who has always been liked by women, is alone with a guy who is as insignificant as a mob character. I’m sure a lot of emotions must be bubbling up in him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“The timing is bad. …… Haha, boring.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">As soon as Ryuzaki recognized us, Shimotsuki sighed.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She let out a disgusted sounding voice that they couldn’t hear and quickly began to put her own lunch away.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, shall we go back?　I don’t want to hear the sound of that guy.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yeah, you’re right.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I want to go back too……, but I don’t think Ryuzaki will be satisfied with that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And perhaps it is Shimotsuki, not me, who will be questioned after returning from this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As proof of this, Ryuzaki was looking straight at Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He looked like he wanted to ask something.</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s just too pathetic.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is a girl who doesn’t like Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She’s very emotional and loves to talk, but she hates him so much that when he’s next to her, she turns into a mute girl as cold as ice.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to burden her too much.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t want her to have a hard time just because she became my friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">So, I shook my head.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“No, Ryuzaki wants to talk to me, so I’ll stay here at ……. Go ahead and leave.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I told her that, Shimotsuki’s eyes widened slightly.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… Sometimes, Nakayama, you make me wonder. You seem like a normal boy, but you sound unusual. …… Ummm, that’s nice. I’m going back first. I’ll see you later and we can chat a lot, okay?”<br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>



<p class="calibre5">Then, after a lot of words spoken in a quiet voice, Shimotsuki stood up.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, hey. Shiho, what are you whispering about? I told you before that if you ever need help, I’m here to help. …… Hey, Shiho?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki passed by Ryuzaki in silence.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She walked away without even looking at him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And after that, only me, Ryuzaki …… and my stepsister Azusa remained.</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 13: I’d Rather Be a Mob Character Than a Dull Protagonist</strong></h1>



<p class="calibre5">“What’s going on here, Nakayama! What have you been doing with Shiho!?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1842" class="calibre5">Ryuzaki yelled at me like he was about to grab me by the chest.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I guess he’s upset. His face, which is usually full of composure and a wry smile, is distorted with confusion. Seeing this, I felt a dark emotion rising up in me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1843" class="calibre5">It seems I am not a very friendly person. I found it interesting that Ryuzaki was so upset.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m aware of it, but I can’t resist it. I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to control myself now that I don’t have Shimotsuki next to me…….</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1844" class="calibre5">“Shiho is weak, you know. She’s so sickly that she gets sick if she doesn’t sleep all the time, even at school. …… Maybe you brought her outside!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… sickly and weak?　</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve never heard of that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve been friends with Shimotsuki for two days now and I’ve never seen her show any signs of being sickly.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1845" class="calibre5">In fact, she seems to be quite healthy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She said that the reason she sleeps at school is because she is bored and at home she would rather stay up all night playing games or something. …… What does that mean?</p>



<p class="calibre5">(Maybe that’s what this guy thinks?)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1846" class="calibre5">Ryuzaki probably doesn’t know Shimotsuki very well.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not surprising if you look at her attitude. She was cold towards Ryuzaki at all times and would not speak to him. …… I feel that Ryuzaki has made up his own mind that she is sickly and weak.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1847" class="calibre5">“Eh, let’s see. ……”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1848" class="calibre5">And Azusa was cowering behind Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1849" class="calibre5">A few moments ago, she looked somewhat tense…… yet determined, and now she looks confused.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1850" class="calibre5">Since I am her stepbrother, I can tell by the expression on her face what kind of feelings my sister is having.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She must have been trying to tell Ryuzaki something important.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1851" class="calibre5">She called him out to the back of the school building where there was no one around.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think she was trying to confess …… or something similarly serious.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1852" class="calibre5">No, you don’t need to be a stepbrother to know this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Being called to the back of the school building is the perfect situation for a confession. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s a common practice.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1853" class="calibre5">But Ryuzaki doesn’t notice it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He’s a bit dull and unaware of love.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1854" class="calibre5">…… Although my sister no longer has any connection with me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I knew it was a shame that her determination was not rewarded, so I couldn’t help but offer her a helping hand.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1855" class="calibre5">“What’s up with you two all of a sudden?　Why did you come to the back of the school building, where there is no one around? …… Were you planning to talk about something important?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1856" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1857" class="calibre5">Not to Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I looked at Azusa and called out to her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1858" class="calibre5">She looks at me with wide eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But she quickly looks away. It’s as though she’s pretending to be someone else.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1859" class="calibre5">“I don’t know. I was called away by Azusa. …… That can wait. Don’t change the subject, explain to me what you were doing with Shiho.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1860" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1861" class="calibre5">But Ryuzaki is insensitive in every way.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He didn’t seem to be aware of Azusa’s feelings in the slightest.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I despised the pure thoughts of that girl.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1862" class="calibre5">It’s still hard for me as a family member.</p>



<p class="calibre5">As an older brother, it is natural for me to hope that Azusa’s feelings will at least be rewarded.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1863" class="calibre5">“Nothing, of course not. Nakayama-san, if you have something to say, why don’t you say it clearly? If I’m in your way, I’ll go away.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1864" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1865" class="calibre5">…… It’s still hard for me to call Azusa, Nakayama-san, though.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But I promised her that before. She doesn’t want people to know that she’s actually my sister. Because the ideal Onii-chan for her is not me, but Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, uh, …….”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1866" class="calibre5">But Azusa is still a bit shy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She is a quiet girl at heart, so it must have taken a lot of courage for her to decide to confess.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think it was really great that she overcame that and called him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1867" class="calibre5">When I thought about Azusa’s feelings, my heart ached.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1868" class="calibre5">It’s a feeling that won’t be directed at me anymore, but …… at least, I hope that she will be happy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1869" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1870" class="calibre5">In the past, I was the ” Onii-chan “.　</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, that thought never seemed to reach Ryuzaki……</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1871" class="calibre5">“You’re making a scene. …… I’m sorry, Azusa. Can you give me a moment alone with him? If you have something to say, I will listen to you later.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1872" class="calibre5">In this way, Ryuzaki dismisses the thoughts of the girl.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Due to his insensitivity, he has no malicious intent. So I don’t think it’s malicious.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1873" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1874" class="calibre5">Not realizing it is evil.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s just laziness to not realize that there is so much affection coming from them.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1875" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1876" class="calibre5">This is the reason why I hated Ryuzaki after all.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1877" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1878" class="calibre5">“Uh-huh. I’ll see you later, Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1879" class="calibre5">And even as Azusa quietly retreated as she was told, anger boiled over.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1880" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1881" class="calibre5">Is that what she wants?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Is that the extent of Azusa’s feelings?　</p>



<p class="calibre5">She was so excited to tell me that she had found someone he liked, and then she cut me out of her life for the sake of that person. …… And now she’s retreating?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1882" class="calibre5">I want to scream.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She should have told him clearly how she felt.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1883" class="calibre5">But I couldn’t say that because I had so many happy memories with Azusa.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I never wanted to see her crying face.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1884" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1885" class="calibre5">“…………”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1886" class="calibre5">So all I could do was look at her in silence.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1887" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1888" class="calibre5">…… Oh, I see.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I used to think of myself as a protagonist, but …… I’m not.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1889" class="calibre5">I can’t be so selfish as to ignore the feelings of such a pure girl.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1890" class="calibre5">No, I don’t want to do it. …… I would rather be a mob character than hurt a nice girl like that with the excuse of being insensitive.</p>




<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 14: Do You Have to Be the Protagonist to Feel Good?</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">It is painful to see that Azusa’s determination did not produce any results.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But that’s the path she chose. I’m not in a position to be helpful to her anymore.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1954" class="calibre5">Kotaro Nakayama is no more than Azusa Nakayama’s older brother in the family register.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Nothing more, nothing less. I can’t do anything about her love life.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1955" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1956" class="calibre5">So, for now, let’s concentrate on what’s in front of me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1957" class="calibre5">I had to get rid of Ryuzaki as soon as possible, so as not to bother Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1958" class="calibre5">“We can talk in peace when we’re alone. Don’t be shy. Don’t you think it’s time for you to tell me? Tell me why you were alone with Shiho.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1959" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1960" class="calibre5">It seems that the protagonist has a strong attachment to his childhood friend.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If this was a story, the main heroine is probably Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1961" class="calibre5">Those girls I liked so much are subheroines.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1962" class="calibre5">“You want to know? I mean, it’s her private life, remember? Are you sure you want to pry into it?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1963" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1964" class="calibre5">To be honest, I felt like I was being a little pushy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1965" class="calibre5">I felt reluctant to say too much when he questioned me so persistently.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1966" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1967" class="calibre5">Why does he want to know so much about Shimotsuki?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1968" class="calibre5">He was generous enough to tell me that he had no reason whatsoever to be concerned.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1969" class="calibre5">“I’m her childhood friend, you know. I have a duty to protect her, because she’s sickly and weak. …… I’m the only one who can help Shiho, because I’m her childhood friend.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1970" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1971" class="calibre5">It was like he was talking to himself.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I felt a chill when Ryuzaki talked about something so grandiose.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1972" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1973" class="calibre5">(Do you really have to be such a protagonist to feel good?)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1974" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1975" class="calibre5">This arrogant, smug, selfish thought made me angry.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1976" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is weak? Is Ryuzaki the only one who can help her?</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s so misguided. She’s not that weak of a girl.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1977" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1978" class="calibre5">She’s a normal girl who can speak her mind and express her feelings clearly.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1979" class="calibre5">At the very least, I can say with confidence that she is not the kind of person who can’t live properly without the help of others.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1980" class="calibre5">What can I say? …… Honestly, I was afraid of Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1981" class="calibre5">The protagonist may seem normal, but he’s anything but normal.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1982" class="calibre5">This guy is insane.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If I were to argue with him and get suspicious, and if Shimotsuki were to follow me around ……, I would be horrified.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1983" class="calibre5">Now, I felt like I finally understood her feelings.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I really …… did not want to have much to do with Ryuzaki, I thought.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1984" class="calibre5">“We’ve known each other since childhood……, and it’s my job to protect her from bad boys. Shiho is too kind and timid to express her opinion, but …… I’ll do it for her.”<br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1985" class="calibre5">And Ryuzaki seems to think I’m a bad boy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1986" class="calibre5">“She likes to be by herself. Don’t make her go out with you for your own reasons. …… Don’t take advantage of her kindness, okay? As a childhood friend of Shiho’s, I’ll give you some advice.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1987" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1988" class="calibre5">I wonder if protecting her means to attack her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1989" class="calibre5">I don’t think it’s right to make assumptions about Shimotsuki’s personality and ideology without permission and to exclude others just based on assumptions.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1990" class="calibre5">How could he do this?</p>



<p class="calibre5">No matter how much of a mob character I am, doesn’t he think it’s rude?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1991" class="calibre5">No, the most rude thing is not towards me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1992" class="calibre5">Doesn’t he feel sorry for Shimotsuki?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1993" class="calibre5">(…… I bet he doesn’t think that way.)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1994" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1995" class="calibre5">How could Ryuzaki think of such a thing as normal?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Because he is the ” protagonist “.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1996" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-1997" class="calibre5">Everything can and has been forgiven on that basis alone, because he is an opportunistic and extraterritorial being&ndash;</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 16: The Only Advantage of being a Mob Character</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki is obsessed with his childhood friend Shiho Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He seemed to be disturbed by the fact that she had eaten lunch with another boy.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2067" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2068" class="calibre5">He wondered why Shimotsuki and I were together.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He wants to know what we were doing together.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2069" class="calibre5">“It’s nothing, really. I don’t think there’s anything that Ryuzaki should be concerned about.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2070" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2071" class="calibre5">I hesitate and let my thoughts wander.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The reason why I am hesitating to give a definite answer is because depending on the answer, I might get in trouble with Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2072" class="calibre5">For example, let’s say I told him the whole truth.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Suppose Shimotsuki explained that she really didn’t like Ryuzaki and was only having lunch with me because we had become friends.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2073" class="calibre5">A normal person would back off when they realize that they are disliked.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But Ryuzaki is no ordinary person. He is a ” protagonist “.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2074" class="calibre5">‘She doesn’t like me? No, Shiho just doesn’t know the real me! If she gets to know the real me, she’ll like me! So let’s try to approach her more!’</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2075" class="calibre5">It’s not surprising that such a thought process was formed.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki is that type of protagonist.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2076" class="calibre5">Usually, he’s slow and indecisive.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But when he is determined, he will go straight for it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The protagonist is a creature that gets more motivated the more he or she is pushed.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2077" class="calibre5">Oh, I’m spiteful.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was one-sided, and the pressure that seemed to be trying to fill in the other person’s thoughts was making it difficult to breathe.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2078" class="calibre5">I’m sure that Shimotsuki, the target of this pressure, will suffer even more than me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s why I can’t tell him the truth. Shimotsuki rejects Ryuzaki like that.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2079" class="calibre5">She called me a friend even though I was just a plain, ordinary mob character.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2080" class="calibre5">She saw the value in me and admired me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2081" class="calibre5">I’m very happy about that, but on the other hand, I don’t have anything to give back to her, so I actually feel a little guilty.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2082" class="calibre5">There was nothing I could do to make her happy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">At least, I wanted to be careful not to cause her any trouble.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2083" class="calibre5">“Nothing? It’s not like you’re alone with her in a deserted place like this. …… Are you hiding something about Shiho from me? Is there anything bothering you, that you can’t tell me about?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2084" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2085" class="calibre5">What do I say?</p>



<p class="calibre5">What should I say to the protagonist who is so delusional that he can’t see what’s best for himself?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2086" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2087" class="calibre5">“Maybe Shiho’s asking you for advice so she doesn’t bother me? If so, please tell her. …… We are childhood friends and I don’t care if she bothers me. If you’re not telling me, it’s all right! Just tell me exactly what’s going on and I’ll do the talking!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2088" class="calibre5">How can he think of something so convenient?</p>



<p class="calibre5">If I say something badly, it might put a heavy burden on Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2089" class="calibre5">Perhaps Ryuzaki is in a hurry.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think he’s also concerned about me in a corner of his mind.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe Shiho Shimotsuki’s special someone is me and he’s getting anxious.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2090" class="calibre5">That’s why he’s searching hard for a reason.</p>



<p class="calibre5">He is looking for a convenient reason to convince himself.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2091" class="calibre5">If that’s the case, then I have to erase it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I need to erase my existence from his mind.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2092" class="calibre5">As long as I’m not there, Shimotsuki can go back to her normal life.</p>



<p class="calibre5">For Ryuzaki, as a childhood friend who is sickly and likes to be alone, she can spend her time without much interference.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2093" class="calibre5">Yes, that’s right.</p>



<p class="calibre5">All I have to do is erase my presence from Ryuzaki’s mind.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m good at that. It’s a simple thing to do, because the only advantage of being a mob character is that you don’t have much of a presence…</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 16: Mobs don’t need emotions</strong></h1>



<p class="calibre5">　&ndash;Fool them.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2158" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2159" class="calibre5">　&ndash;Fake it.</p>





<p id="calibre_link-2161" class="calibre5">Deceive.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2162" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2163" class="calibre5">That’s what I told myself, and I smiled smugly at Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2164" class="calibre5">“Nothing really happened, okay? Well, I knew Shimotsuki-san was a girl with a hard side. I wanted to hit on her, but she didn’t even give me a chance.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2165" class="calibre5">The character, a dog that plays around with the heroine.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In the end, it’s just a stage set to give the impression that he is no match for the heroine.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2166" class="calibre5">“Hit on her? Did you try to seduce Shiho?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2167" class="calibre5">“No, because she’s so cute. …… It was hard to say, but yeah. I somehow managed to ask her to have lunch with me. Shimotsuki-san is kind and …… reluctant, but she ate lunch with me.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2168" class="calibre5">As soon as I said that, Ryuzaki relaxed, as if he was at once relieved.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2169" class="calibre5">“What, that’s what you mean. …… You were just a challenger.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2170" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2171" class="calibre5">“Heh. Well, I didn’t make any progress in the end! But since there is such a beautiful girl in my class, I wanted to give it a try. …… I called her here and tried to hit on her somehow, but then Ryuzaki came. It made Shimotsuki-san go crazy, so she left.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2172" class="calibre5">I put a smile on my face.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2173" class="calibre5">The pain that prickles in my heart is probably due to the fact that I still have some pride left from mistakenly thinking that I was once the protagonist.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2174" class="calibre5">I don’t need that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ll just be a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t mind throwing away anything that disturbs Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2175" class="calibre5">　&ndash;Flirt.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2176" class="calibre5">　&ndash;Heckle him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2177" class="calibre5">　&ndash;Wag my tail.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2178" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2179" class="calibre5">Just act like a pathetic high school boy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Be a nameless character that makes Ryuzaki feel like he’s insignificant.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2180" class="calibre5">“Well, maybe that was a rejection. …… There’s nothing I can do about it, Shimotsuki-san has a high standard! But I’m not giving up. …… I’ll try again, again and again!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2181" class="calibre5">I’ll pretend to be foolish.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I play the part of a pathetic clown who falls in love with an ungrateful woman.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Seeing me like this, Ryuzaki was clearly distracted.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2182" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2183" class="calibre5">“So …… you called her here and created a situation where the two of you are alone. I misunderstood, I’m sorry. You’re right, there’s no way Shiho would hide anything from me. …… We’re childhood friends, so it’s only natural.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2184" class="calibre5">Then, he conveniently complimented the setup.</p>



<p class="calibre5">This is the arrogance and weakness of the protagonist.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2185" class="calibre5">I was relieved at first that I was able to deceive him so easily.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then, I decided to set up a strategy so that I would not be bothered by Shimotsuki in the future.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2186" class="calibre5">“Your childhood friend is strong! But I’m not going to lose either. …… Someday, I’m going to get along with Shimotsuki-san somehow!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2187" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2188" class="calibre5">I played the role of a cheerful and stupid boy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">This should make Ryuzaki think that I’m just a mob character trying hard to get her attention, even if I’m talking to Shimotsuki in the future.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2189" class="calibre5">“Watch me! I can do it too if I try!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2190" class="calibre5">I must have looked like a hothead. Ryuzaki laughed, clearly dismissive.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2191" class="calibre5">“Huh. …… Well, good luck with that. Shiho is a girl with a lot of difficulties, so I think it’s probably impossible. The only person who understands her is me, her childhood friend.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2192" class="calibre5">He seemed to be in a good mood.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki smiled refreshingly and held out his hand to me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I was wrong about you, Nakayama. You’re a pretty funny guy. …… Let’s be friends from now on.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2193" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2194" class="calibre5">…… What was funny about that?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Does he think it’s funny that I am a mob character and I’m messing with the main heroine?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2195" class="calibre5">He thinks me and him are friends?</p>



<p class="calibre5">You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2196" class="calibre5">“I can’t.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2197" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2198" class="calibre5">“…………Huh?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2199" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2200" class="calibre5">It didn’t work.</p>



<p class="calibre5">No matter how hard I tried to pretend, I couldn’t.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2201" class="calibre5">No matter how much I fool myself, no matter how foolish I play myself, …… there is one feeling I can’t lie about, no matter how hard I try.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2202" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2203" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2204" class="calibre5">　&ndash;I hate you, Ryuzaki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2205" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2206" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2207" class="calibre5">Of course, I’m not going to say that I hate him from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I immediately smiled fondly at him, since saying that much would defeat the purpose of eliminating my presence as a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Because you’re my biggest rival! If I take advantage of my position as Ryuzaki’s friend, I’ll never be able to get along with Shimotsuki-san. I know I can’t win, but let me try!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2208" class="calibre5">I gave him a good reason.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then Ryuzaki, who looked puzzled for a moment, seemed to be relieved.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2209" class="calibre5">“I was surprised when you suddenly glared at me. …… If that’s the case, I guess I can’t help it. I’m not going to be your friend, but I’ll be glad to work with you from now on!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2210" class="calibre5">Ryuzaki said nodding his head. He probably recognized that I was just a small fish.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2211" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2212" class="calibre5">I think I’ve succeeded in fooling him somehow.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Now Ryuzaki will not get involved with Shimotsuki.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2213" class="calibre5">“So, I’m going back to class. And Nakayama, make sure you’re not late, okay?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2214" class="calibre5">With those words, Ryuzaki finally left.</p>



<p class="calibre5">After making sure that he was gone, I slowly exhaled.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2215" class="calibre5">“Phew. ……”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2216" class="calibre5">I sat down and clenched my fists as I collapsed on the spot.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2217" class="calibre5">“Huh!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2218" class="calibre5">I slammed into the ground and let my anger out.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2219" class="calibre5">“…… That hurt.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2220" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2221" class="calibre5">I looked at my bloodied fist and regained some composure.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I flattered him. I humbled myself to the main character. It was still frustrating, but ……, well, it’s okay.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2222" class="calibre5">“I am a mob character. I don’t need to feel emotions.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2223" class="calibre5">I muttered sarcastically and forced myself to laugh.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t need to look in the mirror to know, I’m sure the smile I’m wearing right now is so distorted, it’s unbearable to look at.</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 17: He’s a Harem Protagonist, but he only loves his silent Childhood Friend</strong></h1>



<p class="calibre5">If I were to title a story about Ryoma Ryuzaki, what would it be?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2294" class="calibre5">I think about this as I stare blankly at the blackboard during my afternoon class. It was just after lunch and I was motivated to sleep, so the string of numbers on the blackboard did not enter my mind at all.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2295" class="calibre5">(The title might be ……, I guess. “He’s a Harem Protagonist, but he only loves his silent Childhood Friend…”?)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2296" class="calibre5">It’s a terrible title. I can’t help but chuckle at my lack of imagination.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But if I were to summarize the truth, it would be something like that.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2297" class="calibre5">The story is about a harem protagonist, Ryuzaki, who is tempted by all kinds of girls, but loves only his …… childhood friend with all his heart.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2298" class="calibre5">His childhood friend, who is sickly, quiet, and loves to be alone, doesn’t even open up to Ryuzaki at first, but they gradually become friends. …… Eventually, he confesses, “I love you more than any other girl!”. In the end, they confess their love and become a couple.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2299" class="calibre5">The other sub-heroines regret this, but congratulate the hero and main heroine, saying to themselves, “If Ryoma is happy, then so be it.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2300" class="calibre5">&ndash;I felt like I was going to puke when I anticipated such a cold, generic story.</p>



<p class="calibre5">There is only one person who can be happy in this story.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2301" class="calibre5">Of course, that’s Ryoma Ryuzaki and the rest of the heroines can’t be happy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Even the main heroine, Shimotsuki, will have a very hard time in the future.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The story will end when they become a couple, but life goes on.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2302" class="calibre5">Can the harem-minded hero lead a normal married life?</p>



<p class="calibre5">What if he’s a womanizer by nature and indecisive?</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe one of the sub-heroines will become his mistress. …… What will Shimotsuki think when that happens?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2303" class="calibre5">…… Just thinking about it makes my head hurt.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m going to stop thinking about the ending of this story. I’m going to feel sick.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2304" class="calibre5">A quiet story.</p>



<p class="calibre5">After all, the only person Ryuzaki is obsessed with is Shimotsuki. She seems to be the main heroine, unfortunately.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2305" class="calibre5">Even the other harem members are probably just sub-characters to him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2306" class="calibre5">(…… It’s so unrewarding.)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2307" class="calibre5">Even those girls that I loved can only stand in the corner of the story? If that’s the case, then I’m really sad that I was cut off.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2308" class="calibre5">They are not even sub-characters, but mob characters, I guess that’s more appropriate.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2309" class="calibre5">It’s no wonder, since mobs don’t have any human rights. …… Or maybe they don’t care about me now.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2310" class="calibre5">A mob character who thought he was the protagonist is nothing but a pathetic clown. It’s not right to try to reward someone for being so miserable that it’s difficult to even laugh at them.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2311" class="calibre5">But I do have a wish, at least for …… one thing.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2312" class="calibre5">(Please, …… let just one person be happy.)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2313" class="calibre5">The least I could pray for was that their efforts as subheroines would be rewarded, even if only a little.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2314" class="calibre5">It is not uncommon for a subheroine to surpass the main heroine in a story.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It doesn’t matter what the reason is, whether it’s because they became popular, the author liked them or the story flowed the way it had to …….</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2315" class="calibre5">My stepsister Azusa, my childhood friend Yuzuki, and my best friend Kirari ……, at least one of them, should be rewarded.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2316" class="calibre5">There are not only three harem members, and there are many others, but …… no, the number is constantly increasing and the protagonist is an outrageous womanizer, making every girl he meets fall in love with him, one after another, so the competition will be high.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2317" class="calibre5">He is such a ridiculous hero that even within the sub-heroines, there are fierce fights. As a mob character ……, no, as a normal human being, I don’t understand why anyone would fall in love with a guy like that.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2318" class="calibre5">Isn’t it strange to keep thinking about something when there is little chance of it being rewarded? They can’t be so blinded by love that they can’t help it if they fall in love.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2319" class="calibre5">But maybe that’s normal for these girls …….</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s how much they fell in love with someone. Compared to them, I’ve probably only ever had casual love, so maybe I don’t understand it.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2320" class="calibre5">Even though they know they will be unhappy, they can’t help but fall in love. If that’s the case, I want them to do their best.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I want them to win happiness with their own hands.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2321" class="calibre5">That was the best I can do as a mob character…</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 18: The Silent Girl has a Yandere Side</h1>


<p class="calibre5">I was thinking about the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki, and before I knew it, school was over.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2388" class="calibre5">I couldn’t get much of the lessons into my head, but I didn’t think anything of it because it was business as usual. Studying was something I could manage if I crammed all night before the test. Thanks to this, I got a slightly lower than average grade, which is a result that is indescribably mob-like, but that doesn’t mean I can’t change who I am.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2389" class="calibre5">Now, it’s after school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yesterday, I became friends with Shimotsuki after school……. Just because we’re friends doesn’t mean we have to stay together after school.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2390" class="calibre5">Besides, I now have Ryuzaki’s eyes on me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2391" class="calibre5">After lunch, he seemed to be at least relieved by my statement, but he kept his guard up and kept glancing at me to see what I was up to.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2392" class="calibre5">Fortunately, the shy Shimotsuki didn’t talk to me, so I think my suspicions were probably confirmed……. If I stay too close to her, I might get Shimotsuki in trouble.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2393" class="calibre5">I decided to leave as soon as I could.</p>



<p class="calibre5">In fact, I wanted to say a few words to Shimotsuki, but Ryuzaki was flirting with his harem members and wouldn’t leave the classroom, so I had no choice but to leave in silence.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2394" class="calibre5">If we were friends, this would be about as good as it gets.</p>



<p class="calibre5">If I’m not careful, Shimotsuki will quickly close the distance between us, but that doesn’t mean I can’t touch her. I have to be docile like a mob and not get carried away.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2395" class="calibre5">I told myself that and headed home.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I boarded a bus at the nearest bus stop and arrived near my house in about 20 minutes. I got off the bus and walked for another few minutes. When I finally reached home, I turned over to get my keys out of my bag……. That’s when it happened.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2396" class="calibre5">“Who is it? The clue is your friend, a girl. Hmmm, can you guess? You want more clues? I don’t blame you, my favorite food is the food my mom makes. Yeah, if I give you this many hints, you’ll figure it out, right?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2397" class="calibre5">From behind me, small hands cover my eyes.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2398" class="calibre5">The darkness confused me for a moment, but I was relieved when I heard the voice and immediately knew who it was.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2399" class="calibre5">“What is it, Shimotsuki…… Shimotsuki!”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2400" class="calibre5">However, my relief was short-lived.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2401" class="calibre5">Immediately I realized that this situation was unusual.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2402" class="calibre5">“I’m Shiho Shimotsuki, a 16-year-old girl. I’ve always dreamed of being able to say this. It’s one of the top 100 things on my list of things I want to do when I have a friend. I’m glad my dream came true.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2403" class="calibre5">I wondered if the top 100 could really be this special.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Maybe there are quite a few items on the “list of things I want to do when I make friends” …… I was also curious about that, but I guess I need to ask something first.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2404" class="calibre5">“Why are you here ……?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2405" class="calibre5"></p>



<p id="calibre_link-2406" class="calibre5">This place, of course, is not at school.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s my house, 20 minutes away by bus and almost an hour away by foot.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t understand why Shimotsuki, a character I was supposed to encounter only at school, was in such a place.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2407" class="calibre5">Why would she be here?</p>



<p class="calibre5">When I asked her the reason, the light suddenly disappeared from her eyes.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2408" class="calibre5">Her black eyes, in contrast to her silvery-white hair, were filled with a darkness that seemed to absorb all colors.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2409" class="calibre5">“Eh? You’re my friend, but you left without saying goodbye. …… There were many things I wanted to do after school, but you left on your own, so I followed you. I’m not sure if you’re aware that you’re my friend or not. I’m going to make myself at home with Nakayama-kun to get back at you. I’m not going to let you turn me down.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2410" class="calibre5">…… Until a few days ago, I thought she was like an emotionless doll.</p>



<p class="calibre5">This girl was quite talkative and emotional.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-2411" class="calibre5">Shimotsuki: …… Sorry. I’m sorry to feel this way about my friend. …… It’s just a little hectic. The silent girl seems to have a bit of a yandere side…</p>




<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 19: You can’t be sad about being a mob character, can you?</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">It seems that Shimotsuki has been following me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s quite a stalker that I didn’t notice ……. There was no sign of her, which was a little scary.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“So, may I come in? Oh, are your parents here? I’d like to say hello to them. I’m not …… shy when it comes to people around my parent’s age! I’m a little nervous in front of people, but I can talk to people around my mom and dad’s age just fine, you know?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She said she’s shy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Anyway, she seems to be polite. The way she speaks, her gestures and her attitude all have a certain elegance to them. …… Her parents seem to have taken good care of her and she probably had a good upbringing.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The more I learn about Shiho Shimotsuki, the more attractive she becomes.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s rare to find a person with such deep feelings.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s okay. My parents are both on a business trip overseas.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Well, they’re not here, so there’s no need to worry about it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I unlocked the door and invited her in.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Well, that’s …… very disappointing. I would have loved to have seen Nakayama’s mom and dad. I would have liked to have seen your childhood albums and talked with you about the past.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I don’t think you’d enjoy looking at my albums, …… and please don’t embarrass me.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s as strange as ever.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s really boring to look at my albums as a mob character.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki is very curious.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She’s itching to know more about me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry to bother you. Hmm, I see. …… You were born and raised here, weren’t you? It’s a little bit bigger than our house. But it’s nice to have a house this big where you can see your family.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki looked around the house, looking curious.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Really, I don’t think there’s anything to see since it’s just a typical house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I welcomed her to the living room instead of my room. As for me, I thought I’d just serve her some tea and sweets and chat with her over some random food. …… But it looks like that was a failure.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Why don’t you take me to your room, Nakayama-kun? I’m your friend. …… It’s a common practice to invite friends, who come to visit you to your room. Do you know anything about the world, Nakayama-kun? You’re a strange person.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She looked at me with a puzzled look on her face, like she was speaking common sense.</p>



<p class="calibre5">No, that’s not right. It’s not common sense to force your way into the home of a person of the opposite s*x on the second day after becoming friends and moreover, it’s a mystery why she wants to go to my room. I think it’s better to be more …… cautious.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki has a rather defenseless side to her. I don’t know why she trusts me so much, when she is usually so cautious and gets nervous at the mere presence of others.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Yeah, that’s right.</p>



<p class="calibre5">What’s even stranger is the fact that she’s so curious about me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wonder if it’s because it’s always been in the corner of my mind.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Since it was a good opportunity, I couldn’t help but ask her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“My room is really not that interesting, you know. I mean, I’m a boring person myself. …… Don’t you think it’s a little weird that you want to know about this mob character?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s mouth widened at my words.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her face was like that of an annoying person who talks about the universe while inviting people to join a mysterious religion.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Mob characters? Nakayama-kun? What do you mean? I don’t know what you mean. …… I don’t think you’re a mob character. I’ve never found you boring or dull. It’s a strange thing to say. …… I’ve shown so many signs of affection and yet Nakayama still doesn’t get it.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then she sighed and smiled.</p>



<p class="calibre5">With an adorable smile that seemed to make everyone who saw her happy, Shimotsuki said this.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“You’re special to me. Don’t be sad about being a mob character. It’s not bad to be humble, but you shouldn’t be so humble. Don’t be sad about denying who you are. …… It hurts me, your friend.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">&ndash;That was the first time I had heard that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She acknowledged me as one of the many others and said that I was “special”.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Rather than being happy, I think it would be more accurate to say that I was …… surprised.</p>



<p class="calibre5">So, to this girl, I was special.</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 20: Why the Protagonist-sama is obsessed with her</strong></h1>







<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki told me that I was “special” to her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was surprised to hear that, but after thinking about it, I realized that it was only natural.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not natural for me to be special.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She had made a friend out of me. And how can I not be special when I’m her only friend ……?</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’ve been thinking for a while that you’re too insecure about yourself. …… You’re always so scared and reserved with me, aren’t you? You are my friend, so you should be more relaxed. It makes me a little sad.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki looked unusually dissatisfied.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her eyes are wide and her cheeks are puffed out.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I don’t think it’s fair to be cute even in these situations.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, sorry …….”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I can’t argue with her. I can barely manage to apologize.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The reason was that Shimotsuki was so cute that I couldn’t help but admire her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Oh, I see. …… I understand why the protagonist loves this girl so much that he goes crazy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She is just too cute.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s not just the face. No, of course, I think her face is top-notch.</p>



<p class="calibre5">What’s more, this girl has an attractive personality. Maybe it’s because she’s been loved and raised, or maybe it’s because she has a very soft atmosphere. …… I feel very comfortable being next to her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve never seen a girl like her before.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I can say with confidence that she is a unique person.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m sure the main character understands this. He may be cold, but I’m sure Ryuzaki has instinctively smelled Shimotsuki’s charm.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The main character’s eyes must be of good quality.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I thought that because I had been involved with so many girls, I was even more aware of Shimotsuki’s charms.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I have a little bit of what is commonly referred to as “shyness”. Just a little, really. You see, in my previous life, I was a territorial little animal, and I get nervous when other people look at me, you know?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki continues to talk.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The talkative girl continued to sing in her lovely voice until I stopped her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The words were directed only at me, a special person. …… Now, I just wanted to listen to them.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The main heroine’s consciousness could be monopolized by me, a mob character, for now.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I was very happy about that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“But the strange thing is that Nakayama-kun is the only one who doesn’t get nervous. …… I wondered that from the first time I saw you. No, not when I saw you, but when I heard you. I have a good hearing. …… The sounds that ooze out of you are so interesting that I get carried away.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">As usual, Shimotsuki talks about things with a unique worldview.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was difficult to understand everything she said. But I tried my best to understand what she said.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“So, now that we’ve become friends, I want to know more and more about you, Nakayama. The more I get to know you, the more the tone changes. …… Every time I talk to you, touch you, or smile at you, the tone echoes. It’s fun, it’s nice, it’s beautiful.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… Tone?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, tone. It’s like a musical instrument. You can’t make a sound by yourself, but if you have a player, you can make beautiful music, right? It’s almost like that. …… I’m your musician. Right now, anyway, I’m trying to figure out what you sound like.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Then she pecked me on the cheek.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She smiles innocently, as if she were a child playing a prank.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I want to touch you more. I want to talk to you more. I want to know more about you and get to know you better. …… That’s why I’m your friend. You are the only one who is special to me. You have to understand that, right?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… I see. That’s the reason for her closeness to me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s hard to believe, but …… Shimotsuki seems to have a strong interest in me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I didn’t understand half of what she said. Especially the part about the “tone”, there were few parts that I could relate to, and it almost confused me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But I guess I didn’t need to worry about that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Anyway, Shimotsuki thinks of me as ‘special’.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. I understand. …… Thank you. I feel like I’m being saved.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">That’s what makes me feel so happy…</p>




<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 21: I am no longer a Mob</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki follows me around a bit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ufufu, I’ve never been to a friend’s room before. Do you know the rules of etiquette for this kind of situation, Nakayama-kun?　When you go to your boy friend’s house for the first time, there is a certain etiquette that you must follow, you know? I’ve been wanting to try it ever since I saw it in an anime.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was eager to see my room, so I had no choice but to show her around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is a strange girl, and she thinks I’m special. So when she asked to see my room, I couldn’t refuse.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She really seemed to be looking forward to seeing my room, and her steps were light and fluffy. She looked as if she was almost dancing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Etiquette? I don’t know. …… I don’t watch a lot of anime.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Nakayama-kun, are you insane? I don’t see the point of living if you don’t watch anime. …… Could Nakayama-kun be dead? That’s terrible, you’re my friend, you have to come back to life.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m not dead.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I answered with a chuckle, she let out a happy giggle.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Of course I know. That was just a joke. If it were possible, I would have liked Nakayama-kun to make a comeback saying, `I’m not dead yet,’ but I’ll give you a pass. I also like comedy shows, so I know a lot about them.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This girl has quite a lot of interests.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And she is the type of person who mistakenly thinks she is an expert in a field just because she has heard about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yeah, …… Well, it wasn’t very interesting, whether it was the comedy or the jokes. Shimotsuki is pretty clumsy, so the quality of everything she does is surprisingly low.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, we arrive at my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason why we’ve been talking so idly is because I’ve been slowing down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was hoping that maybe Shimotsuki would change her mind, but she was still determined to get into my room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So this is it, huh? Okay, I’m coming in! Now, I’ll give you the answer …… The first thing you should do when you first go to a boy’s room is to look for a n*****y book! I’ve been wanting to try this since it’s a standard anime rule!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki enters the room with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps she’s getting excited, but her voice has been loud since a while ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since we were in a situation where it was just the two of us, of course her shyness was not triggered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe it was because she was so shy, but now she was also loud.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, where could it be! Under the bed? Or in the back of a drawer? Maybe in a closet? I saw a movie about a treasure hunter the other day, so I’m probably pretty good at treasure hunting. There’s nothing I can’t find!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, Shimotsuki starts rummaging through my room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I watched her absentmindedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Normally, I might be in a panic, but …… unfortunately, no such interesting events happen to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because I don’t have any hobbies.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the first place, I don’t like anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The truth is that I don’t really know much about n*****y books either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps it is the nature of a sad mob character, but …… I have no personality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like I don’t have a set of principles or assertions that can be called a personality…… It’s a bit meta, but that’s how it is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, I’m sorry to disappoint her, but …… no matter how hard she looked, there was nothing interesting in this room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, Shimotsuki? I’m sorry, but I don’t have any n*****y books, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sorry, but I’ll make sure to let her know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t have any hobbies or preferences, so I don’t …… have any of those tastes or entertainment items.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I said this, I felt a little ashamed of myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t even be normal, I’m just a mob character, I thought.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Looking at this room from a bird’s eye view, I can clearly see that I have no personality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only furniture in the room is a bed, a study desk, a closet, and a shelf.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The room was equipped with a set of study tools, a change of clothes, bedding, a few things for later use, and no entertainment items.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t think a plain room is an appropriate place for Shimotsuki to be.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Somehow, I wanted to leave the room. I felt that it was not appropriate for a nice girl like Shimotsuki to be in such a place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki laughed at me for being so sneaky.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, I see. …… I’m sorry, but I cannot make any promises. I was looking forward to it, but it can’t be helped. Nakayama-kun is a very strange boy, not having any hobbies. I’m getting more and more curious and excited.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In front of me, Shimotsuki never lets her expression fade.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She affirmed the parts of me that I thought were bad, as if they were part of my charm.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was like an angel.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then I’ll teach you lots of ‘fun’. I’ll be your hobby teacher……. Wow, that’s great. I’ve been playing by myself for so long that I’m starving for a friend to play with, and I think it’s a win-win for both of us!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Teaching your hobbies ……, doesn’t that mean you just want to play together?</p>
<p class="calibre5">For a moment, I thought so, but I was very grateful for the offer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wondered if even a colorless mob character like me could be colored.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I, a mob character, could have a personality, …… I thought, that would be a very, very good thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I could establish my own existence and stand on the stage of the story in a position where I am not a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe then I’ll be able to look at …… Shimotsuki in a much different light.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I’m afraid to be in the position of being her friend right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wish I could be brave enough to say “I like you” to her more as an equal, for example……</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 22: I’m so jealous I’m turning into mochi!</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki never stops talking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, don’t you feel very lonely without your parents at home? If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to bear living without my mom and dad, but you’re so good at putting up with it all by yourself. I admire you even though we are classmates.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I moved the conversation to the living room and offered her some tea and snacks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki, who was sitting on the sofa, didn’t pay attention to the tea and snacks and kept talking to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I think Nakayama-kun is lonely, so it’s okay for me to come over here once in a while. It’s okay, isn’t it? Hey, can I bring a game or something? Please, Nakayama-kun. Let me play here.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was saying a lot of things, but it looked like she just wanted to play games with a friend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m your hobby teacher, Nakayama-kun. It’s nothing personal, you know. It’s just that my gaming time is set at one hour at home, so it’s not too hard to sneak out at night and play games under the covers, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was surprised that there was a kid in high school who was still doing such elementary school stuff.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From what I’ve heard, Shimotsuki’s parents really love their daughter, but they are a little …… overprotective. The deadline is 6 p.m., and she’s only allowed to play games for an hour.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But it’s not as bad as the abandonment of my family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My father and mother both do their job as parents, and I don’t think it’s that they don’t care about their children, but in terms of the level of love they show, I think it’s a little low compared to other parents.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even now, they travel abroad without their children.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is still better to be loved than not to be loved. Shimotsuki also seems to love her parents, but even with that ……, I think she needs a little change of pace.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought it would not be a bad idea to let her use this house for that purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be the least I could do to repay Shimotsuki for her kindness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please feel free to use this house. It’s an ordinary house, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki nodded, and her expression brightened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt embarrassed when she looked at me with such a happy expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s nothing here? No, I have Nakayama-kun in this house. I’m very happy with that. You can’t play a console game in the room because you have to connect it to a screen, right? I’ll bring one tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is something about me, or …… something that makes me feel so special, she’s a strange girl after all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was during one of these conversations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……? Hmm? Hmmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Shimotsuki’s ears twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she suddenly looked unhappy and turned her gaze on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun is …… the type of person who can attract girls, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words, unusually separated by a single line, were nonsensical.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At first, I was confused because I couldn’t understand what she was saying……, and then I heard the sound of the front door opening.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m home.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A quiet voice echoed through the house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that my stepsister, Azusa, has come home.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s unusual. …… Didn’t she go to Ryuzaki’s house today?</p>

<p class="calibre5">And hearing her voice, Shimotsuki looked like she was going to cry a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s terrible. I can’t believe you’re bringing a girl into your home instead of me, your friend. …… This is what you call cheating, right? Nakayama-kun’s n*****y! You’re a fool if you have me in your life and you’re messing around with other girls.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, after hearing what she just said, I finally realized why Shimotsuki was in a bad mood.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She has good hearing, so she must have heard Azusa’s footsteps outside. And probably sensed that the girl was coming to the house. Then Shimotsuki, who is a bit possessive, probably means that …… the flame of jealousy was kindled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, this is ……</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ya, jealous?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I ask, fearfully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She then puffed up her cheeks in an obvious way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her cheeks looked like mochi.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. I’m jealous. I’m so jealous, I’m turning into a mochi.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if you say so, I’m a little confused…….</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because the one who just came back to this house is my family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s my stepsister, even though we’re not related by blood, so I wanted to give her a pass for counting her as the opposite s*x…</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 23: My stepsister is not a love interest!</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Thinking back, I remembered that I hadn’t told Shimotsuki that I had a stepsister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe she misunderstood that I was living alone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, it’s not unreasonable for her to mistake Azusa, who suddenly came to my house, as a girl I hooked up with…… and I can’t convince her of that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, I think people usually notice that. Because next to my room on the second floor, there is a room with a name plate hung with the name “Azusa”, and the laundry on the balcony that can be seen from the living room window belongs to Azusa. If she wasn’t so clueless, I’m sure she would have realized that there were other family members.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could it be that Shimotsuki didn’t see anything other than me? Is it possible that she was so infatuated with me that she couldn’t see ……? I’m a mob character, but I’m being extremely arrogant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, Shimotsuki is a pretty clumsy person, so it’s not surprising that she didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll be careful not to make too many strange mistakes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Huh? Is there a visitor here?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, when Azusa came back, she seemed to have sensed that there was a visitor when she saw Shimotsuki’s shoes at the entrance. She came straight to the living room and appeared.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A girl with a childish face and twin-tails of black hair appears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And as soon as Azusa and Shimotsuki recognized each other, their eyes widened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Why are you here, Shimotsuki-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa’s question was natural.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not surprising that she would be surprised to find Shimotsuki, who is only supposed to be at school, at her house.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Na, na, na …… Nakayama-kun, aaah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then again, Azusa’s appearance must have been unexpected for Shimotsuki as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The unexpected appearance of a person from her own class, a classmate in fact, triggered her shyness to a spectacular degree.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She instantly became nervous and chewed on her words. Still, she seemed to have something to say, so she put her face close to my ear and whispered to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, you cheated on me with a girl whose b*****s are only slightly larger than mine? I wish you would have at least cheated on me with a girl with bigger b*****s. …… It’s true that I’m smaller than her, but I don’t think there’s much difference. Besides, it’s not my fault that I’m tiny, it’s my mom and dad’s genes, and that’s terrible.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, I don’t know what you’re upset about. …… If I kept up with Shimotsuki’s pace, I wouldn’t be able to clear up the misunderstanding any time soon, so I forced myself to start the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll introduce you. Azusa is my stepsister. …… See, we have the same last name, right? That’s because we’re actually brother and sister. Well, we’re the same age and I just have an earlier birthday than her…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I told this to Shimotsuki first, and then turned my attention to Azusa. She was looking at me and Shimotsuki alternately with a curious look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Brother, …… what does this mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, yeah, I’m actually friends with Shimotsuki, so I invited her over to …… our house? Yeah, anyway, she came over and we had a chat. I’m sorry for startling you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t say that she was not invited, or that she was stalking me, so I’ll be vague.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow……, I didn’t know that. It’s kind of surprising.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa was puzzled. Yes, I know how you feel. …… It’s surprising that a person like me has a friendship with Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s a little late for that. It was no use thinking about it too much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Besides, the explanation probably cleared up Shimotsuki’s misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’re siblings, so it’s not cheating or anything. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, I spoke into Shimotsuki’s ear and told her clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, there is no such thing as cheating in a friendship, but just to be sure, I told her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki looked unconvinced.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not fair that you’re stepsiblings. …… Ugh, it’s the standard heroine in anime. How can you not fall in love with a girl who’s been under the same roof with you for so long? I’ve been a loser since the beginning. …… It’s so hard. I’d like to kill Nakayama-kun and make him mine.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m scared.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want you to kill me, please.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it’s probably a joke. I really wanted it to be a joke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What can I say? …… Maybe you’re wrong, but we’re really just brother and sister, okay? I’m not in love with her, so don’t worry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s kind of embarrassing to say something like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if Shimotsuki didn’t seem to cheer up unless I said this, I managed to squeeze out a sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The only friend I have is Shimotsuki, so …… Azusa is just my sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, Azusa is nothing more than a little sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not more or less than that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To Azusa, I am nothing more than her brother.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Moreover, there is a clear rule that it’s ‘only inside the house’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If we step out of the house, we will only be brother and sister in the family register.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since we made that promise, I don’t think our relationship will progress any further.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There may have been a time when we cared for each other a little more……, but we no longer have that kind of relationship.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ho, really?　Your stepsister doesn’t like you! This is what reality is all about. …… I’m surprised. I’ve never heard of it before. Yeah, I see. …… If that’s the case, I haven’t lost yet. I’m glad.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And as soon as Shimotsuki realized her mistake, she looked very happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had a little trouble reacting to such a blatant show of favoritism.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could it be that …… Shimotsuki is looking at me as a romantic interest?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is that why she gets jealous when I get along with other girls?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is so thoughtful that I almost misunderstood something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wish she’d pay a little more attention to the mobs.</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 24: Poor Subheroine</strong></h1>



<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who had been so energetic and talkative just now, instantly became quiet when my stepsister, Azusa, came home. She was restless and fidgety like a borrowed cat.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Her shyness seems to have kicked in.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I guess she became uncomfortable. She seemed to have decided to leave as soon as possible.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“So, I’ll see you tomorrow. …… Bye-bye, Nakayama-kun. Thank you for today, it was fun. Oh, but you can’t flirt with other girls just because I’m going to be gone, okay? Promise!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">With these words in my ear, she leaves the scene.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…………Eh!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">But she didn’t feel comfortable walking past Azusa in silence. Her face turned red, but she bowed to Azusa.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yeah. Thank you. ……”</p>



<p class="calibre5">When Azusa also bowed lightly, Shimotsuki smiled awkwardly and then ran to the door.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Only Azusa and I remained behind.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was a rare occasion when my stepsister came home, and she was gazing towards the doorway as if she was following the back of Shimotsuki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“… I think this is the first time I’ve seen Shimotsuki-san with a face like that.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I think Azusa must have a strong impression that Shimotsuki is quiet.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ve always thought of her as an expressionless, icy girl, but when she shows me her blushing, impatient face, it’s understandable that I’m confused.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never really been involved with her because she doesn’t talk to me all the time and Ryoma said that Shiho prefers to be alone. …… Older brother, you are close with her, aren’t you?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Oh, yeah…… I guess so.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">I scratched my cheek and said a few words back to my stepsister.</p>



<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I wasn’t as comfortable as Shimotsuki, but I was uncomfortable too. Thanks to this, I couldn’t even sit down on the sofa and just stood there.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It was the first time we had talked as brother and sister in several days.</p>



<p class="calibre5">We promised each other before that we would be “strangers” outside the house.After the high school entrance ceremony, right after Azusa met Ryuzaki,…… she made up her mind to “love Ryuzaki single-mindedly” and parted ways with me.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She thought that if she had a relationship with another man, she would never be able to catch up with the distant Ryuzaki.</p>



<p class="calibre5">[“The ideal Onii-chan that Azusa was looking for is probably not Onii-chan. I think Ryoma-san is the real Onii-chan for Azusa.”]</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s only been about two months since she said that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It feels like a lot of time has passed since then.</p>



<p class="calibre5">Since then, we promised to act as brother and sister only inside our house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">The relationship between Azusa and I has become so weak that she asked me to call her “Nakayama-san” as if we were strangers outside the house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But then again, Azusa might have been a little uncomfortable with the idea. …… She started to hate seeing me and started to stay at Ryuzaki’s house.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seems that she stays over almost every day and is spoiled by her favorite “Ryoma Onii-chan”.</p>



<p class="calibre5">So I didn’t expect her to come home today.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“What’s going on? It’s unusual for you to come home.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Could it be that she’s not feeling well?</p>



<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, I was worried that she should be resting ……, but apparently that’s not the reason.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“I’m fine ……, but I just wasn’t in the mood today. That’s why I came home. …… I’m sorry, did I disturb you?”</p>



<p class="calibre5">“…… No, this is Azusa’s house too, so don’t hesitate.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">You don’t need to worry about it.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’m just a fake who couldn’t be your ideal “Onii-chan”, but I’m still a part of the family…</p>



<p class="calibre5">“If you ever have a hard time, please let me know. If there’s anything I can do to help, I’ll lend a hand.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">The person I once loved is now far away.</p>



<p class="calibre5">And now she’s falling in love with someone who isn’t me, and she’s going to devote her life to that person.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I’ll never be able to make her happy again.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I can only act as an older brother within the confines of our home……, but at least inside the house, I want her to spend her time as a younger sister without being bossy.</p>



<p class="calibre5">But I guess Azusa herself doesn’t want that.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She shook her head slowly.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. I don’t deserve to be spoiled by you anymore. …… Don’t worry about it. I’m sorry, you’ve always been so nice to me.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">She seems to have made up her mind a long time ago.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It seems that she has made up her mind to cut off all other men except Ryuzaki and give her all to him.</p>



<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, I can’t look at her.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I can’t even look at her directly because she is my sister.</p>



<p class="calibre5">How painful it is.</p>



<p class="calibre5">It’s really a sad feeling to watch. The subheroines are, if anything, even more …… pitiful than the mobs.</p>



<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-2891"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 25: An existence that only serves to satisfy the protagonist’s need for approval</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Is it really a beautiful story to continue an unrewarding love?</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I look at Azusa, I can’t help but think about such things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not only Azusa, but also my childhood friend Yuzuki and my former best friend Kirari. When I look at them, I feel so painful that it makes my heart ache.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They express their feelings of love in such a straightforward way, but the person in question is completely oblivious to it, using “insensitivity” as an excuse, and their feelings are always in vain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s …… really, really pitiful that her love is trampled on, her efforts don’t produce results, and yet she continues to be devoted to him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s as if they only exist to satisfy the protagonist’s need for approval.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I just can’t stop thinking about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… By the way, you were about to confess your love today behind the school building. The timing wasn’t right, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I have one thing in mind for why Azusa suddenly came home today. When I was eating lunch with Shimotsuki during lunch break, …… Azusa had called Ryuzaki to the back of the school building.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And at that time, Azusa was trying to confess her feelings……, I assume.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah … I was trying to be brave and tell him how I feel about him……, but it didn’t work.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She didn’t seem to have the energy to be brave anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She smiled fondly with a sad expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, Azusa was not able to confess her feelings …… because she encountered us at the wrong time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And unfortunately, it was Shimotsuki, whom Ryuzaki was most obsessed with, that he encountered. So Azusa’s courage was trampled upon and put on the back burner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seemed to be severely depressed by it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, is it possible that the person who was with you at that time was Shimotsuki-san? …… I was dying of nervousness, so I didn’t recognize you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all this time, she seems to have remembered that Shimotsuki was there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was that nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Oni-chan, when it comes to Shimotsuki-san, he can’t see anything else……. Haha, I knew I couldn’t win.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Haha, you can’t.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but curse at her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I almost shouted at my sister, because she was so painful to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is no value in unrequited love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not like Azusa’s love is even a lost love. He’s not even aware of her feelings, she’s just being trampled on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not a beautiful story. It’s just painful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… What? What did you say? Your voice is too quiet, I couldn’t hear you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa says she didn’t hear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But her face looked so sad that I couldn’t …… watch it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know what I’m doing, so don’t say anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t say it out loud, but I think she knows it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t have to say it, but she knows it. She knows that this is not a problem that can be solved with a friendly smile, and she is still trying to cover it up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So she pretends not to hear me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She takes my words and tries her best to hide her pathetic self.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, no.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that look on her face, I couldn’t say anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not in a position to lecture her anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am not someone who is close enough to Azusa to interfere in her life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the path that Azusa has chosen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter how unhappy she was, no matter how much she was hurt, she wanted it all, so I couldn’t say anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So I played it off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a mob character, I replied nonchalantly as an emotionless doll.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can only do so much …… as a mob…</p>



<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-2962"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 26: The Difference Between Subs and Mobs</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">I didn’t want to see my stepsister in pain anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, I talked a little too much. …… I used to only vocalize a few times most days, but thanks to Shimotsuki, I’ve been talking a lot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thanks to this, my throat hurt. My voice was dying due to the fact that I usually don’t talk at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was going to finish the conversation and go to my room to rest.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I’m surprised that you and Shimotsuki-san are such good friends. …… I wonder if Ryoma Onii-chan knows about this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Azusa suddenly said that, I couldn’t help but widen my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Bad … Yes, it might have been a bad idea for Azusa to know about my involvement with Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Azusa likes Ryuzaki. But Ryuzaki likes Shimotsuki. …… In other words, Shimotsuki is a love rival for Azusa.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that the girl is on good terms with everyone except Ryuzaki means that Azusa and the other subheroines will be the ones to benefit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although Ryuzaki’s feelings will not be rewarded, there will be a battle for the vacant position of the main heroine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, in the current situation where Shimotsuki is not attached to anyone, the truce is such that it is impossible to even start a war.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the sub-heroines to be rewarded, Shimotsuki is an obstacle in their way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Therefore, it is not surprising that the girls want to eliminate the absolute main heroine, Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In fact, it is more natural for them to want her to disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For example, Azusa may be hoping that if she gets together with a guy other than Ryuzaki…….</p>

<p class="calibre5">(That was a rather bad move, since that’s not …… the kind of protagonist who becomes more fiery the more adversities he faces.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I’m sure it won’t go the way the subheroine wants.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In fact, I think the absolute stronghold of Shimotsuki will become stronger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki is the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When he is cornered and has no other choice, that is when he shows his true strength.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure he’ll start a fierce attack on Shimotsuki. He will not pay attention to the other sub-heroines, and will become passionate about developing a straightforward romantic comedy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From a meta point of view, I think that’s probably what will happen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And when that happens, the person who will be the most unhappy …… is Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I would never allow someone I hated to follow her around just because she became friends with me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So I got impatient.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa, wait a minute!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but grab Azusa’s shoulder. It was the first time in a long time that I had touched my stepsister’s shoulder, and it was so small and slender that I felt like it might break if I put a little pressure on it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s wrong with ……? You suddenly …… startled me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry for startling you, but I’ll apologize later.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please, don’t tell Ryuzaki about …… me and Shimotsuki, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I desperately begged her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know I look pathetic, but I have to stop this, even if I have to beg.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know it’s not convenient for Azusa. …… Shimotsuki is your love rival, and I understand that it’s more beneficial for her to get together with a guy who isn’t Ryuzaki. But please, …… please don’t tell Ryuzaki. I’ll do whatever I can to help you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was so desperate that I thought about getting down on my knees.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe it’s because I’m in a hurry, but my speech is pretty messed up. It came out of nowhere, and Azusa still seemed surprised, her eyes rounded.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I continued with my words to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki shouldn’t get involved with Ryuzaki. …… I don’t want to hurt that girl, please. I know I’m asking Azusa to take a loss……. Still, please, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I begged her to let us go.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, I lowered my posture to get down on my knees,……but Azusa stopped me from doing so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never seen you get emotional before. …… I was surprised. You’re a human being too, huh, Oni-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she smiled gently at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, okay. I won’t tell. …… I promise. I won’t tell anyone, so don’t look like you’re about to cry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And unexpectedly, she readily agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be a loss for her, but she didn’t seem to care about that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa wants Ryoma Onii-chan to like her, fair and square …… I don’t think I want to be loved in return after Shimotsuki-san is a bust, okay? I’m not going to use …… any sneaky tricks because I want to winover Shimotsuki-san fair and square.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She declared in a clear voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though she knew she was going to lose out, she was going to stick to her principles.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I genuinely thought that was a wonderful thing about her…….</p>

<p class="calibre5">This may be the difference between a “sub character” and a “mob character”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unlike the mob characters who can’t be anything, she has a solid character, “Azusa Nakayama”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found her to be very charming.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“And also, …… you tried to help Azusa in the back of the school building, didn’t you? I’m glad you said, “I think you have something to say.” …… I couldn’t make use of that support, but you still tried to be nice to this terrible sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she clenched her fists.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As if to give herself a boost, she gives a big push.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m not going to bother you. …… Azusa loves Ryoma Onii-chan, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Azusa, who had been depressed earlier, smiled as if she had regained her energy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She had a lovely, friendly smile that was unique to Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to do my best to be as good as Shimotsuki-san! I can not afford to be depressed. …… Azusa is going to visit Ryoma Onii-chan now. I’m going to spoil him a lot and charm him!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She made a strong declaration and walked away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Watching my stepsister’s back, I laughed a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, good luck …….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The only thing I can do now is cheer her on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I still want Azusa to be rewarded for her feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m a fake, but I’m still “Onii-chan”.</p>






<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3033"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 27: How to Break the Tainted Relationship of “Childhood Friends”</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">June. It’s the rainy season, and the gloomy heat is uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My friend Shimotsuki was at my house with the fan all to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s been about a week since we became friends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the past few days, Shimotsuki has been visiting my house after school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Listen, listen. I asked my mom and dad for a 7pm curfew!　Now you can have more time to play with Nakayama-kun, okay? Hey, are you happy? By the way, I’m very happy.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was yesterday when I heard that news.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not that my house and Shimotsuki’s house are not close to each other. …… It’s strange that she came all the way on the bus.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was strange that she wanted to meet me. …… Shimotsuki was a strange girl, as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And today she is at home again. She sat hugging the fan in the living room and gave me a mischievous smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it hot? Hey, Nakayama-kun, are you hot by any chance?　Are you troubled because I’m stealing the breeze from the fan?　That’s too bad. If you want me to share the fan’s breeze, I’d like some ice cream from your freezer.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Negotiating …… is more like blackmail.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s my house, and standing in front of my fan, so wanting ice cream is a strange bargain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you want, …… chocolate or vanilla?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Chocolate!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, I’m giving it to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had bought this ice cream in anticipation of her arrival. But I didn’t expect her to already know what was in the freezer. …… I guess she saw it without permission. No, I’m not mad at her, but I thought she was being very free.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s delicious. …… I wonder if in a little while it will be too hot to be fooled by ice cream? That’s what summer is all about……. Isn’t summer always about the beach? What do you do then?　I want to see a video game with marine fields, or a movie where sharks eat people in the ocean, or a cartoon where people go to the ocean.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… So you don’t want to go to ocean in person?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found this out after we became friends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is a perfect indoor person. She doesn’t really like outdoor hobbies.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s because it burns my skin. …… See, I always wear cardigans, don’t I? It doesn’t matter if it’s summer or not, it’s not for fashion. If I get even the slightest exposure to the sun, I’ll turn red, so I have to take care of myself, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki always wears a gray cardigan. It’s a little large, and only her fingertips are showing where her hands used to be. I had always thought it was a fashion statement, but apparently there was a good reason.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Speaking of which, Shimotsuki wears knee socks every day and keeps her skirt long. That’s why her legs are hardly exposed. She seems to be taking very careful measures to prevent sunburns.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I really want to take it off because it’s so hot. …… In the classroom, my seat is by the window, right? I don’t like it when the sun shines in class. There’s that guy right in front of me. …… Nakayama-kun’s seat is a little far away, and I’m sick of it. But that ends today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Instantly excited, Shimotsuki threw the chocolate ice cream into her mouth at once. I wonder if the coldness doesn’t give her a headache. …… She walked up to me, sniffling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, this is a secret ……, but tomorrow, our class will have a seat change. I was asked by our homeroom teacher, Suzuki-san, to create a lottery …… and he said, ‘I trust you, Shimotsuki-san will not cheat’.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, …… really?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Our class changes seats once a month. Every time this happens, a lottery is created, and this time it seems that Shimotsuki has been put in charge of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But I have one concern. But I have one concern, and that’s that my childhood friend Ryuzaki-kun always sits near my seat. …… I don’t intend to, but he’s always in my sight. It’s in. Is that what they call a rotten friendship? Please don’t do this to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that the relationship of childhood friends can twist the concept of probability.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who spoke in a disgusted tone, must have had quite a hard time so far.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, in order to break this bond, …… I’ve decided to go rogue this time. It’s not necessary to always be together just because you are childhood friends with someone. It’s not a special relationship, just an old acquaintance, and it’s time to move on, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, …… injustice.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The way to break the rotten relationship between childhood friends was by force.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Nakayama-kun, please help me, okay? I want you, my friend, to sit near me. …… If I have any trouble in class, I want you to help me, and I want to help you. Ummm, that’s nice. …… Boring school life can finally be fun!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a sparkle in her eyes, Shimotsuki begins to talk about injustice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She didn’t want to be seated too close to Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">….. The truth is, we shouldn’t be cheating, but I guess we have no choice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I suppose that’s why I don’t like that guy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s time for God to separate the fate of the childhood friends who are connected by a rotten fate.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3102"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 28: The Protagonist Speaks Out</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The day of the seat change.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After thorough planning and preparation, we were ready for this day.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the morning, the students are buzzing because of the seat change ……. Most of the classmates don’t seem to be interested in it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It is only in primary schools, or just barely in middle school, that people get excited about changing seats.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If you’re in high school, you don’t care where your seat is. No, actually, they may care about the opposite s*x nearby, but they are not old enough to show it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So the classroom in the morning is quiet as usual……, but after they came, it became noisy at once.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan, today is the day for changing seats. It would be nice if we could sit near each other again!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Haha …… I couldn’t sleep last night because I had a stomachache. I wish I could be closer to you, Ryoma-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Ryoma, if I leave you, don’t forget me, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki’s group arrived in the classroom and immediately made a fuss about changing seats.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My stepsister, Azusa, my childhood friend, Yuzuki, and my former best friend, Kirari, look worried. Currently, the three of them have an advantageous position in the Ryuzaki harem. They want to maintain that advantage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They are in the same class, sit close to each other, and have a close relationship ……, so for now they are one step ahead of the other harem members, but if they lose that advantage even a little and the balance of power is lost, they will quickly fall down the rankings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If they are not careful, another heroine will take their place. It’s just a matter of changing seats, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, Ryuzaki is so insensitive that he doesn’t notice such things.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh dear, calm down. Don’t make too much noise over a mere seat change.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As usual, he smiles and says he can’t help it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He doesn’t care what the girls think. The hero is not concerned about his seat ……, and no matter which seat he takes, the heroine is always nearby. No wonder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In this year’s second grade class, which I belong to, most of the girls are corrupted by Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All of the girls have some sort of interest in him, and they’re all looking for opportunities to get to know him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s probably because he doesn’t have a problem with women that he can say such annoying lines as, “Oh dear.” no matter what the harem members say to him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But …… there is one girl in particular who is special to Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The girl hadn’t come to school yet. Her seat was right behind Ryuzaki’s, and she was his childhood friend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her name is Shiho Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is a girl with strikingly transparent silvery-white hair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, the seats may change, but that doesn’t change the fact that …… I’m with Shiho. I’ve known her since she was a little girl, so we have a connection. As long as I can be there for her and protect her, I don’t care where we sit.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The protagonist says boldly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He is so proud of his position as a childhood friend that he has no doubt that he can get the results he wants without any effort.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He doesn’t think about the feelings of the other girls who have heard him say that, he just says things that make him happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s still the protagonist, as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“””………”””</p>

<p class="calibre5">The three girls have a little bit of a sad expression on their face when they hear those words. It’s not too late for Ryuzaki to be obsessed with Shimotsuki, but I guess he’s damaged.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, only one …… my stepsister, Azusa, was able to get back on her feet quickly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was looking at them blankly, when suddenly Azusa looked at me and smiled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A week ago, after encountering Shimotsuki at home, …… Azusa seemed to become a little stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had the impression that her heroine status had improved.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even now, she has a sturdy smile on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Eh~? It’s terrible, Ryuzaki Onii-chan is okay with leaving Azusa? If you say anywhere is fine, it makes me sad …… gusu gusu.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Crying, Azusa hugged Ryuzaki from behind as he sat in his chair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, come on, it’s too much. …… Okay, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’ve said such horrible things, but I want to be with Azusa and everyone else.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He even uses this moment to his advantage and indulges himself well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… As always, though, it’s a sight that almost breaks my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, anyway. I cheered her on in my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s good, Azusa. You can take advantage of these opportunities to improve your reputation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After this, there will be a big opportunity …… for you to never miss it?</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Ryuzaki is broken off from his childhood friend by the power of injustice, he is sure to be shocked.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If Azusa can take advantage of his heartbreak, she will be one step ahead of the other heroines.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3172"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 29: Sitting on the edge of the “childhood friend” position</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The seat change in our class is quite normal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Each seat is assigned a number, and the student who draws the number in the lottery gets that seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, if the lottery is drawn in the normal way, Shimotsuki cannot be separated from Ryuzaki due to a mysterious force of fate. It seems that the rotten connection of childhood friends is holding them together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In order to break this bond, Shimotsuki seems to have decided to go rogue this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She must have decided that she couldn’t let this opportunity to create a lottery pass her by.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yesterday, she said something like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I stuck the lottery tickets on the top four corners of the lottery box. This should be a perfect solution for Ryuzaki-kun!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The contents of the fraud are as follows.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let’s say the classroom is divided into four sections and Ryuzaki sits in the back left seat. At that time, I was asked to take the lottery ticket from the upper right front side of the lottery box.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that each of the four corners of the lottery box has two lottery tickets attached to the top. The lottery on the top of the right rear of the box is linked to the lottery on the right rear of the classroom, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you win the lottery, make sure you get rid of all the lottery tickets in the other corners. It’s only lightly glued on, so it’ll come off easily and they probably won’t even notice.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Well, I don’t think anyone would think that I would cheat in such a seat change, and I don’t think they would find out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if they found out, it wouldn’t be much of a problem. The homeroom teacher, Suzuki-sensei, would probably be stunned at best.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s only Shimotsuki who does so much for a mere seat change.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it’s a scary thing that she has to do something like this to break the rotten relationship with her childhood friend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As soon as I was thinking about this, the morning class started.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi, everyone, good morning. …… Oops, Shiho Shimotsuki, you’re just in time! You’re actually out of time, but it’s only for a few seconds, so I’ll let you off the hook~.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as the teacher arrived, Shimotsuki arrived at about the same time. In her hand, she is holding a box that seems to contain lottery tickets.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unusually, she was just in time today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She bowed her head apologetically, though she was too shy to raise her voice. Her face is expressionless, so at first glance she looks unconcerned, but I know she’s actually just nervous and her expression is tense.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now that I’ve gotten to know her better, I can tell a lot more about her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is neither emotionless nor unsociable, she is simply a clumsy person who is very shy and has difficulty with human relations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay, so let’s switch seats right away. Shimotsuki-san, did you make the lottery?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Suzuki-sensei called out to her, Shimotsuki held out the box she was carrying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, thank you. Then, come and get it in the order of your attendance number~.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suzuki-sensei started to change the seats without thinking that she was being cheated on. Our attendance numbers are determined by address, not by alphabetical order, so I was supposed to draw my number after Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho, what’s wrong? You were almost late, did something happen?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was still engaging with Shimotsuki, but she seemed annoyed. She was staring at the blackboard without even looking at him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you need anything, just let me know. We’re childhood friends, so don’t be shy. We’re changing seats today, but we’re always close to each other anyway. …… I wonder…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though he laughed briskly, Shimotsuki made a face of ignorance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She really doesn’t seem to like it. …… I wonder if she’s holding back because it’s only until today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And I’m also looking forward to seeing Ryuzaki’s face when he finds out that he can’t be near Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, Ryuzaki-san, please come and draw the lottery.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, okay. I’m coming, Suzuki-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I’m a teacher, but you can’t call me chan~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki drew a lottery. As I watched to see where he would be, he wrote his number in the center seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The power of fate is unbelievable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Though they couldn’t sit next to each other due to irregularities, he took a seat as close to Shimotsuki as possible. In the center, it would be the closest place to the four corners.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(I wonder what would happen in that case?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, being the creator of the lottery, is supposed to be the last to draw the lottery. This may be an anti-cheating measure ……, so it’s okay for me to choose.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think I’ll take the back right seat anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s where my seat is now. It should be good because the sun won’t shine on her here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then …. Nakagawa ……. Nakayama ……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suzuki-sensei called out my name. She’s my homeroom teacher, but she doesn’t remember me because I’m so shadowy. I’m used to teachers not remembering me, so I didn’t think anything of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I went to the front and put my hand into the lottery box on the podium.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took one of the lots on the upper right rear side and then removed the lots from the three remaining corners.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Not good……. took longer than I thought.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">They probably thought I was messing around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, Suzuki-sensei was smiling and laughing, so it was fortunate that people didn’t think I was cheating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh my? Did you really look forward to the seat change?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">….. You’re mistaken, but that’s okay.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes. That’s how it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said the words nonchalantly and showed the teacher my lottery ticket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, the location was shifted to the right back of the classroom, no ……, but one next to it. So, if everything goes according to plan, it looks like Shimotsuki will be sitting in my current seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The only thing that stuck out to me was the dubious look on Ryuzaki’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I guess he doesn’t know. Let’s hope so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay. Lastly, Shimotsuki-san, here you go~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Shimotsuki drew the ticket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though it was the last one, there were still three seats available since there were absentees. One of them is next to Ryuzaki, and if something goes wrong, Shimotsuki will again be bound by a rotten relationship. …… This time, it seems that the power of cheating has won.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, right in the back. Then, subtract the absentees and ……. that is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki came next to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What !?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was Ryuzaki who was the most surprised at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His eyes widened and he stared at the blackboard as he leaned forward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, seriously……!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost laughed as I watched the astonishment in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh, no. …… I can feel myself getting uglier and uglier. But a black emotion filled my heart and I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Don’t think that everything is going to be the way you want it to be, okay?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that the main heroine hates you more than you think…</p>

<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3237"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 30: Childhood Friend’s Demonic Charm</strong>　</h1>


<p class="calibre5">The cheating of the seat change went off without a hitch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thanks to this, my seat is now in the back right corner of the classroom. It was one position off from the back of the class on the hallway side. And in the far corner, Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, she’s sitting in the same seat I was sitting in a while ago.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m so glad…… I was afraid I’d end up next to him again.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Muttering in a small voice, Shimotsuki dropped down as if exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She put her cheek on the desk and stared at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The plan worked. Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki thanked me in a small voice, and I shook my head, telling her not to worry about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can do anything for her. No matter how much trouble she gives me, no matter how unreasonable she is, I would gladly give my life for her if it would make her happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s the extent of Shimotsuki’s existence to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Phew……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she looks somewhat awkward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems like she has a lot to say, but when she opens her mouth, it’s only faintly audible, and she breaks off her words unusually quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She usually strings together sentences as if she were rambling, so she doesn’t seem to be in the right frame of mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wondered what the reason was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was curious, but the class started and the chatter soon ended.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The Japanese class had started, so I opened my textbook and turned my gaze toward the blackboard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Ryuzaki, who was naturally in the center of the room, came into view and …… to my surprise, our eyes met.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(What’s wrong with him!? Glaring at me so much, are you jealous of …… the mob?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Inwardly, black emotions were swirling in my mind, but I was careful not to let them show on my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I made a show of pouting, as if I were some kind of optimistic mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki clicks his tongue at me. He turned his gaze away and looked forward. You can’t keep looking behind you because you’re in class. …… Thank goodness I was in the back seat, or I would have had to keep an eye on him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I try to avoid talking to Shimotsuki in front of Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To him, I had to be a good-natured mob character. I want to be just a stage prop, a dog in an unrequited love affair, not even a trigger for the progress of the story. It’s safer for Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But now that we’re sitting next to each other in the classroom, we’ll naturally have more opportunities to chat. …… That’s a problem if Ryuzaki sees us, I thought.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, I was offered a notebook from next to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(…………What’s this?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took it reflexively, but I was confused because I couldn’t understand why.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was nothing to see on the plain brown notebook. There was nothing written on the cover, so I didn’t know what it was about.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I looked at the person who had given it to me, not knowing why she had given it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who was right next to me, laughed mischievously and gestured for me to open the notebook.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What in the world is this?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I open the first page. On the first page, there was written the following.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho and Nakayama-kun’s Diary”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… What? You’re in elementary school???</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t expect to have to do an exchange diary when I was in high school, so I was a little suspicious that Shimotsuki wasn’t actually in elementary school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, well, I know that’s not possible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although her body is thin and small, Shimotsuki is a definite high school student.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, she simply wants to have an exchange diary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To Nakayama-kun. In my previous life, I was a small animal with a strong sense of identity, so I can’t talk well in public. That’s why I came up with the idea ……. That’s right, if we can’t talk, why don’t we write a diary like this? I thought.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I read through the text.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps it was because she had decided to start a diary in a serious way, but compared to her last random letter, she seemed to be trying harder to use kanji. However, the number of strokes and the fact that she didn’t seem to know any difficult kanji made it look like an elementary school composition.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I could feel her feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was too nervous to speak well in the presence of others, but she still wanted to communicate with me, so she came up with the idea of an exchange diary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… I can’t believe there are such pure girls out there.　</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought she was like a elementary school student, but …… that’s not a bad thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s the innocence that keeps you as innocent as a child even when you’re in high school that makes men’ hearts flutter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I am sure that Shimotsuki has never been stained with any one particular color.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is colorless, transparent and ……, which makes you desire to dye her with your own colors.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is a certain charm about her that makes me desire to have her heart all to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if that is why Ryuzaki is also captivated by Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s how much of a demonic charm she seems to have.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I hadn’t been aware that I was a mob character, I would have been in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I might have misunderstood and become strongly conscious of Shimotsuki as a member of the opposite s*x.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That would have been unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just being friends is enough, but a relationship beyond that is …… aspired to, but there was also a sense of resignation that it was still impossible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At least, I’m afraid to remain a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I won’t be misunderstood. I picked up the mechanical pencil, eliminating all feelings except those of a friend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“All right. Pleasure to work with you.”<br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>
<p class="calibre5">I wrote a short, single sentence and returned the note to Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She took it with an excited look on her face, but her lips twitched in frustration, as if she was disappointed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe she wanted me to write something longer. No, was it too plain?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Well, no matter. I can continue to keep the diary while trying to figure out what kind of text would satisfy Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But this is good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought this was a good idea, because I could communicate with Shimotsuki without worrying about Ryuzaki’s eyes…</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3305"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 31: The Main Character’s Unnecessary Meddling</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">After class, I decided to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was leaving, Shimotsuki looked lonely, but I was just going to the bathroom, so don’t look at me like that……. Like a baby bird left behind in the nest.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And since Shimotsuki is shy and doesn’t talk much in class, I don’t think it makes a difference whether I’m there or not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think ……, but maybe it’s different for Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, she seems to be at ease just knowing that I am next to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looks at me all the time, and when our eyes meet, she smiles at me. …… An unexpected smile is bad for the heart because it makes me nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I still can’t get used to it because I have no idea why she misses me so much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She really is a strange girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I finished my business while thinking about that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if the reason I’m walking so fast is because I’m subconsciously trying not to keep Shimotsuki waiting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was thinking of returning to the classroom as soon as possible, but on the way ……, I was interrupted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey. Nakayama, do you have a minute?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one leaning against the wall in the hallway was Ryoma Ryuzaki, the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Do you have a minute? It was a formal question, but he didn’t care about my answer. He didn’t even wait for an answer, he just came at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did you do something during the seat change? To my eyes, it looked like you were cheating.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I knew he suspected it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was expecting to be questioned like this, since I had seen the suspicious look on his face during the lottery.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was already prepared to fake it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I laughed in a funny way. I tried to play the role of a good-natured mob, trying to play it off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you talking about? I didn’t do anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t because I was upset that I didn’t hesitate to say something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a trap to mislead Ryuzaki’s perception.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re hiding something, aren’t you? You’re chewing on your words a lot.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He clenched his fists and took another step closer to me.He grabbed me by the chest as hard as he could.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He was quick to show his hands. …… That’s how annoyed he was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The protagonist is obnoxious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay, okay! I’ll be honest with you, ……, so please forgive me~.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Like a dog that has been bitten, I show a slumped posture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was worried that I was overacting, but Ryuzaki was not calm and did not seem to notice the difference.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Tell me quickly. What did you do?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Okay, he’s saying it well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While laughing inwardly, I made a troubled expression on my face and said the answer I had prepared in advance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I was just cheating on the lottery. …… If I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t be able to get close to Shimotsuki-san, whom I adore.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Half of it is true, half of it is a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not really my fault, but …… I wanted to make sure that Ryuzaki knew that this cheating was planned by me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To make Ryuzaki realize that this is ‘just a miserable mob character’ struggling painfully.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But, Shimotsuki-san is always so naive that it hasn’t worked out so well…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the same time, I casually pretended that it was a failure to make Ryuzaki feel less jealous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It will make the protagonist feel much better.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I see. You cheated after all, didn’t you? I’m sure you’ve done something clever. ….. Shiho is a serious person, she doesn’t like that kind of thing. You can’t get people to like you stupidly for cheating.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This seems to have taken some of the frustration away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a sigh, Ryuzaki let me go.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll give you a tip, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He then gave me the advice that a protagonist should appreciate.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There have been many men who have fallen in love with Shiho like you. …… All of them have been crushed. I’m not sure what to say. She’s not interested in other people. …… I’m sure she’s the type who only opens up to the person she’s married to. So don’t be too pushy.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost laughed at that statement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Shimotsuki is serious? Not interested in others? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ……)</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s quite the prankster.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She often teases me and laughs at me like a little devil.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And it’s not that she’s not interested in other people.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just that she’s too shy to chat with others.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And yet, Ryuzaki’s misconception of Shimotsuki was a little scary, as he misunderstood her in a way that suited him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’d better give up on Shiho. This is for your own good. …… Taking on a reckless challenge is not a bad idea, but you’d better step aside before you get too hurt.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With serious good intentions, the protagonist-sama gives me unnecessary fuss.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to say this out loud to Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s none of your business….</p>



<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3377"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 32: Does the protagonist really love his childhood friend?</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Early June. I think we need air conditioning by now, but our school seems to be reluctant to pay the electricity bill, so we haven’t turned it on yet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Instead, the windows are fully open to let the air flow in. However, it didn’t make much of a difference to me as all that came in was a lukewarm breeze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho had been popular since elementary school. A lot of guys confessed to her, but she turned them all down. …… They didn’t even take her seriously. She’s that kind of girl. …… She’s serious, she’s strong, and she’s determined to only let her heart go out to the person she’s going to marry when she grows up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I walked up to the open window, listening to the protagonist’s appreciative speech.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Frowning at the lukewarm breeze, I wiped the sweat from my forehead.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I heard that in the past, schools tried to keep the air conditioner off as much as possible, but recently, more and more schools are turning it on to prevent heat stroke. I wish my school would follow their example.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… No, maybe this is set up so that the protagonist can cause an event.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s it. It is a kind of promise that the uniforms of sweaty female students are transparent. The main character has a good time with it, and the girls seen aren’t too happy about it, so it creates a good situation …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">I remember that my best friend Kirari used to read light novels to get along with me because she liked them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I neither liked nor disliked them, so I’m not passionate enough to call it a hobby, but Kirari seemed to enjoy it when we talked about them….., and that made me happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder who Kirari is talking to about it now?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… No, she’s not talking to anyone anymore, is she?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki told me that he likes girls with flashy colors, so so I dyed my own hair and pretended to be a flashy girl to fit the bill.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I’m sure she hasn’t even told Ryuzaki that she likes light novels.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, are you listening to me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, yeah. I’m listening.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oops, I shouldn’t have done that. I’ve been in a daze, so I haven’t really thought about it. But it didn’t seem to be worth it, so what was the problem?</p>

<p class="calibre5">In any case, he was just showing off the information about how much he knew about Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And it’s a wrong understanding, so I’m just confused when it’s told to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In short, I should give up on Shimotsuki, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, that’s right. Even I, a childhood friend, took a long time to get along with her. …… It’s impossible for a guy who just suddenly became a classmate.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yeah, I think so too. It’s unheard of for the main heroine to find specialness in a mere mob character, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki really is a strange girl. I agree with that, but I think …… Ryuzaki probably doesn’t get along with her, you know?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve just been lucky. It’s like we’re childhood friends and we’re specially close to each other. …… Looking at you, it kind of hurts my heart. You should not have a painful love.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The fact that they are childhood friends makes the equation that they are close. …… The relationship of childhood friends seems to be the absolute solution for the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll take it or leave it. That’s my motto, hit and miss!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Acting like an optimistic person was tiring, but I had to go along with Ryuzaki until he was satisfied. It is not possible for a mob character to not go along with the protagonist’s wishes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m worried about you because you might really break, but are you really that stupid ……? Do you know that?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t care. What’s the matter? You’ve been saying that since before ……, does Ryuzaki like Shimotsuki-san? Oh, by the way, you haven’t made that clear yet!　As your rival, I’m curious about that, so tell me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, I think I did a good job of acting that one.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the kind of line you’d expect to hear from a mob character who’s merely a dog.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And yet, I can ask him what I’m really interested in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the past, I’ve been somewhat aware that Ryuzaki has a liking for Shimotsuki, but he has never mentioned it to me …… clearly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No matter what happens, it won’t change the outcome, and I wouldn’t mind hearing it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I already know that he likes Shimotsuki. From what he has said and done so far, he seems to be absolutely aware of it. So, the only difference is whether or not he is expressing those feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why I want to know what kind of response he will give.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not like he’s the kind of person who would just say, “I love her” …….</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because he is the protagonist with a harem attitude.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indecisiveness is his patent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not that I like her, but she’s my …… childhood friend, so it’s only natural that we be together. She’s like my sister, my family……, and I have to make her happy. So I’d say I like her, but not exactly like you like her…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What?</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I saw Ryuzaki’s sluggishness, I had a concern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought for sure that Ryuzaki liked Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Does this guy …… really like Shimotsuki?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt that it was not a normal feeling of love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I were to compare it to that, it would be like having a pet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s natural to take care of her, it’s natural to protect her, and therefore she has the right to have her tail between her legs. I felt a chill down my spine, thinking that this is the kind of twisted love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(So this is what the …… harem route is like.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had thought that Ryuzaki was the protagonist of a story in which he had a harem mentality but loved one girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But he’s not. Isn’t this guy trying to go the harem route after loving Shimotsuki with all his heart?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost got goosebumps at such a horrifying prospect.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A sentence I had seen before flashed through my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The protagonist in the story had said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I like all of you! But each one of you has a different form of ‘love,’ so you’re equal!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">One heroine loved as the opposite s*x.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Another heroine loved as a friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Another heroine loved as a benefactor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Other heroines loved as family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So he can love them all equally.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He will make everyone happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He wanted everyone to be loved only by him &ndash; I remembered such an arrogant story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Originally, I wondered if Shimotsuki would have been a part of it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think she was framed as a childhood friend, and was added to the harem.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But to call it “love”, I think the form is too distorted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s not love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just selfishness.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3449"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 33: The Opposite of “Love” is not “Hate” but “Indifference”</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">“You can’t help but be desperate for Shiho, but don’t be too shabby, okay? This is the only time I’ll overlook your cheating.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He must have finished what he wanted to say.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that Ryuzaki is finally ready to let me go.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho and I have known each other since childhood, so we were supposed to be next to each other again this time…. I’m going to pretend that this time I’ve been beaten. You’re pretty good at this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">How can someone say that from that viewpoint of the top?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…… No, it’s not unnatural because he’s actually the top.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s the protagonist, and I’m a mob character, so the hierarchy of our positions is clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The reason why I get annoyed every time is simply because I hate Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I still hate Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have the same feelings for Ryuzaki as Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, oh. Thank you for letting me off the hook this time. It’s not very promising, but I’m not giving up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, if I were to argue or retort, the conversation with Ryuzaki would continue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I gave him a bland reply and broke off the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thanks to this, Ryuzaki seemed to be satisfied.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s go back to the classroom.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After saying that, he turned his back on me and walked into the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He headed towards the center of the room where he had taken his new seat. The protagonist’s opportunism is very frightening because the sub-heroines are surrounding him tightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sub-heroines seem to be relieved to be near Ryuzaki safely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even now, I’m even more jealous of him than usual when he comes back. Of course, Azusa, Yuzuki and Kirari were among them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure that if I hadn’t cheated, Shimotsuki would have been among them. I’m glad that didn’t happen……, but yes, her seat was in the corner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Maybe she heard us talking…….?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki has a keen sense of hearing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is very likely that she heard our conversation because she is sensitive to sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Not good. …… I let my guard down.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">What if she heard our conversation?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have no idea what kind of feelings Shimotsuki will have. Will she be dismayed, angry, sad, or happy? …… Hopefully, not too negative.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With this in mind, I returned to the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The first thing I did was to check on Shimotsuki. She was in her seat, holding both ears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… What are you doing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Ugh.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but call out to her. But Shimotsuki didn’t seem to hear anything, she didn’t even notice me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had no choice but to wave my hand in front of her to make my presence known.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Instantly, she looked at me and her expression brightened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun. You’re late. I was waiting for you ……. Here, let’s do the diary.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The fact that she doesn’t talk much and her voice is very low is probably due to the fact that her classmates are around her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she’s shy. Her voice is so low that I can only hear her if I’m sitting next to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay, but …… Shimotsuki, did you by any chance hear our conversation earlier?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She wanted to do an exchange diary, but I’m sorry, but it’ll have to wait.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What I was curious about was whether or not she had heard the conversation between me and Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I asked her about it, Shimotsuki made a blatantly disgusted face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know that Nakayama-kun was chatting with that person just now. But I don’t want to hear just the sound of that man, so I basically cover my ears when I hear his voice. So I didn’t hear the conversation.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you weren’t listening ……, that’s okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, she seems to be uncomfortable with Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Speaking of which, she covered her ears earlier and …… probably isn’t even lying to me. In front of me, Shimotsuki’s emotions show on her face and are easy to understand. I can even tell if she’s lying or not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But that’s not the point. Let’s keep a diary. Here, I’ve been working hard on my writing. Read it, read it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki pushed the diary to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm, what can I say, …… too much, I felt like she was not interested in Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t you care about what Ryuzaki is talking about?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t like Ryuzaki either, but it’s because I don’t like him that I’m curious about what he’s up to. If Shimotsuki disliked him as well, she could have overheard the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was curious, so I asked her frankly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she said with a puzzled look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It doesn’t bother me at all. I don’t know why you’re asking me that. …… I don’t really care what he says.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked deeply uninterested.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looked at me as if she was in a physics class, and finally realized something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki and I don’t hate Ryuzaki in the same way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In fact, I’m the only one who hates Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is completely “indifferent” to that guy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In a way, that’s even crueler than the feeling of dislike.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is a saying that the opposite of love is indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Besides, a romantic comedy that starts with a big dislike is a standard story. If Shimotsuki had disliked Ryuzaki, there might have been such a development.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki is not interested in Ryuzaki. Probably, she neither likes nor dislikes him, but just concentrates her feelings of “dislike”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If Ryuzaki knew that, what would he think?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wouldn’t he break down and give up? …… No, well, that’s not likely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because that guy is the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He is the one who will never give up until he is tied to the main heroine.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3514"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 34: The Life of a Mob Character begins to fade</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">A week has passed since the day we switched seats.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ever since the lottery, I feel like Ryuzaki’s gaze has increased.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hello, Nakayama. Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Ah, yes. Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I came to school in the morning, he started to talk to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that doesn’t mean that Ryuzaki and I have become friends. If anything, Ryuzaki seems to be wary of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s it. It’s like a security guard who dares to greet a suspicious person.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m always watching you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt as if I was being told that, and I was sick of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, fortunately, I think he still recognizes me as a ‘mob character’ for now, so there is no danger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s also unfortunate that Shimotsuki is shy and keeps quiet in the classroom. Our interactions are basically in the diary, and we don’t have any open conversations at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure she’d like to talk a lot, but if she does, Ryuzaki will witness it and will probably become very conscious of me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If he becomes even more hostile than he already is, I won’t be able to remain a mob character. I’ll become a character that opposes the main character, and that guy might try to fight me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that happens, the main heroine, Shimotsuki, will be in trouble. It’s not what I want.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… I wonder if I should keep my distance a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think I’ve become too friendly with Shimotsuki. This made Ryuzaki wary of her, and it didn’t seem like a good idea.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want Shimotsuki to feel sad because of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why it’s important for me to remove my presence as a mob character. It was a natural thing to do since it was a minor role that did not affect the progress of the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what I’ve been thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But she still would not allow me to do so.</p>


<p class="calibre5">“Hey, hey, Nakayama-kun. Do you think studying will be useful in the future?　No, I’m sure it won’t be useful. There’s no such thing as equations, and thinking about numbers in terms of a, b, x, y, variables? It’s absolutely ridiculous to think of numbers in terms of a, b, x, y, and henceforth.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The midterm exams are coming up soon, and even the study-phobic Shimotsuki seems to have finally gotten in the mood to buckle down. It was already a little late since it was three days before the exam, but she was studying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The place was my house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, …… I know it’s not good. I’ve become too intimate with her and I suggested that we study at my house for the exam. But Shimotsuki didn’t want that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t study at home. But my mom will scold me if I’m too silly, so I want to study. …… My dad doesn’t scold me, but I still want him to praise me. So, please, …… study with me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s the type of person who can’t concentrate when she’s alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She said that there were too many temptations in her room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Also, it would be nice if you could …… teach me. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I’m in the bottom half of the class and I’m so dumb that even I’m surprised, so please take care of me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not that smart either, my grades are a little below average.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But compared to me, Shimotsuki’s grades are totally low.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is quite a clumsy girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looks perfect, and her tone and gestures are elegant, giving off the vibe that she’s intelligent, but what’s inside …… is quite interesting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is a heroine in her own right, with her own unique character. When she asked me to do something for her, there was no way I could say no as I was only a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why Shimotsuki was at my house for the entire exam period.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…… I still feel like we’re getting too close.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After school, Ryuzaki doesn’t interfere with Shimotsuki, so so far the secret meeting between her and I hasn’t been exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I was scared that he might find out by chance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This makes him seem like an interloper.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think I am a little too obvious for a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hope nothing happens …</p>
<p class="calibre5">My life as a mob character is slowly starting to fall apart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When the midterm exams are over, our school starts an overnight training program.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is an important event in the school romantic comedy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the time when the protagonist plays the most active role and the story starts to move rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I was worried about whether I would be able to remain a mob character at that time…….</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3584"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 35: Turning point</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">I have some concerns about the overnight training, but first let me congratulate Shimotsuki for avoiding red marks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, look! I got a 32 on my math test. …… I’m so happy I’m going to cry. My mom and dad were so happy, and they praised me so much! Yesterday, they made my favorite hamburger steak. I was so happy. …… This is all thanks to you, Nakayama-kun. Thank you!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After school, Shimotsuki came to my house and smiled with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that she was very happy to have avoided a red mark.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was so happy that she grabbed my hand and started shaking it around. It may have been a handshake, but …… please don’t do skinship unexpectedly. I’m so nervous, it’s bad for my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re a great friend, Nakayama-kun. …… Thank you so much for helping me with my brain, which is not absorbing like a torn up sponge. I’m sorry I don’t remember things well, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No …. It’s just that Shimotsuki worked so hard, and your efforts properly showed in the results. Congratulations.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My help was really minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that Shimotsuki is a proper “can do anything” girl. You can say that it is natural that the efforts are reflected in the results, since she is the main heroine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m a little jealous of that, because I’m a mob character whose efforts don’t lead to results.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… There was a time when I studied hard to catch up with my smart childhood friend Yuzuki, even if only a little. At that time, I thought I was the protagonist, and if I studied hard, I was sure I could catch up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">　But the results were not so good. In hindsight, I can’t blame myself for that since I was a mob character. It is because the value of the character remains the same no matter how you do it that the character is cast as a mob.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m so glad that I’m finally free from my studies. That’s very good, but …… we have to have an overnight program this time, don’t we? Ugh, I don’t want to stay in a place other than my home and Nakayama’s home…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who is an indoor person, seems to be dreading the existence of the overnight program.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For her, it would be one disaster after another.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ugh, ……, this is going to remind me of something bad. I’ve always been in the same group with him. When I was in junior high school, I had a fever because I hated the school trip so much. If it weren’t for Nakayama-kun, I’m sure I would catch a cold this time too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if colds can be manipulated at will.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, no. I think she meant that she would take a normal day off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that she and Ryuzaki have always been connected through their rotten relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But this time, she’s not going to take a day off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The reason is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Nakayama-kun were present, I might be able to enjoy the overnight learning program a little more. …… But it doesn’t mean that we will definitely be in the same group. …… Oh, I’m still worried. I think I’m going to be very bored without you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because I’m there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s still strange that Shimotsuki trusts me so much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if she was relying on me, I wanted to help her as much as I could.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll try my best to be in the group with you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe Ryuzaki will try to bring Shimotsuki into the group. And since I’m a hindrance to him, he probably won’t let me join the group.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that happens, we’ll be separated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hoped, along with Shimotsuki, that we could be in the same group …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">But our fears were unfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The next day, during the class period, we had to decide on the groups for the overnight learning program.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, to my surprise, Ryuzaki approached me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Nakayama. You haven’t decided on a group, have you? If so, why don’t you join my group?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I was taken by surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hadn’t expected him to invite me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe this was a turning point in the story.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it possible that the most important part of the story, the beginning, middle and end, is about to begin?</p>

<p class="calibre5">If so, it was …… very scary.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3652"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 36: Done being satisfied with being just a childhood friend</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama, do you have a minute? I’d like to include you in the group, so let’s talk.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki, who was sitting in his seat, beckoned me over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was surprised because I didn’t expect to be asked to join the group.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I wanted to refuse, but if I did, I would be disbelieved.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A mob character should not be able to defy the will of the main character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As soon as I rebelled, Ryuzaki would become more aware of me……, which was not convenient.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s no use, I’ll just do as he says.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“All right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stood up from my seat and headed for the center of the classroom where Ryuzaki’s seat was.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Muu …”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t help but notice that Shimotsuki looks at me and puffs out her cheeks in frustration. She and I have recently agreed to be in a group together. I want to make her wish come true as much as possible, but I’m not sure how it will turn out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the overnight learning program, we were supposed to form groups of four boys and four girls each, for a total of eight people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m a mob character, so I only have Shimotsuki as a friend. So there was no one else who I could form a group with.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I should have been grateful for Ryuzaki’s invitation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I don’t like this guy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to be in a group with him, but …… I’m not in a position to stand up to the protagonist head on, so it’s hard to answer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ideally, Shimotsuki and I would be together and Ryoma Ryuzaki’s group would be somewhere else. …… It seems that Shimotsuki and I didn’t have the human skills to do that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It looks like most of the other groups have already decided. You are the only one left, right? Our group needs one more person, so come on.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what he’s saying on the surface, but I can’t help feeling that there’s more to it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Otherwise, there is no reason for Ryuzaki to invite me. I’m sure he has some idea of what he’s doing and is trying to get me to join the group.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to do what Ryuzaki wants. …… No, no, no. There is no reason to refuse. It seems that you can’t go against the words of the protagonist. …… I guess this is the fate of mob characters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry, Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s going to be difficult to fulfill your ideal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But there is still a chance to avoid the worst.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the very least, Shimotsuki should not be in the same group as Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t care what happens to me as long as that girl doesn’t feel bad. …… Well, what should I do?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you confused about?　…… Oh, I see. Do you hate it when Shiho isn’t around?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve got Ryuzaki mistakenly thinking that ‘I favor Shimotsuki’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought about how I could use that to my advantage and get away with it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s true. …… But I don’t like the idea of Shimotsuki-san being with you, my rival. Hmm, that’s right! Let’s put Shimotsuki-san in a separate group for equality. This time, why don’t we develop a friendship between men without worrying about the opposite s*x?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Acting as the same nimble mob character as ever, I tried to keep Shimotsuki out of Ryuzaki’s clutches somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it was impossible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to invite Shiho to join the group this time. I’ve just asked Azusa and the others to invite her.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He grinned and gave me a fearless smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I turned around in a huff and before I knew it, Azusa and the others were talking to Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You can’t blame them for getting along with a guy, right? And since you’re my rival, …… let’s play fair and square, shall we?　You’ve been acting suspiciously for a while now. It’s time for me to stop being satisfied with being just a childhood friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That declaration sent a chill down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter what I say, the story won’t stop now. The mob characters don’t have the power to interrupt the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So the only hope left was for Shimotsuki to refuse the invitation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan, I got Shimotsuki-san’s consent too~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was almost nodding my head when I heard Azusa’s report when she came back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What a surprise, Shimotsuki seems to have accepted the invitation even though Ryuzaki is there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t stop it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story accelerates.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3719"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 37: Not being with you is more painful than being with someone I don’t like</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">I wonder why Shimotsuki accepted the invitation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The members of the overnight learning program are supposed to be made up of four men and four women. Of course, Azusa, Yuzuki, and Kirari, the girls in Ryoma Ryuzaki’s harem, will be with us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And it seems that Shimotsuki has joined the rest of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why did she join the group when she had said she was not good with Ryuzaki so much?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could it be that she didn’t know that she was going to be in a group with Ryuzaki?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so worried that I couldn’t help but ask.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, did you like our overnight learning group?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she came to my house and nodded her head as she ate the cake I offered her as a snack.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seemed to be busy munching on the cake and was just moving her mouth without saying anything else. I felt a little impatient, since she was usually so chatty that she would explain things to me without even asking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you sure it’s okay? The group that Shimotsuki belonged to also has …… that guy, you know? Do you know that Ryuzaki will also be working as part of the same group?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She nodded again, and this time began to gulp down her juice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wondered if she didn’t mind being in a group with Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is carefree and relaxed enough to enjoy a good snack.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She had always had such a hard time with Ryuzaki, but her …… natural attitude seemed unnatural in contrast.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t you hate it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You can’t get what you want out of a roundabout question.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I asked her frankly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t it painful to be with Ryuzaki?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who had finally finished his snack time, smiled and answered my question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No? Because it’s more painful not to be with you than to be with someone I’m not fond of.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a surprise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;The pure words hit my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The reason was simple.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In Shimotsuki’s mind, I probably have a bigger impact than Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s become so fond of me that she can paint over the feeling of being uncomfortable with him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t get used to such words of affirmation no matter how many times I hear them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If there hadn’t been someone to give me such special words, I would have felt much happier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel like it’s not fair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like a fool for worrying so much about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, I’m sure the overnight learning program won’t be fun, but …… I’m looking forward to being with you. I hope I can make at least one memory with you. I’m so nervous that I’m going to have some weird fantasies.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;What kind of weird fantasies?</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I hear that now, I have a feeling that the relationship between Shimotsuki and I will change dramatically.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I were the protagonist of the story, I’m sure I wouldn’t have been able to resist asking that question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I’m a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not good enough for her. I have no personality, no character, and am just a symbol.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is too good for such a person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I couldn’t step out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s make some memories…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words I finally managed to reply were bland and ordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was probably not the words that Shimotsuki was really looking for.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, she is still pleased.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes! I hope it will be wonderful ……. Ehehehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The smile on her face was a little different from her usual smile &ndash; it had a hint of color to it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I were to use a literary analogy, it would be …… something like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a lovely smile, like that of a maiden in love.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3791"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 38: Foreshadowing</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">It seems that the overnight learning program is an annual event called the Orientation Camp.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In June, when the new students are getting used to school, and as a reward for finishing the mid-term exams, the school makes various arrangements for us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The location was a nature park about two hours away by bus. We were told that we would be able to sleep in the accommodations there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The main thing to do was to socialize.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Suzuki-sensei, the homeroom teacher, explained that the purpose of the trip was to help the students get to know their classmates better once they had learned their names and faces.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Outdoor cooking, recreational activities, a test of courage, and a campfire were all planned for now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The school may think that the students will be happy, but for someone like me, who doesn’t have many friends and isn’t very active in socializing, it’s quite a pain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki, who is an indoor person, seemed to feel the same way as I did, and didn’t look too happy when the day arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m so depressed that I would have caught a cold and fallen asleep if it weren’t for Nakayama-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The students were to meet in the schoolyard, so we were outside.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We were dressed in the school’s designated school uniform. It’s a dark blue jersey, and it’s plain, but when Shimotsuki wears it, it makes any outfit look good.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Moreover, today she was wearing a straw hat, probably to protect herself from the sun. It’s a mystery why she chose to wear a straw hat instead of a regular cap, but it looks good on her, so it’s not a problem.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Compared to the other girls around her, she looked so cute today that she seemed to sparkle and shine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s a lot of staring and …… I can’t speak.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her speech was lower than usual, probably because she was nervous. Shimotsuki’s inability to speak well is endearing in its own way, though.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh……. Oh, by the way, the seats on the bus are in order of attendance, right? Does that mean you’ll be next to that person?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In our school, attendance numbers are not determined by alphabetical order, but by the order of address. So, Shimotsuki and Ryuzaki are neighbors.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess she hates that and can’t help it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She laughed elegantly and said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh. I have a constitution that makes me prone to bus sickness. …… So I’ll have to move my seat so I don’t vomit on the person next to me. Yeah, that’s why I’m going to ask Suzuki-sensei to help me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki runs off with a thud. What’s the setting? …… She just put it on. I’m sure that’s how much she hates being next to Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if the lightness of her footsteps is due to her weight. …… It’s as if she has angel wings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… No, this is a hallucination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Lately, Shimotsuki has been looking unusually cute. The more I get to know her, the more I become infatuated with her charms.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel like she’s going to become a deity in a little while.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So it seems that Shimotsuki was able to escape from being next to Ryuzaki after asking Suzuki-sensei for help. When she boarded the bus, she sat in the first single seat in the front.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, who will be sitting in the empty seat?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Recently, looking at the situation of the Ryuzaki harem, it seems that my stepsister Azusa is one step ahead of the rest……, and I’m sure she won’t miss such a chance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa has the same address as me, and our attendance numbers are next to each other, but I think I may be the only one seated there on the …… bus.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought that would be good because it would help me relax.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I thought you were …… Nakayama-kun, you’re sitting next to me today. If possible, I’d like to sit by the window.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unexpectedly, Azusa came next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was surprised to see that the seat next to Ryuzaki is now available……. She was so aggressive that she would be the first to sit down if she had been around recently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… The seat next to Ryuzaki is empty?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wondered if maybe she hadn’t noticed, but how could Azusa not know about Ryuzaki?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know. But not today. I was in the mood to talk to Nakayama-kun. In fact, for Azusa ……, I’m making a very serious decision this time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As Azusa bent down to sit down, I, who was sitting by the window, shifted one position and gave up my seat.Although I said myself that we don’t behave as brother and sister outside the house, …… it seems that it is my sister who unconsciously says that she wants to be near the window at times like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And me, who listens to her selfishness without any resistance, must have the habit of being an older brother ingrained in my body.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was thinking about such unimportant things, so I was very surprised by Azusa’s comment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to confess to …… Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“―――― !?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I opened my eyes and went rigid.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that the time has finally come for the relationship between the Ryuzaki harem to become complicated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure that Azusa’s confession will be the catalyst for a fierce battle in the Ryuzaki harem.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is it. It’s a preliminary preparation to make the story more exciting in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was an unmistakable “foreshadowing”.</p>



<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3860"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 39: The Jinx</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The bus departed. Leaving the residential area, we headed towards the mountains where there was more and more nature. On the bus, Suzuki-sensei was trying her best to keep the students occupied by imitating a guide.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In fact, Sensei had a blind date the other day! I’m thirty-two years old, and my parents are insisting that I get married soon. But since I want to marry a nice guy who looks like a prince on a white horse, I don’t want to get into trouble with an arranged marriage.~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Suzuki-sensei’s talk was not interesting, so the boredom was not overcome. My classmates were chatting among themselves. No one was listening to what Suzuki-sensei was saying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, I looked at the front of the bus and saw Shimotsuki sitting at the very front. There was only one seat, and it was for one person. She was leaning against the window, not moving a muscle. She was probably asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then again, no one sat next to Ryuzaki after all. Unlike Azusa, the other members of the Ryuzaki harem were still keeping each other in check, which is why they seemed to have fallen into a state of rigidity. If someone sits down, it will be a problem for them, so they decided not to sit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, hey, it’s sad that I’m all alone. ……. But I don’t need friends, because being alone proves how strong a person is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even when he is alone, he is always noisy. As usual, the heroines around us giggled when they heard this comment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although he says he’s a loner, he still has harem members, so he’s in a luxurious situation. Well, I guess he’s just a little fashionable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;And so the bus ride continued.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the middle of it, Azusa next to me started talking to me in a quiet voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan seems to be having fun. Maybe it’s because Shimotsuki-san is joining us…. Ryoma Onii-chan said that Shimotsuki-san was sickly, so she generally didn’t participate in these events, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… That seems to be the way it is in Ryuzaki’s mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In fact, I heard that she was only skipping it because she didn’t want to be around Ryuzaki, who she didn’t like, but I’ll keep that to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is a secret. …… The truth is, Shimotsuki-san wasn’t even planning on going to this one. When I asked her to join a group, she refused at first. She said, “I’m not really good at this kind of thing.””</p>

<p class="calibre5">I remember that Azusa and others persuaded Shimotsuki to join the group.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But when I told her that she could be in a group with you, she said yes. I’ve never told Ryoma Onii-chan about this, so it’s a secret.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, so that’s how it was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was surprised that she accepted the invitation so easily, but I finally understood why.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that Azusa knew that we were on good terms, and that’s why she used my presence as an excuse to persuade Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I was surprised that I was able to convince her more easily than I thought. …… And Ryoma Onii-chan was happy, so it was kind of complicated.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa smiled dryly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was impressed by her friendly smile, but since she became involved with Ryuzaki, that smile has become cloudy more often. I’m sorry to report that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Azusa also thought that she could not be defeated. …… If things continue as they are, I will always be defeated by Shimotsuki-san, so I decided to confess during this overnight learning program.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Finally, she got right to the point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason why she suddenly decided to confess was because of …… Shimotsuki’s presence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“And there is a jinx that says if you confess your love to someone at a campfire, you will definitely succeed. So I’m going to try my best to believe in the jinx, even though it’s only a …… comforting thought.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… A jinx, huh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They are excellent stage sets for moving the story along.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Jinxes are persuasive and often used as a rationale to change a stagnant relationship.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In Ryuzaki’s story, too, the jinx seems to be a major turning point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder what will happen ……. I am very anxious about the future.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-3934"><strong class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 40: The Crossing of Thoughts and the Complication of the Story</strong></strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The protagonist, Ryuzaki, said this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s time for me to stop being satisfied with our relationship as childhood friends.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, the subheroine Azusa said, “I can’t lose to Shimotsuki-san, so I’m going to confess to Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then Shimotsuki, the main heroine, said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wish I could make wonderful memories with Nakayama-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The thoughts of each party intersect.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story has already begun, which is the “turning point” in the four-part structure of “origins, development, and conclusion,” or the “breaking point” in the three-act structure of “beginning, middle, and end”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder what kind of ending will be created.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If we think of the story as a template, ……, I think Ryuzaki’s relationship with Shimotsuki takes a step forward here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A childhood friend, who has always been quiet and never opened up, realizes her feelings for the protagonist during an overnight trip, and reveals the feelings she has kept hidden in her heart since childhood.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“”I’ve always loved you too, Ryuzaki-kun.””</p>

<p class="calibre5">With the confession of the girl in love, Ryuzaki is bound to the main heroine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think the catalyst for this is the “confession” of the subheroine, Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The protagonist, who has been insensitive until now, realizes that the subheroine likes him through the confession. However, the protagonist has someone else in his heart. So he refuses Azusa’s confession, saying that he can’t have a relationship with her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, finally, the insensitive and perceptive protagonist awakens.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He said it was the end of being satisfied with a normal childhood friend. …… If nothing else, I don’t think he’ll ever confess.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because the harem protagonist is always three things when it comes to love: insensitive, indecisive, and sloppy. He would not have been able to confess or even express his love for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Azusa’s confession inspires the protagonist to say, “I can’t be a coward.” He must be thinking, “Since I rejected Azusa’s confession, it would be disrespectful to Azusa if I don’t confess to Shiho!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And yet, the rejected Azusa says, “I’ve only been rejected once. I won’t give up on you until you fall in love with me someday.”, suggesting that there will be a change in their relationship in the future.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is how the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki ends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He is finally united with his childhood friend Shimotsuki, and the story has a happy ending.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, this is only the end of the first volume.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I assumed that there would be a continuation to Ryoma Ryuzaki’s romantic comedy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because there are still many foreshadowing lines that have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is still the story of that guy’s harem members.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why in the first volume, the protagonist, who is in love with the pure love of his life, is attracted by the charm of the subheroines, who become more present in the second volume. The main heroine who finished her role in the first volume becomes a convenient yes-man for the protagonist and tolerates other girls from the position of “regular wife” in the second volume onward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In this way, Ryoma Ryuzaki’s story is finally complete.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With the catharsis of a harem ending, the story concludes with thunderous applause.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I imagined such a disgusting story.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it were to follow the template, it would be a story like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki had only one …… element of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is the main heroine, Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is in the position of the main heroine, but she is not even slightly interested in the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because of this, the story is getting complicated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story is about to deviate from the standard template, and instead, a bizarre development is about to begin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In addition to the main characters and sub characters, there was another piece on the board.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That was me, the mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can a mob character stay a mob character forever?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the narrator, me, didn’t know.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4002"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 41: The Position of a Mob Character Becomes Increasingly Unconvincing</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">&ndash;It was 11:00 am in the morning when we arrived at the nature park where we were going to have our overnight learning program.</p>
<p class="calibre5">According to the schedule, we were supposed to have an outdoor cooking session as soon as we put our luggage in the large room where we would sleep.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, it’s quite spacious!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The room was spacious enough for the four of us to lay out futons and sleep together. Ryuzaki was excited as he looked around the interior.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that this guy has a personality that enjoys such events.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the excitement of the male members, except for Ryuzaki, was low.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s understandable. The other three guys were quiet because they were mob characters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, Ryuzaki doesn’t have any male friends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s popular with the opposite s*x like a harem protagonist, but he’s so popular that he’s shunned by the boys.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because of this, the members of the group were like a collection of leftovers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama, …… and the other two, please take care tonight, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m an exception, but of course Ryuuzaki doesn’t seem to remember the names of the mob characters. The other two are Hanagishi and Ikura. …… Hey, you’re too disinterested in anything but women.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s been two and a half months since the entrance ceremony. I think it’s polite to at least remember your classmates’ names.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Well, there’s no way the protagonist has such a sensible personality. If he was too normal, he wouldn’t have any character, so it was no use.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you. Let’s go to the square! I’m so hungry~!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At any rate, ignoring the protagonist would offend him, so I’ll just go along with the conversation. I said something that was typical of a stupid, looseheaded mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I guess so. The girls are waiting……. They’re going to be pissed if I’m late.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki grinned and walked out of the room. Hanagishi and Ikura followed behind him with vague expressions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I made the same vague expression and followed behind Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the plaza of the nature park, there is a kitchen and a cooking area. We were going to use them to make curry today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The ingredients and cooking utensils were already in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After we gathered as a class and took a roll call, we were finally divided into groups and started cooking outdoors.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So we’re going to start cooking outdoors……. If anyone here has any cooking experience, please raise your hand.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The person in charge of the cooking was Yuzuki Hojo, my childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her beautiful long black hair was now tied into a single bun. She seemed to have prepared her own apron and headband, so she was all set.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is a really good cook. She seemed confident and motivated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wanted to ask someone who was used to working with knives to help me. …… Hmmm… I think the only ones with experience are me and Ryoma-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The only one who raised his hand was Ryuzaki. It is a mystery to me why so many protagonists are the type that can cook.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, I get it. Many of them are without parents, and they are given the setting of being good cooks to mean that they are independent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If you think about it, it’s easy. Well, I’m a mob character, so even if I didn’t have parents, I wouldn’t be able to cook.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can cook, too, but not as well as Yuzuki, you know. Don’t rely on me too much, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… I’m pissed off because you’re better than me while saying that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t care about the conversational events that only make the protagonist feel good about being affirmed, so I’ll skip them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So let’s divide up the work, shall we? Azusa-san, would you please rinse the rice? Kirari-san, please arrange the plates. Ryoma-san, please work with me on cutting and seasoning the food.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay, got it. Hmm, what? There’s only one knife. …… I’ll borrow one more from Suzuki-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After saying that, Ryuzaki once again left the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that he is motivated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then …”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, one by one, Yuuzuki gave each of us a role in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When it was my turn, her eyes widened, as if she had noticed my presence for the first time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh ……, Kotaro-san, you were here as well, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, I was here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure she did’t notice because she was preoccupied with the protagonist, but I was here too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… We used to be so close that we were together all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess that was a long time ago too. Now she and I were complete strangers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, Kotaro-san, can you be in charge of …… the fire?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I understand.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, I don’t feel anything for Yuzuki now either.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since I had already made up my mind, I was able to finish the conversation without being particularly conscious of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, all that’s left is …… Shiho-san. Can I ask Shiho-san to peel the vegetables for me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she said this, Yuzuki handed Shimotsuki the peeler.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, although Shimotsuki is a girl who has the air of being able to do anything, she is surprisingly a clumsy girl who can’t do anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………Huu?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked at me as if she had never heard of a vegetable having a peel. I don’t think she even knew what a peeler did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, peel them, please. Here you go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She probably didn’t think that Shimotsuki was clumsy. Yuzuki handed her a carrot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki took it, but couldn’t seem to figure out how to do it……. She held the peeler in her right hand and the carrot in her left and tilted her head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, I don’t know what she was thinking ……, but suddenly she started to beat the carrot with the peeler. She’s using it like a blunt instrument, what is she doing?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……Shh, Shiho-san? Um, could it be that you don’t know how to use the …… peeler?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that Yuzuki has indeed noticed. She looked at Shimotsuki with a puzzled look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Peeler?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her head tilted back. This gesture seems to have made Yuzuki realize …… that she cannot have a conversation with Shimotsuki about food.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I was surprised. I thought you seemed to be able to do everything……. Well, you’re only human, so you have your weaknesses. Well, then, can I ask you to work with …… Kotaro-san on the fire?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why Shimotsuki had to work with me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Yes, I understand. Ufufu ♪”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And Shimotsuki was instantly in a good mood. She handed the peeler and carrot back to Yuzuki and walked over to me with light steps.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank goodness I can be with …… you, Nakayama-kun! I’m glad I can’t cook. You know, our kitchen is reserved for my mom. I’m an eater when it comes to food.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/37zxfKz/tRCKTF3.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre5">As she said this, she pinched my jersey.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was trying to get my attention by tugging on it like a child, like she was playing a prank.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, how do you light a fire? Oh, I get it! You rub a wooden board around with a stick, right? I saw it on a survival show the other day. I’ve always wanted to try that, so I’m looking forward to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… …. No. I think they provide us with igniters and lighters.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s that? Hmmm… Pee-rah… and a lot of unfamiliar words in the overnight learning program. I don’t like studying, so I don’t want to use my head too much.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a normal conversation as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki was clearly closer to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We’ve been close for a while, but today we’re so close that we’re almost touching.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know what to do as she leaned in closer than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t cover it up anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This distance is no longer the distance between the main heroine and a mob character.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4071"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 42: The Main Heroine is Full of “Cute”</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">When the firewood was put in the fireplace, the flames rose.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki was staring at the flickering flames.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What on earth is she thinking about?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I went to get some more firewood and came back just now, but she didn’t seem to notice me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was sitting in a gymnastic position, looking at the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought, what a great …… sight.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Cute girls are attractive no matter what they are doing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even just looking at the flames, I feel an attraction that makes me want to take a picture of her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The flickering flames reflected off her silvery-white hair, giving off a faint glow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her cheeks, which were redder than usual, were also cute.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This must be the person who was chosen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is the kind of girl who can be admired by the protagonist.How could she not be attractive?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……… The horse that was mistakenly burned in the fire made a ‘hihihi’ sound. Fire, only to …… ugh.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But what she was thinking was a bit silly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wish she wouldn’t think such silly things with such a sorrowful face. I suddenly felt ashamed of myself for admiring her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Okay, I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Shimotsuki, I’m back.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pretended to have just arrived and put down the firewood I was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki looked at me as I put the extra firewood on the fire.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, can I suddenly tell you a funny story?　You know ……”The horse that was mistakenly burned in the fire made a ‘hihihi’ sound. Fire, only to …… ugh.” It’s funny, isn’t it? I’m afraid of my comedic talent. ……!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess she was pretty confident about her skills.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looked pretty smug.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………Ummm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I had trouble responding.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had heard it before, and if anything, the joke wasn’t even funny, so my cheeks tensed up. I wondered if I should laugh at her, so I ended up with an expression that I couldn’t really understand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, what? Isn’t it funny? Or did Nakayama-kun not understand this joke? Well, the sound of a horse is ‘hi-heen,’ right? I combined it with the word “fire”. Also, you want to cry because you were burned by fire by mistake, right? I also added the sound of a ‘squeal’ to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry to say that she’s trying her best to explain, but that’s not the point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe this is it. …… Maybe I should tell her how I honestly feel.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to contradict Shimotsuki too much, but I think it’s good for friends to tell others what they can’t do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I said it clearly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry … it was dull.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… !!!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Shimotsuki instantly puffed up her cheeks and stood up vigorously. She looked like a blowfish.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Silly, silly, silly. You have no sense of humor if you can’t understand my best comedy. If a professional comedian were to listen to it, he or she would probably burst out laughing. You can’t help it, Nakayama-kun……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seemed to be unhappy, but it was strange because Shimotsuki seemed to be enjoying herself somehow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What a surprise. I’ve always dreamed of fighting with my friends like this. …… I think it’s like number 200 on my list of things I want to do with my friends. And friends can get along better after a fight like this, right? I’m so glad I got to be friends with Nakayama-kun. ♪ “</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not a fight, but more of a joke, but if she called it a fight, then it was a fight.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I let it slide.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, what? Why don’t you say anything? I’m not sure if you’re really depressed because you think I’m mad at you? I’m just kidding, Nakayama-kun. …… Okay, okay, I’m not mad at you, so don’t be scared. Come on.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… And yet, the distance between us is as close as ever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In addition, I suddenly noticed that Shimotsuki has been touching me a lot lately.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think it’s called skinship……, and she’s still trying to act like a big sister and pat my head, but she’s too short to reach for my head, so I’m forced to pat her back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There were many things I wanted to say to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But her gestures were so cute that I was too embarrassed to say anything back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m not depressed…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s all I managed to say. But Shimotsuki smiled mischievously and poked me on the cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? But your face is red. Is it possible that you’re embarrassed? You’re turning red from being stroked by your sister, aren’t you? Oh my god, Nakayama-kun has a cute side too. …… It makes me want to tease you even more.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Please don’t do that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even I’m not used to being teased by a ridiculously cute girl like Shimotsuki. When a girl like that teases me, I get too embarrassed to do anything about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, please, take it easy on me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I raised my hands in surrender, Shimotsuki smiled softly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The smile that seems to make everyone who sees it happy makes me admire it again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ehehe ~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve never seen such a cute girl in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was like a concentrated version of “cute”.</p>

<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4137"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 43: The Protagonist is also dimly aware</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">My face was hot because of Shimotsuki’s teasing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wanted to calm down, so I went to the bathroom and washed my face. Shimotsuki was trying to tease me for some reason, but I managed to get her to stay behind, saying I was scared to leave the fire out of my sight.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her presence was unsettling in a good way. I left her alone for a bit and repressed my exuberant feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mob characters don’t need any extra emotions. I have to keep my cool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And even though Shimotsuki had gotten the better of me earlier, …… there were other people around. They were all working, so they didn’t see us, but it was still dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If Ryuzaki sees me and Shimotsuki getting along, we’ll be in big trouble. …… I’ll be careful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I told myself that, and went back to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There, I saw the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Was Shiho in charge of the fire? Oh, it’s burning well. You’re doing great.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wondered if he had finished preparing the food. He was holding a pot and was about to heat it up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Before that, it seems that he is trying to have a lovey-dovey time with the main heroine, but he looks very annoyed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She had such a soft smile on her face just a few minutes ago, but now she was a beautiful woman of ice. She turned her head away with a pout and became expressionless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha. Shiho is always so humble. …… But let me praise you once in a while, okay? Thank you for the fire.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was trying to get Shimotsuki’s attention somehow. He is trying to pat her head, as he always does to his harem members. He probably thinks that since the harem members are happy when he does that, Shimotsuki will have the same reaction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But that’s only because it’s done by someone you like, not by someone you’re not interested in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s expression tightened, and she dodged Ryuzaki’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Next, she looked around as if searching for something……, and when she spotted me, she immediately ran over to me and got behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s as if she was trying to hide from Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……What? Why is Nakayama ……!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is not good. Ryuzaki is upset.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was dismayed by Shimotsuki’s blatant attitude and the fact that she hid behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If this is the case, the relationship between Shimotsuki and me might be questioned……. I sensed this and immediately followed up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I was in charge of the fire, too! Hey, Ryuzaki …… is terrible. I worked hard too, so it’s not fair to only praise her.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a spur-of-the-moment thing to do, but I played the role of a good-natured mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think I was a little bitter in my statement, but Ryuzaki still seems to have a lot of pride in himself, and even this much was easily dismissed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, I see. So you wanted to say that …… Shiho was kind enough to set fire to the fire with Nakayama? So, you didn’t want one person to be praised. …… Hahaha. I’m not sure what to say. But you surprised me. I thought you hated me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As usual, he interpreted it in his own convenient way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, since it was an incoherent statement, Shimotsuki is likely to say something back. I look at her, wishing in my heart that she would not say anything at this point if possible…..</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Fortunately for me, Shimotsuki, who is behind me, had covered her ears and turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she seems to be trying to avoid hearing Ryuzaki’s sounds.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she probably didn’t even hear what that guy said. Good ……, this way I can still mislead him about the relationship between me and Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But as Shimotsuki’s attitude toward me became more intimate, I realized that it was slowly starting to be difficult.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And even Ryuzaki would not always be able to interpret things in a convenient way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Aha. I was surprised … I was surprised …… to see you hiding behind Nakayama to get away from me…. It’s as if you like Nakayama, isn’t it? No, I don’t think so. Shiho is a strong girl, and she’s not interested in love right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although she is desperately trying to convince herself, Ryuzaki’s anxiety is oozing out in every word he says.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe, just maybe, little by little……</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki may also be beginning to sense Shimotsuki’s true feelings.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4205"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 44: The Protagonist is getting pushed further and further into a corner</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">We finished making the curry and had lunch as a group.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At times like this, you can tell what kind of character is being cast by where people sit in their seats.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First of all, the person who sits in the first seat is, surprisingly, not our protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“” ………… “”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was Hanagishi and Ikura, who were smiling vaguely the whole time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If they have something to do, or if you talk to them, they’ll chat normally, but basically they don’t say anything and just go with the flow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, when it was time to eat curry, they would naturally take the first seat at the back of the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Incidentally, another pattern is to sit in the last seat left. In other words, the mob characters are either the first or the last to sit down, and they have no will of their own.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, the …… tables are not really seats in a restaurant, but just outdoor tables and chairs, so there is no such thing as a superior or inferior seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the sake of convenience, let’s say the one in the back is the superior seat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since I’m also a mob character, I try to follow Hanagishi and Ikura.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, there was a girl who interrupted me and prevented me from doing so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, it was the main heroine, Shiho Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d like you to wait for a moment …… before you sit down.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s picking at my clothes a bit with an impatient look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d like to sit down as soon as possible because I’ve already …… got a bowl of curry and rice in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please, Nakayama-kun. …… At times like this, that person always comes to sit next to me, so let me use Nakayama-kun as a barrier?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, I see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">does not like to sit next to the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is true that if the seat is to be decided naturally, it will be as it should be.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki was resisting that fate.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, sit down too, Ryoma Onii-chan. Let’s eat together.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the meantime, the protagonist who had been serving the food finally arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Azusa, who was one step ahead of the other sub-heroines, was the first to try to get a seat next to Ryuzaki</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa sits next to Hanagishi and pulls Ryuzaki next to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, don’t drag me. …… I’ll sit down even if you don’t tell me to.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki chuckled as usual and sat down as he was prompted. Next to him, of course, sat Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, there was still a seat next to him on the other side, so Kirari took that seat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’ll sit on this side ~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh…….When I was putting away the dishes, I couldn’t sit next to Ryoma…….It’s not fair.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With Azusa on the right and Kirari on the left, there was only one seat left for Yuuki to sit in, directly across from him. She sighed and sat down facing Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And well, Shimotsuki was relieved as the subheroine filled the surrounding area like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Phew, that was good……. Well, Nakayama-kun, why don’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Prompted, next to Yuzuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, but …… please remember carefully. Now, the seats look like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hanagishi, Azusa, Ryuzaki, Kirari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ikura, vacant, Yuuki, vacant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, the seat next to Ikura is vacant, so if we think in terms of character, I should be able to fit in there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But Shimotsuki didn’t want to do that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Do you really want to eat your meal with the cute face of your stepsister Nakayama in front of you? No, you can’t do that!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, this girl had a yandere temperament.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t show any signs of it at all because I never talked to other girls, but it’s a little scary because it comes on unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course, I couldn’t say no, so the seating ended up like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hanagishi, Azusa, Ryuzaki, Kirari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ikura, vacant, Yuzuki, Shimotsuki, and me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… The seat next to Ikura’s is empty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not natural, so the members of the group are glancing at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Among them, Ryuzaki’s gaze was particularly striking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Hey, Nakayama? You must be lonely if you’re at the end of the line. There’s a seat available over here, so come on over.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He’s wary of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He finds it annoying that the main heroine is always messing around with the mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sure Shiho finds it annoying too. It’s rude to forcefully approach a weak-minded girl. …… Come on. If you don’t like it, you have to say so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In Ryuzaki’s mind, I probably forced myself to sit next to Shimotsuki. That’s why he has been lecturing me, which is the protagonist’s specialty.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The protagonist is usually kind, but sometimes he can be harsh. The heroine’s cheeks blush as she thinks, “He’s really thinking about me, isn’t he?”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But apparently, this time the “promise” didn’t flow that way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Shimotsuki seemed to be …… very uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s not true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;For the first time, I think.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was the first time I had seen her respond to a serious question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Usually, she would either cover her ears to avoid hearing Ryuzaki’s sounds, or she would just reply with a few words when he spoke to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s impossible for him to annoy me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The second sentence was spoken.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her normally expressionless face was clearly unhappy. Her lips were tightly pressed together and she was staring at Ryuzaki as if she was glaring at him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s how much Shimotsuki couldn’t forgive him for what he just said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure she really cares about me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Annoyance is not a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a straightforward attitude, as if to assert that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In response to this, Ryuuzaki was very upset …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, if you want …… Shiho, that’s fine……. Well, I’m sorry? I might have misunderstood you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki smiles sluggishly, sweating unpleasantly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clearly, that guy was being pushed into a corner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, hardship was coming to the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…… Normally, I might have looked at that and thought, “Suck it up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It would have been a dark feeling inside me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t think of that now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because this is just a “valley” to create a peak of the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It happens all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In order to emphasize the most exciting scene at the end of the story, it is a common practice to put the main character in a tight spot right before it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The protagonist and the main heroine have a falling out, which raises the reader’s sense of danger by flashing a red light on their relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s just a prelude.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s all just a preview for the big comeback that the protagonist will make.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Have we finally reached this point?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story is finally coming to an end.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4277"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 45: Heroine Disqualified</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, it was my turn for a while from here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no way for the protagonist to stop this negative trend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the sake of the story, he’s getting pushed further and further into a corner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Shiho? Is the curry good? I’m pretty confident about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki, who was rejected by Shimotsuki earlier, is trying his best to get her attention.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although they are a little apart, he is trying his best to talk to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she just keeps responding in a casual manner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… Yes, it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She nodded and took a small mouthful of curry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was delicious, but I remembered that her mother was a very good cook.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Whenever we ate …… lunch together, Shimotsuki would share her side dishes with me, and the taste of the food was incredible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even an amateur can tell that Shimotsuki’s mother is a very good cook.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Compared to that, Ryuzaki’s and Yuzuki’s cooking is not so good. Of course, this curry is delicious to me, but the reason why Shimotsuki doesn’t move her expression much is because she knows the taste of a better curry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her interest is clearly not in cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s interest was, how can I put it, …… quite a bit of it was focused on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m embarrassed to say it myself, but I have to say it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because she’s been messing with me frequently since a while ago.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I shook my body with a jolt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was suddenly poked in the side of my head, and my body almost jumped reflexively.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ufufu ♪”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though she is a high school student, she can do things like an elementary school student and look so happy about it……. She must really want to be noticed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Fortunately, my voice didn’t come out, so I thought no one would notice,…… but Ryuzaki was looking right at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……Ah?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, no.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He looked as if his soul had been drained by the shock.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a state of abandonment, Ryuzaki had dropped the spoon he was holding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki must be despairing in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His cute childhood friend, whom he thought was his only, is opening up to another man, and laughing at him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki’s romantic comedy has become quite a hard act to follow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a development that is sure to stir up controversy among readers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TLN: Damn right.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">The purity of the heroine is an important factor in gaining popularity. In this respect, Shimotsuki, who cheats on her lover with another man, is disqualified as a heroine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, not all heroines of romantic comedies love only the protagonist. In some cases, the protagonist and the main heroine both like different people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not strange that Ryuzaki would make a comeback from here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I was worried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It would be nice if he would simply give up here……. No, how could he?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is no way that a person who can be broken down like this can be a protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure Ryuzaki will struggle from here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If he takes the high road, he will get Shimotsuki back from me, get another heroine, and later on, Shimotsuki will say, “I don’t deserve to be loved by you, but thank you for loving me.” to tickle the protagonist’s desire for approval.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure that readers who enjoy Ryuzaki’s romantic comedy also have a lot of hate for Shimotsuki, who once loved another man. As a punishment to get rid of it, she has to accept Ryuzaki’s dating other girls &ndash; and if that happens, the harem may become more convincing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such a scenario popped into my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My turn is not over yet. …… The longer it goes on, the more I’m afraid that the protagonist will awaken in reaction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that time, Ryuzaki will surely become a monster beyond my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is no more terrifying existence than a completed harem protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everything will be taken care of with expediency, problems will be solved in a way that suits the protagonist, everything will be a favorable wind for the protagonist, and the ending will be one of happiness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And the one that the protagonist sees as a danger is me, a mob character.　 There’s no way I can stand up to him……. What will become of this character, me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was really afraid of that.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4347"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 46: The Position of the Main Character That Should Have Been There</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">After the outdoor cooking, the recreational competition began.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that the classes compete in various events such as tug of war and dodgeball.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, these events are no different from work for the mob characters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They just play and leave without making any notable achievements or mistakes, and without affecting the game.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, I was supposed to participate in dodgeball.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m neither good at sports nor bad at them, but I’m not extremely good at them, so it’s natural that I don’t stand out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As usual, the competition ended on a low note.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was nothing to show for it, the athletic club just threw a ball and it hit the ground, and my recreational event came to an end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was such a silly dodgeball tale that I stopped reading halfway through because it was too boring to be a story. I don’t think any of my classmates would remember how I played.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what I thought.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can’t. My stomach hurts. Nakayama-kun, didn’t you say, “Guhe.” when you were hit? I was listening to you correctly, you know. I’ve been laughing my a*s off about it for a while now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki seemed to have been watching it perfectly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Something seemed to have hit the nail on the head, and she was laughing hysterically.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed to be very funny to her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what to say. …… This girl really watches me closely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think that’s why she can notice the funny parts and laugh heartily at them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I laughed……. It kind of cheered me up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the shade of a tree in the corner of the square, Shimotsuki is leaning against a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was mid-June, and the rainy season was about to end. The weather was very nice today, so she was trying to avoid getting sunburned. She was wearing a jersey jacket the whole time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess it’s just too hot. Her cheeks were reddening faintly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm … I’m going to try my best to play dodgeball, since Nakayama-kun made me laugh a lot. I’m sure you’ll see. I’m going to teach Nakayama-kun, who was terrible at it, how to play dodgeball.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VgHBXTC/kApaWnT.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre5">When the boys finished, it was the turn of the girls’ team, and Shimotsuki stood up with vigor. I’m not sure where this baseless confidence is coming from……, but I’m sure you can guess what she’s capable of.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Higi!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was right after the dodgeball game started.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought Shimotsuki walked sideways like a crab with a nimble step, but the ball hit her in the face as hard as it could and blew her away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was such a catastrophe that Ryuzaki, who was watching, shouted out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was watching from the side, and I was puzzled. It’s not a laughing matter……, but I wonder if she’ll be okay.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The shade of the trees in the corner was a little far from the area where the competition was taking place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I watched her with narrowed eyes, she came out of the area, half-crying. She seemed to have been knocked out by one ball.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, Shiho? Here, towel ……, are you hurt?</p>

<p class="calibre5">As expected of the protagonist. He quickly rushes to the main heroine’s rescue and tries to help her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she walked straight to me first, of course.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s as if she didn’t even see Ryuzaki…….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait, Shiho ……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki didn’t seem to hear him when he called out to her, crying her eyes out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not Ryuzaki that she’s looking for now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ugh ……, Nakayama-kun? Where are you? Please answer me. I got hit on the front of my nose, so I can’t see anything through my tears……. So, will you comfort me a lot? If you can, will you also stroke my head and say ‘Pain, pain, go away’ like my dad does to my mom?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was the one who asked for it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And it’s a lot more demanding and a little too hard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, …… you are spoiled to your heart’s content.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Originally, this position would have been held by Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Damn.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From a little distance away, he was glaring at me in frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The obvious hostility in his gaze made me feel uncomfortable.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4418"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 47: How it feels when the girl you like is flirting with a mob character</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">“Are you okay? Um, do I have to do that …… thing~?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could it be that this girl is really in elementary school?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The infantilized Shimotsuki is a handful. I was embarrassed to do that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, Nakayama-kun is such a cheapskate…… You could at least give me a pat on the back. So, will you support me? Will you tell me to do my best?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s about it. ….. Um, hang in there. Shimotsuki, don’t let the pain get to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What the hell am I being made to do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I doubted that cheering her up would have any effect, but I was surprised when Shimotsuki stopped crying as soon as I cheered her up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Whew, …… I feel calmer now. I was in pain earlier and felt like I was going to die, but Nakayama-kun cheered me on and I was able to endure it. Am I getting stronger again? Oh no, I didn’t want to get any stronger.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, Shimotsuki is weak. She’s probably close to the weakest, so don’t worry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she is a clunker. I think she caught the ball in her face because she is not good at sports.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even so, she was blown away a lot. Thanks to this, her jacket was d***y and her face was covered with dust.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Your face and clothes are d***y. Do you have a change of clothes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I asked her, Shimotsuki smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t have any. So can you lend me a towel and a jersey? I told you before that I’m sensitive to the sun and need to wear long sleeves, didn’t I? If that’s the case, I’m sure my friend Nakayama-kun wouldn’t refuse.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that she decided to rob me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… What if I told you I was sweating a little and would prefer to decline if possible?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No? It’s a refusal to say no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems she’s already decided to take it from me. She took off her d***y jersey, exposing her pure white arms.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They were really white, probably because they hadn’t been exposed to the sun at all. I couldn’t help but look away from her because she looked so innocent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe it was because they were usually hidden, but I felt a little nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt like it would be a bad idea to leave her exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I had no choice but to take off my jersey.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Here you go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I held it out to her, and she snatched it from me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, with a mischievous smile, she pulled it on and zipped it up tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since she’s small by nature, my jersey was too big for her. It was as long as a dress. The sleeves were so long that they could be folded over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think it would be better to get a jersey that fits a little better.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe the teachers have a spare one, shall I check? I was about to ask ……</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe~. Nakayama-kun’s clothes smell like …… Nakayama-kun. I think it’s not bad at all, Kun Kun. No, it’s not bad, it’s even better……. My mom also has a smell f****h, and I think I finally understand her feelings.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t say anything, because Shimotsuki looked so satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She continues to tickle my fancy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, can I borrow your towel too? My towel is d***y and needs to be washed……. Yes, if I don’t wrap it around my neck, I’ll get sunburned. But when I’m like this, it’s like I’m being hugged by Nakayama-kun, and it makes me kind of nervous♪”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, Shimotsuki’s cheeks are red, is it because of a sunburn?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or maybe she’s …… embarrassed?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I see that side of her, I still get nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really wonder why this girl is so cute.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And …… what is Ryuuzaki thinking as he stares at this scene?</p>

<p class="calibre5">(He’s been staring at me since a while ago……. Give me a break!)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki still didn’t notice, but from my angle, I could see Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was looking at me and Shimotsuki from a distance with a face that looked like it was about to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Right in front of him, the girl he likes is flirting with another man……. I’m sure his heart is torn up inside.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that the story is still getting ready to enter its climax.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that Ryuzaki’s suffering will continue for a little while longer.</p>


<h1 class="single_title" id="calibre_link-4491"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 48: The Limits of Mob Characters</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">After the recreational event, we also had a bath and a barbecue as scheduled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">During that time, Shimotsuki was messing with me whenever she had a chance. It seems that she really wanted to be entertained.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki kept his eyes on Shimotsuki. He occasionally checked on her, but he never took his eyes off her, not even for a moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He must be in a lot of conflict and anguish. Hopefully, he will stay as he is for a long time, but since he is the …… protagonist, that is not possible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When will he start his big comeback?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been on the lookout for it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the time did not come easily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was now nighttime. There were only two things left on the schedule for today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A test of courage and a campfire.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was the perfect event to set the story in motion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">” …… Nakayama-kun, I’m a little bit not good with ghosts, so I’m just going to pretend I’m not feeling well and rest. Are the teachers insane to make us walk through the woods at night like this? It’s not that I’m afraid of them, you know. It’s just that I’m not very good at it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That said, Shimotsuki cheated on her test of courage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… I wonder if that girl is the main heroine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A test of courage is a great place for a heroine to be active.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She can hug the protagonist while saying, “Ooh, I’m scared.” and close the distance between them both physically and mentally while having a romantic encounter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But for Shimotsuki, who has already deviated from the main route and is heading for the outer route, such a promise would have no effect. She is tearing up her story as she pleases.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why I decided to test my courage without Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Ryoma-san, I’m afraid of …… ghosts, can you stay with me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, …… okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m not afraid of ghosts either, but don’t ever leave me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, …… that’s right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Ryoma Onii-chan, help me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course, the Ryuzaki harem was trying to flirt with the protagonist as much as they could.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, it was unlikely to be a meaningful event because Ryuzaki himself was not paying attention.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure his mind was full of thoughts about Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter what Azusa and the others do to him, he doesn’t react well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan …?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa and the others are also looking at Ryuzaki with a worried look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, even the harem members seemed to have noticed that something was wrong with Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, the test of courage event ended easily without much excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, there was a campfire, but …… before that, the protagonist started talking to me, a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s almost the end of the story. …… Normally, a mob character should have finished his role by now. But the protagonist seemed to have something to say to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama ……, when did you and Shiho started getting along?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After the test of courage, the executive officers of the overnight learning program were preparing for the campfire.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was bored, so I was sitting in an inconspicuous position, when Ryuuzaki unexpectedly came to talk to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the place where I spent noon with Shimotsuki at the recreational event. She seems to be good at finding inconspicuous places, and this is a pretty good place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In addition, I’m not much of a standout, so it’s unlikely that you’ll just happen to see me and talk to me ……. Perhaps Ryuzaki had taken the trouble to look for me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is the first time I’ve seen Shiho look so happy……, even though she was not interested in others. She’s always alone, and she doesn’t even get along with me because she likes it that way……. What the hell did you do to her?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if he’s really cornered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The protagonist is groaning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, I wanted to say something like a biting dog mob character, but I couldn’t think of any words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t think of anything to say, because it was impossible for a mob character to be involved in such an important scene.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, say something…… You got to be friends with my childhood friend.　You’re the only one who can see the smile on her face……. You should be more proud of yourself. Mock me for being a loser despite being a childhood friend!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was sneering and spitting out his emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I, on the other hand, could only stare at him blankly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wondered if I should agitate him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Should I make fun of him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Should I deny him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Should I deceive him?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Should I affirm it?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Various options are whirling around in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I can’t see the way forward. I don’t know which answer is the right one.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess this is the limit of a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Up until now, I’ve managed to keep my head down, but …… I don’t have the power to change the narrative. I just happened to be on the playing board at the whim of Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As such, I couldn’t think of any way to deal with this protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to choose something more than this, I would no longer be a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The clown who had once mistakenly thought he was the protagonist was supposed to have given up everything by pretending that he was a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When he was betrayed by his childhood friend, his stepsister, his best friend, and all the people he loved, this was the reason why he desperately wanted to convince himself somehow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m a mob character, so what can I do?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since then, I’ve been telling myself that I can’t be the protagonist because I’m a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Damn……, no words for a loser? You don’t even have me in your sights anymore, do you? I feel like a fool for being satisfied with the childhood friend I had …..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki’s wailing disappeared into the night forest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He punched a tree trunk in frustration and then walked away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, I couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all ……, Kotaro Nakayama is a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had been able to say something back to Ryuzaki here, I might have been able to intervene in the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It is possible that I could have broken out of my shell as a mob character and become something else.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if I had been able to do that, I probably wouldn’t have become a mob character in the first place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re a loser……, you say that a lot.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I look out at the forest where Ryuzaki disappeared, I can’t help but remember the past.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“The loser is not you, it’s …… me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I used to think that I was the protagonist, that I was the one at that time…</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 49: Loser</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Looking back, I used to be like a protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My childhood friend Yuzuki and I lived in the same neighborhood, and we had been together ever since we were little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In elementary school, I became very close with Kirari, who became my classmate, and we played together as if we were best friends of the same s*x.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I became a junior high school student, my mother, who was a single parent, got married and I got a stepsister. For the next three years, I spent time with Azusa as if we were real siblings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So the three of them were very special to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had such …… special feelings for them that I was sure that one of them would be my life partner in the future and we would spend the rest of our lives together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was close to three such attractive people.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s an unusual fortune.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure I could be mistaken for the protagonist&ndash;and I think I could be.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not that there was anything special about the three of them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuzuki just happened to live in my neighborhood, Kirari just happened to be my classmate, and Azusa just happened to be the child of someone my mother remarried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was no fateful encounter, but that didn’t change the fact that the three of them were special. And I thought that the three of them must have seen me as special, too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But that was my mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TLN: OMG FINALLY!???)</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t “fate” that brought me together with these girls, it was just a coincidence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that to them, I was just a stranger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, I was the only one who had special feelings for them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the entrance ceremony of the high school, the moment the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki, the harem protagonist, began, I realized my mistake.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Congratulations, the three of them had been discovered by Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They met him, and for the first time, they met the “real” protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And at the same time, they realized.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They realized that I was the first “protagonist”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onii-chan … Well, maybe Azusa’s real Onii-chan might be Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what my stepsister told me, and I lost the significance of being a brother.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kotaro-san …… I think I may have met my destiny. For the first time, I’ve met someone I want to give my all to.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what my childhood friend told me, and I was no longer even a good friend of hers. She became obsessed with Ryuzaki and eventually started to forget about me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, Ko-kun. There’s someone I’ve fallen in love with. I’ll do whatever it takes to make him like me……. Even if it kills the me I’ve always been, I want to be the person he likes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My best friend Kirari sacrificed even her own personality to be liked by Ryuzaki. She dyed her hair, put in colored contacts, changed her tone of voice, and twisted her personality.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was no longer Kirari Asakura, my best friend. She became Asakura-san, a complete stranger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, I lost the three people who were special to me at the same time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was an unbelievable fall for the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a cruel ending, even for the sake of the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… I was not really in love with them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to say whether I liked them or not, I liked them, but I didn’t have any ulterior motives for them or anything like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t think of them as special because they were girls, because they were cute, or because I wanted to go out with them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was just that they were important to me and I felt special.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wanted to get to know them better if I could.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I may be so bold as to say that it would be ideal if I could go out with any one of the three …… people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, in the worst case scenario, if they marry someone who isn’t …… me, that’s fine, as long as they’re happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, even having such thoughts seemed to be a hindrance to the girls……, and my existence has been painted with the color of Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not possible to be the protagonist like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I thought of myself like this.</p>




<p class="calibre5">I’m like a mob character.</p>




<p class="calibre5">When I thought about it that way, I felt a lot better.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was hurt because I had mistakenly thought I was the protagonist, but once I accepted that I was a mob character, I was able to relax.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if I was betrayed, disappointed, or had my expectations lowered, it was all inevitable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I’m a mob character, it’s only natural.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s how I came to recognize myself as a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve come to think of everything from a meta perspective, and I’ve forced myself to accept my lack of rewards.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But if I’m being honest, …… I wanted to be a protagonist, too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t become a mob character because I wanted to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki……, so you’re not a loser.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The loser is me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The pathetic mob character who mistook himself for the protagonist, if not a loser?</p>



<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 50: The Fate of Subheroines</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki disappeared into the forest at night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A little further away, preparations for the campfire were steadily underway. It had finally ignited, and there was a cheerful roar of excitement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was not in the place where the light was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The protagonist is still hiding in the shadows.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one who will give him a helping hand is probably …… her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… I guess Ryoma Onii-chan didn’t know, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was my stepsister, Azusa, who popped up from the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, she was listening in on the conversation between me and Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop…… But I saw that Ryoma was acting strange, so I kept an eye on him. Then suddenly the two of you started talking……. I ended up listening in.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked apologetic, but this was an unavoidable consequence of the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And …… in the story, Azusa had to know about Ryuzaki’s agony.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is because the subheroines are the only ones who can save the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They are always willing to draw the short straw.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They are always willing to sacrifice themselves to make the people they love happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the reason why …… Azusa looked so pained when she thought about Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan looked like he was going to cry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… I know.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never seen a face like that before.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s not the face of Ryoma Onii-chan, the man Azusa fell in love with.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Azusa …… cannot leave it alone.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case, just go after him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just ignore me as usual and do what you want.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And yet, she’s stomping her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She hesitated and looked at me as if she wanted something from me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But Onii-chan, …… I can’t muster up the courage.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A trembling voice echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though she’s a stepsister, the sound of my precious sister’s tears …… still hurts my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… It’s only at times like this that you go back to being my sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not fair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not fair that you cut me off, saying that I’m not the ideal brother, but only when it’s convenient, you ask for help like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I know. I’m sorry ……, but this is the last time. Onii-chan, please …… push me forward? Even though I’m such a useless sister……, please give me the courage to get hurt…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I knew this girl knew what she was talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now she understands …… that she will be very hurt.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is because Azusa, of all people, …… is about to confess her feelings to Ryuzaki right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if she told him her feelings at this time, it would definitely fail.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is because Ryuzaki is preoccupied with Shimotsuki and is hurting from the loss of his childhood friend, but Azusa can not tolerate Ryuzaki, who is in pain…</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is why she is trying to heal Ryuzaki with a drug called “confession”.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure Azusa thinks it’s okay if she gets rejected as a result…….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………… If that is the path Azusa has chosen.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As a brother, I want to stop it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want my precious little sister to get hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But this is the path that she has chosen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what it means to fall in love with Ryoma Ryuzaki, the …… harem-minded protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So there’s only one thing I can do.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good luck. Azusa was my cute little sister, so …… it’s okay. If it’s Azusa, maybe Ryuzaki will be okay with it? Because Azusa is cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I gave her the best I could, which was only comforting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But family is a strange thing. …… Even casual words can make your heart feel lighter than you imagined.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Yes, thank you. You’re right, Azusa is cute. …… I’m sure I’ll be fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Azusa smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It had been a long time since I had seen a friendly smile up close, and it was still cute.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, ……, well, if you can, please don’t watch Azusa shatter herself, okay? I think it’s better if you don’t see …… I think it’s better if you don’t look at ……. Because Onii-chan is kind …….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But the smile instantly clouded over, and a dry smile of empty energy stuck to it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the kind of look I don’t like from Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’m off.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Azusa followed after Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The little back was walking slowly, as if it wanted me to follow it, despite the words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, I get it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa, Onii-chan is watching you.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, do your best&ndash;</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 51: I can no longer hold you in my arms</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was not too far away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was leaning against a tree, nodding off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa was slowly walking up to him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryoma Onii-chan ……, are you okay? You weren’t looking well, so I chased after you. Did that …… something happen to you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had to hide myself from view a little farther away to get a better look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was still nodding off with a pathetic look on his face, even though Azusa had come to see him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not nothing, is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I said it’s nothing!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess he has no room in his heart. Ryuzaki, who is usually kind to the sub-heroines, is yelling at her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that the sound of a man yelling is more frightening to women and children than we can imagine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Azusa was unfazed as she stared at Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……Ryoma Onii-chan, you look very uncool right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa’s voice was firm and strong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki glared at her in anger, but Azusa did not flinch at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s no wonder Shimotsuki-san doesn’t like you when you look like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was severely unnerved by these words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why are you talking about Shiho ……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know, I know. I didn’t need to be told that Ryoma Onii-chan was in love with Shimotsuki-san, I was aware of it. Because Azusa had been looking at Ryoma Onii-chan for a long time, you know? You’ve been thinking about her all the time. How can I not understand~!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And finally, it began.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The biggest and saddest scene of the sub-heroines opens now …….</p>





<p class="calibre5">“Because Azusa loves Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>





<p class="calibre5">&ndash;At last, Azusa confessed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the most insensitive of protagonists would not be able to misunderstand something when it is said so clearly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… What? What did you say?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But then again, …… the protagonist also had the skill of hearing loss.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thanks to this, he can trample on the affections of the sub-heroines without them noticing his thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But that skill seems to be useless now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I said I love you ……, not as a friend, of course. I love you as a boy. I want to spend all my time with you, Ryoma Onii-chan. I want to go on dates with you, I want to touch you, I want you to touch me, and I want to make out with you. I want you to give me everything you have. That’s how much I love you!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Without the slightest room for doubt, Azusa blurted out her feelings of “I love you”.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the most insensitive of protagonists can’t pretend not to notice when someone says something like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, you’re kidding, right? I can’t believe …… Azusa likes me. …… You must be joking, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m serious. I love you, Ryoma Onii-chan. …… If you can’t hear me, I’ll tell you as many times as you want. If you don’t believe me, I can give you a hundred reasons why I like you. So, believe me, …… I’m not kidding, listen to me. Accept Azusa’s feelings. …… Let me at least say I love you!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Azusa’s pure feelings echoed in the forest at night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the distance, I could faintly hear the voices of my classmates. Maybe the campfire is about to start……. Little by little, it’s getting noisier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">On the other hand, things were getting more and more exciting here too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When the protagonist heard Azusa’s words, he slowly raised his head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, it’s true……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, but I don’t want to see you now. But I don’t want to see Ryoma Onii-chan’s face right now. …… I don’t want to see his face when he’s whimpering and miserable. Azusa’s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan has a much better face, you know? Even though Azusa tried her best to approach you, you were still trying to look cool by saying, “Oh dear.” …… I don’t know how many times I wanted to punch you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Honestly, I want to cover my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can see where this is going.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like a farce. It’s a terrible game, and it’s not even funny.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although she said a lot of things, what Azusa wanted to convey was just one point, “I like Ryuzaki.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">And Ryuzaki, thanks to being told over and over again, seems to have finally come to realize this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, don’t be depressed, okay? You can still be Azusa’s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan. …… You love Shimotsuki-san, don’t you? If so, it would be a shame to give up, wouldn’t it? Azusa’s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan is a very weak man, but when he wants to do something ……, he does it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That affirmation becomes a medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is a great way to energize the protagonist who has lost his confidence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re right……. I haven’t done anything yet. I haven’t even told Shiho how I feel about her, and it’s …… disgraceful to give up and slump over.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The voice of the protagonist, who had been sullen until a moment ago, regained its strength.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not like this is me. …… I’m much cooler now that Azusa likes me. …… So, yeah. I’m going to confess properly!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Finally, the time had come.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The harem protagonist’s biggest flaw, has been eliminated by the subheroine’s confession.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the unique “awakening” of the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No one can stop him now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story is only going to rise. Every wind that blows from now on will be a tailwind for the protagonist, and he will become the rightful owner of opportunism.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa……Thank you for loving me like this. I’ll try my best to be the Ryoma Ryuzaki that you love.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah … I love the cool Ryoma Onii-chan the most.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And once awakened, the subheroine is no longer ‘useful’.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“… But I’m sorry. I can’t accept …… Azusa’s confession because I have someone I like.”</p>



<p class="calibre5">And so, Azusa was rejected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though she had tried so hard to confess, her …… feelings were easily trampled upon.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is a natural result.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was no way she could confess to Ryuzaki, who was troubled about Shimotsuki, and have him accept her confession.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even so, Azusa wanted to cheer up Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though she knew she would be rejected …… and hurt, she kept her ‘love’ to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see……. but it can’t be helped. The campfire is about to start, you know. If you’ve decided to confess your love, you’d better go now. There’s a jinx that says if you confess your love at the campfire, you’ll succeed.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really? If that’s true, then …… it’s good timing. Thank you for letting me know. Azusa, you’re the best friend I’ve ever had!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;It is a sin to be insensitive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s …… very cruel to hurt someone so easily without malice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think Azusa had reached her limit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, yes. Then hurry up and go! Make sure you tell her how you feel…… Bye bye, Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She pushed Ryuzaki’s back and made him go to the square.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, okay, you don’t have to push ……, I’ll go. Totally …… Azusa loves to touch me, doesn’t she? I’m glad you did, thank you …… so I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then Ryuzaki left the place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At that moment, Azusa slumped down as if she had lost her mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Onii-chan? You’re here anyway, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Yeah, I’m here.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She called out to me, so I showed my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But she didn’t look at me, she turned her head down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sight was so painful that it …… made my heart ache.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa, you did your best, right? You don’t have to hold back anymore, do you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Yes. No need to hold back anymore. Azusa is a strong girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hope it makes her feel better. I know it’s naive of me to think that, but I can’t help but say kind words to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My stepsister, who once cut me off, …… is still family to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was in too much pain to look at her now.</p>



<p class="calibre5">“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!”</p>



<p class="calibre5">Immediately, Azusa began to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She did not wipe her tears, but continued to cry painfully, shedding large tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I loved you so much. …… This was my first love…why won’t you love me back, Ryoma Onii-chan? I loved you so much, so much……!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was nothing I could do about the sad wailing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only thing I could do was to be there for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We were no longer close enough for me to hug her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The truth is, of course I want to comfort her. I want to comfort Azusa, who is in pain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I can’t do that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could not, and would not, be the ideal Onii-chan that Azusa envisioned, so I have no right to …… hug her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the result of the choices that Azusa has made.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, the only person who can comfort Azusa is …… her acknowledged “real Onii-chan”.</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 52: The Ideal “Onii-chan”</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">It seemed that Azusa had an older brother who was two years older than her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was not a stepbrother like me, but a real brother by blood.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This was before we became step-siblings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I heard from her father that Azusa loved him very much and was always with him no matter what.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to be your wife in the future!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s all she said, and it seemed to annoy her family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But those days came to an abrupt end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Azusa was in the sixth grade, her brother died in an accident.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa, who lost her beloved brother, was of course sad ……, but rather, she was very confused.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not like she could understand that she would never be able to see her beloved brother again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Onii-chan is just going somewhere far away, isn’t he? I’m sure we’ll meet again someday, if …… Azusa is a good girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somewhere in her heart, she must have understood that her brother was dead.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But she refused to acknowledge it. She stubbornly continued to wait for her brother’s return.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even as a high school student, she still wore her hair in twin tails, as she did in elementary school, probably to make her brother recognize her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then one day, …… Azusa’s father decided to remarry. The other person had a stepson, a boy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Are you my Onii-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I still vividly remember the first time I met her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was in the first year of junior high school at the time, and I too was confused by the sudden arrival of a family member my age.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, I couldn’t really think about her question.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I asked her when her birthday was, because I thought it would determine if she was my older or younger sibling …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">And she shook her head, because mine was slightly earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I guess you could say I’m your Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I told her that, Azusa instantly started to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Gusuu … I’ve been waiting for you all this time.Welcome back, Onii-chan! “</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know what to do with my stepsister who hugged me while saying that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was right after that that I heard everything from her father.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa has been waiting for her brother’s return.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought I knew that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She knew that she would never see him again, but she pretended not to notice and put her brother’s image on mine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t stand to see Azusa like that, so …… I pretended to be her brother.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the time, I didn’t think of myself as a mob character, so I was proud that I could save Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thus, even though we were the same age, we started to spend time together as brother and sister.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When we first became brother and sister, Azusa seemed to be very happy every day. She walked behind me all the time and crawled into my bed at night.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I was happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but think how cute my little sister was, how much she missed me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If she wanted, I could be her “Onii-chan” forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I loved Azusa so much that I even thought about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But it seems that I was the only one who thought so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I think back, I think Azusa had a puzzled look on her face even then.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She suddenly looked at me and tilted her head, “Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was as if she had realized that I was not the “Onii-chan” who she was waiting for to come home.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The feeling of discomfort must have been getting stronger day by day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And finally, on the day of the entrance ceremony, …… she met that guy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At first glance, Azusa seems to have realized that I am a fake.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Ryuzaki looks a lot like Azusa’s own brother.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was surprised when I saw the album. I wondered if there was anyone in the world who looked so much like him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In other words, she had finally found her “ideal Onii-chan”.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki, who resembled her own brother, had instantly stolen her heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And I, who was a failure, was cut down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa’s real Onii-chan might be Ryoma Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The parting words were abrupt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I lost my precious sister before I had a chance to sort out my feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because she wanted Ryuzaki to look back at her, she only talked to me inside the house and called me “Nakayama-kun” outside. I was only her brother in the family register, and I could only act as her brother in the limited situation of inside the house, and I became distant from Azusa.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Throwing everything away, Azusa single-mindedly pursued Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, her thoughts turned to love as a member of the opposite s*x instead of love for her brother …… and this completed her as a harem member.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She really is the epitome of a subheroine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a subheroine, she loved Ryuzaki, as a subheroine, she devoted herself to Ryuzaki, as a subheroine, she encouraged Ryuzaki, and as a subheroine, she fell in vain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was an utterly …… disgusting romantic comedy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the end, what did she get out of it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did you get the “ideal Onii-chan” you’ve been seeking with all your heart?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa…… you didn’t get any reward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">You just fell down hurt, crying, and in pain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It really was painful to watch&mdash;</p>





<p class="calibre5">“Higu, Ugu … Ua”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is still crying after being rejected by Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa’s sobbing voice was echoing in the forest at night.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t hug her like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been disqualified from being her big brother, and I’m now just her older brother in the family register.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not even related to her by blood, and I’m almost a stranger to her out there.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s impossible for me to comfort her or heal her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa has gone beyond my reach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But ……, family is still family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is an inseparable bond with this girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why I tend to be lenient with her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……I know it’s very, very painful right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I send words to the sobbing girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a shout out from me, as much as I could.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Azusa will be able to get over this pain. You’ll be able to think about things from a different perspective when you do……. It’s not over yet.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;You’re not done yet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Get up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Use the pain and sorrow as sustenance and take a leap forward.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That is the only way for Azusa to be happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only way for a subheroine who loves a harem protagonist to be rewarded is to overcome a lot of pain, compromise, and accept.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If you don’t like it, give up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want you to be a normal girl, fall in love with a normal boy, and be satisfied with normal happiness.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, Azusa is a girl who is not satisfied with such “normal”.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure she’ll get over this pain.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good luck. I’m rooting for you……. Onii-chan will always be watching over you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“――――”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what Azusa is feeling as she is still crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now there’s nothing more I can do.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’m going to go now. When you stop crying, come back.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I gave her a final gentle pat on the shoulder and turned my back on Azusa.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the end of the story of the subheroine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Whether or not Azusa will be able to come back to the table in the future is up to …… her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If she does, she will probably have matured and become a stronger subheroine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe she’ll become so attractive that she’ll take the main heroine’s place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let’s hope so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Now, what should I do?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Finally, I’m going to have to face it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What should I do about the awakened protagonist?</p>

<p class="calibre5">At last, the story comes to a climax&ndash;</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 53: Declaration of War</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">Thus, Ryoma Ryuzaki awakened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His only flaw is that he’s a slob, but now that that’s gone, he’s almost the strongest of them all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if there is anyone who can compete with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At least, I can’t do anything about it as a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m a nobody, and I can’t stop the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are very few people who can interfere with him right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The main heroine, Shimotsuki, or one of the subheroines……, are the only ones with enough influence to change Ryuzaki’s mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, it begins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki’s solo performance has finally begun.</p>




<p class="calibre5">“…… Hey, Nakayama. Where have you been? I’ve been looking for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I returned to the plaza, Ryuzaki spoke to me as if he had been waiting for me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry about earlier. I got a little emotional …… and showed my disgraceful side.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t know if I should apologize. I didn’t have anything to say in response, so I shrugged my shoulders and looked toward the square.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The preparations for the campfire must have been finished.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A large flame rises from the center of the square wooden structure. The wavering smoke drifted in the wind and disappeared.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone was watching the flames.</p>
<p class="calibre5">According to the schedule, a light entertainment was to be held after this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was a simple stage set up in the square where they were going to perform comedy, songs, and dances.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone seemed to be in a good mood. It was noisier than usual, and I wanted to cover my ears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, I’m not in the mood to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the first place, I don’t know if I would have enjoyed a campfire under normal circumstances……, but at least now I wanted to be alone and sleep.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I think of Azusa, I feel like my heart is going to burst.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I can’t let that happen, because this is where the real battle begins.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you want?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t need to play the role of a dog anymore. The relationship between me and Shimotsuki was already known, so I said something emotionless as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, there’s something I want to tell you. …… I’ve decided to confess to Shiho. I thought I’d tell you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, no.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I already know, since I was eavesdropping earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not like I’m surprised now. So I nodded, expressionless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What……? I was expecting more reaction from you……. As expected, you can afford it. Do you think you’ve already got Shiho? The game is not over yet.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But the protagonist is perverse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without malice, he moves the story in a way that suits him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It is true that you and Shiho are good friends. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t jealous. …… But you haven’t confessed to her yet, have you? It’s not like you’re officially dating, is it? If that’s the case, then there must be a chance for me, too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuuzaki then clenched his fists in an attempt to inspire himself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’ve made me realize something. I was satisfied with just being childhood friends with Shiho. I’ve been thinking that if we could just be next to each other that would be enough, even if we didn’t become lovers. But that’s not good enough……. No other man would leave a girl as wonderful as Shiho aside.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As usual, Ryuzaki’s words were self-indulgent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was not thinking about Shimotsuki in the slightest, he was just looking for a result that would make him feel good.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll be honest, I’m …… scared to confess. I’m so nervous I think I’m going to throw up……. There is someone who likes me like this. If you’re a man who can’t confess your love to someone, it’s disrespectful to that person……. I have to be a cool Ryuzaki Ryoma.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The protagonist’s monologue is as incomprehensible as ever, and it makes my head hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I have one question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why are you telling me this?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t get it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What do you want from this mob character?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Do you think I’m going to give you a push?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s ridiculous……. There’s no way I’m going to support you.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Well, I’m sure Ryuzaki didn’t mean to say that either.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Because you’re my rival. This is a declaration of war.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki smiled fearlessly and turned his back on me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He seemed to be satisfied with his one-sided conversation.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/GP66b8C/FIBlnoP.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre5">“It’s more anticlimactic than I thought. I thought you would be more emotional, but Nakayama is a guy I don’t understand……. It’s boring.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems that the fiery protagonist overestimated his rival.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Don’t get your hopes up. Unlike you, I’m a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not in a position to intervene in the story.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, if possible, I don’t want you to get involved in anything, but I can’t say that when I think about …… Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After this, she will be confessed to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, by a person who is very bad at it, she is told that he likes her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to help her somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I can’t stop Ryuzaki from confessing his love to her……. In the end, I didn’t know what to do, and time just slowly passed by&ndash;</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 54: The Worst Confession Ever</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The entertainment begins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On a simple stage, a pair of high school boys were doing some sort of comedy act.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, I couldn’t tell if it was funny or not.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t have any sense of comedy, so I can’t judge what’s funny and what’s not.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s the nature of a sad mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because they have no hobbies or obsessions, they are incapable of having a personality.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They don’t even have principles, they just go with the flow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even now, at this very moment, I have been unable to do anything about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Ryuzaki’s confession is unstoppable ……)</p>

<p class="calibre5">A few minutes ago, the protagonist declared war on me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure he’s waiting for the right moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you confess your love at a campfire, you will succeed.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such a jinx is said to exist in this overnight learning program.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the reason why Ryuzaki is trying to use it to confess his feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As the entertainment was taking place on stage, I was watching it in a daze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It is not compulsory to participate in the entertainment, but only those who wish to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those who don’t want to participate can sleep in their rooms, so there are many people who don’t attend. There were also some people who didn’t observe the entertainment but instead chatted with their friends or flirted with their loved ones.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Indeed, this atmosphere is perfect for a confession.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The main light source was the flames of the campfire, and other lighting was minimal and a bit dim……. Because it was hard to see, the distance between people naturally narrowed. The unusual space gives courage to men and women in love. The unrealistic space may also make the confessor more excited than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Analyzing the situation, it seems that the probability of success is higher than confessing on an ordinary day when nothing is going on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a situation that convinced me that a jinx had been created.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Maybe Ryuzaki will call Shimotsuki when he confesses…… But first, I have to find her.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I want to stay close to Shimotsuki for now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know what to do, but as long as I could be there, I could always help.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I could do everything in my power to somehow get through Ryuzaki’s confession, that was fine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, my biggest concern was that the protagonist’s opportunism would be triggered and Shimotsuki would be driven into a corner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I have no idea what kind of convenience will come into play, though.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I’m afraid that the situation will turn out to be convenient for Ryuzaki. If something happens that twists …… Shimotsuki’s will, which is unlikely, Ryuzaki’s confession might be successful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is an unrealistic assumption, but since Ryuzaki is the protagonist, I knew that anything could happen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So anyway, I hurried to meet up with Shimotsuki, but even after looking around the square, I couldn’t find her….</p>

<p class="calibre5">(There are quite a lot of blind spots that I can’t see…….)</p>

<p class="calibre5">The visibility is worse than I thought. It is also awkward because there are couples making out everywhere.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her silvery-white hair stands out, so if she were here, I’m sure I’d be able to spot her right away……. Maybe she’s already asleep?</p>

<p class="calibre5">If so, that would have been a relief……, but it seems I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Oh, there she is!)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found Shimotsuki just as the entertainment was about to end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think it was about an hour or so. When the students had finished their performance, I spotted the silver hair in front of the stage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Apparently, Shimotsuki had also come. I wondered if it was a bad time, or if she had just arrived……. Well, if I could join her, that would be fine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what I thought, and I started walking towards her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But there were so many people in front of the stage that I couldn’t make my way to the front. It took me a while.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, she was looking around as if she was looking for someone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And as soon as her eyes met mine, her face lit up and she tried to run over to me……. Just then, I saw.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s time for the annual “Confession Time”! It seems to have produced many couples so far, so if you are a boy or a girl in love, this is the time to show your courage! Is there anyone out there?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Immediately after the host said that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The person who suddenly came on stage was the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m Ryoma Ryuzaki, class 1, year 2. There’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was a child. Today, let me confess my love to that person.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a microphone in his hand, Ryuzaki spoke up proudly, a look of determination on his face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“――――”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, there was silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment he stepped out onto the stage, I felt the place suddenly quieten down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone’s attention was on Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was quite a celebrity. He is so popular that he is recognized not only by jealous boys, but even by girls who have little to do with him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, although he is such a guy, he has never fallen in love with anyone in particular. That’s why the people around him were wondering, “Who is he going to date?”. I guess they were wondering what was going on……. The mystery was finally being solved now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s no wonder everyone is paying attention.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And that “attention” was the …… concept she was least comfortable with.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho! I have something to tell you……. Please, will you listen to me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one who was called out by name was of course Shiho Shimotsuki, Ryuzaki’s childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki is staring at her in front of the stage. The people around her are all looking at her at the same time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A lot of eyes, and the consciousness of others, were focused on the little girl, Shiho Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“――――!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even from a distance, I could tell.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s expression was tense and strained.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure he doesn’t notice the change in Shimotsuki because she is always expressionless in front of Ryuzaki. He is reaching out gently …… and I am sure he does not know what he has done.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As usual, the protagonist only thinks about himself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They don’t seem to understand that Shimotsuki is now so uncomfortable that she can’t speak.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(No way, this is how you’re going to confess…….)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I clenched my fists at the unexpected situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">See, it happened after all. A convenient scene for the protagonist has arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If you think about it, surely …… this situation is the only option for Shimotsuki’s confession to end in a good outcome. The opportunism is firmly in effect.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is not very good with Ryuzaki as she should be, so the chances of a successful confession are close to zero.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But with so many people watching, can Shimotsuki really speak up?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, she can’t. She was shy and sensitive to the presence of others, but there was no way she could express herself in this situation with so many people watching her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Damn.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bite my lip at the worst confession I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t meet up with Shimotsuki anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The story is now entering its peak.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no way for a mob character to intervene in this confession.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why all I could do was look at the protagonist as usual&ndash;</p>


d
<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 55: I Can’t Stay a Mob Character</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The worst possible scenario comes to my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Suppose Ryuzaki were to confess his feelings to Shimotsuki in this situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Will she be able to give him an answer?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, she can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If she was capable of speaking in a public place like this, she wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place. I’m sure she would have firmly refused to go on stage.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she couldn’t say anything, so she went up on stage as she was led by the people around her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone seemed to be excited about Ryuzaki’s confession.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The whole place was already dominated by Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Go for it! “Show us who you are!” “Show us your strength! “You can do it, Ryuzaki-kun!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">They were cheering him on as he plucked up the courage to confess his feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why everyone is oblivious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They don’t understand how frightened Shimotsuki is right now……, how nervous she is, how she’s shaking herself, how she’s about to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because she is the girl who was confessed to by Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is no way that the heroine, who was given such good fortune, would not like it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(This is the worst……)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I clench my fists. My fingernails dig into my skin and it hurts, but it helps me keep my cool.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Think. What can I do …… to save Shimotsuki?</p>
<p class="calibre5">How can I help that nice girl who thinks I’m special……?</p>

<p class="calibre5">(If Ryuzaki confesses his love to her……)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure Shimotsuki can’t refuse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, she should not be able to say anything. The only thing she can do is to keep quiet, kill her emotions, and endure the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If she does, it will eventually be interpreted in a way that is convenient for Ryuzaki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can’t you give me an answer that quickly? If that’s the case, I’ll confess again sometime. But you have to know that I love you. Maybe you don’t like me yet, but I’ll try my best to make you like …… me someday.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What a way to suggest that the relationship would progress in the sequel.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t accept this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Shimotsuki is not very good with Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter how hard she tries in the future, she will never be able to like Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s how much she doesn’t even care about that guy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, …… it’s the reason why the story chose this stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In order to prevent the protagonist from being rejected, the story is trying to extend itself with the most convenient situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If this continues, Shimotsuki will remain the main heroine forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m still not going to allow Ryuzaki to approach her, make her feel bad, and spend her days in pain. …… I can’t allow that to happen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I want to help.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;If I could, I would protect her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think strongly in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is a benefactor to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had no confidence in myself, I was constantly denying myself, and to top it off, I was so self-loathing that I described myself as a “mob character”.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thanks to her, I’ve been really enjoying every day recently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a relief to know that there was someone who would accept me like this …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t say sad things about mob characters.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s what she once said to me to cheer me up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t think I can express in words how much those words encouraged me. ……</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sure that for Shimotsuki, Kotaro Nakayama is not just a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As proof of this, …… she is still looking at me with eyes that seem to cling to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then her lips moved as if to appeal for something.</p>





<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, …… please help me.”</p>





<p class="calibre5">I thought I heard a voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it was an auditory hallucination. Shimotsuki is in a situation where she cannot say a word……, but just by the movement of her lips, I knew what she was saying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve been with her for a while now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can at least tell what she’s thinking by looking at her face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Help me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The moment I sensed her intentions, I felt something flare up inside me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I got it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I nodded, and moved my heavy body forcibly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m done with being a mob character …….</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ll do anything for Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can even stand up to the protagonist.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In order to do that, I can’t stay as a mob character.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You can’t be serious! You think you can get away with this kind of confession ……!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I raise my voice loudly and ruin the atmosphere of the place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, the source of the voice was …… me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry to say that I’m in the middle of a good story, but ……, my protagonist, let me interrupt your story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki Ryoma. I’m not going to allow you to have a happy ending.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Do you know that there is a bad ending to a story?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki, I won’t let your wish come true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For that purpose, I’ll block your romantic comedy not as a “mob character” but as a …… “villain”…</p>


<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 56: Don’t Think You Can Be Insensitive Forever?</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">&ndash;A silence descends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The silence hurts my ears. The air in the place was completely chilled by what I had said.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I am aware that I said something out of place.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, my days of being a casual observer, being carried away by the flow of events, reading the atmosphere, are over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t protect Shimotsuki if I remain a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To protect her, …… I can do anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It doesn’t matter if I’m a villain or not.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt like I could be the heel that destroys the story.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ryuzaki. You’re a real coward, you know that? You’re really annoying to watch. You declared war on me, didn’t you? If that’s the case, then give me a fair fight! Confessing under such circumstances really disgusts me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Slowly, I made my way towards the stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A while ago, the crowd was in the way and I couldn’t move forward, but now everyone was making way for me, so it was easy to walk.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Everyone was looking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They looked at me with puzzled, suspicious, curious, and confused faces.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Who is this?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">They probably didn’t even recognize me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was only natural, since I was a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But today, at …… this moment, they will recognize who I am.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s how far I’ve come.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama ……, don’t interrupt me. I’m about to confess my feelings to Shiho. What’s wrong with you all of a sudden?　Are you in a hurry? I’m sure you’re in a hurry because you were caught off guard by the fact that you won and then I did something bold like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki, on the other hand, is missing the point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Panicked? In a hurry? Me, for you?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m long past that stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve never thought of you as an enemy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because Ryuzaki …… you haven’t even reached the battle stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not sure how you can say that when you’ve already lost the battle.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…… Why would you confess under such circumstances? You love Shimotsuki, didn’t you? You really love her, don’t you? If so, that’s impossible.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I get up on stage and glare straight at Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that he can’t hide his annoyance with me either. I’m sure he’s annoyed that I’ve interrupted his show.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. It doesn’t matter when or under what circumstances I confess, does it? What I did in front of everyone was to show her that I was that serious.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Haha. …… Ryuzaki is always all about himself, isn’t he? You’re so self-absorbed, you don’t even think about the other person, you can only come up with things that make you feel good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As if to explode the emotion of “I hate you” that I had been suppressing in my mind for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I vented my emotions as much as I could.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, you always hurt others. Can’t you see what your beloved person is looking like right now ……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then I embraced Shimotsuki’s shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her face was pale and she was biting her lip tightly, but as soon as …… I hugged her, she started to spill large tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;-Eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing the tears, Ryuzaki finally seemed to realize.</p>
<p class="calibre5">How much Shimotsuki had hated this situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shiho? Hey, why are you crying ……?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s so heartbreaking to see such a lovely girl shedding tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not to mention Ryuzaki, myself, and everyone else in the …… audience were also watching with pain in our eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At this moment, the flow of events changed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At first, there was an air of bewilderment at the intrusion of a foreigner like me, but …… it soon turned to sympathy for Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And at the same time, it also leads to the affirmation of my existence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is confession a spectacle for Ryuzaki? For example, don’t you ever assume that the girl you are confessing to is a very timid and shy girl who gets scared just by the …… presence of others?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Attention gathers<strong class="calibre11">.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre5"><strong class="calibre11">Everyone perceives me, and they are leaning forward to hear what I have to say next.</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">As if to speak to them as well, I strung my words together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki is that kind of girl……. So don’t do this to her. How can you be a childhood friend and not know that? How can this girl be serious when you confess to her like a spectacle?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I won’t allow you to be insensitive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not going to let you get away with opportunism.</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 57: Breakup</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">“… I’m sorry, Nakayama-kun. That … um.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">As soon as I hugged her, Shimotsuki suddenly regained her vigor, as if the time that had stopped had begun to move.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">As if the thread of tension that had been taut had been cut, …… Shimotsuki became weak, leaned against me, and then began to spill large tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">In order to reassure her, I gently rubbed her back.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“You don’t have to say anything. Here, take a deep breath. …… It’s okay. I’ll take care of everything else. Here, take a handkerchief. You’ve got tears and snot all over your face. You’re going to be okay…… Stay behind me, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki was desperately trying to say something, but she was in such an unstable state that she couldn’t get the words out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In order to calm her down, I handed her a handkerchief and spoke gently to her.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing this, Ryuzaki seemed to reaffirm his failure.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shiho is shy? Is she timid? No, no, no, no, that’s not …… possible. This is because Shiho is a quiet, solitary person who likes to be alone and has no interest in other people……, so she didn’t even look at me, and she hated talking to other people. She’s not that kind of girl, is she ……?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">He was still trying to hang on to his misconception.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He doesn’t want to believe it.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">But that statement is not convincing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki’s tears and attitude proved that everything Ryuzaki had said was a “misunderstanding”.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“…… You’re always interpreting things to suit yourself like that. I’m not sure what to say. Does she like to be alone?　Not interested in others? It’s not like that……. She’s talkative, she’s longed for friends, and she’s always been curious about others. It’s just that she’s too timid and shy to get the courage to take the first step.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">At this point, I’d like to correct all the misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I denied all the facts that had been conveniently interpreted by Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then why were you so cold to me!? If you were interested in other people, if you wanted a friend, if you wanted to have a chat, I was there! Why didn’t Shiho accept me, her childhood friend, the one who knew her better than anyone else!”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Still defeated, I felt that he still didn’t understand Shimotsuki when she objected to him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“……That’s a given.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, a smile appeared on my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can see it in myself. I’m sure I have a very distorted and ugly smile on my face right now.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t control my emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was enjoying the sight of Ryuzaki, whom I hated, getting all upset.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">This is exactly the kind of villain I want to be.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A villain who destroys the story might be a good fit for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted Ryuzaki to get hurt more and more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I said clearly in a voice that everyone could hear.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki didn’t like Ryuzaki. ….. Why didn’t you notice? How can you not understand when she’s so cold and unresponsive when you talk to her, and when she looks so depressed just being next to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">At last, I said it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shiho Shimotsuki is not fond of Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">That the protagonist was nothing more than a stranger to the main heroine.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I blurted it out with all my emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In response to that truth, Ryuzaki shook his head as if to say …… it’s impossible, then staggered back and leaned against the stage wall like he was bumping into it.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not possible……, because I’m Shiho’s childhood friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“&ndash;Just because you’ve known each other since childhood doesn’t mean that’s why you’re close. For Shimotsuki, you are just a stranger that she has known since childhood…… You need to accept that fact.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to describe it, I would say that it is like a verbal knife that cuts you to shreds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One-sidedly throwing out emotions and hurting the person named Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the protagonist, as expected, was still hurt by those “truths”.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a lie…… It’s a lie, it’s a lie, it’s a lie!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">He shouted, glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that stare was only for a moment. …… Every time he looked at me, he would be shocked by the reality of what he saw.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, behind me is Shimotsuki, who has shrunk down to hide behind my back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When you see her like that, you’ll understand exactly how much she adores me.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Damn …… damn! I’m the one who met her first! I was the first one to like her…… Don’t take Shiho away from me……. Damn it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">The sore loser’s words echoed through the quiet audience.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a Ryuzaki was so …… uncool that it was hard to watch.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, the Warriors’ time is over. I’m sorry, Ryuzaki ……, but I’m going to let your story “fall apart” at this point.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry to say that right after your awakening, you’ll have to go back to being a bum.</p>
<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 58: Doping, Not Therapy</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">After Azusa’s confession, the protagonist gained confidence in himself, overcame his weakness, and awakened. Originally, the story was supposed to have a happy ending.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Surely, Ryoma Ryuzaki would have been able to make a great leap forward after the turning point of today. Starting with the main heroine, Shimotsuki, he would have been able to capture the sub-heroines in the sequel one after another, whose relationships are still vague at the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">However, the one who interfered with this guy was a person who was only a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Kotaro Nakayama.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, I was the only miscalculation for Ryoma Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t be anything else, but thanks to Shimotsuki, I got a role. In the name of her, I acted as a villain for the protagonist and blamed him.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, the story fell apart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The harem story of Ryoma Ryuzaki, which had managed to hold its shape until halfway through the story, was destroyed by a different person, …… me.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why you? How did you become Shiho’s “special one” when you are such a plain and inconspicuous mob? Nakayama, you’re nothing special, but …… I’m definitely more deserving of Shiho.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">You can deny it, but it won’t change the outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now it’s me next to Shimotsuki, and it’s Ryuzaki who made her cry.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why doesn’t Shiho look back at me too? …… I’ve always liked Shiho, so I’ve always held back, even when other girls have tempted me. I’ve had a lot of emotional turmoil, but I’ve always had Shiho’s face in my mind, and I’ve held back. Only Shiho was special to me…….”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t take it any longer and …… couldn’t help but laugh at the words.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha, …… what’s that? I knew it. You’re always thinking of yourself, aren’t you? Did you put up with the other girls’ temptations? Shimotsuki was the only one who was special? Yeah, you really are a coward, Ryuzaki. The truth is, you were just scared, right?　You just didn’t have the courage to face the feelings of the other girls, using Shimotsuki as an excuse, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t say these words because I was playing a villain. It was something I’ve always thought about.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s ridiculous. I really feel sorry for the girls who like you. …… I feel sorry for them from the side. They’re trying so hard to tell you that they love you. They’ve been very blatant about how much they love you, but you just keep pretending to ignore it. You betray their feelings, trample on them, kick them to the ground, and make no effort to reciprocate. You’re so naive? That’s bullshit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">My stepsister’s face appeared in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not going to forgive this guy for hurting my precious family.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t care what other girls say. Even though other girls have confessed to me, I still love Shiho! So I have to make this confession successful, but if I don’t ……, I won’t be able to face that girl who confessed to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">What an arrogant person you are!</p>
<p class="calibre5">The pathetic clown who was fumbling around in his position as the protagonist was hilarious.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh come on, don’t make me laugh any more……. If you want to repay her confession, all you had to do was accept the girl, right? Don’t talk about turning her down as if it’s a beautiful thing. Don’t talk about how you hurt her as if it’s a good thing. You can’t face her? You can’t face the girl you’ve been talking about!”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I wished he would stop using Azusa as an excuse to say stupid things.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Stop using her as an excuse. Don’t burden her any more. …… That’s the only ‘atonement’ you can make.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Azusa’s confession was the medicine that healed Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it was not a medicine to cure, but a “doping” that only increased …….</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryoma Ryuzaki’s illness has not been cured.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He is a “loser” from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">He only thinks about himself, but he always looks to others for the reason. This time, he didn’t do it voluntarily because he wanted to confess his feelings to Shimotsuki. He just used it as an excuse for rejecting Azusa’s confession.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s really a stupid person.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“You have to realize that. What did she look like when you rejected her confession? Did she smile? Did she really look like that? …… Didn’t she look like she was about to cry, like Shimotsuki just now?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I still have Azusa’s crying face stuck in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I will never be able to forget that painful image again.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Stop looking away from what you don’t want to see. Don’t forget, Ryuzaki, that there is a girl who was hurt because of you. If you are really, truly happy with her confession, please don’t …… smear her with more mud.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m begging you, don’t hurt Azusa any more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure my heartfelt words …… did not reach Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">No matter what I say, there is no way the protagonist-sama will twist his thoughts with my words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for the sake of the subheroine who adores that guy……, the protagonist will be able to accept his mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure he knows that too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He remembered that Azusa had looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why Ryuzaki could only nod, unable to say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the end of the protagonist’s awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The doping effect of Azusa’s confession has worn off, and he’s just the same old loser.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, it’s time to end it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki Ryoma……, I’m sick of your stupid story…</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 59: The End of the Road for the Harem Protagonist</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I thought this exchange would go on forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As my classmates looked on, the mudslinging between me and Ryuzaki continued.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">The battle is only a one-sided attack on my part, but for those who are watching ……, it would not have been very interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">They don’t know the details of the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They can probably only understand half of the conversation between me and Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there is one thing that even they can understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was that a girl named Shiho Shimotsuki was crying.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">They probably understood that I was trying my best to protect her from being hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe that’s why they’re watching over us without saying anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m grateful. I hope they’ll continue to watch me until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">And I hope they understand Ryuzaki’s abnormality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hopefully, his harem members will please wake up.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki is not worth sacrificing everything for.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Please don’t devote your life to a trivial person who is only popular with women.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Hoping for such a thing, I finally decided to make a decision.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ryuzaki, your feelings will not be rewarded. Let’s end this now……. Hey, Shimotsuki. Have you calmed down by now?　Have you stopped crying? Did you wipe the runny nose properly?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I turn my attention to Shimotsuki, who has probably calmed down over time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…… I really don’t want to take advantage of her, though.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I really need Shimotsuki’s help to settle this situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have to make a clean break with the protagonist who refuses to give up.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I have to end his story by confessing my feelings and ending up with Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">So I faced Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“………… Hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps it was because she had carefully rubbed her nose and eyes, but Shimotsuki’s face was even more swollen than usual. However, she wasn’t as distraught as before. She seems to have calmed down somehow, so she’s probably fine now.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">All that was left was for me to confess.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With this, I can finally save Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">With that thought, I tried to finish everything.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki. Listen, …… I think you’re…”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">….. But the girl Shimotsuki Shiho, unlike Ryoma Ryuzaki, is a fine main heroine.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not just a weak girl who can be saved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As soon as she realized what I was going to say, she suddenly changed her color.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“No!”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">She shook her head and stared at me with swollen eyes, as if in anger.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">She is a shy girl, sensitive to the presence of others, and basically a clumsy girl, but she is also a shy person who is strong only in front of those who …… she has forgiven.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">So the girl next to me was …… very strong.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, …… I’m fine now. So don’t push yourself any further, okay? You don’t have to get hurt anymore……. Thank you for helping me. I have more courage. So let’s talk about it later, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I won’t forgive you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I don’t want you to confess now.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt as if I was being told that, and I choked up.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“…… Oh, is that so? Then yeah. Okay, but ……”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Are you sure you’re okay?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was worried about Shimotsuki, but she seemed to be fine, just like she said she would be.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ryuzaki-kun. I understand how you feel. I’m sorry that I misled you……. So, I’m sorry. I’ll apologize to you first. After that, please listen to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Shimotsuki is facing Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the first time in this story, perhaps, the main heroine’s true feelings were about to be told to the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sh, Shiho, ……?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Ryuzaki was scared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, he is looking at Shimotsuki with somewhat expectant eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She has yet to say anything to him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, there is a slight possibility of a major upset, as if to say so.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there is no way that the outcast heroine, Shimotsuki, would approve of such a development in the story.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never been very good at you. I’m sorry I haven’t told you before……. I haven’t liked you much for a long time. Yeah, so …… Ryuzaki-kun. I can’t reciprocate your feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">She puts an end to it with her own hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a slightly different ending than the one I had envisioned.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">What I had envisioned was that I would confess and go out with Shimotsuki to end Ryoma Ryuzaki’s love, but …… she cut off Ryuzaki’s feelings with her own words.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;-!”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">If he were told, Ryuzaki would have no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">His love ended without any reward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The story of Ryoma Ryuzaki came to an end without producing anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That it ended not with a happy ending, but with a bad ending.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that all Ryuzaki could do was accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Without saying a word, he got off the stage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He wandered off in the direction of nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">There was no one left to chase after Ryuzaki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although Azusa chased after him earlier and encouraged him.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the other subheroines seemed to think that it would be difficult to save Ryoma Ryuzaki now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the end of the road for harem protagonists. As a result of betraying his feelings, trampling on them, and pretending not to notice them, …… he lost all affection for him.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">…… And so the romantic comedy of Ryoma Ryuzaki ended.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The harem romantic comedy closes with the result that it is a waste of time, with no catharsis at all.</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 60: My protagonist</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">The entire entertainment program ended amidst an indescribable atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, after Ryuzaki’s confession, the atmosphere was so awkward that no one came out to the stage and …… it was free time.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">The time is 9:00 p.m.; there is a roll call in each room at 10:00 p.m., so I must be back by then.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">The thought of seeing Ryuzaki when I get back to my room depresses me, but anyway, I’ll try not to think about him just now.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">The story of Ryoma Ryuzaki is already over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The days of being pushed around by the harem protagonist have come to an end.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m tired of it all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">I was now next to Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she was good at finding places where there was no sign of people. She asked me to follow her, so I did so, and before I knew it, we were alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps it is a storeroom. There are several prefabricated buildings that look like warehouses set up around it. In such a place, Shimotsuki was quietly breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“I never thought it would come to this. …… I just wanted to chat with Nakayama-kun over the campfire, but how did I get caught up in something so strange?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">In the moonlight, she was covering her face with her hands to hide her reddened face.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh …… hey, now I’m ugly, aren’t I? I’ve been crying so much that my eyes and nose feel funny. I am so embarrassed that Nakayama-kun can see my face like this. If possible, I would like you to close your eyes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“…… It’s not weird. Shimotsuki is always so cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps because I am distracted, my mouth is quicker than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I end up saying the word ‘cute,’ which I usually try not to say too often.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nyu……, no, no, don’t say that. Now my cheeks will turn bright red……. I’m going to be as red as a boiled octopus. Nakayama, are you really so mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">She said that, but she didn’t seem to be completely full of it. Her cheeks were loosening happily.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s not true. Nakayama-kun is very kind……. It’s impossible for him to be mean. I mean, you saved me. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Saying this, Shimotsuki rubs up against me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She rubbed her body against me as if to pamper me, and I felt closer to her than usual. Our skin is touching, and her slightly hot body heat stimulates my heart. My heart is beating hard, and I’m sure it’s because of her charm.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“My mind was blank at that moment…… and I didn’t know what to do, my body couldn’t move as fast as I wanted it to. I’m not very good at public appearances…… so I was afraid of the way people were looking at me. I had so many different sounds echoing in my head that I felt like I was going to freeze in a panic.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">So Shimotsuki could not say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even when Ryuzaki confessed his feelings to her, she was unable to convey her intentions clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is probably how much she was suffering from that situation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is much more sensitive to sound than usual, and perhaps she picks up on other people’s sounds easily. That may be why she senses the presence of “others” more strongly than an ordinary person like me.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">If so, then at that time when she was in the state of being a freak show, Shimotsuki must have been really suffering.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“But when I heard Nakayama-kun’s voice, I was no longer afraid at all. Because you were next to me ……, the things I was afraid of became less scary. That’s why I owe you, Nakayama-kun. Thank you for helping me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">A sincere smile is directed at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For such a person who was only a mob character, Shimotsuki gives me a special look.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">No, this girl does not think of me as a mob character.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun is my own personal hero.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Once upon a time, there was a boy who was loved by no one and betrayed by everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He lost everything, thought of himself as a mob character, and was a boring person who just went with the flow……. He met a girl and his life changed.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">(Is this …… happiness?)</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Warm, tender feelings fill my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so happy to hear Shimotsuki’s words that I almost cried my eyes out…</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you is my line.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you for accepting me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you for choosing me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you …… for making me the protagonist …….</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you very much….</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 61: Kotaro Nakayama’s Love Comedy</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki ……!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was the first time I had ever felt that way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Filled with happiness, I was so moved that I unintentionally hugged Shimotsuki.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kya. Hey, you can’t do that out of the blue. …… What if I get too nervous and collapse? Nakayama-kun is a person who can’t help it anymore. ….. uhehe”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Although she denies it in words, Shimotsuki seems happy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She said no, but on the contrary, she was holding on to me, so I couldn’t get away even if I tried.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“” ………… “”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For a while, we embraced each other in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun? You know, …… I do like you, Nakayama, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words came out of nowhere, and what a “confession” it was.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Shimotsuki, me too…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Immediately I tried to respond too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tried to tell her how I felt.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But she wouldn’t let me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really? Nakayama-kun, is your answer what you really sincerely think? Hey, Nakayama-kun, …… do you understand what it means to like another person?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash; I was at a loss for words at that statement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In response to Shimotsuki’s question, I …… thought carefully about myself again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I like her. That is a feeling that is not false.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I wonder if what Shimotsuki means by “like” and what I think of as “like” are really the same thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nakayama-kun, you hate yourself, don’t you? You don’t seem very sure of yourself. So you don’t love yourself. How can you love another person in such a state? Do you …… really, really like me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…… Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I certainly hate myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t love myself like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if the words “I like you” are really worth it when you say them in such a state.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Do my words have any weight?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I like you more than you know, okay? I will never be satisfied with a mere ‘I like you’.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;I see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, I realized what Shimotsuki was trying to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her thoughts far exceed my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, it sounded like Shimotsuki was asking me to be more mindful of ‘my feelings’ and that’s what she was saying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I like you because you like me &ndash; that’s not enough, it’s like I’ve been compromised. I want you to know me better. I want you to understand my feelings more. And, you know, I want you to like me more …….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Not a passive ‘like’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am looking for a girl named Shiho Shimotsuki for active ‘liking’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So I’ll wait for you. Nakayama-kun, I will watch by your side until you come to like yourself …… and learn to like me even more. So, I don’t need your confession yet.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Shimotsuki stood up tall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She put her hand around my neck and lightly touched her lips to my cheek this time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve never been so in love with someone before. So, if you can, …… Nakayama-kun, I hope you love me as much as I love you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Oh, I see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, I get it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’ve been a mob character until now, and now I’m the protagonist only for…… Shiho Shimotsuki.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, the story had not yet begun.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The story so far was just a prequel.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From here, the romantic comedy between me and Shiho Shimotsuki would finally begin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I do……. I’ll love you more and more. I promise…….&nbsp; Shimotsuki.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If that’s the case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m done calling her a stranger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&ndash;Shiho. I’m going to take care of you from now on.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the first time, I call her name and hug her again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not that this is radical behavior. If you think about it in a normal way, it’s just a light expression of affection…… but even just this made her so happy that she jumped up and down.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ufufu … I’m so glad you finally called me …….. I was so stubborn, you know. I was so determined to have you call me by my name someday that I kept calling you ‘Nakayama-kun’ in a lonely way, you know? But you don’t have to put up with me anymore.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She smiled happily and hugged me again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Kotaro! Please take care of me, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">&ndash;Thus ended the story of a mob character named Kotaro Nakayama.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And now the “romantic comedy” begins.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The story of Shiho Shimotsuki alone as the main character has begun.</p>

<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre10">Chapter 62: The silent Girl uses her expressions to speak</strong></h1>



<h4 class="has-text-align-center">TL/ED: Bogdi</h4>



<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately for the talkative Shimotsuki, she seemed to be shy and reserved and rarely spoke to me in public.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1524" class="calibre5">Even when class started and break time came around, she didn’t come over to me. I guess the reason she came to me in the morning was to return my handkerchief. She doesn’t talk to me unless she has something to say.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1525" class="calibre5">My seat was at the back of the class on the hallway side, and Shimotsuki’s seat was at the back by the window. Right in front of her was Ryuzaki, with Azusa and Yuuki sitting around him.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1526" class="calibre5">The so-called protagonist’s seat was occupied by Shimotsuki. Well, I think Ryuzaki is more of a protagonist than Shimotsuki, but it seems the rule was not triggered by the seat change.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1527" class="calibre5">Anyway, I guess Shimotsuki and Ryuzaki really do have a rotten relationship. It’s strange that their seats are so close to each other.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, Shimotsuki is not very good at talking to Ryuzaki, so she sleeps face down all the time to prevent him from talking to her too much.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1528" class="calibre5">That’s why Shimotsuki didn’t have a chance to talk to me in class this morning.</p>



<p class="calibre5">However, I am concerned about the fact that she keeps glancing at me …… like she wants to say something, but she doesn’t come to me, so I don’t really understand.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1529" class="calibre5">As I was tilting my head, I was unexpectedly spoken to by a boy sitting next to me. His name was Souma Hanagishi. He was a classmate and an acquaintance that I only talked to once in a while. With a curious look on his face, he handed me a piece of paper.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1530" class="calibre5">“Nakayama, it came from someone nearby. …… It’s rather refreshing to get a letter in high school, isn’t it?”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1531" class="calibre5">During math class, Hanagishi speaks to me in a whisper so that the teacher standing at the lectern won’t notice. What is the letter? I had no idea, so I accepted the letter, expressing my gratitude.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1532" class="calibre5">I took out the paper contained in a cute letterhead.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1533" class="calibre5">On it, “Dear Nakayama-kun” was written in cute round characters like an elementary school student.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1534" class="calibre5">Or rather, I’m curious about the hiragana. …… Since it is a name that uses only kanji learned in elementary school, I don’t think it’s difficult.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1535" class="calibre5">While thinking about this, I read through the words inside.</p>



<p class="calibre5">There was something like this written on it.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1536" class="calibre5">“Good Morning, Lunch, let’s eat. From “Your Friend”.”</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1537" class="calibre5">…… I see. The sender is Shimotsuki. She was the only friend I had in this class, so I knew right away.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1538" class="calibre5">But it was hmmm …… strange that she was a high school student but her writing was poor or …… strange. She doesn’t use kanji robustly, and her sentence structure is just weird. The round characters are cute, but unfortunately I didn’t feel any intelligence.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1539" class="calibre5">But I understood what she was trying to say.</p>



<p class="calibre5">She asked me to have lunch with her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1540" class="calibre5">Of course I agreed. I usually just eat the pastries I bought, at my seat during my lunch break, so it was no problem.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1541" class="calibre5">The only problem is how to reply. …… Should I send a letter to her as well?</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1542" class="calibre5">But, as I thought, exchanging letters at this age is embarrassing.</p>



<p class="calibre5">I wondered if there was any way I could tell her. I looked at Shimotsuki. Then I saw her glancing at me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1543" class="calibre5">She had her head on her hands, making it look like she was concentrating on the class, but her eyes were looking at me every few seconds. Because of this, I was also making eye contact with the students seated between me and Shimotsuki, but every time I did, they immediately looked away, which made me very suspicious of their behavior.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1544" class="calibre5">…… Shimotsuki may look perfect, but she’ s pretty clumsy in some ways. I feel that there are a lot of things that are quite wrong with her, in terms of human interaction at least.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1545" class="calibre5">Well, it is convenient, if she is looking at me.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1546" class="calibre5">(Okay)</p>



<p class="calibre5">　</p>



<p class="calibre5">I made a sign with my index finger and thumb and gave the “OK” sign.</p>



<p class="calibre5">A few seconds later, Shimotsuki looked at me, so I guess she got the message.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1547" class="calibre5">As proof, Shimotsuki’s expression clearly brightened, so I was sure she got the message. She usually doesn’t talk much, but I think she easily shows her emotions in her expressions.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-1548" class="calibre5">She was obviously happy to be eating lunch with me. …… She was cute, after all and I was happy to see her.</p>
