<h3>Chapter 4 - Seiran Festival.</h3>

<p>Early July. It was that time of the year again when the summer heat was about to hit in earnest.</p>
<p>The day of the Seiran Festival had finally arrived.</p>
<p>By this day, our class, Third-Year Class A, has been practicing the play for a little less than a month, so we were all set.</p>
<p>All we had to do was wait for the performance, but before that, I had one thing to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was waiting for Nanase to arrive in the hallway in front of the classroom after the morning homeroom.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. From now on, I will be going around the Seiran Festival with her.</p>
<p>Nanase was wearing her trademark white parka over her blouse once again.</p>
<p>It looks like she won&#8217;t change her style even for the Seiran Festival.</p>
<p>&#8220;So where do you want to go first? Or do you want to eat something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, l-let me think&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt strangely nervous as I said this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been out with a girl before, so I have no idea how to talk in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m a little hungry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Shall we go to a place where we can eat first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase smiled at me.</p>
<p>I should have been used to seeing her smile, but perhaps because it was a cultural festival today, her smile looked cuter than usual.</p>
<p>That was why my heart has been beating so loudly for a while now.</p>
<p>Am I going to be okay at this rate&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the first years are having a bake sale in the classroom, so let&#8217;s go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay! Let&#8217;s do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase replied in an overly excited tone and unexpectedly grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;! W-What!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might get crowded. Let&#8217;s get a move on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said, and pulled me along with her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my heart rate was going up.</p>
<p>This is not good. If I don&#8217;t do something, she&#8217;s going to keep leading me around.</p>
<p>In the first place, I invited her to go around the Seiran Festival with me to cheer Nanase up after she failed the audition for the role of Juliet.</p>
<p>So, I have to entertain Nanase somehow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do my best.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know tapioca tasted like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase and I went to a maid cafe for the first year&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>That was why all the waitresses were wearing maid uniforms. For some reason, the men were included as well.</p>
<p>The store&#8217;s recommended menu seemed to be tapioca drinks, and I had never had one in my life, so I ordered and tried one. It was just plain delicious.</p>
<p>I heard that tapioca was made from overseas potatoes, and it did taste a bit like potatoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re a tapirer too, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tapirer? Does that mean someone who likes tapioca a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it probably means!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just use words you don&#8217;t know the meaning of.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s that, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s what? I&#8217;m just drinking tapioca, just like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Nanase said, she was drinking tapioca with a straw.</p>
<p>Her gesture was a little cute in contrast to the noisy girl she usually is.</p>
<p>But that was not what I wanted to ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more to eat here than tapioca, right? Can you eat them all?&#8221;</p>
<p>The table in front of Nanase was lined with omelet rice, hamburger steak and many other dishes. It was a lot for a girl to eat by herself, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m going to share this with Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, I didn&#8217;t hear that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little surprise!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need such a surprise&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell you the truth, it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want Kiritani-kun to say he doesn&#8217;t want it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want it, but&#8230; maybe I don&#8217;t want it after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s terrible. I can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t want to share with me. I’m going to cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like to share, but I&#8217;ll never be able to finish that amount of food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase turned her attention once more to the food laid out in front of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Kiritani-kun can handle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re leaving it up to me!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I sigh in exasperation at the unexpected comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you order so much in the first place?&#8221;</p>
<p>“For the special occasion, I don’t want to miss out.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not why no one would order this much food.”</p>
<p>To be honest, we probably couldn&#8217;t finish it even if we shared it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so upset, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase scooped up the rice omelet with the spoon she was holding and brought it to my mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What this all of the sudden!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what that is? It&#8217;s called spoon-feeding.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but why are you doing this!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because boys like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She teased me and forced the rice omelet into my mouth.</p>
<p>My heart started beating wildly at the thought of my first spoon-feeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it good? It&#8217;s good, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s delicious&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00012.jpeg"></img>

<p>&#8220;Okay, okay! Then let&#8217;s eat it all up like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! You couldn&#8217;t mean to do that from the beginning— ahmmm&#8221;</p>
<p>In the middle of my words, Nanase forcefully fed me again.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, my mouth was full.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a squirrel, Kiritani-kun! So cute!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;ll never forgive you for making fun of me, Nanase.</p>
<p>Well, the spoon-feeding was really good, though&#8230;</p>
<p>And then I ended up eating all of the food that Nanase ordered.</p>
<p>Nanase helped me a little, but I ate most of it, and as a result, my stomach was in one of the worst pains of my life.</p>
<p>&#8230;Seriously, I can&#8217;t eat anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked around quite a lot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said happily from next to me as the two of us walked down a corridor crowded with students and families.</p>
<p>After that, Nanase and I looked around at the various performances.</p>
<p>The second year&#8217;s dance performance, the magic club&#8217;s giant maze, the occult club&#8217;s fortune telling, and a few more.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, I was carrying a lot of prizes and awards in my arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about to fall, do you want me to help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked as she looked at the prizes that were about to fall out of my arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine with just this much. Where do you want to go next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I decide again? Kiritani-kun, you can tell me where you want to go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. I don&#8217;t have a specific place I’m interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? Then I&#8217;ll decide&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase scampered around.</p>
<p>It was almost time for our play, so I guess the next one would be our last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun! Let&#8217;s go there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase pointed to an empty classroom where the photography club was taking a commemorative photo.</p>
<p>Apparently, the photography club would take pictures of the customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our last Seiran Festival, so let&#8217;s take a picture together as a memorial!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? We&#8217;re taking a picture together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You don&#8217;t want to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s decided!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase hummed in a good mood as she said this.</p>
<p>It is true that this is our last festival, so it is better to make some memories.</p>
<p>The previous two Seiran Festivals were not so memorable&#8230;</p>
<p>With this in mind, we entered the classroom where the photography club was taking pictures.</p>

<p>The interior was rather authentic.</p>
<p>They had all the tools for taking pictures, including a reflector, and the camera they used was a single-lens reflex camera.</p>
<p>I felt like I was in a photo studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are costumes over there, so please change into the clothes you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A male student from the photography club showed us a hanger rack with a variety of cosplay costumes.</p>
<p>There are cheerleading outfits, Chinese outfits, Japanese outfits&#8230; really a lot of different costumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one do you want, Kiritani-kun? A cheerleader outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it looks fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just plain awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think I am&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;But since we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s wear the same clothes. Let&#8217;s take a picture together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please! Nanase asked with both hands clasped in front of her.</p>
<p>That being said, the cheerleading outfit is indeed&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, even if you refuse, I&#8217;ll force you to wear it. You guys in the photography club! Please dress this person in a cheerleading outfit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh! What are you talking about!? Also, why are the photography club members so motivated to come over here!? No, stop it!&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, despite my resistance, I was surrounded by people from the photography club and forced to wear a cheerleading outfit.</p>
<p>This is the worst&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through a lot&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, Nanase and the members of the photography club made me change into various outfits, including Chinese clothes and spy outfits, and then took pictures of me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I was photographed with Nanase in all of them&#8230;</p>
<p>By the way, both Nanase and I were back in our school uniforms now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun, you were pretty excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you still say that after seeing my face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so angry. But I had fun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! I-I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If Nanase enjoyed it, so be it.</p>
<p>That was why I was going around the Seiran Festival with her in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, would you like me to take one more picture for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the two of us were talking, a member of the photography club asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are not so many people now, so we can take at least one more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase&#8217;s beautiful eyes sparked as she thought about what kind of photo she would like to have taken next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you take a picture of us in our uniform then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>The photography member nodded in response to Nanase&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>After that, the photography club members start preparing for the shoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, why our uniform?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d have them take a picture of me as myself at the end anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase pointed to her trademark white parka.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re going to take a picture with me, right, Kiritani-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I waited for a while, a member of the photography club called out to us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to start taking the pictures now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The member of the photography club was holding a single-lens reflex camera. The other members of the club were also holding reflectors and shining lights. The shooting location was the same as before, in front of the blackboard in the classroom.</p>
<p>By the way, the blackboard was hidden by a cloth acting as the background.</p>
<p>Then Nanase suddenly raised her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me. Can I take this one off in the back?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to the background cloth covering the blackboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you take it off, you won&#8217;t be able to change the background on the computer later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I want the background to be the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked the members of the photography club to do it again.</p>
<p>They agreed and immediately took the cloth for the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re wearing uniforms. A classroom would be a better background.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re right&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, I wouldn&#8217;t normally go to the trouble of taking off a piece of cloth for the background. That&#8217;s Nanase for you.</p>
<p>After that, she wrote on the blackboard, &#8220;Seiran Festival is the best!&#8221; on the blackboard and drew some cute characters that I couldn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>We got permission from the photo club to do this too, but I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will start shooting, so please pose as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, at last, the shooting began.</p>
<p>Nothing weird will happen any more.</p>
<p>I was thinking that, but when I looked next to me, I saw Nanase in a strange pose.</p>
<p>The left hand is near the front of her head like a peace sign, and the right hand is behind her head like an okay sign, a pose I&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nanase, what&#8217;s that pose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an original pose that I came up with!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about it? Isn&#8217;t it cute?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked confidently.</p>
<p>When I first saw this pose, I thought what the heck is this pose, but when I took a closer look, I realized it really was cute.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I played Juliet, I would have used this pose in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the play is there a pose like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Could it be the famous &#8220;Oh, Romeo&#8230;&#8221; part?</p>
<p>No, no, no, if she posed like that, it would ruin the play.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Kiritani-kun, let&#8217;s do this pose together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!? Me too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Let&#8217;s take a picture together in the same pose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you even want to pose for&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so uncomfortable. It&#8217;ll be fun. Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase brought her face closer to mine with eyes full of anticipation.</p>
<p>A moment later, my heart started to beat faster and faster.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say no to a face like this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I get it. I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really! You&#8217;re doing it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase was excitedly happy. It wasn’t fair at all.</p>
<p>Then Nanase taught me how to use her mysterious pose.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we made the photography club wait for us, but they didn&#8217;t even look unhappy.</p>
<p>The photography club is too kind, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take some pictures then.&#8221;</p>
<p>A member of the photography club took the SLR camera and started snapping pictures.</p>
<p>We posed in a strange pose, and it was quite hard to stay still in an unfamiliar position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun, are you posing properly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m doing fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing my best to keep my pose intact, so don&#8217;t talk to me.</p>
<p>After a few more pictures were taken, the photo shoot was finally over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to print out the photos now, so please wait over there for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these instructions, we went to the waiting area, while the photography club members went to the corner of the classroom where there were laptops and printing machines.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the pictures turned out good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, they are the photography club, so I&#8217;m sure it will be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad you did that pose with me, Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter if we pose together or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when I did that for the group photo, no one did it with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t do that for a group photo.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, did you do the mysterious pose even then?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the only one who&#8217;s posing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting. Your picture is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a member of the photography club called out to us.</p>
<p>I was surprised. The photos came out fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>
<p>The member of the photography club held out a photo of us and Nanase took it.</p>
<p>Next, we left the classroom for a while so as not to disturb the other students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, this is for you, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T-Thank you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I received the photo from Nanase in the hallway and immediately checked it out.</p>
<p>It was me and Nanase in the exact same strange pose.</p>
<p>It was a funny picture, but I think it turned out good.</p>
<p>The picture was also quite beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good! But I think Kiritani-kun&#8217;s pose is not quite there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? It&#8217;s perfect no matter how you look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not perfect at all~, like the position of your left hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The position of my left hand? I don&#8217;t need to be told all those details&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad I could make good memories with you, Kiritani-kun! Aren&#8217;t you glad you made memories with me, Kiritani-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked with a grin and a teasing tone.</p>
<p>The way you&#8217;re saying it, you&#8217;re trying to get me to only say yes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;I&#8217;m glad you got to make memories with Nanase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! It was great!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase looked very happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll treasure this photo, so don&#8217;t lose it either, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t lose it&#8230;maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! You just said &#8216;maybe&#8217; !&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! I&#8217;ll make sure I never lose it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Then I forgive you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said in a deliberately pompous tone.</p>
<p>What the heck was I even forgiven for&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, it&#8217;s time for the class play, let&#8217;s go back to class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, is it that time already?&#8221;</p>
<p>I checked my phone and sure enough, it was almost time for the class play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, umm&#8230;can I ask you one question before we go back to the classroom?</p>
<p>&#8220;? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; Did you enjoy going around the Seiran Festival with me today?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Nanase, a little at a loss for words.</p>
<p>She smiled prettily at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I enjoyed it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! I-I see. I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could entertain Nanase, but at least I seemed to have gotten a good score.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;m going to work hard on the play. Although, Kiritani-kun and I will only be carrying the props for the show!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but we&#8217;ll do our best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah! I&#8217;ll carry a lot of props with you, Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to carry a lot, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase was smiling as she talked with me like this.</p>
<p>From her looks, she doesn&#8217;t seem to be dwelling on the audition anymore. That was good.</p>
<p>After that, we talked about what was interesting about the Seiran Festival and headed to class.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After returning to the classroom. We, the third year A class, had the performers change into their costumes, and the people in charge of the props moved them to the gym.</p>
<p>Once in the gymnasium, we went backstage to put the props down and wait for the other class to finish their play before us.</p>
<p>As soon as that was over, our class&#8217;s performance of &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221; would begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki, you&#8217;re the lead, so do your best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know. You&#8217;re the star too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Backstage, Akutsu encouraged her and Ayase replied with a grunt.</p>
<p>Ayase, who was playing Juliet, wore a glittering dress, while Akutsu, who was playing Romeo, wore an aristocratic costume.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, the reason Akutsu was poking Nanase was probably for the sake of his childhood friend Ayase. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it was a good thing to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki-chan, the costume looks great on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I think so too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Atsushi looks good in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, don&#8217;t praise me every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ayase group&#8217;s cronies — Takahashi, Tachibana and Suzuki — have joined in, and the five of them are having a lively conversation. They&#8217;re a noisy bunch, even before the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>A voice suddenly called out from behind me.</p>
<p>When I turned around, I saw Nanase wearing the same school gym uniform as me.</p>
<p>The props crew all wore the same outfit to make it easier to move the props around during the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun, if I wasn&#8217;t here, you&#8217;d be by yourself all the time, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you suddenly talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve been observing Kiritani-kun for a while now, and I noticed that you&#8217;re always alone and absent-minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C-Come on! Don&#8217;t observe other people&#8217;s embarrassing sides!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I panicked, Nanase chuckled.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy making fun of others that much? goodness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys are really good friends after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ayase approached me and poked me, just like she did sometime ago.</p>
<p>Akutsu, on the other hand, is talking with his other cronies.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you afford to get involved with us before the show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, shut up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase looked frustrated with Nanase, who didn&#8217;t seem to move at all.</p>
<p>But I thought Ayase was going to continue her attack, but she didn&#8217;t say anything more.</p>
<p>Actually, after the audition, the two of them didn&#8217;t get into too much trouble.</p>
<p>The reason is that Ayase doesn&#8217;t get involved with Nanase as much anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because she feels guilty for taking the role of Juliet over Nanase. But that&#8217;s just a guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good luck as Juliet. Don&#8217;t get shaken if you say the wrong line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! I know what I&#8217;m doing, and I&#8217;m not going to get my lines wrong in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Nanase was smiling, Ayase had a somewhat awkward expression on her face.</p>
<p>It was so strange that the two of them don&#8217;t argue when they see each other anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Saki, it&#8217;s time for us to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu came up and said.</p>
<p>When I glanced at the stage, it seemed that the class before us had finished their play.</p>
<p>It was finally our class&#8217;s turn to perform.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m in charge of the props, so I&#8217;ll only be moving the props around during the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. Thanks for the call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t get involved with Nanase before the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu then glared at Nanase and me warily.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be so hostile when we&#8217;re about to do a play together.</p>
<p>&#8230;But when I found out the whole story, I realized that Akutsu might be trying to protect his childhood friend Ayase in his own way.</p>
<p>—That&#8217;s when it happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! It&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard the panicked voice of a male student.</p>
<p>I hurriedly looked over and to my surprise, I saw that the props for the backdrop building, which was four times my height, had fallen over.</p>
<p>And it was headed in the direction of me, Nanase, Akutsu and Ayase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch out! It&#8217;s dangerous!&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu and I shouted as quickly as we could.</p>
<p>I fall down to push Nanase out of the way so that we both don&#8217;t fall underneath.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, a loud bang could be heard! And with a loud bang, the backdrop props fell over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; Nanase, are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m fine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked her as I collapsed, and she replied that she was.</p>
<p>I got up and took a look at her, she seemed to be in good shape with no injuries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad. I was wondering what I would do if she had broken a bone or had a big scar or something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. You were really cool, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase smiled and thanked me.</p>
<p>I averted my face slightly and said something back.</p>
<p>I wasn’t used to being told I&#8217;m cool, so I was embarrassed by what she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki! Are you okay!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard Akutsu&#8217;s panicked voice.</p>
<p>Ayase was by his side.</p>
<p>It seemed that Akutsu protected her and neither of them were trapped underneath, but there was something wrong with Ayase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase was sitting on the floor, holding her feet.</p>
<p>She was in such a state of pain that her face was contorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not good, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it looks bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What should we do&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ayase group&#8217;s cronies were also worried about her condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get her to the infirmary right away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Atsushi, calm down. I&#8217;m totally fine like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase said that and tried to stand up.</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shouted and immediately fell to the floor.</p>
<p>Seeing that she couldn&#8217;t get up, I think she has at least sprained her ankle.</p>
<p>To be honest, acting in such a state was not very possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t strain yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu called out in concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up. What will happen to the play if I go to the infirmary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to leave that to someone else!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do that! How many lines do you think I have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase pointed out, and Akutsu stammered.</p>
<p>Juliet is the main character in Romeo and Juliet. Naturally she has a lot of scenes and lines.</p>
<p>There is no one who has it all figured out except Ayase as Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody! Is there anyone who can play the role of Juliet instead of Saki?&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu still asked his classmates around him.</p>
<p>But they all looked away from Akutsu and didn&#8217;t answer anything.</p>
<p>Of course. No one wants to be embarrassed on stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I am the only one who can play Juliet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But with that foot&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed that Akutsu really didn&#8217;t want Ayase to appear on stage.</p>
<p>He was thinking of his childhood friend and I saw how much he cared for her.</p>
<p>There was a sense of unease in the air around them.</p>
<p>Everyone was wondering if the play itself would become impossible.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;ll be Juliet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, it was Nanase who raised her hand.</p>
<p>But I was not that surprised at that time.</p>
<p>I was sure Nanase would offer to play Juliet instead of Ayase.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s who she is.</p>
<p>Besides, Nanase had already auditioned for the role, and she was an active member of the theater company, so even if she had to play Juliet now, she could do it with no problem at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rena, you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase sat down and gave her a look of disgust.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t want to give up the role to Nanase because of her past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see her play Juliet too, if possible, but I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s got the foot for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, I guess you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, I&#8217;ll play Juliet. Saki doesn&#8217;t want to ruin the play itself, does she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked, but Ayase did not answer.</p>
<p>Because if she answered that, the role of Juliet would be completely handed over to Nanase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! I&#8217;ll play the best Juliet for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Nanase squeezed Ayase&#8217;s right hand as if to reassure her.</p>
<p>Ayase was a little surprised by this, and then gave a small sigh of resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Okay, okay. I&#8217;ll give the role of Juliet to Rena.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! Thank you, Saki!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase thanked her, and Ayase shook her head from side to side.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t a fair audition in the first place, so it was right for Rena to play Juliet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, that was a cowardly thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase apologized apologetically.</p>
<p>So, I guess she knew when she ran for the audition that she would win regardless of her performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? I don&#8217;t care at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rena&#8230; Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase looked like she was going to cry a little at that moment.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Ayase may have felt quite guilty about being chosen to play Juliet even though her skills were inferior to Nanase&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Her personality and her eyes are harsh, but as her crony Tachibana once said, she may not be that bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for Saki&#8217;s foot injury, but when I take you to the nurse&#8217;s office, I need you to change your outfit for my gym clothes! Are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayase gave a small nod in response to Nanase&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Akutsu-kun, tell all your classmates to start the play first. I&#8217;ll be done changing by the time Juliet comes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Nanase instructed Akutsu, he looked a little surprised.</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t fight back like he usually did.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-Okay. All right! Let&#8217;s get ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>With Akutsu&#8217;s words, each of his classmates began to prepare.</p>
<p>I have to move the props too!</p>
<p>But before that, I have to&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I called out, Nanase responded puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;U-Umm&#8230; good luck with your performance!&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, stumbling over my words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! I&#8217;ll play it perfectly and flawlessly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase smiled and gave me a peace sign.</p>
<p>Although, perfect and flawless both mean the same thing&#8230;</p>
<p>But Nanase&#8217;s dignified appearance made me feel refreshed again.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s lost. I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m not here. This is not Romeo anymore. Romeo is somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the stage. The play had already started, and Akutsu was playing Romeo with passion.</p>
<p>I was surprised. Akutsu was apparently a good actor.</p>
<p>During the preparation period, I had been working hard on the props, so I was watching his performance for the first time.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s good at sports, good at acting, and even better looking. His specs are so high, it&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p>&#8220;But still, Nanase is late.&#8221;</p>
<p>After taking Ayase to the infirmary, Nanase had not returned.</p>
<p>Well, it seemed that in the infirmary, Ayase gave her a Juliet costume to change into, so it might take some time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is it going to be fine?&#8221;</p>
<p>I muttered to myself as I checked on the progress of the play, trying to dispel the anxiety in me.</p>
<p>After that, the play proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>Akutsu continued to play Romeo properly the whole time.</p>
<p>Thanks to him, the audience responded well, and it would have been perfect if Nanase had come&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Still not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just reached the scene before Juliet&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>And yet Nanase still hadn&#8217;t arrived.</p>
<p>Is it really okay?</p>
<p>If she doesn&#8217;t come, it&#8217;ll be Romeo and Juliet without Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Nanase hasn&#8217;t come yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What should we do? It&#8217;s not good if it continues like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anxiety began to spread among the classmates backstage.</p>
<p>This wasn’t good. Someone had to organize the classmates.</p>
<p>But Nanase and Ayase, who were good at that kind of thing, were in the infirmary and Akutsu was on the stage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no one to organize the classmates here.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t just leave my classmates like this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Nanase were here, I&#8217;m sure she would be able to organize her classmates well.</p>
<p>Then I guess I&#8217;ll just have to&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mutter to myself to calm down.</p>
<p>And then, after a few breaths&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, guys&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry for the wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later, Nanase appeared in a hurry.</p>
<p>The moment she arrived, the air around us was filled with relief.</p>
<p>I was surprised because she came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8230;but it was good. She made it in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, you&#8217;re back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she returned, Nanase was wearing the same beautiful dress that Ayase had worn earlier.</p>
<p>When she, who is usually a noisy person, wears such a graceful dress, it creates a gap, in a good way, and to be honest, it looks good on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like it? Do you think it&#8217;s pretty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; Y-Yeah. I think it&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re blushing~.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I am not! You made me say it in the first place!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I hurriedly replied, Nanase laughed amusedly.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t tease me when we don&#8217;t have the time for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Nanase&#8217;s expression turned serious.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if some kind of switch has been turned on.</p>
<p>The scene that Akutsu and the other students were playing now ended, and the scene went dark.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the props were replaced for the next scene, and the stage was lit again.</p>
<p>The girls who played the roles of Lady Capulet and the nanny appeared on stage.</p>
<p>In the middle of their interaction, it was finally Juliet&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, umm&#8230; good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! I&#8217;ll do my best!&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase waved to us as we sent her an ale.</p>
<p>The schoolgirl playing the nanny called Juliet, and Nanase went out onto the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter? Who wants to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase appeared gracefully as she spoke her lines.</p>
<p>The way she acted, she really looked like a young lady from a noble family.</p>
<p>After that, Nanase continued to perform in a way that set her apart from the other students, and finished the first scene without incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, welcome back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back, Kiritani-kun, we did this before, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase laughed and gave me a tsukkomi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Kiritani-kun, did you fall in love with my acting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s with you suddenly? Well, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, you&#8217;re being so flippant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to be flippant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in love with Nanase&#8217;s acting for a long time.</p>
<p>This is because her acting is filled with her passion.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have that kind of love yet, so when I watch Nanase&#8217;s acting, I can honestly respect her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, good luck in the next scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on it! I&#8217;ll make Kiritani-kun fall in love with it even more!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase jokingly closed one eye and winked at me cutely.</p>
<p>Then, when Juliet&#8217;s turn came again, Nanase went to the stage.</p>
<p>When the performance was over, she went backstage again.</p>
<p>This is how Nanase continued to play Juliet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Romeo! Romeo! Where are you Romeo?&#8221;</p>
<p>A famous scene where Juliet laments her fate with Romeo on the balcony.</p>
<p>The audience was mesmerized by her voice and her overwhelming acting ability that echoed everywhere in the auditorium.</p>
<p>I thought again that Nanase&#8217;s acting had the power to move people&#8217;s hearts.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s because she loves acting from the bottom of her heart that she can accomplish this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I envy her&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but spill out again.</p>
<p>I wish I could be like that.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know why I felt so strongly about it at this time.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After Ayase&#8217;s accidental injury, our play went on without a hitch.</p>
<p>Everyone thought that the story would probably end the same way.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, another problem arose towards the end of the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221;</p>
<p>The stage went dark, and Akutsu, who had returned backstage, suddenly shouted and collapsed.</p>
<p>He was holding his leg as Ayase had done earlier.</p>
<p>He must have hurt his leg the same way she did when he tried to help Ayase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Akutsu-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase ran up to Akutsu in a panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up. I&#8217;m fine like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he said this, Akutsu seemed unable to stand up.</p>
<p>It seemed that until now he had been forcing himself to act while enduring the pain.</p>
<p>But now it seemed that he had reached his limit.</p>
<p>Worried about Akutsu, his cronies, Takahashi, Suzuki, and Tachibana, came over to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not okay at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, take it easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s not&#8230; good to push yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three of them told Akutsu with anxious expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, I guess Akutsu is trustworthy after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not going to happen. I&#8217;m gonna be on soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu tried to stand up again, but he collapsed in the middle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Akutsu-kun, let&#8217;s get someone else to play the role.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Nanase who said that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we don&#8217;t, the play will be canceled. Are you okay with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu was at a loss for words when Nanase asked him a serious question.</p>
<p>As expected, he wouldn&#8217;t want to cancel his last play in high school.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;but who&#8217;s going to take my place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask everyone like you did with Saki.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase replied, and turned around to face her classmates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anyone here who can play Romeo instead of Akutsu-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked, but no one came forward.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;yes, I&#8217;ll do it&#8221; like Nanase did when asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the end of the story and Romeo only has one more scene. I don&#8217;t have that many lines. I&#8217;ll be there for the next scene, and if you forget your lines, I&#8217;ll make sure they&#8217;re covered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase wanted to find a student to play the role of Romeo, but no one wanted to do it.</p>
<p>If we keep goofing around, Romeo&#8217;s turn will come.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If it was me before, I would never have come forward at a place like this.</p>
<p>&#8230;Even when I met Nanase, saw her continue to be herself, and admired her.</p>
<p>If it was Nanase in a scene like this, she would play the role of Romeo even though she is a girl.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, I want to try my best too.</p>
<p>Then&#8230; I might be able to get a little closer to Nanase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; I&#8217;ll play Romeo.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I raised my hand and said it, all of my classmates&#8217; eyes turned to me.</p>
<p>And they all looked at me like, &#8220;You&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you play the role of Romeo?&#8221;</p>
<p>If anything, Akutsu asked me directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Well, umm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why am I being stared at just because I said I&#8217;d take over for him?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to prevent the play from being cancelled&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Akutsu-kun. Kiritani-kun will be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase followed up on me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Kiritani-kun, he remembers Romeo&#8217;s lines reasonably well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, when I was auditioning for the role of Juliet, he accompanied me to practice as the role of Romeo.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s okay, Nanase told Akutsu.</p>
<p>Next, Akutsu stared at me suspiciously.</p>
<p>His face is close and scary&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Okay. I&#8217;ll leave it to you, Kirishima.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Kiritani&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This man, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>You just heard Nanase call my name earlier.</p>
<p>Then I hurriedly changed clothes with Akutsu in a corner backstage and put on the Romeo costume.</p>
<p>It was a little big, but it wasn&#8217;t too big to worry about, so I didn&#8217;t think it would be a problem.</p>
<p>Now that I was ready, all I had to do was go out on stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that Kiritani-kun would play the role of Romeo.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Nanase approached me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Was it because I was playing Romeo for Nanase&#8217;s practice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of it, but I also thought that you might be able to do it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase&#8217;s words made me irresistibly happy.</p>
<p>I felt a little bit recognized by her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got some people waiting, so let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase looked at the stage and then smiled at me as if to reassure me.</p>
<p>The stage was still dark as before.</p>
<p>The audience has already been informed by the narration that the show has been interrupted by an accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s work together! I&#8217;ll cover you if you forget your lines!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do your lines for you, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to mess up the play&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>But I knew that if it was Nanase, she would do it.</p>
<p>She does crazy things, but it&#8217;s usually to help someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I remember my lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? That&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, so let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase and I walked to the stage together.</p>
<p>As we arrived at each other&#8217;s position, a number of lights came on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the lights came on, I could see a lot of people sitting in the audience in front of me.</p>
<p>At that moment, I felt a surge of tension inside me.</p>
<p>I had never experienced doing something in front of so many people before.</p>
<p>To be honest, the thought of failing was quite frightening.</p>
<p>If it were me before, I don&#8217;t think I would be standing on the stage as Romeo at this moment.</p>
<p>When I think about it, I&#8217;m nervous, but I&#8217;m more motivated to do my best.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Phew.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to calm my mind, I exhaled just a little.</p>
<p>The scene is at the Capulet family graveyard, where Romeo thinks that Juliet, who is temporarily dead, is really dead and commits suicide with poison.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m kneeling on the ground, holding Nanase who is lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Juliet has no lines in this scene.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s suddenly my turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Juliet, why are you still so beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure my performance was average or worse.</p>
<p>Much worse than Nanase or even Akutsu.</p>
<p>Even so, I felt a sense of elation that I had never experienced before.</p>
<p>So I continued to say my long lines without making any mistakes.</p>
<p>Eventually, the nervousness I had felt when I walked onto the stage gradually faded away and I began to enjoy myself.</p>
<p>I wondered if Nanase was feeling this way when she was acting.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, for the love of my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>After finishing my last line, I tried to take a poison pill.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s a poison pill, it&#8217;s a fake&#8230;</p>
<p>Romeo is now dead, and my part in the story is over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad&#8230; I managed to get through it.</p>
<p>It was a moment of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Romeo&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>To my surprise, Juliet — Nanase, who was being held by me, got up.</p>
<p>&#8230;Eh, what are you doing?</p>
<p>&#8220;Romeo! You&#8217;re Romeo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase takes both my hands in hers and acts touched.</p>
<p>I was confused.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of doing this before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ju-Juliet. You&#8217;re Juliet. I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re still alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to act like it, but I mumbled my lines, my tone was weird and everything was messed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Romeo! Come with me and run far away! Somewhere far away, where there is no Capulet or Montague! And let us be happy together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Nanase stood up and held out her hand to me.</p>
<p>The sudden improvisation took me by surprise.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the sudden improvisation, but I was so fascinated by her performance that I naturally said the following line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Let&#8217;s do it! Let&#8217;s be happy together!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I returned, Nanase showed a happy expression.</p>
<p>I-I&#8217;ve managed to get through&#8230;?</p>
<p>My relief was short-lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, will you please pose for the vows with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>A new line came from Nanase.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a pose for the vow?</p>
<p>&#8220;A-A vow pose&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! This is the vow pose!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase put her left hand near the front of her head like a peace sign, and her right hand behind her head like an okay sign — it was that strange pose.</p>
<p>By the way, I remembered her saying she wanted to include this pose in Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s really going for it, this girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for the two of us to be happy together! Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase hurries me along, still in her mysterious pose.</p>
<p>You want me to do that? And in such a theatrical play.</p>
<p>When I glanced at the audience, I saw that they all had a look on their faces like, &#8220;What the hell is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t want to do it at all&#8230; but I have to if I want to move forward with the play!</p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00013.jpeg"></img>

<p>After making up my mind to do so, I took the plunge and struck a wonderful pose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Romeo! Now we can both be happy together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase was acting like she was about to cry when she saw my wonder pose while maintaining her wonder pose. No, I don&#8217;t understand&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, for some reason, I can hear the audience crackling with applause. &#8230;It&#8217;s already a mess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Romeo! Let&#8217;s go with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Nanase smiled and held out her hand to me.</p>
<p>That smile seemed to say, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing her like that, I couldn&#8217;t help but smile too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Juliet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I grabbed Nanase&#8217;s hand and we left, still holding hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Juliet woke up.&#8221; &#8220;What a turn of events.&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect this.&#8221; &#8220;It would be a pity if Romeo died.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s good that it&#8217;s funny.&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s with the pose at the end?&#8221; &#8220;That was cute, that pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The audience was in an uproar as the story took a completely different turn from the original.</p>
<p>If anything, when we returned backstage, my classmates&#8217; faces had turned pale.</p>
<p>Seeing them, I laughed a little, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve been influenced by Nanase in no small way.</p>
<p>When I looked next to her, Nanase was laughing as well.</p>

<p>After that, due to Nanase&#8217;s unbelievable ad-libs, the scene where Juliet killed herself with a dagger was suddenly lost, and many other things happened, but we managed to bring the play to a close.</p>
<p>　<br />
Thanks to this, our &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221; ended up as a comedy, not a tragedy, even though it turned out to be a mess.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Backstage, while we were preparing for the curtain call.</p>
<p>I asked Nanase.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you before. I told you before that I don&#8217;t like bad endings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to do something like that on stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing we made it to the end. It almost turned out to be a disaster.</p>
<p>By the way, my classmates didn&#8217;t complain about Nanase because the audience&#8217;s reaction was very good, and some of them even said that Nanase made the play the best it could have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I thought it would definitely be more interesting to have a happy ending!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase gave me a big smile.</p>
<p>I thought it was funny, so I turned the ending of Romeo and Juliet from a tragedy to a comedy.</p>
<p>I thought it was a very typical idea of hers.</p>
<p>And even though I was complaining about this and that, I actually envied her for being able to do such a thing, and thought that I could never do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about that original pose? I don&#8217;t know if you would need that in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, wasn&#8217;t it fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an unfair reaction&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Kiritani.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard my name called. It was Akutsu. This time, he called me by my real name.</p>
<p>&#8230;but on the other hand, it&#8217;s scary. I can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;m being glared at.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;W-What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked fearfully, thinking that he would get angry.</p>
<p>But Akutsu scratched the back of his head, looking a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm, thanks for playing Romeo. I think I made fun of you a few times in the past. &#8230;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, y-yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Akutsu apologized to me. What the hell kind of change of heart is that?</p>
<p>I wondered if it was a good thing that I had replaced him as Romeo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, Nanase, I&#8217;m sorry for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind at all~! I mean, you can come at me anytime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fu, I see. Then I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akutsu replied to Nanase&#8217;s deliberate provocation with a smile.</p>
<p>Then Akutsu went back to the place where his usual cronies were.</p>
<p>Ayase was there, on crutches.</p>
<p>She hadn&#8217;t been to the hospital yet, but was planning to go there after the curtain call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun, it&#8217;s starting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase told me.</p>
<p>It was time for the curtain call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go! Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase called me, and I walked up to the stage with the other classmates.</p>
<p>Then, in front of the stage — a large audience stood up to welcome us.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was great!&#8221; &#8220;That last part was amazing!&#8221; That was a good Romeo and Juliet!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;d like to try that pose.&#8221; &#8220;I want to see it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>One after another, the audience gave us words of praise like that.</p>
<p>The sight made my heart beat faster than it had ever beat in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curtain calls are great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase, standing next to me, muttered.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s in a theater troupe, so she always gets a taste of this.</p>
<p>Most of the cheers at the curtain call were created by Nanase.</p>
<p>Of course, our classmates worked hard together, but I think the audience was moved because she changed the ending of &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase is amazing after all&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I muttered to myself as I waved my hand to the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Did you just say something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked me as she turned her gaze to the audience.</p>
<p>I thought about repeating what I had just said, but there was one thing I wanted to tell her more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Nanase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Kiritani-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase glanced at me.</p>
<p>And then I—</p>

<p>“I want to have a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I was cheered by the crowd, I thought to myself, &#8220;I want to be like Nanase, someone who can move people.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I wanted to have a dream to become such a person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all Nanase said, but she smiled happily.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>A week has passed since the Seiran Festival. It was almost time for summer vacation.</p>
<p>I was thinking about my dream.</p>
<p>What kind of dream is good for me? What do I want to do in the future?</p>
<p>What do I like? What am I suited for?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this and that, but I can&#8217;t seem to come up with anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Haa, what should I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before my morning homeroom. I muttered with a sigh as I sat in my seat in the classroom.</p>
<p>I know that dreams are not something that can be decided easily, but I feel like I&#8217;ll never be able to have one if I don&#8217;t change my mindset.</p>
<p>In the first place, I&#8217;ve been living a boring life, so I&#8217;ve never seriously thought about what I like, and I have nothing that can lead to a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you looking so gloomy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly Nanase called out to me and even peered into my face.</p>
<p>Then her beautiful face was right under my nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Startled, I quickly moved away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s rude. Do you hate me that much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that, but anyone would be surprised if you came out of nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to this, my heart has been beating wildly since a while ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that reaction is still hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase mimicked crying, while also adding a gesture of sobbing.</p>
<p>What a lousy performance for an actor.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, why are you looking so gloomy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t look like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned my head away and answered.</p>
<p>It could be a good idea to talk to Nanase about my dreams, but I didn&#8217;t want to do that.</p>
<p>I want to find my own dream on my own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh~You definitely had a gloomy look on your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though I kept denying it, Nanase was not convinced at all.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to change the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, you don&#8217;t argue with Ayase and the others anymore, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, Saki and Akutsu-kun don&#8217;t come at me anymore&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said happily.</p>
<p>After the Seiran Festival, Ayase and Nanase never caused any trouble.</p>
<p>In fact, Ayase sometimes talks to Nanase and laughs with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably because Nanase played Juliet instead of Ayase at the Seiran Festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe so. &#8230;But if you say so, Kiritani also played Romeo instead of Akutsu. Did you get along with Akutsu-kun after that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, well yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>After the Seiran Festival, Akutsu stopped glaring at me and even greeted me once in a while.</p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t chat or laugh, and if you ask me if we are close, it&#8217;s a fine line.</p>
<p>However, I feel that this level of distance is just right for me, and I&#8217;m sure Akutsu feels the same way.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Kiritani-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you look so gloomy just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That again!?</p>
<p>As if something had stuck, Nanase asked the same question again as before.</p>
<p>But I kept saying that I didn&#8217;t have a gloomy face and that it was nothing.</p>
<p>This girl has a keen intuition!</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was second period gym class. We were playing soccer together with Shuuichi&#8217;s class.</p>
<p>I was participating in a mini-game, but I kicked at the ball as hard as I could when it was passed to me, and then I fell backwards really hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oww, I hit my hip&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kakeru, are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was holding my waist alone when I heard a brisk voice above me.</p>
<p>I looked up to see Shuuichi in his gym uniform holding out his hand to me.</p>
<p>He was a member of the enemy team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, you&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this exchange, Shuuichi helped me to sit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could Kakeru, who is so good at everything, from studying to sports, miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. What do you mean by &#8216;good at everything&#8217;? You&#8217;re making fun of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, that&#8217;s the best compliment I could give you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Shuuichi was grinning at me. So you&#8217;re making fun of me after all&#8230;</p>
<p>While we were exchanging such nonsense, the whistle sounded to end the game.</p>
<p>The team I was on had lost badly.</p>
<p>After the game was over, Shuuichi&#8217;s team and mine had a break.</p>
<p>This time, we sat on a bench on the field while the other teams were playing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi asked from next to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you asking me that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been acting strangely all game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah? I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think so. I can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi assured me and continued to ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s bothering you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer that question.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to talk about my worries about my dreams with other people.</p>
<p>But will I be able to find my dream if I just think about it alone?</p>
<p>After some hesitation, I decided to ask Shuuichi a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to be so abrupt, but do you have any dreams, Shuuichi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really sudden. My dream&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi looked a little puzzled.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try and listen to other people&#8217;s dreams. Maybe it will help me.</p>
<p>As I waited for his reply, Shuuichi gave me a surprising answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really have any dreams. I&#8217;ve never even thought about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Well, when I was little, I had dreams of being a soccer player, but that was a dream I could have had when I was little. I don&#8217;t think there are many people in high school who have a clear dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi said plainly.</p>
<p>He might be right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with Nanase over the past few months, and I&#8217;ve felt close to her, so I thought everyone had dreams.</p>
<p>If you think about it, there are not many high school students like Nanase who have dreams of becoming a Hollywood actress, joining a theater company, or something like that, and are working for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, most of them just go to college and get a job. And so do I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand what Shuuichi is saying.</p>
<p>Because not so long ago, I thought exactly the same thing as he did.</p>
<p>&#8230;But as I got to know Nanase, it seemed like such a waste to me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful thing to have a dream, and to walk through life towards that dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, I came up with an idea.</p>
<p>If the majority of high school students don&#8217;t have any dreams and just go through life without any idea.</p>
<p>It would be good if I could support them to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>I used to be like most of them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I believe I can be there for most high school students who don&#8217;t have a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? What&#8217;s up, Kakeru?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shuuichi, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seriously, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi asks in a tone that sounds like he was wondering if I had lost my mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shuuichi solved my problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously? Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to get a hat trick in the next game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi shook his head, but I was in such a high mood.</p>
<p>Then, the next game.</p>
<p>In the first ten seconds of the game, a ball kicked by the opposing team hit me directly in the face, and I was sent off the field. &#8230;I&#8217;ll never play soccer again.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I should act more flamboyantly when I say this line.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now lunchtime and I was having lunch in an empty classroom in the old school building.</p>
<p>Next to me, Nanase was checking the script of the upcoming play to be performed at &#8220;Yunagi&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since Juliet&#8217;s audition, I haven&#8217;t been helping Nanase practice her acting.</p>
<p>She no longer needs to practice after the audition, and she told me a long time ago that she doesn&#8217;t need me to help her practice for the play that &#8220;Yunagi&#8221; is performing.</p>
<p>And since my relationship with Akutsu has improved, I can have lunch in the classroom, but I still spend my lunch break in this empty classroom.</p>
<p>The reason is simply because I enjoy spending time with Nanase.</p>
<p>In addition, I have something to tell her today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, do you have a minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked a little nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea, sure~&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase happily agreed.</p>
<p>Then she put the script on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;So? Do you want me to do something for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t have a favor to ask. I have&#8230;a report to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Report&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase tilted her head.</p>
<p>But soon after, she seemed to have thought of something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be that you caught the ball with your face during soccer in PE?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it! Also, how did you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the girls had gym class on the field, too. We were doing the long jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;R-Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe they saw me looking so lame.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so embarrassed I want to die&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so you know, that&#8217;s not the report I wanted to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, on the contrary, why would you think it was?&#8221;</p>
<p>I said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Then I cleared my throat and spoke to her again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to report to you, is, umm&#8230;my dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment I said it, Nanase froze with her mouth hanging open.</p>
<p>I was worried that maybe she didn&#8217;t hear me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase suddenly congratulated me with a huge smile.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if finding a dream is something to be celebrated, but I was honestly happy to hear her say it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll ask you out of the blue, what is your dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked me excitedly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as big as hers, so I hope she doesn&#8217;t get her hopes up too high&#8230;.</p>
<p>Then I revealed my dream to Nanase.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m going to be a high school teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I told her that, Nanase looked a little surprised, and then her mouth relaxed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;High school teacher..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;U-Umm&#8230;how is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;What do you think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m satisfied with this dream, or rather&#8230;I think it&#8217;s a good fit for me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I wanted the same words from Nanase, who made me want to embrace my dreams.</p>
<p>But she—</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that. Because this is your dream, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;yeah, well, yes, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014.jpeg" alt="" width="1304" height="1853" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2459" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014.jpeg 1304w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00014-1081x1536.jpeg 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px" /></p>
<p>What Nanase is saying is correct.</p>
<p>What do you think about other people&#8217;s dreams? I don&#8217;t know what I think about other people&#8217;s dreams.</p>
<p>Still, I wish Nanase had said something to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;But whether the dream will be a good one or a bad one depends on you in the future, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said and smiled at me.</p>
<p>At least she didn&#8217;t seem to have anything negative to say about my dream.</p>
<p>Which made me feel a little more confident about my own dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why a high school teacher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase asked me curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because high school students are probably the ones who spend the most time giving up on their dreams.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I heard Shuuichi&#8217;s story, I thought.</p>
<p>Most high school students don&#8217;t have any dreams.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m sure they had dreams when they were little, too.</p>
<p>However, as they grow up little by little, they see reality and give up their dreams.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for them to have another dream after being confronted with reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, without having a dream, they just go to college and find a job.</p>
<p>I want to save those high school students.</p>
<p>Just as Nanase made me want to have a dream, I want to help others find a dream.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I want to become a high school teacher.</p>
<p>When I told Nanase why, she said,</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very nice reason!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I guess so&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I think so too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing those words, I felt a warmth in my chest.</p>

<p>To be honest, the scale of her dream was so large that I was a little worried that she would say mine was silly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to work hard then!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right. In order to become a teacher, I have to go to the University of Education, so for now, I have to study hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. &#8230;That&#8217;s tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as hard as Nanase&#8217;s, because you&#8217;re attending school and performing in a theater company.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much harder for Nanase than it is for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, Kiritani-kun. Actually&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I heard Nanase&#8217;s words, I asked her back.</p>
<p>But she stopped talking and didn&#8217;t continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked again, curious about her strange behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head from side to side.</p>
<p>&#8230;I wondered what was wrong. It&#8217;s not a big deal, is it?</p>
<p>“Better yet, let&#8217;s shake hands!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake hands? Why all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s shake hands to say good luck to each other! Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase clasped her hands together and asked for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case then sure&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Yay!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase said happily, and held out her beautiful white hands to me.</p>
<p>Next, she made eye contact with me and urged me to hold out my hand.</p>
<p>I sighed and held out my hand.</p>
<p>Nanase then squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>Her hand was soft and a little cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and Kiritani-kun are going to work hard from now on! Ooh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase suddenly said something like that.</p>
<p>No, what? Don&#8217;t suddenly do something I haven&#8217;t heard of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Kiritani-kun, say &#8216;ooh&#8217; too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, o-okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, I had to say &#8220;ooh&#8221; too.</p>
<p>Since she&#8217;s so supportive of my dream, I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to work hard! Ooh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;What the heck is this? I don&#8217;t know what it means.</p>
<p>I was so confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you can become a teacher, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase gave me a shout of encouragement and laughed at me.</p>
<p>She always gives me courage in the most important places, doesn&#8217;t she?</p>
<p>&#8220;You too, Nanase, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll become a Hollywood actress.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015.jpeg" alt="" width="1257" height="1786" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2460" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015.jpeg 1257w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00015-1081x1536.jpeg 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px" /></p>
<p>I also gave Nanase a shout out like that.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, I believe she can become a Hollywood actress.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if she can&#8217;t become a Hollywood actress, who can?</p>
<p>And from that day on, I started studying hard to get into the University of Education.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;Onii-chan!&#8221;</p>
<p>One day in the morning. Momoka&#8217;s loud voice could be heard from outside the room.</p>
<p>Footsteps that were just as loud came closer and closer, and the door opened with a bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan! It&#8217;s time to go to school! How long have you been asleep?</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Momoka.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I was changing into my uniform and making myself presentable in the room, Momoka was standing near the door, stunned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momoka, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong is my line! I didn&#8217;t expect my brother to wake up so early. It&#8217;s been a week in a row.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing, isn’t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but it&#8217;s definitely not right. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Momoka&#8217;s question made me think for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I had to guess, I&#8217;d say I found my dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan&#8217;s starting to go insane. He&#8217;s broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not broken. You&#8217;re a terrible sister&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>While I was having this conversation with my sister, I finished making myself presentable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, Onii-chan is going. Lock up the house, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Are you going to school already?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have to study in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Momoka was incredulous when she heard my words.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re so rude, my sister.</p>
<p>After I told Nanase about my dream, I started going to school every day and doubled my study time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also planning to attend a summer course at a cram school during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>To be honest, studying was hard, but it wasn&#8217;t so hard when I thought I was working towards my dream.</p>
<p>I wondered if Nanase felt this way when she was practicing her acting.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, she seems to be working hard at the theater too.</p>
<p>The other day she told me she was given the lead role.</p>
<p>Since Nanase is working so hard, I should work just as hard, if not harder.</p>
<p>We both must make our dreams come true.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I spent many days working hard to make my dream come true.</p>
<p>I went to school early in the morning to study, and after school I went home and began to study right away.</p>
<p>During long vacations, I spent the entire day studying at a cram school.</p>
<p>As I kept repeating this routine, summer passed in a flash, autumn came, autumn also passed quickly, and then winter came.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, I was a little nervous, but not so much that it affected the exam.</p>
<p>I believed that if I could show what I had accumulated so far, it would definitely lead to a result.</p>
<p>I finished the exam without any problems, and now all I had to do was wait for the announcement of my acceptance.</p>
<p>My parents and Momoka were freaking out until the announcement was made, but I was strangely calm.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I thought I would definitely be accepted.</p>
<p>But I had worked so hard that I didn&#8217;t have any regrets, so I guess somewhere I knew I would be okay.</p>
<p>Then came the day of the University of Education&#8217;s acceptance announcement.</p>
<p>The numbers of those who had passed the entrance exam were posted on the bulletin board amidst a large crowd of examinees.</p>
<p>At that time, I was alone and checked the numbers one by one.</p>
<p>When I saw the number in the middle of the board, I took a deep breath.</p>

<p>—I had been accepted.</p>

<p>The moment I found out, I was relieved rather than impressed.</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;Now I&#8217;m much closer to my dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I passed the exam, I looked for a place to live on my own since the university was located in a place that I couldn&#8217;t commute to from home, arranged the furniture I would use, and occasionally relaxed at home.</p>
<p>And so the months went by, and the graduation ceremony came for us third-year students.</p>
