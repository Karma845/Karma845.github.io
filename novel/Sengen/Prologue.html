<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>What are your dreams for the future?</p>

<p>I wonder how many people can answer this question immediately.</p>
<p>If the respondents were kindergarteners or elementary school students, they might all be able to answer immediately.</p>
<p>That’s because&#8230; children are full of hope.</p>
<p>Someone somewhere once said that a child can become anything they want to be, and I think that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>When I was little, I used to say, &#8220;I want to be a professional soccer player!&#8221;</p>
<p>But now, I can&#8217;t even juggle a soccer ball with my feet.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more I understand.</p>
<p><em>Most people can&#8217;t achieve their dreams even if they have one.</em></p>
<p>In fact, no matter how hard I try from now on as a high school student, I will never be a professional soccer player.</p>
<p>I eventually came to realize this.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll just go to college, become a salaried employee at a regular company, find someone I like, and if I&#8217;m lucky, we&#8217;ll get together, marry, and have kids&#8230; I wondered if I could have a normal life like that.</p>
<p>Just so you know, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want a normal life.</p>
<p>Rather, I thought that I would be happy enough if I could live a normal life, and that I wouldn’t deviate from such a life unless something drastic happened to me.</p>

<p>However, it was the last spring of high school.</p>
<p>My life would change drastically when I met her, a girl who did all kinds of absurd and unreasonable things and could not be called normal—</p>
