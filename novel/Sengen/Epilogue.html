<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s been about four years since I said goodbye to Nanase at the airport.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now a teacher, fulfilling my dream. And it&#8217;s at my alma mater, Seiran High School.</p>
<p>After entering the University of Education, I had a lot of work to do, including university exams, reports, teacher recruitment exams and a graduation thesis, but I managed to graduate and become the teacher I&#8217;ve always wanted to be.</p>
<p>By the way, my subject was Japanese history.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have been assigned as a homeroom teacher since my first year.</p>
<p>Just before school started, the teacher who was originally supposed to be in charge of the class had a car accident and had to be hospitalized for a long time.</p>
<p>So I, who had never given any class before, was assigned to be the homeroom teacher instead.</p>
<p>&#8230;By the way, I haven&#8217;t heard anything about Nanase since we parted at the airport.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s auditioning or something, but I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with her since she&#8217;s on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>But since it&#8217;s Nanase, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s working just as hard as she did in high school.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this house&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>One day after school, I was at the home of a student in my current class.</p>
<p>The student&#8217;s name is Tanaka Kenji-kun.</p>
<p>He had stopped attending school immediately after entering the school and had been withdrawn for the past two months.</p>
<p>The other teachers told me that I shouldn&#8217;t do anything unnecessary, but I forced the principal to allow me to visit him at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, who is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>I pressed the intercom and was immediately answered by someone who seemed to be Kenji-kun&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;ve asked her permission to visit her home as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me. I&#8217;m Kiritani, the homeroom teacher of Kenji-kun&#8217;s class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately after that, I couldn&#8217;t hear her voice over the intercom, and the front door opened instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;His teacher, is it? Please take care of my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. Can I talk to Kenji-kun for a moment?</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Please do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenji&#8217;s mother then led me upstairs and we arrived in front of his room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then leave the rest to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. Please take care of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenji&#8217;s mother bowed her head and went downstairs.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to see if the door would open, but it was locked.</p>
<p>Well, yes, as it should&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenji-kun. I&#8217;m the homeroom teacher for your class, my name is Kiritani Kakeru. Can I talk to you for a minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked through the door.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, I have nothing to say to a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the reply I got.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s better than getting nothing back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to force you to go to school. I just want to talk to you. So why don&#8217;t you open the door?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything to say to a teacher!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenji shouted. He really didn&#8217;t want to talk to the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll do the talking and you can listen to me from there. Is that okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reply to my question.</p>
<p>Still, I decided to start talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be a student just like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him about my high school days.</p>
<p>I told him about my high school days, how I was living a boring life, and how my life was changed by a beautiful girl who wore a parka to school every day, which was against school rules.</p>
<p>She told me that being withdrawn is not in itself a bad thing.</p>
<p>She said that even if you are withdrawn, it is important that you are able to do what you want to do and live your own life.</p>
<p>When I told him this, Kenji replied with these words.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t really know what it means to be yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said to reassure his anxious voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you, and we&#8217;ll find something that&#8217;s you together.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I became a teacher.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do anything to help my students live their own lives.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, the door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>The person who appeared was a young man with shaggy hair and tattered clothes.</p>
<p>He must be Kenji-kun. But he looks like he could be a handsome guy if he was fixed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really going to help me find myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenji-kun asked me anxiously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;m your homeroom teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered with confidence.</p>
<p>Then, in a slightly subdued voice, Kenji-kun said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; Can you come back tomorrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>I responded immediately to Kenji&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>After putting on my shoes at the entrance, I greeted Kenji-kun.</p>
<p>Kenji&#8217;s mother was not at home at the moment because she had to work urgently.</p>
<p>His parents both work and were away from home a lot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-sensei, can I ask you a question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? You can ask me anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; What kind of person is that girl in the parka who changed your life that you were talking about before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she was the most problematic kid in school and did the most crazy things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ehh!? I see&#8230; So what does she do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now? Right now, she&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words at Kenji&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>I wonder what Nanase is doing now&#8230;</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, my phone suddenly rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apologizing, I checked my phone and saw that I had received a text message.</p>
<p>The sender was Shuuichi. Incidentally, he now runs his own restaurant in the city.</p>
<p>The subject line was &#8220;urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I checked the contents, I found that the email said, &#8220;Look at this,&#8221; with a URL attached.</p>
<p>What the heck, I thought, and tapped the URL.</p>
<p>It took me to an online news site.</p>
<p>I was astonished by the headline of the news.</p>
<p>It was an article about a woman who had achieved her dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was so happy that I couldn&#8217;t help but gulp.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Kenji-kun, who was standing beside me, looked at me strangely.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. I hadn&#8217;t answered his question yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenji-kun, about what the parka girl is doing now&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, what is she doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenji-kun asked me curiously.</p>
<p>To which I replied with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a Hollywood actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>This has been the story of Kiritani Kakeru, who was dyed by a girl named Nanase Rena to live outside of a life of withdrawal and to find a life of his own.</p>
