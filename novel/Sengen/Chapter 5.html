<h3>Chapter 5 - Good-bye Declaration</h3>

<p>Early March. The graduation ceremony of Seiran High School was held with many of the students&#8217; families in attendance.</p>
<p>The diploma awarding ceremony, the last words from the principal and the graduation song given by the younger students.</p>
<p>After a variety of other events, the third-year students graduated.</p>
<p>Many of the graduates were in tears.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Akutsu and Ayase cried in our class.</p>
<p>However, instead of crying, I ended the graduation ceremony in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>The reason was that Nanase had not come to the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>She was the only one of the graduates not to attend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone get closer~&#8221;</p>
<p>While some graduates were taking commemorative photos in front of the school gate.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was playing with my younger sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan! Congratulations on your graduation!&#8221;</p>
<p>Momoka snapped a picture with her smartphone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. But aren&#8217;t you taking too many pictures?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Since my brother was able to graduate, we should take a lot of pictures to commemorate the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m the one who just barely graduated.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going to school diligently since before summer vacation.</p>
<p>I even got accepted to a university.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really glad, though. If my brother hadn&#8217;t graduated, I would have been too embarrassed to go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re relentless, little sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re joking or serious.</p>
<p>Momoka then went to look for our parents, who had disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Where did those parents really go on their son&#8217;s big day?</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Atsushi and Ayase are going to university together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yeah. I&#8217;ll have to stay with Saki.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my line. Atsushi will be useless without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How nice~!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m jealous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ayase group was having such a conversation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ayase and Akutsu have been officially dating since about the end of summer vacation.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the conversation, they are both going to the same university.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the ideal childhood relationship.</p>
<p>Then I looked around.</p>
<p>There were many students and their families, but still no sign of Nanase.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nanase, why aren&#8217;t you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the graduation ceremony started, I didn&#8217;t care that much if she wasn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>I was sure she&#8217;ll be late and appear more conspicuous than anyone else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought.</p>
<p>But from the start of the graduation ceremony until now, Nanase hadn’t shown up at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the last time, so let me see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was one thing I hadn&#8217;t told her yet.</p>
<p>I was going to tell her that today, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! Kakeru!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, my name was called.</p>
<p>I looked over and saw Shuuichi coming towards me, looking rushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations on your graduation, Shuuichi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, thank you. That&#8217;s not what this is about!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What do you mean it&#8217;s not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just heard from a teacher why Nanase didn&#8217;t come to the graduation ceremony.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment I heard that, I grabbed Shuuichi&#8217;s shoulders and pressed him tightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Where is Nanase?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C-Calm down, I&#8217;ll tell you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I let go of Shuuichi&#8217;s shoulder, he spoke about Nanase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Kakeru. Nanase, she&#8217;s going to study in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I had never heard of her planning to study abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s leaving today on the afternoon flight. Do you know what that means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What that means&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You idiot, if you take a bus or something to the airport now, you might make it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;R-Right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just go! You were so preoccupied with Nanase during the graduation ceremony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! How did you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re my best friend, so of course I knew! Now get the hell out of here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Shuuichi&#8217;s encouragement, I decided to head to the airport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! I&#8217;ll do my best!&#8221;</p>
<p>After replying to Shuuichi, I started to head for the airport.</p>
<p>But there was one thing I hadn&#8217;t said, so I turned around to look at him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shuuichi is my best friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise at my words.</p>
<p>Then he smiled calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You idiot. Of course I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuuichi said embarrassedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off then!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! Just go!&#8221;</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words with my best friend, I started running towards the airport.</p>
<p>Nanase, please don&#8217;t go yet.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something I have to tell you.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&#8220;The graduation ceremony should be over by now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I muttered to myself as I sat down in front of the airport security checkpoint.</p>
<p>Today was the graduation ceremony of Seiran High School.</p>
<p>However, I had already decided to study in America in order to fulfill my dream of becoming a Hollywood actress, and due to the audition schedule I was already scheduled to attend there, I had to leave on today&#8217;s flight at the latest.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end, I couldn&#8217;t tell Kiritani-kun about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studying abroad itself had been decided long ago, so I had been trying to tell Kiritani-kun.</p>
<p>However, I couldn&#8217;t find the right time to tell him, and the days passed by so fast that I couldn&#8217;t tell him in the end.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really sorry for what I did to Kiritani-kun&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I guess it&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood up with my suitcase in my hand.</p>
<p>It was almost time for me to board my flight. Normally, I would have been able to board and leave earlier, but due to an accident, my flight was delayed by about an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get to America, I&#8217;ll have to work even harder than I already do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was alone with my enthusiasm as I headed for the security checkpoint.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when it happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked back. But there were only a lot of people passing by.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s strange. I felt like someone just called me.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was my imagination, but I started walking again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nanase!&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew I was being called!</p>
<p>I turned around once more and saw only one person coming towards me out of the crowd of people. And that person was someone I knew very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase&#8230; I&#8217;ve finally found you!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Kiritani-kun who appeared, out of breath and sweaty.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After leaving the school, I managed to get to the airport in two hours by bus, cab, and train.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have enough money in my wallet to pay for my transportation today.</p>
<p>After arriving at the airport, I checked the time and boarding gate of the flight to the US.</p>
<p>Then I looked around for Nanase, relying on that information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase! Nanase!&#8221;</p>
<p>I kept calling out her name without worrying about the people around me.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, people around me looked at me like I was filming a drama.</p>
<p>Even so, I continued to call out her name while looking around everywhere.</p>
<p>As a result&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase&#8230; I finally found you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I finally found Nanase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun, why are you here&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about your study abroad. You&#8217;re going to America, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I was actually going to tell you properly&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase turned her face down apologetically and said with a gloomy expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I wish you would have told me, but I got to see Nanase before you left for America.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much time.</p>
<p>I have something I really want to tell Nanase before she leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, there&#8217;s one thing I want to tell you, can you listen to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something you want to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase tilted her head.</p>
<p>But her expression tightened as if she realized the importance of what she was saying when she saw my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase agreed and I began to speak after a short pause to calm myself down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful to Nanase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I met Nanase, I was living a dull life.</p>
<p>I went to school as much as I could get credit for, and when I skipped school, I played video games and read manga all day.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have any goals in life, I just went through the motions of digesting the day.</p>
<p>At the time, I was fine with that, and I didn&#8217;t think I needed to change.</p>
<p>But thanks to meeting Nanase, my life has changed drastically.</p>
<p>At first, I thought Nanase was a terrible troublemaker.</p>
<p>As we spent more and more time together, I became fascinated and admired her way of being herself at all times, unlike me, who just went with the flow of the moment.</p>
<p>I wanted to be like Nanase.</p>
<p>And because of that, I was able to have a dream.</p>
<p>I was able to work hard to pursue my dream. I learned the joy of getting closer to my dream.</p>
<p>If I hadn&#8217;t met Nanase, I would have gone to college without a dream and without any plan.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m really grateful to Nanase.</p>
<p>When I told her that.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t do anything important. It&#8217;s all thanks to yourself that you became the Kiritani-kun you are today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase replied in an embarrassed tone.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were slightly red as she did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, did you come all this way to tell me thank you, Kiritani-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but not exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head left and right in response to Nanase&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>It is true that I wanted to express my gratitude to her, but what I really wanted to say was something else.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Phew.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a breath to control my racing heart.</p>
<p>This is the first time in my life that I&#8217;ve done this, so I guess I&#8217;m getting nervous.</p>
<p>At first I thought Nanase was a person I didn&#8217;t want to get close to, then I began to envy her for being herself, then she became something I admired, then she became something I wanted to be.</p>
<p>And finally&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have feelings for Nanase Rena&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was about to say, but I stopped myself.</p>
<p>I was actually going to tell her how I felt, but when I saw Nanase in front of me, I stopped.</p>
<p>I felt like that wasn&#8217;t the right thing to say to her here.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase has a strange expression on her face.</p>
<p>Now she&#8217;s going to cross the ocean to make her dream come true.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, there are more important things than my feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanase, we should definitely make our own dreams come true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230; Yes! I&#8217;m going to America to become a Hollywood actress for sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can do it, Nanase! I&#8217;m going to be a teacher too.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that said, I held out my hand.</p>
<p>She blinked her beautiful eyes and looked a little surprised.</p>
<p>But finally she chuckled and shook my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was surprised. I didn&#8217;t expect Kiritani-kun to shake my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least for the last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>We naturally laughed at each other as we talked like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s almost time. I have to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase muttered as she checked the clock at the airport.</p>
<p>It seemed that the time to say goodbye to her had finally come.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you soon, Nanase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, see you soon, Kiritani-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the last thing Nanase and I said to each other.</p>
<p>Nanase rolled her suitcase and walked to the security checkpoint.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right&#8230; Now Nanase is really going to America&#8230;</p>
<p>I thought I had prepared myself for this by the time I came to the airport, but seeing her go away like this made me feel inexplicably sad.</p>
<p>I wish I could have spent a little more time talking, playing, and spending time with Nanase.</p>
<p>More specifically, I wish I had gotten to know her when I was a freshman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too late to think about that now&#8230;</p>
<p>I was feeling a little regretful at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard my name called out in a loud voice that echoed through the airport.</p>
<p>When I looked up, to my surprise, Nanase, who was supposed to be on her way to the security checkpoint, was coming back to me, leaving her suitcase behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Nanase! What are you doing—!?&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later, I felt a soft touch on my cheek.</p>
<p>Nanase kissed me gently on the cheek.</p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00016.jpeg"></img>

<p>It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever been kissed by a member of the opposite sex, and it made my heart beat rapidly.</p>
<p>But before I could say anything, she pulled away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last year I spent with you, Kiritani-kun, was a lot of fun! Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all she said, and Nanase went back to the suitcase she had left behind.</p>
<p>Too many things happened at once, and my mind was in turmoil.</p>
<p>But&#8230; Nanase thanked me.</p>
<p>The year I spent with her was not a waste of time for her either.</p>
<p>I was relieved to know that, but at the same time, I felt sad that Nanase was going to America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye-bye, Kiritani-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanase waved at me with her suitcase in hand, smiling at me like usual.</p>
<p>I really miss her, but I can&#8217;t be so selfish.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I have to say goodbye to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye-bye, Nanase!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I waved back, Nanase&#8217;s face broke into a smile of satisfaction and she went back to the security checkpoint.</p>
<p>Then she turned around and waved again, this time with a big smile on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Nanase&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, but I waved again.</p>
<p>There are some people who don&#8217;t dare to look back because they don&#8217;t want to feel sad at such times, but apparently, she is different.</p>
<p>I knew that she was the one who would do everything in her power even when we were parting.</p>
<p>After seeing Nanase off until she was out of sight, I started walking in the opposite direction of her.</p>
<p>If this is a movie or a drama, I would probably see Nanase again someday.</p>
<p>Even if it was&#8230; I somehow felt that I would never see her again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but that&#8217;s what I thought.</p>
<p>Maybe she thinks the same thing.</p>
<p>Because at the end she said &#8220;bye&#8221; instead of &#8220;see you later&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m mistaken, but I&#8217;m sure she did.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I decided to tell her one last time in my heart.</p>
<p>What I couldn&#8217;t tell her in the end.</p>

<p>I was in love with Nanase Rena.</p>

<p>And then I said good-bye to Nanase.</p>
