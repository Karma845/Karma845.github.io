<h3>Afterword</h3>

				<p>Nice to meet you. If you&#8217;ve been reading my work for a while, it&#8217;s been a while. I&#8217;m Mitsuki Midori.</p>
<p>I am very honored to have been asked to write the light novel of the famous &#8220;Goodbye Declaration&#8221;.</p>
<p>To give you a rough idea of the story, the main character, Kiritani Kakeru, who has been living a half-baked life, has his life drastically changed by the heroine, Nanase Rena, who is the biggest troublemaker in the school.</p>
<p>As a side note, when I was in junior high school, I was dumped by my girlfriend right after I gave her a gift on Christmas Eve, and my life was changed forever. I&#8217;ll leave it to your imagination how it changed my life.</p>
<p>By the way, the gift was never returned&#8230;</p>
<p>Sorry for the digression, but I hope you enjoy reading this story while paying attention to the lyrics of &#8220;Goodbye Declaration&#8221; because I think you will learn the real meaning behind it.</p>
<p>If you listen to &#8220;Goodbye Declaration&#8221; after reading this piece, or if you read this piece after listening to &#8220;Goodbye Declaration,&#8221; you may enjoy it even more.</p>

<p>Now, for the last time, I would like to express my gratitude.</p>

<p>[EDN: Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed the story! I hope I was able to do this novel justice and properly convey both Nanase and Kiritani’s emotions in English. I really wish they reunited in the end but that&#8217;s my own personal opinion and I think the actual ending suits this novel better. Thanks to Char for picking it up, TL’ing it, and letting me edit this!]</p>
<p>[TLN: Bro I hated Akutsu and Ayase so much, I fuming every time I TL. But I feel so empty when the story ended. Anyway thanks for reading, everyone! Thanks, Anima for editing!]</p>
