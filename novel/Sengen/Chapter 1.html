<h3>Chapter 1 - The Encounter.</h3>

<p>Mid-April. The cherry blossom season was coming to an end.</p>
<p>It has only been a week since the new school year started.</p>
<p>The first-year students who have just entered the school are gradually getting used to high school life, and the second and third-year students who have advanced and changed classes are probably deciding on their position in the class and what group they belong to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I—Kiritani Kakeru, would be a third-year in high school this year.</p>
<p>It was my last year in high school, so I should normally be busy with a lot of things&#8230; But in reality, I haven&#8217;t been to school once this semester.</p>
<p>So what do I do when I don&#8217;t go to school—</p>
<p>“Alright, one more kill and I&#8217;ll get my wish of 20 kills.”</p>
<p>It was past seven in the morning and I was playing a shooting battle royale game that is currently very popular in Japan.</p>
<p>I started playing around spring break, and for the past week I&#8217;ve been holed up in my room . That was why I haven&#8217;t been able to go to school.</p>
<p>“Hey, Onii-chan! Last night you were playing games until midnight&#8230; eh, and now you&#8217;re playing games again!?”</p>
<p>The one who suddenly opened the door and walked in was my sister—Kiritani Momoka.</p>
<p>Unlike me, who has a very average face, Momoka, who was now in the second year of junior high school, was cute and popular at school. It’s a good thing she doesn&#8217;t look like her big brother.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Momoka. Your brother is a little busy right now, so can we talk later?”</p>
<p>“What are you so busy with? You&#8217;re just playing a game.”</p>
<p>“There are busy times in games too. If you don&#8217;t usually play games, you wouldn&#8217;t understand.”</p>
<p>I was now at a very critical juncture.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing this battle royale game for about a month now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just one step away from my goal of 20 kills.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m sorry Momoka, but now is not the time to be listening to my sister—</p>
<p>“Hehhh.”</p>
<p>The TV screen went dark with a click sound.</p>
<p>&#8230;Huh? What the heck just happened?</p>
<p>“Goodness. You were playing games until midnight last night, and you&#8217;re still playing games in the morning, you idiot.”</p>
<p>Momoka was holding the plug of a gaming console in her hand as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Momoka-chan! Your brother told you that he was busy playing games, right!?”</p>
<p>“So now you&#8217;re not busy.”</p>
<p>“No, that&#8217;s true, but&#8230;”</p>
<p>Ahh, my 20 kills&#8230;</p>
<p>“Anyway, Onii-chan, you should go to school today.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry, imouto-chan. Your brother doesn&#8217;t have to go to school yet, so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>When I answered with a smile, Momoka looked at me with a frown.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Onii-chan, are you planning to only go to classes until the very end of your academic year again?”</p>
<p>“Of course I intend to.”</p>
<p>Ever since I entered high school, I&#8217;ve only taken enough classes to make sure I pass each year.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, but the short answer was that it was too much trouble to go to school.</p>
<p>There was a general opinion that it was better to go to school, but I don&#8217;t think so at all.</p>
<p>In the first place, going to school and taking classes will almost never be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Do you think you will ever use calculus or ancient texts in society?</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think most people would use these unless they were a scholar.</p>
<p>In other words, 90% of the time you spend in school is wasted.</p>
<p>Well, I understand that if you are in a club and you go to school because you enjoy the club activities.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, I&#8217;m not in any club, and if anything, I don&#8217;t have many friends, so I don&#8217;t even go to school to talk to them.</p>
<p>What was the point of me going to school? In fact, I could even say that not going to school was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>That was why I only go to school as much as I need to, and on the days I don&#8217;t go to school, I spend my time playing games, reading manga, and being lazy, like now.</p>
<p>“You know what, Onii-chan? This is your last year in high school. Why don&#8217;t you go to school properly for the last time?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Because it&#8217;s my last, I&#8217;m going to work hard enough to stay in school this year. Have you ever heard of the term &#8216;original commitment&#8217;?”</p>
<p>Momoka sighed in exasperation as she said this.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Haa. Why is my Onii-chan so uncool?”</p>
<p>“I got our father&#8217;s face, so you can tell our dad.”</p>
<p>“No one&#8217;s talking about your face. Yes, your face is unattractive, but&#8230;”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re my sister and yet you&#8217;re relentless.”</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, it seems that we are both uncool.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I think you should go to school today.”</p>
<p>“Good grief, I told you it&#8217;s okay if I don&#8217;t go yet.”</p>
<p>“If you don&#8217;t, mom said she&#8217;d throw away all of Onii-chan&#8217;s games and mangas.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Seriously?”</p>
<p>When I asked her fearfully, Momoka nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Well, you don&#8217;t have to go to school if you want to have all of your games and comics thrown out. I&#8217;ve already told you that.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Momoka walked out of my room.</p>
<p>I looked around my room. Dozens of video games and dozens of manga.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t go to school today, this will all be thrown away&#8230;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Then, l should get ready.”</p>
<p>Then I put my arms through my uniform for the first time in about a month.</p>
<p>It was the seventh day of the new school year.</p>
<p>I decided to go to school for the first time.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>“Mom, you were really going to throw away my games and comics.”</p>
<p>When I went to the living room to get ready for school, I found that my mother, who usually worked as an office worker at some company, was not working today and had prepared a lot of garbage bags.</p>
<p>She thought I wouldn&#8217;t go to school anyway, so she stood by beforehand.</p>
<p>Mom, please have a little faith in your own son&#8230;</p>
<p>“Is the cherry blossom already in bloom&#8230;”</p>
<p>The high school I go to,Seiran High School, had many cherry trees planted all along the road leading to the school gate.</p>
<p>However, all the cherry blossoms had already fallen. If I had come to school on time, I might have been able to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom.</p>
<p>&#8230;But I personally don&#8217;t feel like going to school for that reason, so I don&#8217;t feel the slightest regret. It was more fun to play games and read manga at home than to watch the cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>“Yo! Kakeru-chan!”</p>
<p>Someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind.</p>
<p>When I turned around, there was one handsome, fresh-looking boy there.</p>
<p>He had an atmosphere that resembled somethingresembled something out of a shoujo manga.</p>
<p>“What is it, Shuuichi?”</p>
<p>“What’s with that reaction?”</p>
<p>A handsome boy laughed amusingly at me as I looked at him boringly.</p>
<p>His name is Amahisa Shuuichi.</p>
<p>He is in the same grade as me and is also from the same junior high school.</p>
<p>And he is the only friend I have.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s your first day at school this year. Last year you didn&#8217;t come to school for two weeks after the second year started, but this time you&#8217;re early.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well, yeah. If I don&#8217;t go to school today, my mom&#8217;s going to throw away all my games and manga.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? That&#8217;s super funny!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s not at all funny.”</p>
<p>I calmly replied, but Shuuichi was still laughing. Is this guy making fun of me?</p>
<p>“Well, whatever. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here at school.”</p>
<p>“That sounds so fake.”</p>
<p>“No, no. Seriously, I&#8217;m happy for you.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi smiled and put his hand on my shoulders.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s too hot. Stop it.”</p>
<p>“Come on, don&#8217;t be shy.”</p>
<p>“And I&#8217;m not shy.”</p>
<p>I removed Shuuichi&#8217;s arm from my shoulder and started to walk away.</p>
<p>And soon Shuuichi came alongside me.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Kakeru and I aren&#8217;t in the same class this year.”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t get so lonely.”</p>
<p>“Huh? I&#8217;m not lonely at all.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi was smirking even as he said that. This guy is just so annoying.</p>
<p>“Instead, I&#8217;d say, there&#8217;s that particular girl in your class.”</p>
<p>“That girl? Who&#8217;s that girl?”</p>
<p>“You want to know more?”</p>
<p>“No, I&#8217;m not that interested.”</p>
<p>“If you want to hear it so badly, Shuuichi-kun here will give you a special lesson.”</p>
<p>“Shuuichi doesn&#8217;t have any ears?”</p>
<p>Even though I returned his words in a dumbfounded manner, he didn&#8217;t care and continued talking.</p>
<p>I knew he didn&#8217;t have ears.</p>
<p>“That girl who&#8217;s in your class&#8230;”</p>
<p>Shuuichi said in a smug tone, but continued.</p>

<p>“It’s Nanase Rena.”</p>

<p>At the moment I heard that name, I was sure I looked a little annoyed.</p>
<p>Because Nanase Rena was known as the most problematic girl in school. Even I, who only goes to school moderately, know about her.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve never been in the same class, so I only have a vague idea of what she looked like, and I&#8217;ve never talked to her in person, so I don&#8217;t really know what she’s like.</p>
<p>&#8230;But the rumors about her that are frequently circulated are pretty outrageous.</p>
<p>During my freshman year, there were many stories, such as the mysterious guerrilla event called Rena Festival that started without permission, or the campfire that was held on the school grounds at night after the sports festival without permission by gathering all the students in the school.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re lucky, Kakeru, to be in the same class as the most famous person in the school.”</p>
<p>“How? This is not good at all.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know. Maybe you&#8217;ll start to enjoy coming to school and you&#8217;ll want to go to school every day.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely no way.”</p>
<p>In fact, if I had such a problematic person in my class, I might not want to go to school any more than I do now.</p>
<p>“As a friend from junior high school, I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll start coming to school properly soon.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re bringing that up again after all. I told you I don&#8217;t like to discuss it.”</p>
<p>I said to Shuuichi, who looked worried.</p>
<p>In the first place, I went to school as little as I could during my freshman and sophomore years, and now I feel like I can&#8217;t take school seriously anymore.</p>
<p>“Kakeru, you were going to school normally in junior high school. Why did you become such a mess the moment you entered high school?”</p>
<p>Suddenly Shuuichi threw a question at me.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been telling you. I&#8217;m just tired of going to school.”</p>
<p>“You always give the same answer, but that&#8217;s an absolute lie.”</p>
<p>“You know, Shuuichi, even if you don&#8217;t go to school, you can get a high school diploma if you pass the high school equivalency exam, and then you can take the university entrance exam. There are many places where you can get a job even if you are a high school graduate&#8230; The adults in the world say that if you don&#8217;t go to school, it&#8217;s the end of your life, but that&#8217;s not true at all.”</p>
<p>“That might be true, but&#8230;”</p>
<p>When I gave a long explanation, Shuuichi gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said a lot of things, but I know that I should go to school. Some mentalists told me that if I don&#8217;t go to school, I won&#8217;t be able to learn communication skills.</p>
<p>Well, I still wouldn&#8217;t go to school every day, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Because it was exhausting in so many ways. Only people who experienced what I have would know what I mean.</p>
<p>“Kakeru, even so, I&#8217;m still worried about you.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the sentiment, but it&#8217;s none of your business. I mean, we&#8217;re going to be late for school if you keep talking about things that don&#8217;t matter.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Heh heh, I get it.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi muttered as if he had given up.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly started talking about other topics, like how a new girl had told him off, or how the principal&#8217;s wig had almost come off at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>It was very helpful that he could sense my mood and stay out of it like this.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, he was too good a friend for me.</p>
<p>I would never tell him this, because I think he would get carried away if I told him.</p>
<p>Then, we walked along the path of the fallen cherry trees, exchanging idle conversation.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>I changed my shoes at the gate and headed to my class room alone.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Shuuichi happened to meet his girlfriend, whom he has been dating since their freshman year, in front of the school gate, and they went to their class together first. It seemed Shuuichi and her were in the same class.</p>
<p>Shuuichi asked me to go with him to the halfway point even though we were in different classes, but I refused.</p>
<p>If I were there, I&#8217;d obviously be in the way.</p>

<p>“Nanase has arrived!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard such a voice from a male student.</p>
<p>In addition, I heard a name that I just heard from Shuuichi a moment ago.</p>
<p>I turned around, curious, and there was a girl wearing a white parka over her uniform blouse. Her skin was white, and her hair was brownish and long enough to reach her shoulders.</p>
<p>She had a pretty face, but she was also cute, and frankly, quite a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>“Rena-chan good morning~!”</p>
<p>“I heard you were called into the staff room yesterday!”</p>
<p>“As expected of Nanase!”</p>
<p>“Rena-chan, you look so pretty today~!”</p>
<p>“You better do something today!”</p>
<p>A beautiful parka girl was approached one by one by male and female students passing by in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Good morning, everyone! Today I&#8217;m going to enjoy school life to the fullest, so I&#8217;ll be looking forward to working with you all~!”</p>
<p>She smiled affectionately and waved to each of the students.</p>
<p>The parka girl did not have the air of being difficult to approach that was often associated with beautiful girls, but rather wore an atmosphere of friendliness.</p>
<p>I see&#8230; That parka beautiful girl is Nanase Rena.</p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m seeing her clearly for the first time. I never thought she was such a beautiful girl&#8230;</p>
<p>By the way, the parka she was wearing over her blouse was a complete violation of school rules.</p>
<p>But out of all the students in the school, she was the only one who was allowed to wear a parka.</p>
<p>&#8230;Of course, when Nanase first came to school wearing a parka, the teachers warned her and confiscated it, but she still wore the same parka all day, every day, and the teachers all gave up on her.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous obsession, wasn&#8217;t it? She was obsessed with wearing a parka.</p>
<p>In addition, Nanase Rena has an enthusiastic fan base.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the kind of people who are talking to her right now.</p>
<p>Nanase has had a number of problematic behaviors since her freshman year.</p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00008.jpeg"></img>

<p>However, it seemed that this had caught the fancy of some students and had created an ardent Nanase fan base.</p>
<p>This was what Shuuichi told me earlier, that she already has a few fans among the new students.</p>
<p>What kind of thing would achieve that in just one week&#8230;</p>
<p>“That Nanase is still on a roll, isn&#8217;t she?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, crazy.”</p>
<p>“They all are treating her like an idol.”</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s treated like an idol when all she does is cause trouble.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, a group of boys and girls were talking badly about Nanase on the side.</p>
<p>If there were enthusiastic fans, it was not surprising that there would also be strong opposition.</p>
<p>Nanase was a student who stood out, for better or worse.</p>
<p>“In my last year of high school, of all times, why am I in the same class as Nanase&#8230;”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself with a sigh. I hope nothing troublesome happens&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I turned my back on Nanase, who was talking to her fans, and went to the classroom first.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>I arrived at the classroom and opened the door to find my classmates chatting in their groups.</p>
<p>It has already been a week since we started our new class, so most of them have probably found a place that suits them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a guy who came to school for the first time a week late doesn&#8217;t have that kind of place at all.</p>
<p>After checking my seat on the seating chart posted on the bulletin board, I move so as not to stand out too much. If I stand out too much, people think, “has he not come to school for a week?” And it would make me feel awkward.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Oh goodness.”</p>
<p>I was moving along smoothly, but when I got close to my seat, I despaired.</p>
<p>A boy I didn&#8217;t know was sitting in my seat.</p>
<p>He was also chatting happily with the boys behind him, who were probably his friends.</p>
<p>Well, what should I do? It seemed like it would be solved by me saying to the boy sitting in my seat, &#8220;That&#8217;s my seat,&#8221; but it was not that easy in school.</p>
<p>The boys had sporty hairstyles and looked very athletic, and if I insisted on claiming my seat, they might react negatively. That would be very troublesome.</p>
<p>&#8230;So, should I go out into the hallway or use the restroom to kill time here and wait for the boys to leave my seat&#8230;?</p>
<p>“Sorry, I&#8217;m gonna go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>Then the boy in my seat got up. This was my chance. I had to sit down quickly while I could. So I quickly sat down in my seat before the boy came back.</p>
<p>The boys&#8217; friends were a little surprised, but they didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p>The boy who had been sitting in my seat also came back and looked at me with blinking eyes.</p>
<p>However, he now sat down on a nearby empty seat and resumed chatting with his friends.</p>
<p>No, don&#8217;t just sit in someone else&#8217;s seat and chat. It&#8217;s just plain annoying.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, but I can&#8217;t seem to say it out loud&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Haaa, why do I have to be so careful just to sit in my seat?</p>
<p>With that in mind, I looked around.</p>
<p>I needed to see what kind of students were in my class.</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t do it. I have club activities.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Why not just go to karaoke? You need to take a break once in a while.”</p>
<p>“The tournament is coming up, so I can&#8217;t take a day off.”</p>
<p>“I have a song that I really want to sing.”</p>
<p>“Go with the others.”</p>
<p>At the back of the classroom, there was a group of five boys and girls, and the handsome guy was clearly the leader of the group and a beautiful girl was having a conversation with him.</p>
<p>I know them both well. We were in the same class last year.</p>
<p>The handsome man&#8217;s name is Akutsu Atsushi.</p>
<p>He was not as brisk as Shuuichi, but a bit more ornate and handsome. He was a member of the basketball club, and has been a regular member since his freshman year, and was now the captain and ace of the team.</p>
<p>That was why I heard that he was often confessed to by girls. I heard that his behavior was not so good, but he somehow was popular with the  girls. But I didn&#8217;t understand why.</p>
<p>And the beautiful girl&#8217;s name is Ayase Saki.</p>
<p>Long black hair and piercing eyes. She looked more like a beautiful woman than a pretty one, and had a slender figure.</p>
<p>However, she has a queen-like atmosphere or a thorny air that is often associated with female leaders, and Ayase was a beautiful girl who was the complete opposite of a particular someone I met this morning.</p>
<p>&#8230;I know them, but I&#8217;ve never spoken to them or even greeted them properly, so they probably think I&#8217;m just a gloomy guy who comes to school once in a while.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re not careful, they might even forget that they were in the same class as me.</p>
<p>“Then I&#8217;ll go to karaoke with Saki-chan!”</p>
<p>“Then maybe I&#8217;ll go too~!”</p>
<p>Two of the Ayase group&#8217;s — Suzuki Tatsuya and Suzuka Takabashi started talking. I was in the same class with them last year as well.</p>
<p>“Tatsuya has club activities, right? Don&#8217;t slack off!”</p>
<p>“Atsushi is really serious about his club activities, isn&#8217;t he? What about karaoke, Mei?”</p>
<p>“Eh, I-I&#8230;”</p>
<p>The girl, called Mei by Ayase, was the last of the group who had never said a word before. Her last name was Tachibana.</p>
<p>“Of course you&#8217;re going, right?”</p>
<p>“U-Umm&#8230; yeah.”</p>
<p>Tachibana gave a small nod. &#8230;She was the one who really didn&#8217;t want to go. But Ayase&#8217;s words pressured her into nodding her head.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in the same class with Tachibana since second year, but she was the weakest link in the Ayase group, so I saw things like this all the time.</p>
<p>But no one can stand against Ayase and Akutsu, so everyone pretends to ignore them. Including me, of course.</p>
<p>In terms of school caste, the Ayase group probably was at the highest.</p>
<p>If I anger Akutsu and Ayase, I&#8217;ll be in big trouble, and I have to be careful not to get too close&#8230;</p>

<p>“Good morning, everyone!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a cheerful voice echoed through the classroom.</p>
<p>I looked over and saw Nanase, the beautiful parka girl, at the door.</p>
<p>This was the first time I&#8217;ve seen someone greet the whole class like this, other than a character from an anime or manga.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re late, Nanase!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I actually overslept a bit today&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Rena-chan After school, let&#8217;s go eat crepes at that new place in front of the station!”</p>
<p>“I like crepes! I don&#8217;t have any plans today, so that&#8217;s totally fine~!”</p>
<p>Several classmates called out to her one after another, and Nanase responded to them one by one.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are some Nanase fans in this class.</p>
<p>&#8230;I mean, this parka beauty was a heck of a communicator. It was amazing.</p>
<p>As I was admiring her, Nanase gradually approached me — and took a seat next to me.</p>
<p>&#8230;Really? Nanase&#8217;s seat is next to mine? I don&#8217;t like the idea of sitting next to a girl who has both fans and enemies in school because I feel like something might happen.</p>
<p>“Good morning!”</p>
<p>Then, Nanase greeted me abruptly.</p>
<p>“Eh, g-good morning&#8230;”</p>
<p>“This is the first time you&#8217;ve been to school, right?”</p>
<p>After greeting me, she asked me a question. She was really pushy.</p>
<p>“I-It is&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Right! I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah. Likewise&#8230;”</p>
<p>She smiled at me and said hello, so I said hello back.</p>
<p>I was surprised. Would one normally talk to someone they have never spoken to before like this? That was beyond casual</p>

<p>“Rena&#8217;s in a great mood today — or should I say, she&#8217;s very popular.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I hear a sharp, cold voice. The owner of the voice was Ayase.</p>
<p>She has clearly said “she’s getting carried away”, loud enough for others to hear.</p>
<p>“As expected of the best troublemaker in school!”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re causing so many problems that you&#8217;re becoming popular with the same troublemakers, aren&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>Takabashi and Suzuki, cronies of the Ayase group, followed up to Nanase and then both laughed stupidly.</p>
<p>Nanase, on the other hand, was smiling without a single disgusted look, even though she&#8217;s been bad-mouthed quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I&#8217;m flattered that you think so highly of me.”</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? I didn&#8217;t mean it as a compliment. I meant it as an insult.”</p>
<p>Ayase said irritably, and glared at Nanase.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Ayase was Nanase&#8217;s antagonist. Quite a big one, too.</p>
<p>This story was as famous as the fact that Nanase was a problem child in the school, and even I, who has not been attending school much, know about it.</p>
<p>After all, they had been fighting as soon as they saw each other since shortly after entering high school.</p>
<p>“I know. But I&#8217;m a person with a big heart. I don&#8217;t take anything that some random person says seriously.”</p>
<p>“Who are you to judge me!? Stop looking down on other people!”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s looking down on me. Can you please stop trying to come after me every time?”</p>
<p>Sparks fly between the two of them as they argue.</p>
<p>It seemed like they were about to go at it.</p>
<p>“How can you wear such a tacky parka to school?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s better than your crappy makeup. Your eye makeup is falling off.”</p>
<p>“What&#8230;”</p>
<p>Ayase looked impatient and pulled out a hand mirror to check.</p>
<p>However, the makeup didn&#8217;t come off.</p>
<p>“Sike. Just kidding.”</p>
<p>“Uh! You&#8230;!!”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;ve already learned your lesson. Messing with me is only going to cost you.”</p>
<p>“Sh&#8230; S-Shut up!”</p>
<p>With that, Ayase didn’t say anything more to Nanase.</p>
<p>This time around, she seemed to have admitted defeat. Or rather, from the conversation between the two of them, most of the arguments like the one today probably ended with Nanase winning.</p>
<p>“Mei! Go get me a drink now!”</p>
<p>“M-Me&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m really frustrated right now, so go get me a drink. A milk tea.”</p>
<p>Ayase ordered Tachibana in a bad mood.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll have a can of coffee.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll take anything carbonated.”</p>
<p>“Black tea for me~”</p>
<p>Akutsu and the others continued to urge Tachibana to buy them drinks as well.</p>
<p>Her homeroom teacher was about to arrive, and normally she would have refused, but as the weakest link in the Ayase group, she couldn&#8217;t go against what Ayase and the others had said.</p>
<p>So, she has no choice but to follow what they said to keep her position there.</p>
<p>“&#8230;A-Alright.”</p>
<p>Tachibana nodded weakly and turned to leave the classroom to go to a nearby vending machine.</p>
<p>At this point, Tachibana was clearly being treated unreasonably.</p>
<p>But no one was going to help her. Obviously.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to do anything unnecessary and get the attention of Ayase or Akutsu, and even if I try to help her, there&#8217;s a chance that I&#8217;ll get beaten back and it will all be for nothing.</p>
<p>So the right thing to do here was to read the air and do nothing—</p>

<p>“Hold on a second!”</p>

<p>A piercing voice echoed in the classroom.</p>
<p>I was surprised that the voice came from Nanase.</p>
<p>“What? I didn&#8217;t say anything to Rena.”</p>
<p>“Saki, I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while that you&#8217;re treating Tachibana too harshly. If you&#8217;re friends, you should be more fair.”</p>
<p>“Hah? What are you talking—”</p>
<p>In the middle of her words, Nanase got up from her seat and approached Ayase.</p>
<p>Then, with a bang, Nanase slammed the palm of her hand down on Ayase&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>“So why don&#8217;t you go buy drinks for everyone today, Saki? Ah, I&#8217;ll have orange juice.”</p>
<p>When Nanase slowly took her hand off the desk, there was a small change on it. It was just enough for a bottle of juice.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Rena, cut the crap.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the one who needs to cut the crap. Either you go buy a drink, or stop making Tachibana-san buy a drink.”</p>
<p>Nanase and Ayase looked at each other.</p>
<p>However, the tension in the place was much different than when they had been arguing earlier.</p>
<p>“Hey Nanase, if you&#8217;d just shut up and listen, we wouldn&#8217;t be saying so much.”</p>
<p>At this point, Akutsu also intervened.</p>
<p>They were probably simply annoyed with Nanase for even getting into their own business.</p>
<p>“Akutsu-kun and the others are saying a lot of selfish things to Tachibana-san.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re classmates. We&#8217;re related.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8230;”</p>
<p>Akutsu directed a sharp gaze at Nanase. Honestly, it was pretty scary.</p>
<p>&#8230;but instead of freaking out, Nanase returned his gaze straight away.</p>
<p>To be honest, the atmosphere in the classroom was a mess because of Nanase. You could say it was the worst.</p>
<p>&#8230;But strangely enough, I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off of her.</p>
<p>“Come on, choose quickly. Either Saki buys the drinks or stops making Tachibana-san buy the drinks.”</p>
<p>“You, just don&#8217;t stop saying things that piss me off.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re going to listen to you.”</p>
<p>The battle between Ayase and Akutsu against Nanase was still going on, but if it continued, it would probably end with Tachibana being sent to buy a drink.</p>
<p>And as Ayase said, the two of them didn&#8217;t need to listen to Nanase.</p>
<p>&#8230;but was she sure she wanted to do that?</p>
<p>After asking myself that question, I glanced at the clock hanging in the classroom.</p>
<p>She has about two minutes before the homeroom teacher arrives&#8230;</p>
<p>“You two really have bad personalities, don&#8217;t you? Why don&#8217;t you start over as a baby?”</p>
<p>“You, let me tell you&#8230;!!”</p>
<p>At this point, Ayase completely snapped out of it and raised her hands in the air.</p>
<p>Whoa, she was going to slap her.</p>
<p>“Wait a second, Saki!”</p>
<p>Akutsu thought the same thing as I did and thought it was a bad idea, so he tried to stop Ayase.</p>
<p>But before she could, Ayase&#8217;s hand swept down and straight into Nanase&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>The moment everyone thought the slap was going to hit Nanase.</p>

<p>Suddenly, an alarm sounded.</p>

<p>This triggered Ayase&#8217;s hand to come to a halt.</p>
<p>And the eyes of my classmates, including Ayase&#8217;s, were drawn to the direction where the alarm went off — my seat.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry. I guess I forgot to turn off the alarm&#8230;”</p>
<p>I showed my phone and apologized. But there was no reaction from my classmates. If I had to say, they looked at me like, &#8216;What the hell is he doing?&#8217; That&#8217;s cold&#8230;</p>
<p>“Okay, everyone, take your seats~”</p>
<p>The door to the classroom opened with a bang and a female teacher walked in.</p>
<p>Today was my first day of school for the new semester, but I think she&#8217;s the homeroom teacher of our class.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, the situation seemed to be settled.</p>
<p>Tachibana then went to her seat without going to buy drinks for Ayase and the others.</p>
<p>Akutsu and the other two who had gathered at Ayase&#8217;s seat also returned to their seats.</p>
<p>Phew, I guess I managed&#8230; When I was feeling relieved in my heart, I felt a glance from next to me.</p>
<p>I looked at Nanase, who had returned to her seat and was staring at me.</p>
<p>“Ummm&#8230; do you need anything?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing~”</p>
<p>Nanase turned her head in a hurry to look the other way. What the heck was that about?</p>

<p>Homeroom was over, and my classmates were getting ready for the first period, going to the vending machine to buy drinks, or just chatting.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ayase seemed to have recovered from her anger and was now chatting with her cronies, including Akutsu and Tachibana.</p>
<p>“You, have a minute?”</p>
<p>As I was getting ready for class and playing with my phone in my seat, Nanase called out to me again.</p>
<p>“&#8230;What is it this time?”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t look so bummed. I just want to talk to you.”</p>
<p>After smiling like the sun, Nanase continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Earlier, you were trying to help me, weren&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;No, I really wasn’t.”</p>
<p>In response to Nanase&#8217;s question, I immediately denied it.</p>
<p>“? Why are you lying to me?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not lying, I really just forgot to turn off the alarm. I don&#8217;t want to get into trouble or anything in the first place.”</p>
<p>When I insisted, Nanase gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>“You didn&#8217;t want to get in trouble and yet you helped me?”</p>
<p>“I told you I wasn&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>Even though I denied it, Nanase put her finger on her chin as if she was contemplating something.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re pretty amusing.”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled somewhat sinisterly.</p>
<p>What was that reaction? It was really scary.</p>
<p>I was scared.</p>
<p>“I think I might be interested in you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What?”</p>
<p>When I was confused, Nanase grinned and loosened her mouth.</p>
<p>It was my first day of school in my third year of high school. I suddenly felt like I was in trouble.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>
<p>I was in my first period math class. I was thinking about him, Kiritani-kun.</p>
<p>He looked like a little animal. I thought it would be fun to tease him.</p>
<p>There are people you don&#8217;t talk to that much, but enjoy messing with.</p>
<p>I think Kiritani-kun was probably fitting to be that kind of person.</p>
<p>But when we first talked, I thought that Kiritani-kun was just a normal boy who didn&#8217;t want to go to school. I didn&#8217;t really feel anything about that, and I didn&#8217;t look at him strangely just because he didn&#8217;t go to school much.</p>
<p>But he was not your average truant student.</p>
<p>When Saki almost hit me, Kiritani-kun helped me. I then had another conversation with him. I thought he was a little weird.</p>
<p>He flat out lied about not helping me.</p>
<p>And normally, people who don&#8217;t want to get into trouble wouldn&#8217;t help others.</p>
<p>Moreover, the atmosphere in the classroom was appalling, if I do say so myself, and no one was trying to help me.</p>
<p>That was why I was surprised when the alarm on Kiritani-kun&#8217;s phone went off.</p>
<p>I almost laughed when he said, &#8220;I think I forgot to turn it off&#8230;&#8221; His acting was so awkward. I thought it was kind of cute, though.</p>
<p>And even vaguely, I felt that Kiritani-kun was similar to &#8220;her&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I took an interest in him.</p>
<p>After my first conversation with Kiritani-kun, I made it a point to say a few words to him when he came to school.</p>
<p>I asked him what his favorite food was, and we talked about what he did on his days off.  Those sort of things.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, if things continue as they are, maybe Kiritani-kun will end up in the same awful situation as &#8220;her&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he hasn&#8217;t been pushed that far yet, but&#8230;</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t just leave him like this.</p>
<p>Because I might be able to help Kiritani-kun.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>After I started attending school for a few days, as I did in my first and second years, I went to school as much as I needed without losing credits, and on days when I didn&#8217;t have to go to school in particular, I slacked off at home.</p>
<p>But the trouble was, whenever I went to school, Nanase was always talking to me.</p>
<p>The content was &#8220;Do you have any hobbies?&#8221; or &#8220;Did you see the drama last night?&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what she was thinking when she said she was interested in me, but what the heck was this parka girl thinking?</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s see, today is the day of the volunteer event to clean the trash all day. I guess I don&#8217;t have to go then.”</p>
<p>In my room. Looking at the calendar hanging on the wall, I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that I don&#8217;t lose any credits and that I can skip school as much as possible, this calendar has a detailed list of days that I could miss school and days that I have to be at school.</p>
<p>Whenever I could take a day off, it was always marked as an ‘off’.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m not going today because of the annual volunteer event to clean up trash in residential areas, riverbeds, and parks near the school.</p>
<p>There was no way I was going to volunteer when I only went to school on days when I had classes and when my credits were relevant. I didn&#8217;t even participate in the last two volunteer events.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I&#8217;ll have another go at Apet today.”</p>
<p>I started up Playon. The title I&#8217;m going to play is the Battle Royale game that Momoka unplugged the other day. I’m going to get 20 kills today.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting into the swing of things, the intercom rang at my house.</p>
<p>I was going to ask Momoka to get it, but I realized students should be in school.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m a student too, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Both of my parents were at work&#8230; I was the only one at home.</p>
<p>The intercom rang for the second time, but I didn&#8217;t care and started my game. If it was a delivery, they&#8217;d probably put in an absentee ballot, and if it was an insurance salesman, they&#8217;d probably just go away if no one was available.</p>
<p>I was playing the game with that in mind, but unfortunately the intercom didn&#8217;t stop ringing. On the contrary, the intercom had been ringing continuously since a while ago.</p>
<p>No, this was indeed too rude.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I&#8217;m coming now.”</p>
<p>I had no choice but to leave my game and headed for the door.</p>
<p>Who in the world was this rude person? I would definitely have a problem with them.</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it&#8230; wait it&#8217;s you?”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Kakeru.”</p>
<p>It was Shuuichi at the front door with a fresh smile on his face.</p>
<p>We went to the same junior high school, so he and I lived relatively close to each other, and our houses were about a ten-minute walk from each other.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here&#8230;”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s because I came to pick you up to go to school with me.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m not going.”</p>
<p>I responded to Shuuichi&#8217;s statement by shaking my head.</p>
<p>“Why? There&#8217;s no class today, and it&#8217;s a pretty easy day.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not interested in volunteer events, it&#8217;s too much work.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t say that. Let&#8217;s go. I&#8217;ll give you that game you wanted the other day.”</p>
<p>“The game I wanted&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s called Battle Stage 6. I won it in a raffle when I was out near the station on my day off.”</p>
<p>“Seriously!? That&#8217;s really what I wanted!”</p>
<p>I got a little excited when I heard Shuuichi&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>The title he mentioned was a game that I had given up on buying financially.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to give it to me?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I don&#8217;t usually play games or anything. Instead, you&#8217;re going to have to join me for the volunteer event today.”</p>
<p>“I-I get it. If that&#8217;s what you mean&#8230;”</p>
<p>Halfway through, I stopped speaking.</p>
<p>&#8230;Isn&#8217;t there something wrong with him?</p>
<p>Shuuichi has tried to get me to go to school in the past like he was doing now, but to give me a game just to go to school seemed a little too pushy today.</p>
<p>“Shuuichi, are you up to something?”</p>
<p>“Eh, n-now what are you talking about&#8230;?”</p>
<p>When I asked him about it, Shuuichi turned away from me with great speed. It was too easy to understand, indeed.</p>
<p>“Maybe I should stop going to school after all&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, all right, all right. I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s going on, but you&#8217;ve got to come to school.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi said desperately.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe he was in such a rush. What kind of reason was he giving me to go to school?</p>
<p>“Actually, I was going to work with her at the volunteer event today.”</p>
<p>“What is that? Showing off your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s not what I meant. Chill out, man.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi appeased me by saying, &#8220;Well, well.&#8221; It was kind of annoying.</p>
<p>“But she got sick and couldn&#8217;t come to school, so there was no one to pick up the trash with today.”</p>
<p>“Why don&#8217;t you just pick up trash with your friends? Unlike me, Shuuichi has a lot of friends, right?”</p>
<p>“That is true, but&#8230;”</p>
<p>Shuuichi looked as if he was having a hard time saying it.</p>
<p>“You know, every year when you volunteer to clean up trash, you have to spend a lot of time with someone, except for those who work alone. And you have to fill that time with conversation and stuff.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess&#8230;”</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about it because I&#8217;ve never participated in one&#8230;</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don&#8217;t want to spend that much time with someone I don&#8217;t really get along with.”</p>
<p>“I-I see&#8230;”</p>
<p>This handsome boy, he said a terrible thing without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>Well, maybe what he was saying wasn&#8217;t wrong&#8230;</p>
<p>“&#8230;is that why you want me to go to school?”</p>
<p>“Something like that. So please.”</p>
<p>Shuuichi clasped his hands together and bowed his head lightly.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t really want to clean up the trash at all, but if he was going to give me Battle Stage 6 that I&#8217;ve always wanted, I guess I would just have to do it. Also, he was my only friend who was asking me to do this.</p>
<p>“&#8230;All right. But please make sure you give me the game in return.”</p>
<p>“OHHH! You&#8217;re coming with me! That&#8217;s my best friend!”</p>
<p>With a tear on his handsome face, Shuuichi placed his hands on my shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t grab my shoulders.”</p>
<p>“Again, you&#8217;re being shy.”</p>
<p>“I’m not shy.”</p>
<p>Goodness, he was a bit annoying and good-looking.</p>
<p>&#8230;But if I participate in a volunteer event, Nanase might get involved with me again.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll let Shuuichi take care of it then.</p>
<p>Then I headed to my room to get ready for school.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>After Shuuichi and I arrived at school, I finished homeroom as usual and changed into the school&#8217;s gym clothes to clean up the trash in the city.</p>
<p>So, after we got out of the school, the volunteer event started right away&#8230;</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been betrayed&#8230;”</p>
<p>I was standing alone with a garbage bag in my right hand and a pair of garbage clippers in my left.</p>
<p>Usually, Shuuichi and I would be cleaning the trash while having idle conversations. But this year, however, the homeroom teacher decided to randomly divide the class into groups and have them clean the trash together.</p>
<p>The reason, she said, was that every year when people who are close to each other act together, they just talk and don&#8217;t take cleaning the garbage seriously.</p>
<p>Shuuichi and I were in different classes, also we couldn&#8217;t be in the same group, so we couldn&#8217;t act together anymore.</p>
<p>This alone was bad enough for me, as I had never planned to participate in any volunteer events, but the group our homeroom teacher had divided us into was even worse.</p>
<p>“Hey, Atsushi. I don&#8217;t have time for this.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m with you on that.”</p>
<p>Under the direction of my homeroom teacher, I&#8217;m picking up trash in the city park near the school.</p>
<p>&#8230;However, Ayase and Akutsu were sitting on a bench talking lazily.</p>
<p>“Hey, was there any point in coming today?”</p>
<p>“If I skip this event, the advisor of the club will get mad at me. Worst case scenario, I won&#8217;t be allowed to play in the games.”</p>
<p>While they were having this conversation, they made no pretense of picking up the trash.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t skip out and flirt in the open because the teacher isn’t here.</p>
<p>Well, I was actually going to skip it too, but&#8230;</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness&#8230;:”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself, clutching my head.</p>
<p>I never thought I&#8217;d be in the same group as the top boy and girl in the school caste.</p>
<p>That was a lot of bad luck. &#8230;But my bad luck didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>“Why are you clutching your head?”</p>
<p>I heard a cute voice from next to me.</p>
<p>When I turned around, I saw Nanase looking at me with a smirk, wearing the same gym uniform as Akutsu and Ayase. However, she was wearing her favorite parka over her gym clothes today.</p>
<p>That was right. In the same group, there was Nanase, the famous and problematic girl in the school.</p>
<p>And that was all the members of my group. It was the worst group ever.</p>
<p>And on top of that, when the cleaning started, Nanase went at it once with Ayase, who was trying to skip the cleaning.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t have a headache&#8230;”</p>
<p>“No, no, you&#8217;re lying. You looked like you were in big trouble.”</p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009.jpeg"></img>

<p>Nanase giggled in amusement. What was so funny&#8230;</p>
<p>“But this is rare. Kiritani-kun is often absent from school. I thought you would skip these volunteer events.”</p>
<p>Then she smiled and said something rude.</p>
<p>And frustratingly, I can&#8217;t argue with her because she was right on the money.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m going to pick up the trash by myself, Nanase, you should go to those two.”</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun, you have a funny way of saying things. I don&#8217;t get along with those two very well.”</p>
<p>“I know. I&#8217;m trying to tell you to stay away from me.”</p>
<p>“Right, umu yeah I know—”</p>
<p>But Nanase didn&#8217;t leave me alone at all. She didn&#8217;t understand me at all.</p>
<p>“So, why did you come to school today?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I think I should volunteer and do something good for the world and for others&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Because you&#8217;re always missing school and annoying the teachers?”</p>
<p>Nanase asked in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>Was she that? Was she a genius at irritating people?</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s annoying the teachers. You&#8217;re wearing a parka today, which is against school rules.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s my trademark, that&#8217;s why.”</p>
<p>Nanase replied proudly, puffing out her chest to show off her parka.</p>
<p>What about her trademark violating school rules?</p>
<p>“Hey, you guys. Stop slacking off and pick up your trash.”</p>
<p>Akutsu came up to me, wrinkles creasing his brow.</p>
<p>To be honest, I want to complain about the way he&#8217;s putting himself on a pedestal, but I don&#8217;t have the courage to do that to Akutsu, who was the most powerful male in the class.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ayase, who had been chatting with him earlier, was playing with her gutsy smartphone even though she was volunteering.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry. I&#8217;ll pick up the trash in a minute.”</p>
<p>I immediately apologized and resumed picking up the trash.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? You&#8217;re slacking off too. You&#8217;re a man and you&#8217;re lame.”</p>
<p>Nanase, on the other hand, said so in a completely contentious tone.</p>
<p>What the heck was she doing again&#8230;</p>
<p>“What? You have a problem with what I&#8217;m saying?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, though, I&#8217;m only complaining. Akutsu-kun and Saki, you should pick up the trash, too.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not going to go through all that trouble.”</p>
<p>“Then you have no right to complain about us. Are you stupid, Akutsu-kun?”</p>
<p>When Nanase said exactly what I had been thinking, Akutsu&#8217;s face twisted.</p>
<p>“Who&#8217;s stupid? You&#8217;re really getting carried away.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not getting carried away, but I mean, if you&#8217;re not stupid, pick up the trash.”</p>
<p>The two of them are going at it. It was like they&#8217;re on the edge.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, stop causing trouble near me.</p>
<p>“S-Stop, stop!”</p>
<p>Hurriedly, I stepped between them.</p>
<p>Then Akutsu, who had been staring at Nanase, turned his gaze to me.</p>
<p>“What the heck. You got a problem with me too?”</p>
<p>“N-No way. How could I&#8230;”</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never even been to school properly, and I&#8217;m terrified just thinking about what will happen if I go against Akutsu, who holds the actual power of the boys in our class&#8230;</p>
<p>“Nanase and I will take care of picking up the trash. Akutsu, please take a rest.”</p>
<p>“Wait, why are you&#8230;”</p>
<p>Nanase was about to say something from behind me, but I stopped her with my hand.</p>
<p>Does this girl not know how to read the mood?</p>
<p>“Whoa, someone knows what I am talking about. Was it Kirishima?”</p>
<p>“It’s Kiritani&#8230;”</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a last name that would make me quit a club.<br />
[TLN: I don’t know the joke.]</p>
<p>I mean, I knew he couldn&#8217;t even remember my name.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;d better get that trash picked up. They&#8217;ll give you some free time if you finish early.”</p>
<p>In a good mood, Akutsu said this and went back to the bench where Ayase was sitting.</p>
<p>He sounded like the ultimate self-centeredness.</p>
<p>“Hey, why did you say that?”</p>
<p>Nanase asked in an angry tone.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry. Nanase, if you don&#8217;t want to pick up trash, you can go somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Not that, why didn&#8217;t you tell Akutsu-kun or Saki to clean up?”</p>
<p>“No, I can&#8217;t say that.”</p>
<p>“So Kiritani-kun thinks it&#8217;s right that those two don&#8217;t clean the place?”</p>
<p>“I-It&#8217;s not really like that either&#8230;”</p>
<p>At a loss for words, I sighed heavily.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t think it was a good thing that they&#8217;re skipping cleaning either.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s say I asked Akutsu and Ayase to do the cleaning.</p>
<p>If I do that, the two of them would never clean up.</p>
<p>Because there was a clear power difference between me and them.</p>
<p>It was useless for the weak to try to make the strong listen to them.</p>
<p>Not only would it be useless, but there was a possibility that I might offend the two of them and they take revenge on me</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m treated like a slave every day, I&#8217;ll never go to school again.</p>
<p>“There were times when speaking out about what you want to say or what you think won&#8217;t solve the problem. Even Nanase should understand that.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm.”</p>
<p>Nanase reacted in a boring way, then continued to speak.</p>
<p>“But I think it would be painful if I covered up my feelings like that every time.”</p>
<p>“Gu&#8230;”</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words again.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think what Nanase said was right.</p>
<p>That was why it was probably the last thing I wanted to hear right now.</p>
<p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s better than getting in trouble with Akutsu and Ayase.”</p>
<p>After a few words of defiance, I picked up the trash in the park with tongs and put it in a garbage bag.</p>
<p>Nanase only muttered, &#8220;I see,&#8221; and resumed picking up the trash.</p>
<p>After that, Nanase and I didn&#8217;t talk to each other until we finished cleaning.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s finally over!”</p>
<p>After two hours of cleaning, Nanase raised her hands in happiness as she finished picking up all the trash, including fallen leaves, empty cans and dirty magazines.</p>
<p>The park here was quite large, so it took a while for the two of us to clean up.</p>
<p>Of course, it was definitely better to do it with four people.</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun! High five!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Nanase approached me with her hands raised in the air. What did she want now?</p>
<p>“Hm? Kiritani-kun doesn&#8217;t know about high-fives&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“No, I know about them but, umm&#8230; Isn&#8217;t Nanase angry?”</p>
<p>“Angry? At who?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;At me.”</p>
<p>When I said this, Nanase stared at me and then chuckled.</p>
<p>“Did Kiritani-kun perhaps think that because you were scared of Akutsu-kun, I was angry at you?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a bit of a stretch, but that’s about right. &#8230;Is it not?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not. I&#8217;m a generous person and I wouldn&#8217;t get angry over something like that.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t really know how you feel, and you didn&#8217;t say a word to me while we were cleaning.”</p>
<p>“That was simply me being diligent with cleaning. Otherwise, we would never get done if only us two clean it.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;True.”</p>
<p>“What? Did you want to talk to me?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s never going to happen.”</p>
<p>I shook my head left and right as Nanase asked me with a grin.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I wanted to talk to her. It was just that I was curious because the person who opened up so much to me to me had suddenly stopped talking.</p>
<p>“Okay, here we go. High five!”</p>
<p>“No, no, I won&#8217;t do it.”</p>
<p>I calmly replied to Nanase, who was excitedly asking for a high five.</p>
<p>“Eh~ Why not? Are you embarrassed?”</p>
<p>“No. I just don&#8217;t want to do that with someone I&#8217;m not that close to.”</p>
<p>“Isn&#8217;t that awful!?”</p>
<p>Nanase complained, but it was too much trouble to deal with her forever, so I ignored her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m done cleaning up the park, so now I should get back to school.</p>
<p>I was told that if I delivered the full garbage bags to the teachers in front of the school gate, they would throw them away for me.</p>
<p>“Good work, both of you.”</p>
<p>Akutsu came in looking pompous with his hands in the pockets of his gym uniform pants.</p>
<p>But Ayase was not by his side, and I could not find her on the bench where she had been sitting earlier.</p>
<p>“Umm&#8230;  Ayase is?”</p>
<p>“Saki huh. She&#8217;s&#8230;”</p>
<p>Akutsu slurred his words somewhat awkwardly. &#8230;Hmm? What is it?</p>
<p>“I see. It&#8217;s a girl&#8217;s day.”</p>
<p>Nanase held up her index finger and made a great guess. Oh, so that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s not it! She just went to the bathroom!”</p>
<p>Akutsu desperately denied it, his face turning red.</p>
<p>Apparently, Nanase&#8217;s good guess was way off.</p>
<p>I mean, if it was the bathroom, why not just say it normally? I wonder if he was concerned about Ayase, just in case.</p>
<p>“Goodness, you&#8217;re a freak.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Akutsu-kun!”</p>
<p>“I wasn&#8217;t complimenting you.”</p>
<p>When Nanase was joking around, Akutsu gave her a sharp look.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t ruin the atmosphere with something so trivial.</p>
<p>“Oh well. You guys better take care of that garbage bag.”</p>
<p>“Uh, y-yeah&#8230;”</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement with Akutsu&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been planning to do that all along&#8230;</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Since Kiritani-kun and I did the cleaning, Akutsu and Saki finish it up yourselves.”</p>
<p>Nanase held out the garbage bag in her hand to Akutsu.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s really stubborn. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you say&#8230;</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not going to do it. I&#8217;m too lazy to carry garbage.”</p>
<p>“Me and Kiritani-kun are lazy, too.”</p>
<p>Akutsu shrugged his shoulders in anger and annoyance at Nanase&#8217;s sincere request.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re annoying. Anyway, I won&#8217;t carry it and neither will Saki.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hmm. Oh, yeah.”</p>
<p>Nanase finally stopped talking back at Akutsu&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>I wonder if she&#8217;s given up for good.</p>
<p>Well, nothing good would happen if she provoked Akutsu any further.</p>
<p>I think it was the right choice.</p>

<p>“Take this—!”</p>

<p>Just when I thought Nanase had finally made a sane decision, she threw the trash bag she was carrying directly at Akutsu.</p>
<p>The trash bag, fired at close range, was a critical hit to Akutsu&#8217;s vitals.</p>
<p>The contents of the garbage bag are plastic bottles and cans, so it must hurt a lot.</p>
<p>&#8230;Wait, what is she doing!?</p>
<p>“O-Ouch&#8230;!?”</p>
<p>Akutsu, who had fallen, was mumbling to himself, his face contorted.</p>
<p>Apparently, Nanase&#8217;s garbage bag had damaged his vital parts.</p>
<p>Wow, that looks painful&#8230;</p>
<p>“W-What are you&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Look, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re the ace or captain of the basketball team, but don&#8217;t get carried away just because you&#8217;re a little bit good-looking and athletic!”</p>
<p>Nanase said, looking down at Akutsu, who was still lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Then she turned to me.</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun, give me that.”</p>
<p>She pointed at the garbage bag from my hand and placed it beside Akutsu.</p>
<p>Oh goodness, is Nanase insane?</p>
<p>“Akutsu-kun, take care of the garbage bag!”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled at Akutsu, who was crouched near the two garbage bags.</p>
<p>Then Akutsu, still unable to move, looked at me in a fierce manner.</p>
<p>“Nanase, you better remember&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry~! I&#8217;m so forgetful!”</p>
<p>Nanase clasped her hands together and made an annoying ‘Tehe’ face.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how she could do that in this situation&#8230;</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun! Let&#8217;s go!”</p>
<p>“What, let&#8217;s go where&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“I mean, go back to school!”</p>
<p>“B-But&#8230;</p>
<p>“Come on, come on!”</p>
<p>Nanase grabbed my hand and pulled me along with her.</p>
<p>“W-Wait a second!?”</p>
<p>Even though I called out to her, Nanase did not stop at all.</p>
<p>Although I had only been involved with her for a few days, she gave me a slightly wild impression on me.</p>
<p>But her hands were small and white, as expected of a girl&#8217;s hand, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never even held hands with a girl before, and my heart was beating pathetically.</p>
<p>Nanase, on the other hand, was moving forward with a twinkle in her eye, probably happy that Akutsu was able to give her a break.</p>
<p>I should have known that nothing good would happen if I got involved with her.</p>
<p>Even as I thought this, I couldn&#8217;t help but think how cool her back was as she pushed forward.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>“The look on Akutsu-kun&#8217;s face earlier was a masterpiece.”</p>
<p>A short time after we left the park.</p>
<p>We were walking along a path lined with cherry blossom trees that leads to Seiran High School, which we usually take on our way to and from school.</p>
<p>“It truly was a masterpiece, wait no it wasn’t. Because of Nanase, I may have caught Akutsu&#8217;s attention too.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s great!”</p>
<p>“Can you please not respond to me like that? It&#8217;s not great at all.”</p>
<p>I sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“You know, I&#8217;ve always wondered why you keep trying to get involved with me.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a terrible way to put it. I&#8217;m just trying to get to know the person sitting next to me.”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Nanase said to me, but I wonder if that’s really true. Well, she usually gets involved with people she&#8217;s never met before, so it&#8217;s not completely implausible&#8230;</p>
<p>“Can I ask you one more question?”</p>
<p>“Hm, hm? Are you that curious about me?”</p>
<p>“Then I won&#8217;t ask anymore.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I&#8217;m just kidding! Ask me anything!”</p>
<p>Nanase smiled and placed her hand on her chest.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t want more useless conversations every time I talk to her.</p>
<p>“You always seem to act on what you think, but do you ever think about other people or your own situation?”</p>
<p>In the case of Tachibana and today&#8217;s incident, Nanase always acts without reading the atmosphere or the situation.</p>
<p>Because of that, I was mixed into their affairs unwillingly.</p>
<p>Especially today&#8217;s volunteer event. I&#8217;ve offended Akutsu, and tomorrow I may be his target for revenge&#8230;</p>
<p>“I said something similar when I was cleaning up in the park, but if you don&#8217;t be honest with yourself, you&#8217;ll suffer from a lot of constrictions.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s true, but don&#8217;t we sometimes need to adapt to the atmosphere?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t believe so.”</p>
<p>In response to my question, Nanase said firmly.</p>
<p>“Because you don&#8217;t have to bend what you think is right to fit in with others.”</p>
<p>“T-That’s&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Besides, life is definitely more interesting when you&#8217;re always being yourself!”</p>
<p>Nanase said with a beautiful, cloudless smile on her face.</p>
<p>I was speechless.</p>
<p>I knew she was right, because that&#8217;s what I thought as well.</p>
<p>But just doing the right thing doesn&#8217;t always work in this world&#8230;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Haa, Nanase is still a problem child.”</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun, I can hear you.”</p>
<p>I took a small breath as I looked at Nanase who was giving me the stink eye.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that I would be pushed around by Nanase Rena in the future.</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>A few days had passed since the day of the volunteer event.</p>
<p>I thought that Akutsu would take notice of me and I would become his slave, but surprisingly that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>The reason was simple: his hate was directed more at Nanase than at me.</p>
<p>However, I try to stay away from Akutsu as much as possible because I would get shot at if I came face to face with him.</p>
<p>By the way, the game I was supposed to get from Shuuichi when I went to volunteer, Battle Stage 6, was not there. Shuuichi had Battle Stage 3, which was not the game I wanted. I still got it, but I didn&#8217;t need it at all.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I volunteered that day, but I did&#8230;</p>
<p>“Onii-chan! It&#8217;s about to start!”</p>
<p>Suddenly my sister, Momoka, called out to me.</p>
<p>We didn’t have school today, and Momoka and I had come to a theater hall near the nearest station to our house to watch a play. The seating capacity was about 1,000, which was about medium-sized.</p>
<p>Originally, Momoka was supposed to come with a friend, but the friend had something to do and as her brother, I decided to go with Momoka instead.</p>
<p>I really wanted to stay home and slack off, but my sister insisted, so I had no choice but to come here. The look from mom was painful&#8230;</p>
<p>“So, what&#8217;s the play we&#8217;re watching today?”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s see, it&#8217;s called &#8216;The Maid&#8217;s Excellent Deduction&#8217;. I think it&#8217;s a mystery.”</p>
<p>Momoka explained as she opened a pamphlet.</p>
<p>My sister&#8217;s hobbies are reading novels, watching movies, plays, and the like. That&#8217;s why, as her brother,, I often went along with my sister&#8217;s hobbies like this.</p>
<p>It was not that I wanted to hang out with her, it was just that she was always forcing me to go out with her&#8230;</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re going to watch plays and stuff, why not read manga too?”</p>
<p>“No, because I don&#8217;t know anything about battles.”</p>
<p>Manga&#8217;s aren’t only about battles&#8230;</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, the buzzer suddenly sounded and the venue went dark.</p>
<p>It looked like the play was about to start.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Momoka and I were seated in the front row. We could enjoy the actors&#8217; performance right in front of us.</p>
<p>“Onii-chan! This is gonna be fun!”</p>
<p>“I-I guess&#8230;”</p>
<p>Thanks to this play, Momoka&#8217;s eyes were sparkling next to me.</p>
<p>Then only the stage was lit, and the curtain slowly opened.</p>
<p>Then a mansion-like set and two women appeared.</p>
<p>One of them was a woman in her twenties, dressed as a maid.</p>
<p>And the other one was wearing a maid&#8217;s uniform as well—</p>
<p>“&#8230;!”</p>
<p>The moment I saw her, I was astonished.</p>
<p>“Hey, Onii-chan, your mouth is hanging open. I&#8217;m embarrassed, please stop.”</p>
<p>Momoka gave me a warning, but I couldn&#8217;t even close my mouth.</p>
<p>Because on the stage was the most famous person and problematic person in school who had a track record of doing whatever they felt like doing — Nanase Rena.</p>
<p>&#8230;What the heck is she doing here?</p>
<p>　　◇◇◇</p>
<p>“But I was surprised.”</p>
<p>The next day at lunchtime. I muttered to myself as I ate an egg sandwich I bought at the store.</p>
<p>After going to see the play with Momoka, I did some research out of curiosity and found out that Nanase Rena was apparently an actor who belonged to the theater company “Yunagi” we were at.</p>
<p>According to information on the Internet, “Yunagi” was a theater company that was just established five years ago, and is mainly active in the area where we live.</p>
<p>The company has been gradually gaining popularity since its opinion and is now attracting attention.</p>
<p>It seems that there are about forty members of the group, both men and women with youngest being in their teens and oldest in their forties.</p>
<p>According to her profile on the official website of ‘Yunagi’, Nanase joined the theater company shortly before she entered high school.</p>
<p>“I never thought Nanase was an actor.”</p>
<p>Honestly, she didn’t feel like one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more like if I only saw her in her normal form, I&#8217;d wonder how she could even act.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve actually seen her act with my own eyes, and I think she was really good&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about acting, but at least she was completely on par with the other performers.</p>
<p>“That girl must have been amazing.”</p>
<p>I mumbled to myself and took a bite of my egg sandwich.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m having lunch by myself. I sometimes eat with Shuuichi, but he&#8217;s usually with his girlfriend, so I&#8217;m basically alone most of the time during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Or rather, even when Shuuichi invites me out, I decline.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to interrupt my friend&#8217;s love life as a guy who doesn&#8217;t even attend school properly.</p>
<p>&#8230;So, being alone was the usual, but there was a problem with where I was having lunch.</p>
<p>I usually eat in my seat in the classroom, and if anything, I&#8217;ve spent about 90% of my high school lunch breaks in my seat.</p>
<p>And yet I&#8217;m having lunch in an empty classroom in the old Seiran High School building, which is separate from the main building.</p>
<p>Moreover, as it was an old building, there was a breeze coming in from somewhere, making it slightly cold.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why basically no one comes here.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Haaa, it&#8217;s still cold here.”</p>
<p>I blurted out as I continued to eat my egg sandwich.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m spending my lunch at the old school building is Akutsu.</p>
<p>Since the day of the volunteer event, he hasn&#8217;t done anything to me directly, but he sometimes stares at me when I&#8217;m in the classroom, which is pretty scary.</p>
<p>Especially during the lunch break, Akutsu was also having lunch with his friends in the classroom, which made things awkward.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve taken refuge in this gloomy place. </p>
<p>This will be where I&#8217;ll spend all my lunch breaks until graduation&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m only coming to school for the minimum amount required, so I could put up with this.</p>
<p>“But this classroom. Why are there so many books in this classroom?”</p>
<p>As I looked around the room, I saw a large number of books lined up or stacked on bookshelves and desks. They were of various genres, including novels and magazines.</p>
<p>“Hmm? This is&#8230;”</p>
<p>In the midst of the large number of books, one book suddenly caught my attention.</p>
<p>It was a book about acting. Why a book about acting?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking this, the door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>W-Who…?</p>
<p>I turned around, startled.</p>
<p>“Huh? Kiritani-kun?”</p>
<p>It was Nanase, to my surprise, who walked into the empty classroom. She was carrying her lunch box, and she was wearing her trademark white parka over her blouse.</p>
<p>“Nanase, why are you here&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s my line. Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been&#8230; going through a lot of things.”</p>
<p>If I said something like I was uncomfortable because Akutsu was in the classroom, Nanase, who started it all, might be bothered, so I muddled my words.</p>
<p>“And why is Nanase here?”</p>
<p>“Me? I&#8217;m eating lunch here.”</p>
<p>As she said this, Nanase took a seat next to me and untied the knot in the wrapping of her lunch box.</p>
<p>You just sat next to me without a second thought. Well, I don&#8217;t mind&#8230;</p>
<p>“Do you always eat lunch here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I&#8217;ve spent most of my lunch breaks here since first year.”</p>
<p>“Since first year&#8230; could it be that everything in this room is Nanase&#8217;s personal belongings?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right~”</p>
<p>When I asked, Nanase replied in a tone like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>“No one uses this place. I keep it to myself.”</p>
<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>
<p>Even though it is an empty classroom, Nanase is probably the only person in the world who would turn a school classroom into her room without permission. It&#8217;s just like her, I guess.</p>
<p>“Ah, by the way, you saw me yesterday, right?”</p>
<p>“Eh? What are you talking about all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m saying you came to see it yesterday, right? The play I&#8217;m in.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I wondered how I should respond to the sudden topic.</p>
<p>If it was something Nanase wanted to hide, I would pretend I didn&#8217;t know about it, but since she&#8217;s been so open about it, I guess I don&#8217;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but&#8230; gah, you noticed me?”</p>
<p>“You were in the front row, you know. I noticed you rather quickly.”</p>
<p>“I-I see&#8230;”</p>
<p>I also noticed Nanase on the stage at once.</p>
<p>It should not be at all surprising that she noticed me, too.</p>
<p>“Do you like theater, Kiritani-kun?”</p>
<p>“No, I&#8217;m not. My sister just asked me to go with her yesterday and I went along. She likes those kinds of things.”</p>
<p>“Kiritani-kun has a sister! I wish I had a brother or a sister too~”</p>
<p>Nanasese looks at me with envious eyes.</p>
<p>Apparently, she doesn&#8217;t have any siblings.</p>
<p>As someone who has a younger sister, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good to have siblings.</p>
<p>My sister wants me to go to school every day&#8230;</p>
<p>“So, do our classmates know that Nanase is an actor?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think they know. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m hiding anything, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that only very few people in the school know about it.”</p>
<p>“Eh, really?”</p>
<p>“I joined a theater company just before I entered high school, but it&#8217;s only recently that I&#8217;ve been able to play a real role on stage, like yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Is that so&#8230;”</p>
<p>I was thinking that Nanase must be having a hard time, when she suddenly remembered something and shouted, &#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Hey, hey! What did you think of my performance?”</p>
<p>Nanase asked with an expectant look in her eyes.</p>
<p>Does this mean she wants a compliment? Well, her performance was amazing&#8230;</p>
<p>“U-Umm&#8230; I don&#8217;t know much about acting, but I think you did a great job.”</p>
<p>“For real!?”</p>
<p>Nanase brings her face close to mine with a goofy smile.</p>
<p>Whoa, that&#8217;s too close.</p>
<p>“F-For real.”</p>
<p>“Well~ I&#8217;m happy to hear that!”</p>
<p>Nanase was smiling and in a good mood.</p>
<p>She seemed to be very happy with the compliment.</p>
<p>“But to be honest, I was surprised. I had no idea Nanase was an actor.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not that big of a deal, though. I&#8217;m just being put on a play for a theater company I&#8217;m in.”</p>
<p>“I still think it&#8217;s amazing. &#8230;Nanase wants to be more famous?”</p>
<p>When I asked her, Nanase looked a little thoughtful.</p>
<p>Then she turned to me and stared.</p>

<p>“Actually, my dream is to be a Hollywood actress.”</p>

<p>She told me so with a serious expression.</p>
<p>I was momentarily at a loss for a response to the sudden and unexpected words that came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hollywood actress, that’s a very lofty goal.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? But I read in some book that the bigger your dreams are, the richer your life will be.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t have the faintest idea what kind of book that is&#8230;”</p>
<p>Well, even if I knew, I wouldn&#8217;t read a hundred percent of it.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of books in this room, does this have anything to do with Nanase&#8217;s dream?”</p>
<p>I asked her while looking at the books around me, and she nodded her head.</p>
<p>“During my lunch break or after school when I don&#8217;t have rehearsals with the theater company, I come to this classroom and practice acting by myself, or read novels to broaden my senses.”</p>
<p>After listening to what Nanase had to say, I picked up one of the books on the desk nearby. It was a romance novel.</p>
<p>When I skimmed the contents, I was surprised.</p>
<p>The novel had pages and pages of detailed discussions about what kind of acting she should do if she were to actually act out the interactions between the characters.</p>
<p>Nanase had written this down, and maybe similar notes were written in all the books in this room. That was enough for me to know how serious she was about her dream.</p>
<p>“You’re serious about being a Hollywood actress.”</p>
<p>“You didn&#8217;t think I was joking, did you? That&#8217;s horrible, Kiritani-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase was pouting and started to get angry.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think it was a joke, but I didn&#8217;t expect her to be this serious about it.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kiritani-kun, do you have any dreams for the future?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Nanase threw a question at me.</p>
<p>“Why so sudden?”</p>
<p>“I told you about my dream, so I thought it was Kiritani-kun&#8217;s turn to talk about it.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to know about that in the first place.”</p>
<p>She usually just goes ahead and does what she thinks is best&#8230;</p>
<p>“So, Kiritani-kun, what is your dream?”</p>
<p>“Dreams&#8230; You don&#8217;t have dreams when you&#8217;re in high school.”</p>
<p>I also had dreams when I was in kindergarten and elementary school.</p>
<p>&#8230;But I don&#8217;t have any dreams now that I&#8217;m more aware of things.</p>
<p>“Even if I have a dream, more often than not, it won&#8217;t come true.”</p>
<p>After I muttered this, I immediately realized my mistake.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry&#8230;”</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t have to apologize. What you&#8217;re saying is true, Kiritani-kun.”</p>
<p>Nanase says so, but I made an unbelievable statement in front of someone who is seriously trying to make her dream come true. &#8230;Haha, I feel like dying right now.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s true that most dreams don&#8217;t come true, but you know what, when you have a dream, you can always be who you are.”</p>
<p>“Who you are&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“In short, it means you can be yourself!”</p>
<p>Nanase stated firmly.</p>
<p>If you have a dream, you can be yourself, huh.</p>
<p>Is that why she is always able to act as she pleases, without worrying about others or her own position?</p>
<p>“Ah, by the way, Kiritani-kun. I&#8217;ve got a favor to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Something you want me to do? I don&#8217;t want to.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don&#8217;t turn me down before I say what it is.”</p>
<p>Nanase gave me a vigorous tsukkomi.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&#8217;t look like she&#8217;s going to ask me for something too difficult&#8230;</p>
<p>“Then I guess I could at least hear you out&#8230; What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>I asked fearfully.</p>
<p>“Didn&#8217;t I tell you earlier that I practice by myself in this empty classroom?”</p>
<p>“Yeah you did.”</p>
<p>“But you know, when I&#8217;m by myself, I can practice, but I feel like I&#8217;m progressing slowly or it&#8217;s hard to do.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well, theater isn&#8217;t something you do alone.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like Kiritani-kun to accompany me in my practice from now on. Specifically, I&#8217;d like you to say lines for characters other than the ones I&#8217;m playing. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p>Nanase clasped her hands together and striked a begging pose.</p>
<p>But I’m going to have to refuse.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t hear anything. Can you say it again?”</p>
<p>“Um, I said I’m not—”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I didn&#8217;t hear you again. One more time—”</p>
<p>“You definitely heard me right!?”</p>
<p>“Ah, did you just say you&#8217;d help me?”</p>
<p>“I never said that! Don&#8217;t make things up!”</p>
<p>Ah, god. Is she trying to get me to go along with her practice at any cost?</p>
<p>“&#8230;can I go back to class?”</p>
<p>“S-Stop! Hold on! I just want to talk to you one more time!”</p>
<p>As I left my seat, she frantically held me back.</p>
<p>“It may seem like I&#8217;m joking, but I&#8217;m serious about becoming a Hollywood actress.”</p>
<p>“I never thought you&#8217;re joking, though&#8230;”</p>
<p>I understood how serious Nanase was about her dream by the amount of books in this classroom and the amount of notes in the books I saw earlier.</p>
<p>“So please! Please come with me to my practice!”</p>
<p>“Why does it have to be me? What about your friends?”</p>
<p>“I have a few fans here and there, but not so many friends&#8230;”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the words broke off.</p>
<p>I guess that meant she didn&#8217;t have any close friends that she could casually ask for help.</p>
<p>It was understandable. She was a famous troublemaker in the school.</p>
<p>“All right. I&#8217;ll help you if you want.”</p>
<p>“Really! Yay!”</p>
<p>Nanase did a guts pose with joy.</p>
<p>To be honest, I could have said no, but I couldn&#8217;t easily say no to someone who was so desperate.</p>
<p>“But only on the days I go to school. I only come to school on days when I can get credit.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s totally fine! &#8230;But I see. You&#8217;re not skipping school without a plan, are you, Kiritani-kun?”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me I’m slacking.”</p>
<p>When I argued back, Nanase chuckled at me. She&#8217;s so rude.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, Nanase unexpectedly grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>This caused my heart rate to go through the roof.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you! I&#8217;m counting on you, Kiritani-kun!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re expecting from me though.”</p>
<p>After I replied, I quickly moved away from her.</p>
<p>I really want her to stop the abrupt body touching. It&#8217;s bad for my heart.</p>
<p>This was how I came to accompany Nanase in her acting practice.</p>
<p>To be honest, normally, I would have said no, but this time I thought it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to cooperate with Nanase, who was strangely serious about her dream.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t think at the time that this would be the start of a major change in my life.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;>◆◆◆</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m glad I could get Kiritani-kun to help me.”</p>
<p>The location remained the same, an empty classroom in an old school building.</p>
<p>After finishing my lunch, I muttered to myself as I read the script for &#8220;The Maid&#8217;s Excellent Deduction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m checking the script and reflecting on yesterday&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Kiritani-kun, who had finished his lunch, went back to the classroom first.</p>
<p>We talked about so many things that we almost ran out of time, so I decided to ask Kiritani-kun to help me practice my performance tomorrow and in the future.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of acting skills Kiritani-kun has.”</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I should say this, but it doesn&#8217;t look like he is doing very well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like playing a part in a school presentation in elementary school, like a tree or grass that barely speaks.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t checked with him, but I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>“Kuchu, I was imagining Kiritani-kun playing the role of the tree, and I laughed out loud.”</p>
<p>I imagined it, and it looked pretty good on him. It was also pretty cute.</p>
<p>“But Kiritani-kun cooperated surprisingly easily.”</p>
<p>I really thought he would be more reluctant.</p>
<p>Kiritani-kun may seem bland, but he&#8217;s pretty gentle on the inside.</p>
<p>When he came to school for the first time, Saki and I had a small but loud argument in which I almost got slapped, and he saved me.</p>
<p>In any case, I&#8217;m really glad that Kiritani-kun agreed to help me with my acting practice.</p>
<p>Of course, it was partially to improve the quality of my performance practice, but that wasn&#8217;t the only reason why I asked him to help me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a little over a week since I started interacting with him, and I was thinking again.</p>

<p>I knew it, Kiritani-kun was just like “her”.</p>

<p>If this continues, I&#8217;m sure Kiritani-kun will regret it someday.</p>
<p>So for a week, I&#8217;ve been trying to get involved with Kiritani-kun as much as I can, and I&#8217;ve been trying to make sure that he doesn&#8217;t go down the same path as &#8220;her&#8221;.</p>
<p>By showing Kiritani-kun the part of me that makes me, me.</p>
<p>&#8230;But unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t see much change in Kiritani-kun.</p>
<p>So I decided to spend more time with Kiritani-kun by asking him to accompany me to my acting practice.</p>
<p>This is the other reason why I asked Kiritani-kun to accompany me to my acting practice.</p>
<p>I can be my best self when I&#8217;m acting, so I want him to watch me carefully.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want Kiritani-kun to become like “her”.</p>
