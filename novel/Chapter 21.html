<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Quickly Becoming Stronger in the Dungeon! Last</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the direct damage towards the dragon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fists tore through its scales, ripped open its muscles and landed at the bones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the bones shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a snap, the sensation of the bones crushing reverberated through my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the mass of magical energy burst through the dragon’s body in waves of impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an uncomfortable echo of tearing throughout the hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Likely, the internal organs of the guardian were now wasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the giant catfish, it had not opened up a crater-like hole and exploded into bits of organs, blood, and flesh in every direction. Probably due to the impressive strength of the scales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with a loud smash, the body of the golden dragon thundered to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in that position, it vomited blood and began to convulse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, I was experiencing dizziness, like the symptom of having lost too much blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a pounding headache as my knees gave in. I was now covered in a greasy sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—That was cutting it pretty close… Had I not been able to finish it in a single blow…I would have been toast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My shoulders heave up and down as I breathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I stand up again and look at the fallen dragon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again and again, I take in a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With each time, the pain lessens a little more, and after several minutes I was somehow able to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I picked up the fallen ax from the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walk over to the dragon’s neck and raise the ax high into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My gaze moved over to Lilith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be so easy for me to deal the finishing blow here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lilith? Are you really okay with this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Yes. This what father had been wishing for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, then… I continued with an uncertain expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you crying then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears had not stopped running down her face for a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were like large pearls that fell to the ground and created patterns with their stains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean, you don’t know…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“………I really don’t know why….why I am crying. My father is already dead. In that case, it would be better…to have you…to have someone young, kill him so he can become a Dragon God… That is what happiness is for dragons….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brooded over this. Then, looking back at the dragon—-I swung the ax downward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It went right into the back of the dragon’s brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon convulsed strongly, but even now, it hadn’t reached its limits of being able to act as an undead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you crying…was it? This ceremony is holy to the dragons, none of them ever question it, all of them accept this as being normal, do they not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Yes. They become spirits and ascend into godhood. It is something to celebrate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But in spite of this, you are crying…Is it perhaps because you are human?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even among humans, differences in skin color or religion could prevent people from understanding each other, making them attack one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if both were intelligent beings, dragonkin, and humans…There were obvious differences in thinking and feeling that had nothing to do with how they were educated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Because I am human?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case, Lilith should…It would surely be best to have this funeral end in a human fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case…you must deal the finishing blow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was always the relatives of the deceased who closed the casket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, he had fought for all that he was worth as Lilith’s father… In that way, it was also validated as dragon’s funeral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Me? If I did…surely the blessing of the dragon god skill will not go to you, but to me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You shouldn’t worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“….but….you….You are standing here as the result of an extraordinary resolve and determination. Then, you absolutely must become stronger. I cannot receive the skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed deeply and opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many other ways to become stronger. But…the funeral can only happen once. In the end…how can anyone but you, send your own father to the afterlife?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought for a moment before wiping away the tears that flowed from her eyes with her sleeve. Then she nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…..Ultimately, I still don’t know why I am crying. But…I shall send him off…the meaning of those words…I was able to understand them with my heart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith thrust out the palms of her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were directed towards the giant ax that I had just cleaved into its head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic she would use was an electric shock spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attack that would pass through the metal and hit the brain directly—no matter how powerful a dragon was, having its whole nervous system fried would surely put an end to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Father. Thank you for…taking care of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued with all the emotion that she felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I was so happy…being gently raised by you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electricity struck, and the dragon’s movements stopped completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tightly wrapped my arms around Lilith’s shoulders as she was about to crumble to the ground in tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“….Now I truly have no one else in this world…it’s a little…lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sobbed soundlessly as she buried her head in my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so I gently caressed her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a bad thing to cry… It will make you feel better if your cry for a while. So cry as much…as you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“….Yes. Let me stay like this for a moment…please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I could not tell just how long we stayed like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt like it could have been a few minutes, but it also felt like much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was certain, was that Lilith had calmed down a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And perhaps it was due to her crying, but her eyes were now red and puffy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, then…we should leave soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith nodded and opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out the status plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was to see how much experience and levels I gained from this last fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I stopped in shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What does this…mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My eyes widened as I did a double check, but no, the skill was recorded there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do I have the skill?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-SKILL: Dragon God’s Blessing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The precious skill that raised your minimum status was really there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I showed Lilith the plate, and she too widened her eyes in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…But the last blow was dealt by…me…how come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she gasped and took out her own status plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Huh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shook her head to the side as if she did not understand what she was looking at, then she handed over the status plate to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the…hell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-SKILL: Guardian Spirit of the Dragon God</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gives tremendous resistance to bad statuses. Greatly alters your growth rate. Adds +500 to all statuses, Attack power, Defense power, Magic and Evasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I and Lilith looked each other long and hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we broke out into laughter right on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, I see…so that’s what it means.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…What does it mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilith asked with a suspicious expression. I answered her with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It means that your father…was that much of a doting parent. As proof, he even left his daughter a cheat skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So what does that mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lilith… Didn’t you just say…that you had no one in the world and that you were lonely?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I make a fist with my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with it, I knocked on the center of her flat chest—where her heart was and said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Your father is right here…he is there with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Lilith finally understood the meaning of the words, she erupted into tears once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You really are…quite a crybaby, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so I pulled Lilith by the hand and said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now…let’s go home.”</span></p>
