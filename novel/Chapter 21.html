<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer â‘ </h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
see, so the Hooded Elf is the Adventurer Killer."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
red-haired Miya, who had given me the burn medicine as a gift, suddenly
appeared in the inn suite room where we stayed and fell on the floor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the same time, the misanga tied to her left arm was torn off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
cause of her sudden appearance in the room must be the "SSR, the Praying
Misanga" I had given her as a thank you for the burn medicine.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
the dirt on Miya's clothes and the wound on her leg, I immediately realized
that something terrible had happened.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
healing her wounds and cleaning the dirt with the "Cleaning" card, I
used the "Hypnosis" card to get more information.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"SR,
Hypnosis is a card that allows you to hypnotize your opponent, manipulate, and
extract information from them. However, it does not work well on someone with a
high level. The blank expression on the target face while hypnotized makes it
easy for a third party to detect the abnormality at a glance. It's not an
all-purpose card."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
I used it because it was very effective in extracting information from a
low-level person like Miya.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
she lay on the couch, I finished extracting information from her about what had
happened.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
hooded elf that called himself "<i class="calibre7">Boku-sama</i>"
had attacked and killed the adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
girl was also attacked by the hooded elf, her brothers died, and she
desperately tried to escape to inform me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the end, she was caught and almost killed - that's when "SSR, The Praying
Misanga" was activated, and she transferred to this place and saved.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
don't know what happened to her brother and the others after that.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
extracting the necessary information from her, I put her to sleep with the
"SR, Sleep" card.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
SR Sleep card is not particularly useful, as it does not work well against
high-level opponents.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
it would keep her asleep for 24 hours.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
let out a light sigh as I finished listening to her story.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
only thing that could have caused Miya-chan to show up in our room is the power
of the SSR, the Praying Misanga.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
think it's because she strongly wished to tell me the information while her
life was in danger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
didn't expect to find out the effects of the SSR Prayer Misanga in this
way.......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
"SSR, the Praying Misanga" was tested in Naraku, but all of the tests
were unsuccessful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
explanation given in the appraisal was very vague: "It is an item that can
cause small miracles by wishing strongly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
what Miya told me, this "strong wish" means that one must wish very
strongly. Like a wish when the user's life is in danger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
just too difficult to use.......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
its power is very strong.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
tell me the information, she jumped across space and appeared at my inn that I
had never told her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
no wonder it has SSR gacha rank, and the description says it can make a small
miracle.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"So,
Lord, what are we going to do now?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......Isn't
it obvious? We're planning to catch the Adventurer Killer to improve our rank,
and now we've got a clue."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We've
become the full-fledged adventurer, but it's difficult to raise our rank any
further.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not that the Adventurer's Guild discriminates against us; it's just that we
haven't been active as adventurers long enough to raise our ranks any further.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
only conditions for raising our ranks are that we must have been adventurers
for at least a year or have an achievement that are recognized by society.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
"Adventurer Killer" for which a bounty would be offered this time was
a perfect opportunity to get such an achievement.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Beside......
Erio, Gimra and Wardy are not people who deserve this kind of unreasonable
treatment. I only met them for a few days and didn't have many conversations
with them. But Erio and his friends worked hard as adventurers, trying to save
money for his sister in this racist world. Even though they were trying their
best to live in this unreasonable world......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gimra
is a frivolous person who seemed to say everything on his mind. I knew that
behind his words and actions, he is actually concerned about his friends.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Wardy
is quiet and rarely spoke, but I knew that he always watched out for his
friends to avoid any danger in the dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
is the person I feel the closest to.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
is an older brother with a younger sister and has a weak spot for her, just like
me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
cherished Miya and fought together for her future.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And
most of all..... I lowered my voice and muttered.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
thought if we had met in a different way, we could have become
friends......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
had a revenge mission that I had to accomplish and a mission to find out the
truth about why people were being killed just because they aren't the Master.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
apart from that, I felt a certain familiarity with them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
we had met somewhere in peaceful days when we are just commoners, maybe we
could have become friends.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
that wish was nothing but a faint bubble.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Raito-sama...."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
unintentionally said my real name.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
holds her chest with both hands as if her heart stabbed by a knife, and her
tears well up in her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
seems to be empathizing with my grief and taking it as her own pain.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
magma-like emotions are rising up from the bottom of my heart. As if to dispel Nemumu's
grief, I leak out my voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Catch
him, and then turn him to the Adventurer Guild, and giving a chance for the
elven royal family to interfere? No, I won't do that. I won't let him get away.
I swear in my name."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
clench my fists.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
will never forgive the man who continues to kill humans for his own desires.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
will definitely kill him. Let's get all the evidence and the testimony, make
him taste the pain that Erio and the others experienced. Then I will kill him
with my own hands. I'll make sure he pays his crime of killing Erio and the
other adventurers!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
could hear the air in the room squeaking.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">My
magma-like anger and murderous intent are overflowing from my body, interfering
with the air and making it squeak.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
Miya hadn't been asleep and had looked directly at me, it would have stopped
her heart.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
hooded elf had irritated me that much.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
call out my subordinates without turning around.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gold,
Nemumu, do you understand? We're going to find this 'adventurer killer'
ourselves before the other adventurers find him."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
and Nemumu immediately kneeled down on the spot and bowed to me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
wiped her tears. With the cold but beautiful face and voice of a supreme
assassin, she speaks as if she offers her soul to God.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"In
the name of Raito-sama, the Lord to whom I owe absolute loyalty, Nemumu the
Assassin Blade swears to hunt him like a hound from hell!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
a knight's role model, Gold is kneeling down and bowing his head, offering his
loyalty once again to the "Lord" he had truly trusted in and admired.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gold,
the Golden Knight. In the spirit of golden chivalry, I will use my shield to
protect and my blade to strike down any enemy that stands in my Lord's way!
Golden loyalty to the King!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
looked down at the two kneeling in front of me and put on my "clown
mask" again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Let's
go find a stupid elf that's so arrogant that he thinks he can play with human
lives .... Let's kill this Adventurer Killer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
you wish, Raito-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
you wish, my Lord!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
immediately prepare to hunt the "Adventurer Killer".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
got our gear ready in a few moments, and Miya, who was sleeping on the sofa,
was transferred to Naraku using SSR Transfer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
told May about the situation and asked her to treat Miya as a guest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
will not wake up for 24 hours because of the SR Sleep effect, but it is not
good to leave her alone in the inn. That's why I left her in Naraku.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
all the preparations, we are heading to the dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dungeons are open 24 hours a day. There are only a few adventurers who come and
go late at night.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
entered the dungeon as usual.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Tonight
the stars are glowing beautifully inside the dungeon as if they are linked to
the outside world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
moved to a secluded place.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"SSR
Clairvoyance."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
SSR Clairvoyance is a card that allows the user to find and see a distant
object. However, it can't find things that the user doesn't know about or is
too far away.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thinking
of the information Miya had given me, I am using the SSR Clairvoyance to find
the hooded elf that had attacked them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There
he is. He seems to have gone back to the place where Erio and the others felled,
looking for something. Maybe he thinks Miya-chan might be back to that
place."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Once
I found him, I don't have to worry about missing him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Once
again, I declare.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
found our prey. Now, let start hunting the Adventurer Killer."</span></p>
