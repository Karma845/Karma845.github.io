<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Love Can Drive People Crazy</h3>

<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">[Takai Yumi's POV]</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the morning, Takai came to school to check the desk situation and found a white envelope under his desk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was an ordinary female student, I would have thought it was a love letter. But Takai remembered the harassment that happened to Yuki and Uehara earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it my turn this time?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai calmed down as he talked about others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Couldn't separate it now. So to confirm the contents, he took out the white envelope under his desk and walked towards the toilet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the toilet room, Takai opened the envelope to confirm the contents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Inside was a white sticky note and a photo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The photo captured what Takai looked like when he invited Yuki into his house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It looks like I was secretly followed and photographed on the day I went to karaoke with everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, I opened the folded note and looked at the contents above.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;There is something I want to say about this photo. I'm waiting for you under the water tower on the roof of the school building after school today.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was no sender's name on the note.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai regretted that his vigilance was too low, and he was so careless that he did not realize that he was being followed near his house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was only Yuki who entered his house, then he could find some reasons to justify it. But perhaps some people would doubt Takai and Yuki's relationship because of this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This would not only cause trouble for Yuki, but also make Uehara sad. Only this one should be avoided.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It looks like I can only go there after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If there was no photo of him with Yuki, Takai intended to ignore the contents of the note. But since the other party was holding the photo, there was no other choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Takai who didn't go to the library came to the roof of the school building.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Passed by the library and climbed the stairs. Opening the door, the sunlight coming in made Takai squint his eyes. Walking to the deserted roof, I found a figure near the water tower in the distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Are you the one who put the envelope on my desk&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Waiting for her there was her classmate Saori Ishiyama. Although there had been no intersection with Ishiyama so far, what was the purpose of summoning herself in such a roundabout way? Takai knew nothing about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, I suddenly called you, Takai-san. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Contrary to what he said, Ishiyama did not mean to apologize at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So, what's wrong with me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai didn't take a stance of blaming Ishiyama, and calmly told the truth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll ask straight to the point now, is Takai-san dating Touyama-kun?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama didn't mince words either, she went straight to the point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm not dating Touyama-kun, I invited him to my house just because I had an appointment to borrow his books.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But when you walked in, you didn't look like you were inviting friends at all. It looks more like a man-woman meeting to me, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that moment, neither Takai nor Yuki were alert and prepared. Probably because the behavior in the library made both of them become sexually excited, and both of them were emotionally high about the next gender, thus creating an atmosphere of male and female estrus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I'm not dating Touyama-kun. This is the truth.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Ishiyama's "communication" refers to a romantic relationship with Yuki, then it is true that the two are not dating as Takai said. After all, Takai and Yuki were sex friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. I'm still thinking about what to do if you're dating Touyama-kun, because if you're not dating him, that's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's all you can say?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, that's what will happen next. I hope Takai-san won't have anything to do with Touyama-kun in the future.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What does that mean?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Verbal meaning. I didn't mean to break your friendship with Touyama-kun. Please don't do misleading things like inviting him to your house again.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;To support a classmate's love. Because if a cute girl like Takai-san hangs out with Touyama-kun, she'll get jealous. So I hope you keep your distance from Touyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't quite understand what you mean. You shouldn't have the right to interfere with my friendship.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that...impossible...why should I send this picture to class? Maybe someone will doubt your relationship with Touyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Ishiyama displayed a picture of Takai inviting Toyama to his house on his phone screen and handed it to Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rather than spreading rumors and letting Uehara know about the relationship between the two and losing everything in the end, it's better that I bear it myself... Thinking of this, Takai was forced to make a painful choice and could only accept Ishiyama's offer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Alright. Thank you for accepting my offer. But don't forget this photo.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama talked about the photo and secretly threatened Takai not to do unnecessary things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But, can you tell me who is the classmate you said who is into Touyama-kun? Is it you? And what is your reason for supporting that girl?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai knew that it was Uehara, but he couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun is not my type. For reasons... as you can imagine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama didn't answer the important points at all, probably because everything was over, he quickly left from there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki... is this okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai asked as if talking to himself, but now he could only stare at Yuki who could give him the answer from a distance.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like a normal lunch break, Uehara, Aizawa, Chihiro, and Touyama ate lunch while chatting and laughing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun, may I join you too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person who spoke up was Saori Ishiyama, his classmate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Hmm, of course. Everyone's fine, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the incident happened suddenly, Touyama was silent for a while before answering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The others didn't seem to have any particular objections.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san, that's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Touyama-kun knows my name? I'm very happy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, she hadn't spoken so far, so Ishiyama had no choice but to think so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course, I remember the names of my classmates well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a member of the library committee, Toyama often came into contact with students from other classes or grades, and she remembered the names of her classmates clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Since Touyama-kun didn't deal much with people in the class before, I thought you would be the type of person who thinks no matter what others do.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Ishiyama said, it didn't matter before. However, it was because of this that Uehara was also involved in the slander incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The existence of this kind of loner in the group is seen as misguided by the people around. As a result, whether it is low-key or silent, it will be seen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So now, Touyama was thinking of valuing relationships with everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I did think so before. But now I want to have a good relationship with all of you. It's all thanks to Uehara-san, Aizawa-san, and Chihiro here, I was able to change my mind.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;When I first talked to Touyama, Touyama really wanted to avoid getting involved with me, right? The salt correspondence at that time was really incredible. Well? Touyama though.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Uehara spoke up for the first time, she really didn't want to attract attention and deliberately avoided it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Looking back now, I'm really sorry about that time. Sorry, Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hm, I don't care.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara only said that, Touyama felt that he had been saved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;However, Yuki has really changed. It's all thanks to Uehara-san's devotion to Yuki, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Chihiro said, Touyama had changed a lot since his relationship with Uehara. It was the same when he was with Takai, even if Uehara was just confronted by Takai, Uehara continued to talk to him without giving up. Perhaps thanks to this, Takai could open his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really, Okita-kun. I'm embarrassed to say that in front of Ishiyama-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was praised, looked embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I've always felt that everyone here is very happy, which is truly enviable.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, who saw Touyama and the others talking, muttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;By the way, why did Ishiyama-san come to us today?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa asked about something that everyone, including Touyama, was very worried about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm how should I put it... I feel envious seeing how happy you are all the time. So I want to have a good relationship with Okita-kun, Uehara-san, and Aizawa-san. Of course, so does Touyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Ishiyama turned his gaze towards Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama's eyes seemed to be curious about Touyama, and Ishiyama seemed to be weighing his worth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, are you free after school today? Do you guys want to go to the arcade to play?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama suddenly proposed to go to the arcade</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Why do we want to go to the arcade?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama asked Ishiyama about her proposal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You know, I want to have a good relationship with everyone as soon as possible, and isn't the arcade the most suitable place to improve communication?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Playing games can indeed bring up endless topics, and what Ishiyama said also made sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then... let's go together. The arcade also has the prize I want. Let's go, Touyama too&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked at Touyama as if she was pleading with him, and asked for his approval.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Alright, I'll go too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yatta! What about Okita-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was very happy that Touyama could go together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um. If Yuki comes, I'll come too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll invite Takai-san to come too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After speaking, Touyama walked towards Takai's seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Everyone says to go to the arcade to play after school, do you want to come, Takai?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who was spoken to by Touyama, glanced at Uehara and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm not coming. I don't like noisy places like arcades.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's it...Although it's a bit regrettable, I can only give up. Where do you want to go next time?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, just invite me next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama turned around and planned to return to Uehara and the others' place, but suddenly thought of something and faced Takai again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai... I said....&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I didn't see you coming when I was in the library recently, and that...you didn't let me come to your room either, so I was wondering if...what was going on?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lately Touyama always felt that Takai was avoiding him, and he felt uneasy about whether he was hated by Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;My family has been very busy recently, and my mom is often at home, so I couldn't call you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ohh... I see.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this sentence, Touyama let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, so don't worry about me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So yeah, sorry for asking you weird questions.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I apologize. I didn't tell you earlier.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay, it's okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll go back there first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, you guys just have fun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The real reason was to avoid telling anyone, only a lie could be used to deceive the past, which made Takai hurt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san said she doesn't like noisy places like arcades, so she didn't go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Isn't that so... Sorry... Takai-san really isn't good at things like that...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who knew that Takai didn't participate, felt lonely from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So is Aizawa-san going too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama asked Aizawa, who had never spoken to her before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm...I'm not going either.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Mika didn't go either?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Takai, Aizawa didn't go, which made Uehara's shoulders suddenly sag.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, I go back with Marika every day, you four have fun today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, that's right... Takai-san won't be leaving either... But next time, let's all play together.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the end, only Touyama, Uehara, Chihiro, and Ishiyama went to the game room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama realized something. Aizawa and Ishiyama hadn't said a word so far. Do Ishiyama and Aizawa have a bad relationship?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mika, then I'll leave first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Be careful on the road.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Uehara and Aizawa greeted each other, Yuki and the others left the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Yumi, can I take a little of your time?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Right after Yuki and the others left for the arcade, Aizawa talked to Takai, who was studying in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Aizawa-san? Is something wrong?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You really don't want to go with them?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I'm not good at noisy places. So it's no problem.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's so... But then again, what happened to Yumi recently? It seems like you're avoiding Touyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Usually I see Takai going to the library every day, but recently, Takai didn't show up when Touyama was on duty. Aizawa felt unnatural about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's just your shadow, I'm the same as usual&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;...... Alright. Talk to me if anything happens."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand. Thank you, Aizawa-san. Don't worry too much, I'm fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Takai, who pretended to be brave, wanted to tell Aizawa everything. But Takai and Yuki's relationship will never be recognized anyway. If exposed, everyone would become sorry too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Takai buried everything in his heart and pretended to be calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;One more thing, I have something to tell you about Ishiyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Takai usually has no interest in other people, when he heard Aizawa mention Ishiyama's name, he felt panic in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What happened to Ishiyama-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Although this is something that the girls in the class basically know... He likes Kurashima. However, he's trying hard to get close to Marika, whom Kurashima likes, and I'm really worried about that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai suddenly understood what Ishiyama meant when he said that he wanted to support those who liked Yuki. He finally understood the reason for Ishiyama's actions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama wanted Uehara, who was his rival in love, to have a girlfriend, so that Kurashima could let Uehara go. Although Takai could not resonate with Ishiyama's desperate and unscrupulous actions, he could understand it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that right... he did his best too for that. It definitely is...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What does this mean? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll go home first. Goodbye, Aizawa-san&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before Aizawa could understand what Takai meant by doing his best, Takai left the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yumi...what do you know?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only Aizawa was left in the class, whispering in a low voice.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Touyama and his group came to the arcade in front of the station with Ishiyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's been a long time since I came to the arcade! Touyama, look at that cutie!&#12301;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Walking into the game room, Uehara was very emotional when he saw the skeleton of the claw machine. She pointed to the prize catching doll machine and urged Touyama to hurry over there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even in shopping malls and internet cafes, Uehara seemed to like this kind of entertainment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Touyama-kun, are you good at catching doll machines? Me, I want that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama held Touyama's arm and deliberately pressed against his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama's breasts were not as big as Uehara's, but they were also quite large. Touyama was slightly shaken by the sudden pressure on his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, well, if you're good at it or not, you're good at it, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll pay for it, you'll help me catch it&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Ishiyama pulled Touyama to the target claw machine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A-I understand, can I move my arm a little? It's making it hard for me to operate it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah sorry. I didn't mean to. However, Touyama-kun's shy look is quite cute. hmmmmm.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama and Ishiyama didn't talk until lunch break today, Touyama was a little overwhelmed by Ishiyama's active actions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama was clinging to Touyama, who wanted to operate the doll machine, and had made physical contact with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san is really sticking close to Yuki. Uehara-san, how are you?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okita couldn't bear to look at Uehara, who was lonely watching this scene, and asked anxiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll go&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was encouraged by Okita's words, ran towards the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, Touyama-kun is amazing! Catching it in just two times, that's amazing!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The location is good and the shape is easy to understand. It was just luck."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who managed to catch the Doll, chatted happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama held Touyama's arm again, and their bodies pressed together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Come here, come here! I also have something I want too, come here!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; Ue, Uehara-san? I understand. Ishiyama-san, I'll go over there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not to be outdone, Uehara grabbed Touyama's arm and pulled him away from Ishiyama forcefully, until he brought him to the doll claw machine that was his target.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What is Touyama ashamed of? Don't you just love being pressed by a pretty girl's breasts?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A-I'm not embarrassed... and it's force majeure.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... But I look like Touyama-kun has a frowning face?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, Toyama thought that the pressed breasts felt really good, so he couldn't explain it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is Uehara-san angry?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm not angry. After all, I'm not Touyama's girlfriend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara&#12300;puff&#12301;turned her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So, which one does Uehara-san want?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There's no point in trying to please girls with things like that. Ah, but if Touyama gets caught and insists on giving it to me, it's not impossible for me to accept it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. I'll do my best for Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama desperately tried to please Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That!? That... catch that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hand it over to me!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Because of that, Uehara-san really likes Toyama-kun. That's a bit surprising.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama watched the conversation between Touyama and Uehara from a distance, and muttered to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were many rumors in class that Uehara and Touyama were dating, and Ishiyama felt this way too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Does Ishiyama also like Yuki? Look at Ishiyama-san's very close appearance from earlier.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing these words, I remembered Okita's question who had been talking to Touyama and Ishiyama all this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I...I did that on purpose just to provoke Uehara-san's jealousy. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama's answer surprised Okita.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Why did you do this on purpose?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Because Uehara-san doesn't seem very active to Touyama-kun, right? So I wanted to encourage her. Thanks to this, isn't the atmosphere between her and Touyama-kun getting better now?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right... Is Ishiyama-san trying to bring Uehara-san and Yuki closer together?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's it. Okita-kun will also support them, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand! I'll support those two too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under Ishiyama's rhetoric, Okita, who knew nothing, stood on the side of supporting Uehara's love relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama is amazing! Can catch it once!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara, who didn't know the conversation between Okita and Ishiyama, were having fun with the claw machine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This is for you, Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama handed the doll he had just obtained from the claw machine to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The first gift I received from Touyama... I'm very happy...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's just a gift, no need to exaggerate.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmmm, since it was caught by Touyama for me, so I should cherish it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... It's good that Uehara-san can accept it happily.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Uehara's better mood, Touyama let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry for interfering when you were making out, Touyama-kun, let's take a picture&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama was sandwiched between the two of them, where things got really good, pushed tiui's back, and forcefully pushed her into the photo-making machine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishi, Ishiyama-san&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Leaving Uehara and Okita behind, Touyama and Ishiyama disappeared in the box of the photo-making machine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Humphhh! Though the atmosphere is finally getting warmer!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was interrupted by Ishiyama again, puffed up his cheeks in dissatisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmph, Ishiyama-san is really tough.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike Okita, who knew the situation, for Uehara, this should be a rather boring development.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okita-kun, let's take a picture too!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Me and Uehara-san? I'm not used to doing this kind of thing, I'm sorry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okita-kun's face looks good, and the photo should look good... In other words, my female power is not as good as Okita-kun's...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't think so... Uehara-san is still a beautiful woman, but I'm a man?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okita-kun... you don't seem to know yourself very well. Now I'll tell you what I mean."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okita was also pushed into the photo booth by Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san, this is my first time taking photos, so I don't know what to do&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was alone with a girl at a small photo booth, became very honest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hand over the operation to me. You see, to photograph it our bodies need to be closer.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uh huh......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama urged him to come closer, Touyama leaned his shoulder in awe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You see, the first is this feeling. Touyama-kun... your expression is too stiff! You can take five more pictures, just relax. let's take a good picture&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who was not used to being photographed had a rather funny expression, while Ishiyama who was looking at the photo looked quite happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, is it better than before? Although his expression is still unnatural.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">More and more often, Touyama gradually got used to it. Squinting at her unattractive face on the screen, I really can't understand the excitement of the photo sticker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama thinks that this kind of photo activity is not suitable for her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama doesn't look very happy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, there's no such thing! I'm just not used to being photographed so I'm a little nervous."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Lastly, I'll give you a little bonus. Haikk&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, wait, Ishiyama-san&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama hugged Touyama from the side facing the camera, and Ishiyama's cheek was so close that it almost kissed Touyama's cheek.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hehe, Toyama-kun's expression looked good last time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the last photo, Touyama who was suddenly hugged by Ishiyama shows a surprised expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's indeed a very natural expression, but it's a sight that can't be seen at all. Touyama could only hold his head in distress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Do you want to print this as well? not delete it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course it will be printed? It's rare to take such a good photo, it's a pity to delete it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Don't show this photo to others.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama lowered his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? It's good too right? Or do you not want Uehara-san to see it? Well, he might get jealous.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? I don't think that's the case...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, what does Toyama-kun think of Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What do you think...? What happened to Ishiyama-san all of a sudden?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama's sudden question confused Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san is the most popular student in the class. Touyama-kun must be interested in her too, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes... Uehara-san is cute and has a good personality. I think she's very attractive."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hoho, Touyama-kun has very high judgment. So do you like Uehara-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Should I answer that?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course. If you don't answer, I'll bring this photo to class and spread it around."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Ishiyama pointed to the picture on the screen where she was holding Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;...... Of course I like Uehara-san..&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Heee~... Toyama-kun likes Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, that's not what I mean, I mean, I like him in the sense of a friend.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. So, do you want to date him?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I'm not compatible with Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Huh, that can't be denied.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama always felt that he was being persuaded to answer Ishiyama's statement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san, I don't quite understand the meaning of your question.&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I was just doing a little consciousness research. Don't mind."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's hard for me not to care...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you're a man, don't mind the details.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, Touyama who failed to understand Ishiyama's intention to ask, could only be depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, I'll send the photo to your cell phone later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Can this be done?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course it can be done now. Is Toyama-kun really a high school student? I feel more like an old man.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After speaking, Ishiyama giggled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? Where did Chihiro and Uehara-san go?&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Ishiyama, who had finished shooting, walked out of the photo booth, but they didn't see Uehara and Chihiro outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;They both also went for the photo shoot, right? You see, it's printed.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some of the photos that came out showed stiff expressions, and one of them had a photo of Touyama being hugged by Ishiyama half-opening his mouth in fear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Therefore, this expression is really embarrassing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, who was used to this kind of photo printing, was quite well photographed, and it was interesting to compare it with Touyama, who had a stiff expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But the expression of the latter is very natural, I think it's good.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The expression of being hugged suddenly looks very natural, but it is also a photo that can easily cause misunderstanding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While Ishiyama was evaluating the photo, Uehara and Chihiro came out from another photo box.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, sorry I made you wait for me&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Chihiro and Uehara-san also went for a photo shoot.&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes. But... Okita-kun did a great job... I'm going to lose my confidence...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked at the photos taken by Uehara and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... it looks like those two girls are filming? Chihiro, you really are a girl...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, that's it! After various processing and corrections, the image of the beautiful girl came out at once. And I haven't changed...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Uehara in the photo didn't seem to have changed much from her usual self, it was because she looked so good. On the contrary, Chihiro became more feminine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, Okita-kun is too cute, right? Even compared to Uehara-san, who is known as the prettiest girl in the class, she's not inferior at all.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, there's no such thing... So, that's why Yuki, let me see what you printed out your picture of.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro looked embarrassed and lowered her head like a pretty girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, Touyama's expression is so stiff.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who saw the photo, said what Touyama expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No way, this is my first time taking a photo like this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Because of that, Ishiyama-san is very used to taking photos... Taking a picture with Touyama... Very good... I want to take one too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara muttered something that made her envious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, do you want to print a photo with me next! I'm used to printing photos like this with Ishiyama-san, right, so this time should be fine, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Are you still printing photos again?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course. let's go in.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had already finished the second photo shoot with Uehara this way, felt tired. In contrast, Uehara carefully put the printed photo stickers into her bag with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then Uehara-san, let's print a photo with me at the end!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Ishiyama-san also wants to print photos again?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's a rare opportunity, by the way, let's talk about personal female topics.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, well, I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;While Touyama-kun is waiting for us, how about you take a picture with Okita-kun too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As if talking about other people's business, Ishiyama grabbed Uehara's arm, and the two disappeared into the photo box.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I won't use tumblr anymore! And two boys or something. Right, Chihiro?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The photo shoot is only for two girls or couples, right? Touyama, who wanted to ask for approval, turned his gaze to Chihiro, but saw Chihiro lowering her head shyly and looking at him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yu, Yuki...Aren't we going to print a photo of one?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why are you blushing?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Defeated by Ishiyama's strength, Uehara was pushed into the photo booth by him. She opened the curtain slightly and peeked from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You... Toyama and Okita-kun... look like a couple... In the end, the two of them also went for a photo shoot together...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara muttered softly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is Uehara-san jealous? After all, Okita-kun is very cute, so maybe it's not impossible for Touyama-kun.&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no! It's just that.... Okita-kun is a man...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you say that, you might get snatched up by someone, right? Uehara-san likes Toyama-kun, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Huh!? for, why?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't expect his heart to be seen by Ishiyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahaha, don't be surprised, it's all been revealed.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is it really that easy to see? ......&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes... I just came to the arcade with everyone today and I can see that Uehara-san really likes it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I'm so embarrassed...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered her head and covered her flushed cheeks with her hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Uehara-san, please tell your feelings to Touyama-kun before any evil worms take it first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought he would say something out of the blue, but I didn't expect Ishiyama to ask Uehara to confess to Touyama, and Uehara couldn't hide the trembling in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh, eh, eh!? I can't do it, I can't do it! Besides, Touyama doesn't seem to be interested in me...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps due to lack of confidence, Uehara was stunned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There's no such thing! I asked him when I took a picture with Touyama-kun just now, and he said he likes Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama deliberately omitted the word "friendship".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#12300;Really&#65281;&#65311;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, there's definitely nothing wrong. After all, Touyama-kun seems to really like Uehara, and he will definitely succeed. So go and confess to him?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, is it okay...?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No problem! Uehara-san is very cute, you should show your confidence.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yes... Then I'll go and confess to her...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was seduced by the sweet words, was already completely seduced, and suddenly fell into Ishiyama's trap.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I'll help you too. Confess tomorrow to Touyama-kun&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Tomorrow, tomorrow! This is so sudden, I'm not mentally prepared yet...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Confession is following the momentum! Aren't you two in a good mood today? Don't let this opportunity slip away!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I see... Although I think the atmosphere is pretty good too... I, I know... So what should I do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hand it over to me, it'll definitely work out.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm, um, I see! I'll do my best tomorrow.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this way, Uehara's love confession preparations went smoothly without Toyama's knowledge.</span></p>
