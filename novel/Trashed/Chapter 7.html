<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Gradual Mood Change</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, Uehara, Chihiro, and Aizawa each brought their lunch boxes and gathered around Touyama's table.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Recently, the four of them had been gathering for lunch more often.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the past, only Touyama and Chihiro ate together, but things had changed recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro noticed that Touyama had cut his hair, and his rumors with Uehara had gradually diminished.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is not a dramatic change.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, although Uehara always invited Takai to have lunch with him, Takai always refused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama admired Uehara's spirit that did not give up despite being rejected many times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, are you free after school today? Want to go karaoke together? I have a discount coupon for group use."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As if the kiss on the cheek at parting never happened when Touyama and Uehara went to the movies a few days ago, Uehara naturally invited Touyama to go to karaoke together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I want to! I'm going I'm going! I haven't been to karaoke recently, but I really want to go now!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa leaned forward and raised her hand first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Harumi we used to go together a lot, but recently everyone split up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to Uehara, their circle used to go to karaoke together, but they split up since the group chat that discussed Touyama and Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why the small circle centered on Kurashima became like this was mostly due to the departure of Uehara and Aizawa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I still have work as a library committee member after school today, so I can't leave until later. If you think it's okay, will you guys wait for me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, it's fine if I wait for you to finish work. how about it? Harumi.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara asked for Aizawa's approval.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's okay to wait in class for an hour or so, no problem.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa also said that she would wait for her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So what should Chihiro do?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Yuki goes too...I'm the only boy who doesn't go, so, if Yuki goes then I'll go too...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As she said that, Chihiro lowered her head and raised her eyes to pleadingly look at Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Chi, Chihiro says so, then I'll go too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro's cute expression made it hard to believe that she was actually a man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay! Then I'll also invite Takai-san to come along as well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Uehara walked towards Takai, who was reading quietly by himself as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Uehara's invitation to Takai was unexpected. But her words... Touyama didn't expect Takai to come along.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't imagine how Takai would look like singing at karaoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san will come with us too&#65374;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eh!?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who returned, gave a surprising answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't expect Takai to go to karaoke together... What kind of mood change is this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Aizawa was also there, and Touyama wanted to take this opportunity for Takai to have a good relationship with them and expand his circle of friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Touyama opened the library door and went inside. I saw Takai already sitting in his chair reading a book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before coming to the library, Touyama wanted to tell Uehara to wait in the library while waiting for Touyama to finish his work. But thinking that they might be very noisy, I had to ask them to wait for him in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If they could read quietly like Takai, the lord of the library, it would be fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, I can't get the book, can you get it for me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The deadline time for borrowing and returning books had ended, and when the library was empty as it approached closing time, Takai talked to Toyama at the front desk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's rare, it's usually Takai who can't be chatted with, can't Takai just pick up the books himself with a tripod. Touyama thought so, and followed behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That book, please.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The book Takai was looking for was in the deepest corner of the library's dead end, and Takai pointed to the top shelf of the bookshelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh... this one?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama climbed onto the tripod and picked up the book according to the indicated position.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, the one on the right.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The book Takai instructed was a romantic comedy that he didn't usually read. Touyama wondered if her mood had changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, is this it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Thank you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai took the book from Touyama and turned the pages to confirm the contents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not this one.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Takai returned the book back to Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The next one is that one.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai asked Touyama to take another book, turned the page and said it was wrong, and returned the book back to him. After repeating it several times, Takai suddenly stopped when he didn't know the number of books he turned over, and handed the open page to Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey Yuki, I want to do this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? This refers to...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I looked at the page Takai opened, there was an illustration of a man and a woman kissing passionately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was staring at Takai, thought he was teasing him, but from his expression that never showed emotion, it was hard to tell if Takai was joking or serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Touyama knew that Takai was not the type to joke around, so he must be serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Maybe someone will see it, if there are strange rumors, will Takai be in trouble too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It doesn't matter if I'm seen. Yuki would have a problem too right if Uehara-san saw her?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who said so, advanced step by step, and the back of Touyama, who continued to retreat, collided with the bookshelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Takai said, Touyama didn't want Uehara to know about their relationship. So Touyama couldn't say anything, and his eyes kept wandering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moment Touyama took his eyes off Takai, something soft and warm touched Touyama's neck. His body trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Taka, Takai! What are you doing?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai pressed his lips and tongue against Touyama's neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In, in a place like this... No, no, if someone comes here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama said that while feeling the breath Takai exhaled as Takai licked his neck. The feminine scent on his body, which was different from the body wash and shampoo Takai usually used, gradually paralyzed Toyama's mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It tastes a little salty.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai, it's dirty. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not dirty, I don't care about that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai said that while licking Touyama's neck again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's slippery tongue stimulated Touyama's brain, and a burst of pleasure flowed behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, now it's erect...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The stimulation in the neck made Touyama's lower body react, and he couldn't help but move his waist because he was embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Takai reached out and hugged Yuan Shan's waist, as if Takai was unwilling to let her escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai licked Touyama's neck without interruption, pressed his waist against her lower body, and began to rub it slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's quickening breathing made Toyama understand that he was becoming sexually aroused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead of stopping, Takai reached out and touched Touyama's lower body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um... Yuki, that's amazing...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai put his hand on Touyama's bulging school pants, sighed, and then started stroking Touyama's dick up and down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Taka, Takai... Stop... If we go any further...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't want to.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, whose rationality exploded, extended his hand to Takai's lower body and stimulated her through her skirt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's body also trembled in response, and gasped softly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was getting desperate, put his hand inside Takai's skirt-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? no one's there?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When the library door opened, a familiar voice sounded inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is Touyama not here?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The owner of that voice was Uehara who was supposed to be waiting for him in class. Touyama's entire body instantly calmed down upon hearing that voice. In order for Uehara not to see this situation, he tried to distance himself from Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, Touyama felt a slight tingling in his neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In what Uehara could see, Takai had clearly left bite marks on his neck. Then Takai licked his lips deliciously, and separated his body from Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His beautifully shaped lips were wet with his own saliva, making Takai's expression extremely lascivious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Touyama, are you here? What are you and Takai-san doing?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who discovered Touyama's figure, ran over, but there was no bad sight at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, that's...because Takai-san said she couldn't reach the book, so I came to help her pick it up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama immediately put his hand on her neck, covering the place where she had just been kissed by Takai. His neck was wet with Takai's saliva.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, what's wrong with your neck?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to notice Touyama's unnatural hand touching his neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no... It's because... A, I just got bitten by a bug.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... There shouldn't be any insects inside the library. Let me see Touyama&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Insects attached to books won't bite, unless the book insect is like Takai, I shouldn't know about that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no, I'm fine. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you keep refusing to show her, it might arouse her suspicion. Touyama had to give up and slowly removed his hand covering his neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, it's really bitten. it's all red.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara stared intently at his neck, without the slightest suspicion that it was Takai's bite mark. But since it was actually Takai's bite marks, Touyama felt an indescribable sense of guilt when he thought to be seen by Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahh? why is your lehe wet.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara said this to his neck that was wet with Takai's saliva, and Touyama's heartbeat suddenly became very fast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That, that..., maybe it's because I was sweating while organizing the bookshelves.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Come on, clean it with this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was a weak excuse, Uehara took out her handkerchief from her pocket without hesitation and handed it over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no, this is fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Take this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay... thank you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama took his handkerchief and wiped Takai's saliva with the handkerchief he borrowed from Uehara. This unethical behavior made her feel complicated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Thank you, I'll return it to you after I wash it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, it doesn't need to be washed.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, without even having the chance to refuse, Uehara took his handkerchief back from Touyama's hand in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A handkerchief with sweat from Touyama...hehehe.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Uehara-san, what did you just say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara muttered with a somewhat unruly expression while stuffing the handkerchief into his pocket. But Touyama didn't seem to hear Uehara's words clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What, nothing! Is this work of yours finished?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara hurriedly changed the subject, as if trying to remove the guilt in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;My work will end when I've returned the returned books to be placed into the shelves, it might take a little more time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then let me help too. Let this end faster?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara offered to help her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll help you too, that book. I basically know where the books are, so I can pack them faster. Uehara-san can wait in the classroom alone.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who had been silent for a long time, said that he would help her instead of Uehara. But this sentence made Touyama feel an unbearable pressure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A-I understand... Then Takai-san, please. We'll wait in the classroom.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was getting pressure on Takai, left the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wouldn't it be better if Uehara-san also helped?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Does Yuki want to be with Uehara-san more?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not so...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama felt that Takai was rarely this emotional.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey Yuki, you just got an erection right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Um...it was just sexual arousal alone...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So...I'm also sexually aroused. So...we'll continue in my room later."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The libido that was cooled down by Uehara's appearance was revived by Takai's words, and Touyama felt his body start to heat up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And today Takai always felt a little strange. Not only did he accept Uehara's karaoke invitation, but he also left his bite marks on Touyama in the library. Not only that, Takai also showed a sense of exclusivity. Touyama felt that Takai's mood seemed a little unstable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Let's pack up and go back to class, everyone is waiting.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it's not like I didn't understand what Takai was thinking, so Touyama didn't bring it up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Touyama and Takai finished the library committee work, they moved to the station with Uehara and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the group, only Touyama and Chihiro were male. Although Chihiro looked like a girl at first glance, but now she was wearing a man's suit, so it wasn't that she couldn't tell that she was a man. But from other people's point of view, it might feel that it was an inconspicuous boy walking with four girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, Aizawa, and Chihiro were the complete opposite of the rural Touyama and Takai. It was just a yin and yang feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What happened to Takai-san today? Even willing to go to karaoke with us.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who was even more committed to acting alone than Touyama, how could his mood change from usual?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Nothing. Since Uehara-san always invites me along, I feel like a nuisance and have no choice but to accept occasionally.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Haha, let's just say that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was an honest statement that was unique to Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To the words of Touyama, Takai remained silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was true that Uehara always invited Takai, if it was Touyama's invitation, Takai would probably refuse. But Uehara got into Takai's heart like a communication expert and got a good answer from him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can be seen that Uehara is just trying to have a good relationship with Takai regardless of gain or loss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it was because of this that Takai knew that Uehara had no bad intentions, so he gradually opened up to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as I came to the karaoke place, it turned out to be a one-man show between Uehara and Aizawa. After all, the two of them often came to karaoke, so they were used to singing a lot of good songs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Between Uehara and Aizawa singing three songs each, Toyama and Chihiro sang one song with their own rhythm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What song is Takai-san going to sing? Eh? Not sure about the song? Look, isn't this song very famous, you should have heard it a few times?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai said that he hasn't been to karaoke since middle school. Although I originally planned to listen to others sing, but Uehara said that the opportunity is rare, so let's sing something. As a result, Uehara and Takai chose a song together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eventually it was Takai's turn to sing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who usually only saw him in the classroom or library reading a book, or in a bed that was messy from being fucked, now saw Takai nervously holding the microphone, which was very refreshing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After singing, Takai sat on the sofa with a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san sang very well! Your voice is also very good.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara praised Takai, who was sitting next to him, for how cute he was while singing. Hearing this, Takai looked very embarrassed, and seemed to see a hint of excitement on his usually expressionless face. This should not be an illusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Takai was not used to singing, Takai sang very well. Chihiro sang well too. Only Touyama received a subtle evaluation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama felt that he really didn't belong here, and felt a little uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why is Touyama a little anxious?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was sitting beside the distant mountain, asked anxiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, I thought everyone sang really well or something.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama can sing as long as you're used to singing. This kind of thing just needs to be sung a little more.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so? I just heard that pitch delusions can't be cured.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama is just a pitch idiot, whose pitch is always out of tune when singing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Karaoke or whatever, as long as you sing happily. That's fine. As long as you practice more, you can become useful... Next time we'll practice together, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san naturally invited Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right, let's go karaoke together next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, knowing Uehara's feelings, didn't know how to answer, but in order to keep Uehara from getting his hopes up, Touyama still answered politely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Gosh! Clearly this is a good reason to be alone with Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite what Uehara said, he didn't look very sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm I'm very happy. The members are different from usual, it feels really nice.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the way to the station after leaving the karaoke, Aizawa approached and whispered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Karaoke was really fun. Not only releasing the pressure, but also hearing Takai-san's singing, it's very satisfied.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, Takai only sang that one song, and Uehara and Aizawa basically spent the rest of the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Did Takai-san have fun?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara asked Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, it's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This should be a very subtle evaluation for a normal person. But considering Takai's feelings, it could be considered a good feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um! That's good. Let's go play together next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara had a smile all over her face, and seemed to accept Takai's answer very happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai nodded silently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Takai were on the same line, while the other three were on different lines, so the group split up in front of the station and headed home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama agreed to go to Takai's house in the library after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was sitting next to Takai on the train, was excited to have a brutal fuck with Takai next to continue from the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, perhaps understanding Touyama's current mood, Takai, who was sitting next to, suddenly took his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's hand was soft and slightly warm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Was Takai also looking forward to the next thing?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After getting off the train, the two of them walked silently on the dark night road.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even without dialog, it was a very comfortable time for both of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, wait a moment.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Touyama came to Takai's house, Takai entered first to check if anyone was home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, no one is here, please come in.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama heard Takai's words, who poked his head out from the entrance, Touyama was dragged into the house by Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two, whose sexual desire was high because of the library, were satisfying each other's bodies more intensely than usual. Finally, Takai became exhausted and lay down on the bed with his body completely naked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Uehara-san and the others come to invite you again in the future, will you agree to play together, Takai?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wanted to know if Takai came to karaoke today on a whim, or if his mood had changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't know. But... I went to karaoke with everyone today. I felt a little happy because it's been a long time since I played with many people."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yeah... that's great. As long as Takai can continue to communicate with others like this little by little, I'll be happy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Considering Takai's family environment, the bad influence on him was also obvious at a glance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, as an ordinary high school student, Touyama couldn't possibly disturb his family, the only thing he could do was to at least make his school life feel happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... like Yuki's recent changes, so should I...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai did not continue the conversation anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, even if Takai didn't say anything, Touyama knew what Takai wanted to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because, I'm just like you.</span></p>
