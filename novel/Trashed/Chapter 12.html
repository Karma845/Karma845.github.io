<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Recognition</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">As usual, I came to school and stood blankly in front of my shoe locker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is this a love letter? No... that's not going to happen. Am I being bullied again?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A white envelope was placed on top of an indoor shoe in the shoe locker. At first glance it might seem like a love letter, but the world was not that simple. Touyama had also received a malicious harassment note recently as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama carefully took out the envelope and put it in his bag, then hurriedly ran to the toilet room. From the other students' point of view, they would think it was a stomachache and rush to the restroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not writing the sender's name? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama openly opened the envelope, which contained a white note and a photo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Photo!?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The photo captured the moment when Takai held Toyama's hand and invited her into the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was seen by someone!? Was I followed home from karaoke? Or was it just a coincidence...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The only thing that can be understood is that this letter is not the kind of love letter that makes people happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama eagerly opened the note that was also put into the envelope to confirm the contents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Touyama-kun, I have something to ask you. After school today, someone will be waiting for you, Touyama-kun, in front of the sports equipment warehouse. Please go to the front of the warehouse after school and grant that person's wish.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was thought that, in order not to be known who wrote it, all the contents of the post-it note were printed on the computer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Putting a photo in the envelope means that if you don't want to reveal your relationship with Takai, you have to secretly do what the sender asks...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I don't know what kind of request the other party will make, what Touyama can do is very limited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The relationship between Touyama and Takai cannot be determined from photos alone. But rumors will always spread. I'm afraid this is the opponent's goal. In that case, the only thing to do was to follow the instructions in the letter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I can only leave. Let me end this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who did not know what kind of demands the other party would make, was very uneasy, but he still decided to end this series of harassment.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mika, I have something to tell you, can I take a moment?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once the afternoon class ended, Marika said to Aizawa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, no problem. What do you want to say?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I also want to tell Takai-san, but it will be heard by others here, so let's go outside the classroom.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marika looked around, whispered to Aizawa, and ran towards Yumi again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marika took Yumi and Aizawa out of the classroom, and the three of them went somewhere without anyone around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even in a place like this, does something bother you when someone hears it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa's judgment seemed to be a very important matter, and she asked Marika with a serious face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you say it's a problem... I must say I'd be embarrassed if someone heard it...&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is it okay for me to listen along?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course! Takai-san is my closest friend, so I also want you to hear from me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yumi asked anxiously, and Marika said that she wanted Yumi to listen to what she had to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yumi looked a little happy when she heard the words "Important friend", it shouldn't be an illusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I should listen carefully.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa looked at Marika seriously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#12300;eh... that's............</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Marika wanted to say something, she didn't know if it was difficult to say, she always seemed to hesitate to say anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika, if it's a difficult thing to talk about, you don't have to force yourself, okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmm, I'm fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Marika's appearance, Aizawa said softly with a worried expression on her face. Marika closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if she had made up her mind, and faced Aizawa and Yumi again with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I..... will confess my feelings to Touyama next.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marika, who had made up her mind, made a surprising confession.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Marika... what did you just say?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The overly aggressive words made Aizawa wonder if she heard something wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll confess to Touyama next.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this sentence, Yumi was still expressionless as usual, and did not move.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why are you suddenly saying that you will confess to her? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was too surprising for Aizawa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;When I was at the arcade yesterday, I talked to Ishiyama-san... She said there was hope so she asked me to confess to Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Deciding such an important thing because of that baseless statement?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa was very surprised that she decided to confess based on that unreliable information.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not like this. Ishiyama-san said that she heard directly from Touyama that he likes me, so as long as I confess to Touyama, I will definitely succeed, and Ishiyama-san said that it's okay to leave the matter to her.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......So, you decided to confess today?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... Ishiyama-san will call Touyama in front of the sporting goods warehouse, all I have left to do is confess to her.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You're very......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unexpectedly, Marika really liked Touyama, Aizawa's calculation had been wrong all along. Although it is said that love makes people blind, Marika could not see her surroundings at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mika doesn't support me...?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Aizawa's appearance, Marika felt a little uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How could that be! I will always be Marika's support. So... come on.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this point, no one could stop Marila, and there was no power to stop her. Marika might really be successful and happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san should also support me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marika glanced at Yumi, who was still expressionless and said nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll go first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marika, who left this sentence, turned around and left, running towards her lover's place.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm still thinking about what happened... It's surprising to say that Marika wanted to confess so suddenly. Right, Yuzu.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Huh?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Marika's back, Aizawa asked for Yumi's approval. But Aizawa didn't get any response, and she looked back in a dignified manner, only to see Yumi's face dazed and confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#12300;How&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;&#65281;&#65311;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yumi really wanted to answer her, but couldn't say anything. In front of Aizawa, Yumi shed tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yumi...don't you like Touyama-kun? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yumi, who was crying like rain, didn't say anything and walked away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhhh Damn! Why did things get like this! It's all your fault, Touyama&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa complained and chased after Yumi, but she found no trace of her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;ha ha ha......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Uehara said that she wanted to confess, her mind went blank. When she regained consciousness, the crying Takai left Aizawa's side as if running away, and ran to the sports equipment warehouse where Yuki was called.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I like Yuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Yumi heard that Uehara was going to confess to Yuki, she felt desperate. Takai who didn't want to lose to Uehara and didn't want Yuki to be robbed by Uehara, had finally realized it now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai turned the corner of the corridor as he ran, but almost bumped into another student, but luckily avoided it at the last minute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Due to his mistake of running in the hallway, Takai faced the student and apologized to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishi, Ishiyama-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san, why are you so nervous?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay... I almost bumped into you, sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It didn't bump into me, no problem. But Takai-san, your face...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's tears stopped, but Ishiyama seemed to realize something when she saw his swollen expression because of Takai's crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that...it seems like you know that. Did you hear it from Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai nodded slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's why I ran behind the school building in a panic. But...I won't let you disturb them. Sorry, but I'll be in trouble if the two of them aren't together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san...that's all for yourself, right? Because what do you think Kurashima-kun will give up Uehara-san as long as they can date smoothly, right? If Kurashima-kun gives up Uehara-san, maybe he'll look at you, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing that the talked-about Ishiyama didn't say a word, Takai continued his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's why you let Uehara-san have such an idea and encouraged her to confess to Touyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't say it again&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably because of guilt, Ishiyama didn't want to talk to anyone else about what she had done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I can understand Ishiyama-san's feelings. How painful it is for someone you like to not see yourself. But...but you can't take advantage of other people's feelings either. That's how that person feels-&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before Takai finished speaking, his eyes widened in surprise. What caught his gaze was not Touyama in front of him, but the figure behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Saori...what he just said is true?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing a voice that could not be forgotten, Ishiyama looked back and saw Kurashima's figure appearing there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto!? Since, since when have you been here?...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I've been hearing it in this corner since the beginning of your conversation&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In other words, Kurashima heard everything. Ishiyama who pushed Uehara's confession, it was all so that Kurashima could see him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama felt as if his whole body had lost its blood. He was afraid that he would be hated by Kurashima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So is it true that Marika wants to confess to Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Kurashima's cold eyes and voice, Ishiyama couldn't get his voice out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Answer me Saori&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama's body shuddered at Kurashima's angry roar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kura, Kurashima-kun... Please, calm down...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai also momentarily shuddered at Kurashima's furious roar, but still begged her to stay calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai, what about you? Why are you still standing in this place. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not good...but, I understand how you feel.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai wondered if Kurashima agreed with his answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun and Uehara-san will meet in front of the sports equipment warehouse...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, whose face was pale, raised his voice to convey the information Kurashima wanted to know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I now hate you&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this, Kurashima turned around and ran towards the sports equipment warehouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto, don't go ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama wanted to stop Kurajima from running to Uehara's side. But Kurashima glanced at Ishiyama and left quickly.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the way to the sports equipment warehouse, Touyama stopped a little further away and peered at the situation in front of the warehouse from behind a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even from a distance, you can recognize the striking hair color and beautiful atmosphere, no one else but him has such features.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is it Uehara-san who called me...? No... Uehara-san probably wouldn't do such a thing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was undoubtedly summoned to the warehouse as well. Toyama told herself what kind of trap this was, and walked towards Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama...you're already here...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't show his surprise when Touyama appeared, instead showing an expression of embarrassment and pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did Uehara-san know that I was coming? Seriously, was it Uehara-san who called me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is it Uehara-san who called me here?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um, uh, yes oh... sorry for calling you all of a sudden. Did I give you trouble?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered his head and looked at Touyama, showing a troubled expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There's no such thing... Is there something wrong with summoning me to a place like that on purpose?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uh...ah that...I-I have something to say to Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Uehara who was blushing and seemed to be thinking, Touyama remembered a sentence in the note.&#12302;Please fulfill that person's wish&#12303;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;Could it be...! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama's heart jumped violently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was eager to weave a language, remembering Uehara's words and deeds during this time, he understood what would happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san, what are you going to say next...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, I menyu&#9472;&#9472;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't keep talking!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The voice of "Marika" came from afar, and Uehara stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I heard that voice and looked back, I saw that Kurashima who was already out of breath, ran towards Touyama and Uehara with a grim expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto!? Why are you here?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't seem to know that Kurashima was coming, and Touyama became even more agitated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kura, Kurashima-kun...? were you called here too&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, not true. I came here after hearing about you from Saori.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ishiyama-san? How is this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even if it's like that, are you okay Marika? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a thinking expression on his face, Kurashima took a deep breath and looked at Uehara as if he had come to a decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I... I like you. So... please go out with me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was silent listening to Kurashima's sudden confession.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was a silence between the three.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurashima......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was silently listening to her confession, spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I...have someone I like...so...I can't return your feelings. I'm sorry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>TL/N: </b><i>I'm a dog to my chest.</i></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Both Kurashima and Touyama knew who Uehara's confession was directed at.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wah! Marika...you really treat a guy like this like that-&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai suddenly ran out from the corner of the warehouse. Did you hear the conversation earlier from hiding in the shadows of the warehouse?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurashima-kun... don't say that again....&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai... is this acceptable to you? Maybe he wants to compare you and Marika on a scale&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki... won't do anything like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Are you dating Touyama? But still, this guy is a guy who can date other girls and is cute! Even so, can you still emphasize that&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Yuki and I are not dating. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Isn't that so? Saori and I both saw it, you brought this person to your house&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Kurashima's question, Takai neither confirmed nor denied, and remained silent the entire time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It can't be denied that. What are you saying Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima asked Toyama, whose mind could not keep up with his status, to answer his question. But for Touyama, there was only one answer in his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I'm not dating Takai.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... Then I'll be fine with Takai, right? After all, I've been dumped by Marika, and I've always cared about Takai.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima's words sounded like he was giving up on himself, but he was actually trying to test Touyama, to draw out the truth from within Touyama's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Deceiver. You only see Uehara-san from her appearance.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Ahhh... right! I've always liked Marika. I've liked her since I entered middle school! But it was Touyama who helped Marika solve the harassment problem... it was you! I even have to be suspected as the culprit, it makes me so unwilling!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima, who had let out the contents in his mind, approached Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurashima-kun... I know that feeling very well. But... that's no reason to blame Yuki. so...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai was at a loss for words and couldn't continue speaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I really envy you, Touyama. There are so many classmates who admire you and gather around you. So does Marika, so does Mika! Touyama...if it weren't for you&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima became really annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Dog bastard, you look down on people like me, thinking of your words and your own deeds all this time, right? Isn't this all your own fault! ?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama listened calmly, he couldn't continue to hide his anger in the face of the hatred Kuroshima said to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, don't give me anger&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Slowly approaching him, Kurashima grabbed Toyama's chest with one hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This is a suitable place like you, Kurashima. Did I say something wrong? It was just because I told you that you would be rude to me, wasn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Silence&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I won't shut up. I'll keep talking until you admit it! Say it if you hurt yourself&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You, bastard&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima grabbed Toyama's chest with both hands and pressed his body against the wall of the warehouse.&#12300;Buk&#12301;With a voice like that, Touyama's face turned into pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto, don't continue anymore&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Saori......&#65281;&#65311;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima, who grabbed Touyama's chest, about to hit him, was prevented by Ishiyama by hugging Kurashima from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto...this is all my fault...so please, don't continue this matter...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With tears in his eyes, Ishiyama desperately tried to stop Kurashima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......So yeah... in the end I get nothing but suspicion as a criminal, so I'll be left alone... haha&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima released his hand that was grabbing Toyama by hanging him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama... are you alright?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I, I'm fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai squinted at Uehara, who was worried about Touyama, and said to Kurashima's empty back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurashima-kun... Although you say that you're alone, that's not the case. The people who appreciate you are by your side. So...I hope you see that woman more often.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai turned his attention to Ishiyama, who hugged Kurashima from behind and buried his face behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima and Ishiyama, who turned around, looked at each other for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima gently released Ishiyama's embrace and left his body, then turned around and left. Ishiyama, who silently watched Kurashima leave, followed her back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Kurashima and Ishiyama left, the three who remained in place didn't know what to do with each other, and just stood still.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it was Uehara who broke the silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I called Touyama here because I have something to say to Touyama. Sorry for dragging you into this kind of thing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama knew what Uehara wanted to say by calling him out. And the answer had already been determined. The only thing left to do was to listen to Uehara's determination to continue and have the courage to accept his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it doesn't matter. Compared to this... what do you want to tell me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama fully understood what happened this time, it was Ishiyama who was planning to call Touyama and allow Uehara to confess to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmmm... I really can't talk about it right now, so forget it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara replied while looking at Takai, and then her eyes looked down at her feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that...I see.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry I'm so fickle-minded...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this sentence, Touyama had already made up his mind, but it turned out that he was really relieved now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know it's impossible to continue like this, but I also don't want to destroy the current relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So... Touyama did not regret choosing the current relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if Touyama knew it was just a delay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And then tomorrow, let's start our daily lives as usual.</span></p>
