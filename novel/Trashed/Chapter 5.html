<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Appointed Day for Dating</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since yesterday's class meeting incident, Uehara has been actively approaching Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In particular, skin-to-skin contact has increased a lot, and the number of times Touyama's arm is often held has also increased, and every time his arm is held, Uehara's chest likes to stick to his arm. And because Uehara didn't choose the time and place to hold Touyama's arm, a lot of gossip had already started to spread in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, do you want to go out on the next holiday?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Uehara talked to Touyama, who was in charge of the library committee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm working right now. And talking too loudly is strictly prohibited inside the library.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked like a member of the library committee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh~, let's talk a bit. Isn't there only Takai-san here right now?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wasn't too serious either, so there was really no harm in talking about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fortunately, in the library right now, there was only Takai who was sitting in his chair reading a book as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;...... I see. So where do you want to go?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Recently, Uehara would take Touyama out if he was free. Touyama felt that it was not good to always make excuses to refuse his invitation, so Touyama decided to accept this invitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Can we really play together?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first Uehara thought he would be rejected again. It could be seen that he had a premonition that this time was also hopeless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It feels bad for me to always reject you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay! So where do you want to go?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Didn't Uehara-san already plan where we should go?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I thought if I asked you again I would be rejected, so I didn't think about it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, Uehara came to ask me without any purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So... why don't we go to the movies? I have a movie I want to see, even if it's anime, is that okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm fine with anime. After that, is there anything else... is going to the movies your only goal?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The original comic book was very popular, and the box office revenue of the movie also ranks first in history.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama said the current topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>TL/N: </b><i>I took this from China so I don't know the title of the anime Touyama will be watching, but the Chinese writing is like this (鬼讨之剑),</i></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right, I've watched both the manga and the anime, so I'm thinking of watching the movie too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara is more likely to read manga than novels, so this famous work should have already been seen by him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm surprised, Uehara-san watches anime.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the impression given above, Touyama thought that Uehara wouldn't watch anime, but from the point of view that Uehara didn't reject light novel recommendations, he shouldn't have any resistance to animation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't usually watch anime, but I liked&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;Oh yes, have you watched it Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;As for manga, I've read the entire volume of manga in the library before. I haven't watched the anime, but I want to see what the movie is like, so I'm curious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's it. Since the popularity of the movie is so high, there won't be any seats if you don't make a reservation early. Can we leave on Sunday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I don't have any plans on Sunday, it should be fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who has no friends to go out with, will definitely be idle no matter which Sunday it is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then, set a time to meet according to the appointment time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right, remember to send me a message when the time is set.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um! I got it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara replied with a smile on her face. Seeing her happy face, Touyama felt very happy that she didn't reject him today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While they were talking, Touyama shifted his vision and looked at Takai from the front desk. I saw that Takai was staring at Touyama and Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because Touyama was blocked by Uehara's body, Takai did not notice his line of sight, but he rarely cared so much about others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara happily ran up to Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, hey, Takai-san! You know&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;? It's a very popular movie right now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I know the title, but I haven't watched it yet. So what?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This Sunday I'm going to watch that movie with Touyama. I'm looking forward to it&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, so enjoy it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The conversation between the two was much better than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Uehara who was previously chatting with Takai had made no progress, the improvement from just one sentence to two or three sentences was not a big improvement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara who seemed to be engrossed in chatting with Takai, would Uehara think if Uehara knew that Touyama and Takai were sex friends? If you knew, would you feel sad...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It didn't make sense to think so. Touyama buried this thought deep in his heart.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the Sunday when Touyama made an appointment with Uehara to go to the movies, Touyama was frantically in his room getting ready.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oops! There were no clothes to wear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama, who didn't care about his clothes, had no clothes to go out at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Touyama's first time dating a girl alone. After all, I've never had the destiny to do this kind of thing so far, so I didn't pay much attention to my appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama would go to his house to have sex with Takai, the two never went out together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, forget it, just dress as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jeans and a T-shirt as usual, and a sweater on top.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I also feel that this is quite unpretentious, Touyama, who looked in the mirror, realized that he was really a sly horn.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh, I'll be late if I don't leave now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who had finished getting ready, left the room, and walked towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan! Where are you going?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Touyama was putting on her sneakers at the entrance, Naki approached her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Going to the movies.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? How come you didn't tell me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't have to report everything to you, do I?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Since this is the first time Onii-chan will be out on Sunday, I obviously care.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama smiled wryly, It shouldn't be her first time out on a Sunday. But maybe Naki who felt her Onii-chan was squatting would stand up and leave the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll go to the movies first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm...then who will Onii-chan meet?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki seemed suspicious of Touyama who seemed to be going on a date, so Touyama couldn't possibly tell her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Maybe, I'll just go alone?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's so strange not to say this directly... Could it be... with such a big Oppai&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that in Naki's heart, Uehara has been known as a big Oppai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't call people "Big Oppai", call them Uehara-senpai.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ah, oops... I exposed myself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah if that's the case! Naki will go too!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki said she wanted to go with Touyama as expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Since there are only two reserved seats, Naki can't go along.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah-how sneaky.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Naki looked dissatisfied, Touyama would be late if it continued like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I know, I know, I'll take you there next time, just hold it for today. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmm...I'll hold it for today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This wayward appearance of hers doesn't reflect like a junior high school student at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't say I'll be late, then I'll leave first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After comforting Naki, Touyama hurriedly walked towards the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara had made an appointment to meet in front of the ticket gate of the nearest station in the shopping center where the movie theater was located.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Passing through the ticket gates and walking towards the designated place, Touyama could see a very striking woman at a glance. Speaking of beautiful girls with loose curls, bright hair color, and plump breasts, it was definitely no exception to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wow... Uehara is very attractive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, Uehara was a beautiful girl. That beautiful appearance attracted the attention of many passers-by.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Touyama's appearance was very ordinary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like going back home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you were walking around side by side with Uehara like this, it would be seen in another sense. Touyama and Uehara are so disproportionate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I usually wear a uniform, I don't feel anything, but Uehara in casual clothes is very cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Uehara's relatives and friend Aizawa are different types, they are also beautiful girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ugh... It's a bit difficult to talk about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama! Here, here!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Touyama hesitated due to Uehara's overwhelming presence, Uehara noticed him and greeted him from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Passersby who were responding to Uehara's actions suddenly turned their attention towards Toyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ignoring that attention. Touyama walked towards Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, sorry I'm late, have you been waiting long?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not the time yet, so it's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good. But then again... Uehara-san, you're so cute.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The off-the-shoulder blouse and floral culottes look quite stylish with wedge sandals. The off-the-shoulder design opens up her chest slightly, which makes Uehara, who has plump breasts, full of destructive power.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really? Ehehe... I'm glad Touyama praised me for being cute.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looks beautiful and gives off an inaccessible vibe. But her words, deeds, and inner being are so ordinary that they are easily accessible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;When I saw her from a distance just now, I thought Uehara-san was the cutest of all the women around here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was no doubt that Uehara was the most charming one around this station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's just that, even if you praise me like that... I'm a little embarrassed.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The shy Uehara blushed and smiled embarrassedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;By the way, Touyama is very good at getting along with women. Other people usually don't say it directly like this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I don't know the standards of boys of the same age as me, I don't know if this is considered good in getting along with women. But since I said so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm not too sure about that, I just think that Uehara-san is cute and I'm just saying it directly... In comparison, I'm quite ordinary, and I don't get along with Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't usually pay much attention to my grooming, so I can only do this...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who usually doesn't care much about other people's views, stood with Uehara like this, and of course, he still cared about his own appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It does look a bit revealing. It's obviously early spring, but my upper and lower body have chosen dark colored clothes. It's better if I choose bright colors that have a spring feel to them.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who noticed the clothes, immediately noted the problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah yes! There's still a little time before the movie starts. Would you go and take a look at her outfit? I came to dress up Touyama. There's a cheap brand store like FU-GU here, so check it out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With this rare opportunity, Touyama accepted Uehara's invitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay. Let's take a look over there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, the two went to many clothing stores. Because of my limited budget, I ended up looking for clothes at FU-GU where you can buy clothes at a cheap price.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;These jeans are not bad, it looks quite simple with this jacket and also suits Touyama. If you wear it inside, long T-shirts are enough now&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected from Uehara, she was able to instantly choose clothes that suited Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;590 yen for the pants... that's quite cheap. The jacket is only 1,500 yen, so, I'll buy them all.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Choosing clothes like this makes me want to pay attention to my appearance, it's really great.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you go out for a walk with Uehara, you should have a decent set of clothes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I think that's good. Choose the right size and try it on.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama changed into the trousers and jacket that Uehara had chosen in the fitting room, and opened the fitting room door excitedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How is it? I think the size is just right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, the size is just right, no need to enlarge, it seems to fit Touyama quite well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In that case, I'll buy this one.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That way, you won't have to feel embarrassed when you go out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then, put on this outfit and we'll go on a date today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today's outing really counted as a date in Uehara's mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That too... Since I bought everything, I'll go to the restroom first and change there. It's a bit embarrassing to walk around in clothes like here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah... come to think of it, your shoes don't seem to match the style. There's also a shoe store nearby, so go visit it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the shoes don't match, then the overall style will be a strange combination, since all my money has been spent on them, it's better if I just wear one set.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it is Uehara's choice, then there should be no sense of incongruity to stand with her. Uehara is a pretty girl, and Touyama is a mediocre guy. This kind of incompatibility was impossible to walk together. Touyama believed that although this was not a problem that could be solved by clothes, he could only give up, but what he could do was to keep working hard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had paid the bill for his clothes, changed his clothes in the toilet and looked in the mirror in the sink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, it was much better than those jeans and sweater.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama went to Uehara who was waiting outside the restroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama looks good in that. Well, the simple and bright collocation suits you very well. It's even better to cut your hair afterwards.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My far bangs are so long that they almost cover my eyes, so I look like a villager.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;By the way, I just saw a barbershop shop for a thousand yen in the mall, so let's get your hair cut there.I'll tell the barbershop staff there a good look to cut it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if that triggered Uehara's matching soul, and I felt that Uehara was very enthusiastic about the transformation of Touyama's image.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But, is the time okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If it takes 15 minutes to go to a thousand yen barbershop, it'll be fine as long as you don't have to wait in line.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fortunately, you can get a haircut right away without having to wait at the Barbershop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, Uehara who looks like my boyfriend was giving instructions about Touyama's hairstyle to the barbershop's female Staff, the older barbershop's female Staff smiled slightly at that situation, it made Touyama a little embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, my hair already suits me too, and when I matched it with my clothes too, that cool feeling came out all at once.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara said that the barber at the Barbershop was very skillful as it received many customers due to its relatively cheap price. You can feel that Uehara really understands this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Although I'm still not a good match, even if we walk together, Uehara-san won't be embarrassed because of me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't worry about that kind of thing. No matter how you dress, Touyama is Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was an incident of harassment before, and since it was related to Uehara, we have to make appropriate efforts, otherwise we will repeat the same mistake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm glad Uehara-san can say that, but that's because Uehara-san knows me a little. But those who don't know me when they see me walking with Uehara-san, they'll definitely think&#12302;Why does it have to be that bastard walking beside Uehara-san?&#12303;&#12290;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about it like this, the school circle status can indeed be said to be true in a sense. Form small groups and circles with peers who pay attention to their conversation, fashion, and appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, you can't look down on others just because of this. Just because those who don't work hard can only get the status that suits them. And that was the case with Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Uehara had made a hole in the small circle. She did not look down on Toyama and Takai, and approached them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Obviously you can't judge people by their appearance.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Indeed it is. But Uehara-san got involved in that harassment incident because I got too close to you. It's a pity, but that's the reality.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama is really introverted huh.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's just a character trait I have.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;However, didn't Touyama make a change today to go out with me? I'm glad I was able to make a compromise like this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as everyone has the spirit of making concessions to each other, the world will be peaceful. Of course, this is just an ideal, and is impossible in practice. So I want to do the best I can.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I become closer to Uehara, I must change myself. Touyama thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Choose clothes, get a haircut, and time flies by. Towards the beginning of the movie, Touyama and Uehara walked towards the theater.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, there are a lot of people.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While walking to the movie theater, the dense crowd surprised Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The crowd includes families, friends, couples, singles, etc. It can be seen that this topical work was welcomed by various audiences.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;As expected of such a popular topical work, if you don't make a reservation in advance, you definitely won't be able to get a seat.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After taking the tickets at the automatic ticket machine, the two moved to the designated location.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We got the front adjoining seats here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We got an adjoining front section, so the head of the person sitting in front won't block the screen, and you can watch the movie comfortably.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Having a position here is good.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really! ? Compliment me on my proper seat selection.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara raised her chest proudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san is amazing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hehe, I was praised by Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked very happy, and Touyama who accompanied her couldn't help but be happy too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a while, the place went dark and the movie trailer started playing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The movie was about to start after this trailer was the most exciting moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;My heart was pounding as the venue went dark and the trailer started.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to feel the same way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the trailer ended, the movie finally started, making the anticipation even higher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The lighting in the pavilion became dimmer, and the story was about to begin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The screen expands left and right, and the story begins with a violent battle scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The powerful battle scene at the beginning is truly heartwarming.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the story gets better.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the top of Oniwa's group, one of the wall members managed to repulse a powerful enemy. However, the life that was injured in the fierce battle has turned into a candle that has been blown away by the wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He entrusted a sword that could be said to be his life to the protagonist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Please give this sword to my brother...please......&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The protagonist nodded and took the sword wordlessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;I will definitely give it to him...&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After showing a satisfied smile, the sword slipped out of his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;......You must give it to him&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama knew from the original manga that the best scene of The Sword of Ghost Discussion, was about the death of those four people. However, the attractive images and realistic acting skills of the voice actors made this scene very interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hiks......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Next to Touyama, Uehara who was staring at the screen, there was a sobbing sound. The audience in the hall also began to sob.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, Touyama's eyes also gradually filled with tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, it was hard not to cry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama managed to hold back his tears from flowing, and at this moment, his left hand was wrapped in a warm touch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara placed her hand in Touyama's. She sat next to with tears on her face, and the light from the screen shone under the reflection of the tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Very beautiful</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn_yb-mlLAnXBHVml3JqF4Lv_WmFunWPrKuGXBq7bMHBi11d8HHi-QpiiR-8r9cU5VqG0UKQGuQd7ZuZceSIoBL6PE3Z-1cHKBho1swPPzvt_4AObNMithc_85SNVvNNulq31iUaM9upm6Whow8aVA5R_j_7QYedER11We2vfmavcjbUZuFXtYWk0_/s800/w6hckIO.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn_yb-mlLAnXBHVml3JqF4Lv_WmFunWPrKuGXBq7bMHBi11d8HHi-QpiiR-8r9cU5VqG0UKQGuQd7ZuZceSIoBL6PE3Z-1cHKBho1swPPzvt_4AObNMithc_85SNVvNNulq31iUaM9upm6Whow8aVA5R_j_7QYedER11We2vfmavcjbUZuFXtYWk0_/s16000/w6hckIO.jpeg" height="500" width="350"/></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Uehara, Touyama could only think of this sentence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was so fascinated with Uehara that he even forgot about the movie.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Towards the end of the story, Touyama and Uehara were holding hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She still holds on as the credits play.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, the venue gradually brightened, and the audience started chatting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama and Uehara were quietly immersed in the remains of the story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama... well done!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a moment of silence, Uehara said to Touyama with a sad cry, as if returning to the real world from the dream world. Uehara's pretty girly appearance was marred by sudden tears and snot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, wait, Uehara-san... your nose, come on&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After handing over the tissues, Uehara took one and blew her nose hard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The pretty girls were also blowing their noses...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama gave off such a natural feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Can we start going Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few minutes, when the atmosphere finally calmed down, Touyama asked Uehara hesitantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, it's fine if we go. I have a bit of makeup that's broken from my crying earlier, so I'll go to the bathroom first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike at school, Uehara wore little makeup. Although she was also very cute without makeup, wearing makeup with this outfit of hers was probably something that only girls could understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Let's go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Touyama say that, Uehara urged him and held the hand he had just released again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, forget it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara once again walked to the bathroom while holding hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll wait for you here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I might take a while.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll wait for you on the bench over there. It's okay for a few moments of your time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama stopped in front of the hallway leading to the bathroom and glanced at the empty bench.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. Then I'll go over there first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara disappeared into the depths of the hallway leading to the bathroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Haha...that was a bit surprising...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Recalling the scene when he and Uehara intertwined their fingers like lovers just now, Touyama couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Therefore, it feels a little hot... It's spring already, is the heater still on?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama's hand still had the soft touch and warmth of Uehara's hand. This heat seemed to ignite the atmosphere, illuminating the body and mind, but I didn't realize it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama sat on the bench and read a novel on his cell phone while waiting for Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? Touyama-kun?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who couldn't concentrate on reading, was surprised by the sudden voice. Turning back to the direction from which the voice came.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I saw four of my classmates appear in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, it must be Touyama-kun. You've become so handsome, and for a moment I thought I had seen the wrong person.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh, Okuyama-kun? And Kojima-san is there. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shota Okuyama and his girlfriend Rie Kojima came to talk to Touyama on the second day of the class meeting because of their admiration for Touyama. The two were recognized as a couple in the class, and it was no surprise that they were together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We came to watch a movie together.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima!?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okuyama glanced at Kurashima and Ishiyama Saori behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saori had long black hair, delicate features, and tall stature, she was an orthodox beauty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#12300;Yes, I see....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't expect to meet Kurashima in such a place... But she didn't seem to see Touyama and Uehara who were together, and Touyama could only sigh in relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So Touyama is here to buy something?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes...I should say I'm also watching a movie...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was worried about when Uehara would return, answered Okuyama's question vaguely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh, did Touyama also come to see&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uh, yes&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh yes! So, have you seen it yet? we just finished watching.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama originally thought of ending the topic early and postponing it, but he didn't expect the other party to bite on the topic and did it anyway. Touyama regretted choosing the wrong answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We just finished watching it, maybe it's the same movie as you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We? Is Touyama waiting for someone? Seeing that you've been sitting here since earlier, it's as if you're waiting for someone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">-Bastard!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama gave a clue about who he was, but Okuyama noticed and dug up the information on his own.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible so that Uehara and Kurashima would not meet, but Touyama did not have such words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, no... the movie was very interesting earlier.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama...you seem very strange...could it be that you're on a date?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama tried to change the subject, but instead raised suspicions. Touyama couldn't help but hate his poor communication skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah - indeed, his hairstyle has become more handsome, and his clothes are beautiful, unlike Toyama-kun who was at school.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okuyama's girlfriend, Kojima, also seems to have noticed Toyama's image change from the start.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really. This is even more suspicious... It's okay to tell me secretly.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Okuyama, who came towards Touyama, seemed to be very happy for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Shota, leave that guy, let's go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima, who was silent behind Okuyama and Kojima, made no secret of his displeasure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Touyama, these words were just like a thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Kazuto, you don't have to be so mean, right? It's rare to meet our classmates by chance, so let's get along well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You don't have to get along with me, but you should leave quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's only a matter of time before Uehara returns. Before that, I have to part with this classmate of mine at all costs, but Okuyama's worries only bothered Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Touyama intended to take advantage of this unwanted situation and decided to act.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I felt like peeing, so I went to the restroom first-&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, sorry to keep you waiting so long...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I was about to say that I was going to the restroom, it was already too late and Uehara returned. That action seems to be a late move.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh... Ri? and all the people...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika! How is this possible?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Kurashima's surprised expression from seeing Uehara, she couldn't hide her frustration in her words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh... what the hell is this situation?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who didn't understand the situation, muttered to someone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The four of us came to watch a movie together and happened to meet Touyama-kun. So, the person Touyama-kun is waiting for is Uehara-san huh.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okuyama wasn't too surprised that it was Uehara who showed up, he explained the current situation to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;However, I didn't expect that Touyama-kun who seemed to be dating someone turned out to be with Marika...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kojima, who had a good relationship with Uehara, was a little surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We, we're not dating... are we? Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh...yes, yes, I just came to watch a movie...um...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To hide his embarrassment, Touyama asked for Uehara's approval. However, when Uehara heard him, a sad expression appeared on his face, and his tone of voice became weak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kum, you better understand the heart of a woman a little. After hearing that Touyama-kun denied that it was a date, Uehara-san was a little confused.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Uehara's appearance, Okuyama seemed to feel something, he shrugged his shoulders with Toyama again, avoiding the others and moving to a place a little further away, and said to him with serious eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But we're not really in that kind of relationship...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I said, even if you don't think so, the other party might just think it's a date and enjoy it? Wouldn't you feel disrespectful to her if you didn't plan to date her like this? Or do you hate dating Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hating something... that must be pathetic.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If that's the case, then don't worry about anything, just enjoy it with dignity. I think Uehara-san will be happy too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama deeply felt that Okuyama's sensitivity and calmness towards the intricacies of women really meant that the one who had a girlfriend better understood the heart of women, which was different from himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that...that what you're saying.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun, you should date Uehara-san more in the future.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Okuyama released his hand on Toyama's shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmmmmmm... I got it! Thank you, Okuyama-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okuyama, who heard Touyama's reply behind him, waved his hand and turned back towards Kojima and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then our light bulb goes out.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It could be seen that the pair of Okuyama and Kojima were very interested in Touyama and Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry to bother those two, let's go too. right? and everyone else.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, who was always silent, held the stunned Kurashima's hand and left Touyama and the others early. At that moment, Kurashima cast hostile eyes mixed with jealousy and anger towards Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I'll see you at school.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Okuyama and Kojima left after Kurashima and Ishiyama. Leaving Toyama and Uehara standing still in an awkward atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um... Uehara-san, what should I say, I'm sorry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A subtle air flowed between the two who were left in place. Remembering what Okuyama said just now, Touyama apologized to Uehara, but Uehara turned his face away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama doesn't need to apologize. It was just my wishful thinking that this was a date.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was clearly angry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm so sorry. That's... I was embarrassed to be seen by someone I knew on a first date or something, so I was suddenly shaken up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Uehara's unhappy look, Toyama hurriedly apologized. This was his first experience making the girl in front of him angry, so he had to try his best to please her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Obviously, it's fine if Touyama gets along with girls one on one, but it's not enough to get along with a group that doesn't communicate much.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I really don't have a face to argue with... But, even though I said that in front of everyone, I think today's date was really fun, and well, it was my first date."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really!? I'm sorry if it was to cover up embarrassment. And I'm glad to know that Touyama's first date is me...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Takai immediately skipped the dating step and developed a relationship in bed. Therefore, Touyama could not face accidents like today, which made Uehara unhappy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, after Uehara learned that this Touyama was his first date, he was in a good mood and his smile returned to his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This movie is so good, I seem to be crying since the middle of the movie.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After parting with Okuyama and the others, Touyama and Uehara chatted about the movie while walking in the shopping center.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The movie really didn't make me cry. The seiyuu's acting skills and bgm were amazing, I was really touched by her performance. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remembered that Uehara had actually cried before that person died.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama also tried his best to hold back his tears that gathered at the climax of the plot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really, that movie has made all the viewers cry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That scene was truly a performance that only animation could do.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, I'm curious, I want to read the manga&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;. What about the internet cafe we talked about before going here Touyama? Didn't it say there was a full volume of manga there?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The internet cafe that Touyama sometimes visits is nearby. Anyway, there's an open cafe area, so it's good to take a rest there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The Internet cafe is nearby, let's go there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okeeー&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara decided to go to the internet cafe to rest and read comics there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I've never been to an internet cafe before, I'm really looking forward to it&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Uehara grabbed Touyama's arm and urged him to leave quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, Uehara seemed to be filled with excitement no matter what she did. Touyama, who was with her, also felt her mood had improved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, so big and beautiful.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking around this open and beautiful internet cafe, it seemed to stun Uehara with its spaciousness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Internet cafes always gave off a dirty impression. But this shop must have gone to great lengths to make it easy for female customers to visit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hehe... I'll choose a variety of dishes. Pasta, curry, ramen... and karaoke sets too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara happily looked at the posters and price lists in the store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama heard that if you order a karaoke set, you also have a karaoke set and lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um...is outdoor seating okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama pointed to the price list for the outdoor coffee area where tables could be moved freely, and asked for Uehara's approval.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I want to choose this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked at the price list Uehara showed him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A couple's room! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Why choose a couple's room?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh-because I want to find a quiet place to chat quietly, and I'm also interested in a private room.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yan, that's fine too... So, which one should you choose?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are two choices. One is a room that has a flat chair with an outstretched cushion, but shoes must be removed. The other is a room with a sofa so you don't have to take off your shoes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Flat chairs are fine!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara answered immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, then we'll order the flat seat one.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We'll order for the couple room set with flat chairs.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The male staff glanced at Uehara, then looked at Touyama who offered to use the couple's room. It was still the same, as if the Staff was judging Touyama who was carrying Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Generally speaking, even if you have thoughts about the other party, you won't do anything. But the world wasn't the only one like this. So, the flames of hatred fueled by jealousy were not only at school, but also everywhere he went.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Touyama received his bill, he walked quickly to the couple's room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The couple's room is downstairs, down the stairs from there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Touyama. I want to get the manga&#12302;The Sword of Ghost Discussion&#12303;, where I should look for it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In that case, the manga should be there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama pointed to the popular comic book shelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? There are only the first ten volumes here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara wanted to know if there were any volumes after the eleventh volume, but they all seemed to have been loaned out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The eleventh volume should have been borrowed. Check again.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, too bad. Then I'll go get a drink.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed that Uehara wanted to greedily bring manga and drinks to the couple's room at once.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I can't carry so much, so I'd better put the book down and come back to get it later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Touyama and Uehara walked towards the reserved couple's room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow...this couple's room is really unexpected.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who walked into the couple's room, let out a surprised sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it was connected, it wasn't a completely independent single room. But on the flat floor there is a sofa to lie down on. Maybe you can take a nap here, but according to Touyama, it's not suitable for reading manga for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you bring your partner, you can do lustful things here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama seems to have heard that there really are couples who do this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It seems that some people want to use this place instead of a love hotel, but there are surveillance cameras on the ceiling, so I think it shouldn't work.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked at the ceiling to find the camera. This internet cafe should have installed some small circular cameras on the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, is that it? The round, transparent one.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right, there should be surveillance cameras there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really under surveillance&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's it. After all, there are people living here, so theft seems to be a frequent occurrence. Even if surveillance cameras are installed, it may not be able to fully play an anti-theft role.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, not only will there be thefts, but there will also be crimes in internet cafes. Therefore, not only surveillance cameras should be installed in the internet cafe, the couple's room will also be installed with surveillance cameras so that it is not completely made a place to be fucked by couples who are easy to fuck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is this computer working?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who came to the internet cafe for the first time, asked Touyama with interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You can use the computer to check information, watch videos, and play games. So basically the computer is free to use."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... uh uh uh, there seems to be a colored icon? What is this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then what? Is it the PV of the idol's photo?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and the others are still minors, so they can't watch adult-related shows.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Open a little aht.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Uehara clicked on the icon with the mouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can see the PVs of various photo idols in the launched app.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Which one does Touyama like?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the window, the photo idols' photos and profile lists were placed side by side, and Uehara asked Toyama which girl she liked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara waited for Touyama's answer with bright eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama never thought about what kind of girl he liked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I pity these idol photos, Touyama thinks that Uehara is many times cuter than them, and Uehara's figure is comparable to these idol photos.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Touyama honestly expressed his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uh...I haven't really thought about what kind of girl I like...but I think Uehara-san is many times cuter than them.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;And, I won't be embarrassed if Touyama says something like that again... Really... That Touyama is really a natural huh.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Natural?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Likes to play around, and likes to be praised by girls&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this, Touyama couldn't help but wonder, how could he be like that with his appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How can Uehara-san come to this conclusion with my simple appearance?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama... I said, it has nothing to do with appearance. There are also some people who are good looking, but their personalities are like trash, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like trash. Unexpectedly, Uehara would also utter swear words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, there are people like that too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking of someone in class, Touyama smiled wryly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So I've been studying. Boys don't look at my face, but they look inside my chest... I now reflect on how stupid I was back then. And then&#9472;&#9472;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara started talking enthusiastically about boys like this and that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That means&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because the topic was too long, Touyama didn't listen carefully. I feel that more than half of Uehara's talk was talking about the image of the ideal man in her heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes it was. Although it's not very clear.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe it was because of the high mood after watching the movie, and I felt that Uehara could really talk about it today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So&#9472;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I, I'm a little thirsty, I'll go get a drink and come back here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing that Uehara wanted to continue talking, Touyama cut him off, stood up and walked out of the room before Uehara could answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm afraid this topic will consume a lot of time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, I'll come too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then don't put your valuables here.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had been listening to Uehara talk about his ideal male image, but didn't know how to react, finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara's eyes lit up as she walked to the front of the drink bar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, compared to that crappy family restaurant, the drink bar here is much nicer.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everything from refreshing drinks to tea cans to ice machines.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara had placed three drinks and an ice cream on a tray.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, it's free, so not too much. what do you want?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama thought that this was all not included in the cost, so it shouldn't be free. But don't count everything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;eh...I want a soft drink.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara took a new empty glass and started pouring soft drinks into it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm going to the bathroom first, Touyama take my drink first and come back to the room.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand. Uehara-san remembers the room number, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh, I remember.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll go back first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After parting from Uehara, Touyama returned to the couple's room with a tray.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably because the movie was very interesting, Uehara was very excited after watching the movie.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, just be happy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who stayed in the room alone, started searching for comics in the internet cafe on his computer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So...are these new novels newly released?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I found some new novels that I want to read from the search results, and I'll look for them later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I was looking for something in front of the computer, I heard the sound of a single door opening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Just come in Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara should be back already. Touyama, who was looking at the computer, called out to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Cpalck&#12301;After the door slammed shut, Touyama's backside was suddenly wrapped in something warm and soft.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara hugged Toyama from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ue, Uehara-san! ?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A gentle touch on the back and Uehara's scent. The distance was so close that Touyama could feel his heartbeat and breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Touyama...Even though we held hands at school, Touyama wasn't nervous at all. Am I so unattractive as a woman?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara whispered in Touyama's ear, so close that Touyama could almost feel Uehara's breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No...that kind of thing. Uehara-san is very attractive.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Lying, it's obvious that you're always so calm.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's true. Evidently, Touyama was now quite shaken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The warmth of Uehara's body, the distinct scent of shampoo and perfume, and the feel of her plump breasts on Touyama's back. All of this was very attractive to Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara's body was strong yet soft. Although Takai was slender, he was not as strong as Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to Takai, Touyama was somewhat immune to women. Therefore, in public places such as schools, skin contact with Uehara could be easily dealt with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But in this couple's room, Touyama, who was in close contact with the charismatic Uehara, did his best to maintain his rationality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama is an ordinary male high school student with normal sexual desires. Although there was Takai, if Uehara continued to take further actions, he might not be able to refuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not having sex and having sex now are two different things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, you'll be seen by the surveillance camera lo.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After speaking, Uehara left Touyama's back. Touyama couldn't deny that he was a little reluctant to part.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I apologize for disturbing Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking back, Uehara bowed his head apologetically.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no problem, I understand Uehara-san's feelings.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was not boring like the protagonist of a romantic comedy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He knew that Uehara had good intentions for him. If he didn't take any action, Touyama would pretend not to notice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Uehara acted shamelessly like this. It would not be honest to continue pretending not to know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was just that Touyama did not know if this was Uehara's momentary confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps this was just the effect of yesterday's slanderous event.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama... do you hate me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to be talking to Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If I hated you, I wouldn't be with you now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's what I said... If that's the case, I can look forward to it a bit.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama didn't know if Uehara was asking Touyama or just talking to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Touyama had no affirmation or denial. No... More precisely, there should be no way to make a judgment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahaha, sorry, my eyes look a little wet. It's rare that I get emotional after watching a movie... I'll read the comics I brought too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara tried her best to be cheerful and wanted to restore the current atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I also have comics I want to read, I'll look for them.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama decided that it would be better to leave here first and reset his mood, so he left the couple's room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Klak......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, Uehara's sudden attack earlier made Touyama's heart beat fast. Because of the close contact with herself, I also became excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, I really can't help it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There should be no man who can be said to have no feelings when attacked by Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was looking for comics, while killing time until his mood calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Touyama and Uehara, who returned to the couple's room, talked as if nothing had happened, and passed the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I spent a long time at the internet cafe, and this is the end of the day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara took different routes, so they were separated in front of the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, had fun today. Let's take a walk together next time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm also very happy. Thank you for helping me choose clothes&#9472;&#9472;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sneak attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara's lips gently touched Toyama's cheek</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the crowded station, Uehara boldly kissed Toyama's cheek.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good night&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, whose face was flushed, ran towards the station as if running away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama covered his cheeks and stared blankly at Uehara's running figure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After parting with Uehara, Touyama walked towards Takai's house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't make an appointment with Takai today to meet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under Uehara's attack, Touyama was so excited that he could not conceal his feelings. If you don't have a partner, you can only rely on masturbation to calm yourself down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But there was Takai, who had a sex friend relationship with Toyama. So Touyama, who wanted to meet him, walked to his house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who was standing in front of Takai's house sent a message.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;I'm at your door, Takai, can we meet now?&#12303;</span></p>
