<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Only Touyama Knows My Hidden Secret</h3>

<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">[Takai Yumi's POV]</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ever since I went to karaoke with Yuki and the others, I've been going out more and more with Uehara and the others after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Recently, Aizawa-san started calling me "Yuzu".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, at my request, I came to the bookstore with Aizawa and Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuzu always reads difficult books.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We stood in front of the corner marked "Pure Literature".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes? I don't think it's difficult, but it's just that it's hard to understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I explained to Aizawa-san that the so-called pure literature are works that attach importance to art and pursue the beauty and fluidity of the text. The more famous works are Osamu Dazai's&#12302;Human Disqualification&#12303;&#12289;Kenji Miyazawa&#12302;Galaxy Railroad Night&#12303;and many more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Does it feel like a text version of a picture? Just like ordinary people who can't see the quality of paintings, I don't understand at all. Besides, I feel dizzy when I look at the text."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, Mika only reads manga. If you're not good at writing Chinese characters, it's better to read more.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Didn't Marika also only read the manga before? I don't want to be told that by you who started reading with the impure motive of wanting to get close to Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, wait, Mika! You, what are you talking about? It's not like that&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? isn't it? Sorry if I made a mistake! ?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mika...you did it on purpose, right?&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Who knows.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know very well that the reason Uehara-san often comes to the library to ask about books is because he wants to have a good relationship with Yuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But to be serious, Mika would be better off reading more. Not only can I understand Chinese characters, but I can also find fields that I like, reading in my spare time is also a very enjoyable thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Being able to read Chinese characters is really the same feeling as an elementary school student. But since all of my nutrition went into my breasts and wasn't sent to my brain, it made me an idiot.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Aizawa grabbed Uehara's plump breasts with her hands from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;hiii&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika... Your breasts are getting bigger again? I can't hold them with my full hand anymore.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Can I touch them too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Without waiting for Uehara-san's answer, I placed my hand on her large chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even Takai-san too&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unbelievable... It's so big... As expected, Yuki also thinks it's better to be big.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I put my hands on my breasts, and the huge gap between me and Uehara-san almost made me lose my confidence as a woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm so jealous of Uehara-san's big breasts.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika will give us some of these useless parts of her breasts.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa-san's are the same size as mine, or even a little smaller.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Seriously, what are you two talking about in a place like this. It's so embarrassing, don't say that again.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked around a bit, as three high school girls were arguing about the topic of breasts, and the eyes of the surrounding men were all focused on Uehara-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, Uehara-san not only has big breasts, but she is also very cute. Would Yuki be happy if I could become Uehara-san too?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san said that she was embarrassed to be seen by the people around her, so we left the bookstore after we settled the bill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After leaving the bookstore we chatted and moved to the cafe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, does Yuzu really have bad eyesight?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa-san probably noticed my thick-rimmed glasses and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;My eyesight isn't bad, it's just a pair of flat mirrors.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? They're flat mirrors...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san looked a little surprised that I was wearing flat glasses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I took off my glasses and showed Aizawa-san and the others to look at the lenses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, that's right. Why is Takai-san wearing flat glasses?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's understandable if it's for fashion, but this flat mirror isn't pretty if it's to get compliments. So it makes no sense for Uehara-san and the others to ask me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I...that...I'm not very confident in my own makeup...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Takai-san is obviously a very beautiful person, why are you thinking about yourself like this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The somewhat surprised Uehara-san didn't seem to be complimenting me, but actually thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Beautiful or whatever... I don't think that's the case...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yumi you really have good makeup, it's a pity to hide it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yes, if that's the case, why don't you take off your glasses and change your hairstyle? I think that would be really cute. I'm looking for a suitable hairstyle for Takai-san. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Uehara-san took out her phone and searched for a hairstyle catalog, then passed the phone between me and Aizawa-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How about this hairstyle?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san showed a photo of a model with short hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If the hair is always black, it will make people feel heavy, and it would be better to color it a little brighter.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have medium to long black hair right now and I haven't dyed it at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How? That kind of hairstyle. I think it suits Yumi very well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Does it suit me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Since it was chosen by Marika, I think it must suit you. After all, this kid is very good at helping people dress up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I also chose clothes for Touyama before. He looked very suitable back then, and he was so handsome, I really wanted you two to see it too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I thought of Uehara-san choosing clothes for Yuki, my heart ached.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Yumi also changed your hairstyle, took off your glasses, and became cute, is it possible that you can confidently show yourself to Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa-san sounded like she knew that I had a crush on Yuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Does Takai-san also like Toyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the point of view of Uehara-san said, "Yes, I didn't mean to hide my liking for Toyama at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I, that's...for Yu, no, I'm not like that to Touyama-kun...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order not to let the other party know about our current relationship, I deliberately pretended not to care.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yes... That's great... What should I do if a cute girl like Takai-san becomes my love rival.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san and Aizawa-san both said I'm cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Will Yuki be happy if I change my hairstyle and take off my glasses?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to attract Yuki's attention, and I'll start by making myself more cute.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the morning, Touyama, who came to school, stepped into the classroom and found that the classroom was noisier than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What about today's situation?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking around the classroom, all the girls were gathered in one place as if they were making noise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remember that seat was... Takai's! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A moment of unease flashed through Touyama's mind, Touyama wondered if something was wrong with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Approaching Takai's chair, he peered through the gap between the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eh!?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The one sitting there was not a country girl with medium dark hair and thick black-rimmed glasses, but a pretty girl with short hair, dyed her hair brightly, and took off her glasses to be cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, Takai-san has become a very beautiful woman, are you surprised?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when Touyama was dumbfounded, Uehara spoke with a satisfied look on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhh...I knew Takai-san was beautiful, so I wasn't surprised. But it's really surprising that she can change her image.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai had gone to great lengths to avoid getting involved with others in the past, but now he would deliberately turn towards the visible, which showed that his mood had undergone a considerable change.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama has long noticed that Takai is beautiful&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked surprised that Touyama noticed Takai's hidden beauty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing her again like this, Takai was truly a beautiful woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, how can you see Yuzu's charm. Are you now obsessed with Yuzu?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa spoke jokingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no, that's not the case... I just feel that if she becomes more popular, she and I will suddenly become very distant, and I will feel a little lonely."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh oh oh, Touyama is definitely not Yumi's boyfriend, why do you want the monopoly?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa, who was smiling, found it funny.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mmm&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the contrary, Uehara didn't find it interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The days when Takai no longer needed Touyama might be coming soon. Thinking of this, Touyama could not deny that he felt a little lonely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai was surrounded by girls in class and was asked a lot of questions. In contrast, Touyama watched the scene from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama probably didn't know how to deal with the suddenly beautiful Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Takai-san, is it possible that you changed your image because of someone you like? &#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Ah, this is very concerning.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like&#12302;eh who,&#12303;&#12302;Is it Kurashima-kun? &#12303;Everyone said something to themselves, but only Kurashima... Absolutely not!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who wasn't used to talking to others, didn't know what to do, so he could only speak&#12300;Yes......&#12301;or&#12300;that......&#12301;such ambiguity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, you saw Yumi with a troubled face, right? Although I know everyone cares about that, the class meeting is about to start. Everyone, please return to your seats."</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEnLziPEnrttVbjJMUhne3QJG9uzhGpgtPTmCDlWqqpDHHiDxy-hjxNW2KG5q-ljC5KsOSZJ885v53VvcCa-xGnbVnhCmKOtn_W93GijEU46ZSxvTVBO2CZq9XpteKyBfGO4tlolsDKrWd6tEBNQy1wddjY8h4GWgTFhzih22Y_xA6r8lecPIzotVX/s800/rkpex3D.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEnLziPEnrttVbjJMUhne3QJG9uzhGpgtPTmCDlWqqpDHHiDxy-hjxNW2KG5q-ljC5KsOSZJ885v53VvcCa-xGnbVnhCmKOtn_W93GijEU46ZSxvTVBO2CZq9XpteKyBfGO4tlolsDKrWd6tEBNQy1wddjY8h4GWgTFhzih22Y_xA6r8lecPIzotVX/s16000/rkpex3D.jpeg" height="500" width="350"/></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa dispersed the human wall beside Takai to take their seats. As expected of someone from the former circle's top brass. Speaking not only upright, but also influential.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The students who gathered at Takai's seat scattered back to their seats like spider children.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san, this hairstyle suits you perfectly.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Taking aim as everyone left, Touyama whispered to Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's expression rarely changed, and his face was flushed with a shocked but embarrassed expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh, oh, oh... How did Touyama seduce Yumi?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Aizawa's most troublesome words, Touyama smiled wryly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, I was just praising her frankly.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I thought so. However, if you praise her so much, you should be careful not to make Marika jealous. hum hum.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa seemed to find this situation funny.</span></p>
