<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Uehara Marika Wants to Have a Good Relationship</h3>

<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">[POV Uehara Marika]</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was a classmate named Touyama Yuki in my class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama always read books leisurely, and he looked ordinary, a boy known as the horny type.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was very concerned about this unremarkable male student at first glance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of the boys in the class, especially the ones close to me, were always talking and staring at my breasts. The content of what was said was just to attract attention and pretend to show off, there was no substance to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I refused another boy's confession, they would casually say nasty things about that person being overconfident and not a good match. Just as naive as elementary or middle school students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I wanted to have a good relationship with the girls in the same small circle, honestly, I had no interest in the boys in that circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, Touyama was very different. Among the many boys who looked at me, he was the only boy who showed no interest at all as if he didn't know me, and just read a book calmly and casually.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Last night, I met Touyama who was so far away by chance on the street.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I saw Touyama who was buying condoms in front of a vending machine. But she didn't panic at all, and she spoke to me as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, when I saw Touyama buying condoms, I felt a little depressed, it's a secret.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, I was relieved after hearing that the condom Touyama bought was going to be used by Touyama's older brother. This also surprised even me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who exuded a calm and mature aura from beginning to end, was the kind of boy I had never seen before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, I wanted to know more about Touyama, finally, I went to school early in the morning to greet him once. But his salt correspondence really made me a little disappointed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima Kazuto is a handsome male student who is very popular with girls, but he looks down on others, and this morning he went to insinuate Touyama. But Touyama just said that he didn't care, and let the matter pass. Her calm demeanor struck me as handsome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It makes me realize that as long as you have the right character, no matter how good or bad you are, you are handsome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What kind of books does he read? What was he like?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this way, I became interested in Touyama and wanted to have a good relationship with him.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, let's have lunch together.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro Okita, who was sitting in front of Touyama, turned around and spread the bento box on the table in front of Touyama who was behind her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro was one of the few friends in Touyama. She had a gentle personality and was very good at dealing with people. No matter who you were, she could be your friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She was the opposite of Toyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Moreover, she was petite, and her facial features were as delicate as a girl's. If she wasn't wearing a boy's uniform, she would be perceived as a girl with short hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So she is very popular among both boys and girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Chihiro also brought a bento today. Is that enough to eat?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the urinal box that girls use when they lose weight, there were only about two mouthfuls of food.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This is more than enough for me. By the way, Yuki, did you just eat two buns?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I just ate onigiri, if I eat too much, I'll feel sleepy in the afternoon.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama, who ate quickly in her free time, frankly said that these 2 buns were enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you don't eat more, you won't grow up lo&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't want to be told like that by Chihiro.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama felt very persuasive when Chihiro said that because of her petite size and small appetite.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro's concern is like someone who has a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Could it be Chihiro's feminine appearance that made Touyama think this way?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you feel like this when you have a girlfriend?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama had friends in benefits (Sex Friends), Touyama never had a girlfriend. And Takai never did anything like a girlfriend. So in conclusion, Touyama is an unwanted dark corner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Although I also want to grow a little bigger, but my stomach capacity is small, so this is enough.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey Chihiro, you're actually a girl, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki you're too much. Even I'm worried about that too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro, who puffed up her cheeks with a pout-so cute, that people would wonder if she was a real boy or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Chihiro is my girlfriend...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yu-Yuki! You, what are you talking about! I, both of us are men you know...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Just kidding. I don't know about that either, don't worry. At least I'm normal.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... really don't do that. It's bad for my heart.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro's embarrassed cheeks reddened slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Compared to this, Yuki hardly talked to Uehara-san this morning.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps due to feeling embarrassed, Chihiro changed the subject.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhh... It's probably because I happened to meet her on the street last night, right? I don't have a very good relationship with her. Besides, I don't want to have a good relationship with the people in that circle.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Touyama looked at the small circle where Uehara and Kurashima were. Uehara, who met Toyama's gaze, waved softly in front of her plump breasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It feels like Uehara-san is always waving at Yuki.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama chose to ignore it and looked away from Uehara's small circle. It'll be troublesome if I get entangled with Kurashima again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, is this possible? ignore what.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's okay. I don't want to get too involved with them.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......However, the other party doesn't seem to think so.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;Um?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama didn't understand what Chihiro was talking about for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, I'm greeting you! Why are you ignoring me?!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara broke away from the small circle and came towards Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahh... sorry. Seeing you chatting so happily, I thought about not bothering you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't outright say in front of myself that I didn't want to get Touyama into trouble, so I had to choose appropriately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Compared to this... you guys look like a couple. From a distance it looks like you're making out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked back at Touyama and Chihiro, and said surprising words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? We are all men. How can it look like that? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Chihiro seemed a little shaken, her faint expression seemed for Touyama to be happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Because Okita-san's woman power is higher than those girls over there. Touyama also thinks so, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara said something terrible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no, don't do that. No matter how similar Chihiro is as a girl, it's not a good joke.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara's face showed a mischievous "hee hee" smile, it seemed like Uehara was really teasing the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama once again sensed where the scene came from, he did not turn his head, but Touyama used his eyes to find the owner of the scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed to be Takai... The other one was Kurajima, who frowned and looked at him. He probably didn't want Uehara to come towards Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the encounter with Uehara last night, there had been a crossroads, and the luck had really ended. Touyama couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And then Takai... always showed an indifferent attitude towards Touyama in the classroom. But today, I looked at him as if I noticed Touyama from afar. Is it because of Uehara who is now involved to Touyama?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama was familiar with Takai, Touyama actually didn't really know what he was thinking. Then the bell rang for afternoon class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Lunch break is almost over, I'm going to the restroom.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Touyama forcefully interrupted the conversation with Uehara. If he continued like this, Touyama would be in trouble if he became Kurashima's target.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Next time, ask Takai directly what he cares about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama muttered to himself as he walked to the restroom.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a member of the library committee, Touyama is in charge of receiving book loans and returns at the front desk of the library after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the course, the borrowed and returned books would be collected at once. In the temporarily quiet library, Touyama put the book back on the shelf alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As she worked silently, the library door creaked open. Touyama noticed the female student who entered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Medium-length black hair, thick-rimmed glasses, slender body and smooth chest. Touyama even knew where the dark mole hidden by this rural schoolgirl was at first glance. And she was also quite beautiful without makeup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm here to return this book, please.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The school girl who was returning the book was Touyama's friend, Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama quietly took the book and returned it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai seemed to have something he wanted to ask Touyama, and asked with a little fear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Forget it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai made a thinking expression for a moment, but soon returned to his usual poker face. After interrupting the conversation with Touyama, he went to the bookshelf to look for books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama also wanted to talk to Takai, he still chose to prioritize the library committee work and concentrate on handling books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Inside the library with only Toyama and Takai, there was a quiet and relaxing time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai seemed to have found a book that was dear to him and sat down on his chair to start reading.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama continued to work silently, and eventually returned all the returned books to the bookshelves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had been paying close attention to Takai's vision in the morning and during his lunch break, wanted to ask questions no matter what, and was ready to talk to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I found Touyama&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before Touyama could speak, the library door suddenly opened, and the person who rushed in blocked his movement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Without reading the air, it was a familiar character who entered the library noisily. Touyama only recognized one girl who wore a uniform but exposed her chest, her plump breasts squeezed the cleavage, and her hair was brightly painted and curled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; Uehara-san, in the library please be quiet!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, sorry...but no one's there, right?  Isn't that okay? I'm just making a little noise."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't seem to look at Takai. Toyama pointed to where Takai was sitting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is Takai-san there? I'm sorry to disturb you. But I didn't feel your breath at all.&#12301;</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQrfUUGUQUicCeHuBFAKsv8kNzILzD_CHY9HRmkpYcZZlxBG76T2dZf3TJHqT7E_0qAe1DzCwcHJZAsFLyyTIBh_gbRiokvXCh4Ebb6U5LFwo2pkWyZ34eNN05VpNy5jtWYN9fIC0tLDeK0zF-4-nl14G-Dwpw-waPkOZRcMlFhxHmetTq1VDHqXyF/s800/zLK7U8C.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQrfUUGUQUicCeHuBFAKsv8kNzILzD_CHY9HRmkpYcZZlxBG76T2dZf3TJHqT7E_0qAe1DzCwcHJZAsFLyyTIBh_gbRiokvXCh4Ebb6U5LFwo2pkWyZ34eNN05VpNy5jtWYN9fIC0tLDeK0zF-4-nl14G-Dwpw-waPkOZRcMlFhxHmetTq1VDHqXyF/s16000/zLK7U8C.jpeg" height="500" width="350" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even in the classroom, Takai's atmosphere and appearance were weak. Perhaps it was because he was concentrating on reading right now, and he felt his existence was thinner than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai glanced at Uehara wordlessly, and his eyes immediately returned to the book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, did I make Takai-san unhappy...? I'm sorry if I made you angry. I'm not bad...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai was usually like that. Uehara, who didn't know this, probably thought the expressionless Takai was angry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps because of the small circle we used to gather together, Uehara seemed to be somewhat unable to read the atmosphere on this occasion. But judging from his self-reflection and apology, he shouldn't be a bad person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked at Uehara who was confused and thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's okay, I don't care about that&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai's reply was very cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's good... Takai-san is always reading in class. What kind of book are you reading? Can you tell me if you can?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps Uehara was a little interested in books, so she asked Takai for a recommendation. But the book Takai was reading should be quite difficult for Uehara to understand. Takai prefers pure literary works. He also recommended Touyama, but the content of the art book was too high so I didn't really understand it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, private conversations are strictly forbidden in the library. Please don't disturb other people's reading."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama said something like the library committee said, and reached out to help Takai. As this continues, we can only see the future when Uehara speaks unilaterally to Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry for interrupting your reading. Tell me next time in class. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who unilaterally interrupted his conversation without hearing Takai's reply, ran towards Touyama at the front desk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, talking about books with Touyama, a library committee member, isn't a private conversation, right? Tell me about the recommendation I said this morning.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, if you're chatting with the library committee in charge of management, it shouldn't be considered a private conversation. Chief Uehara suddenly became flexible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, it may not count, but is it okay to put Kurashima and the others aside? I really hope he doesn't bother me anymore.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The people who said that have left before, so it doesn't matter.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not so bad.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm sorry that you got entangled with those people Touyama. And people like him aren't bad. He's just a little selfish&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If she wasn't evil, it would be more uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not Uehara-san's fault, so you don't need to apologize. Kurashima-kun seems to like Uehara-san, so is it natural that he's jealous? Or should I say monopolizing&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... I guess, that's wrong, because Kazuto is very popular... But sometimes I also feel that he's annoying."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If that's the case, wouldn't it be better not to be in the same circle together? Although Touyama thought so, but once a small circle is formed, it shouldn't be easy to say separate actions, right?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is really quite troublesome, even if it's someone else's business, I feel a little sorry for Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So far, Touyama has been very calm, and gentle, which I think is good...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered his head and looked at Touyama behind the front desk. His expression turned slightly red, probably from the sunset light coming in from the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I want to borrow this book.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara looked at each other for a few seconds. With a "clack" sound of a chair, Takai stood up and walked to the front desk. His words brought them back to their senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama felt that Takai's words were not emotionless as usual, but contained anger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The due date is two weeks.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Thank you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if the other party was Takai, Touyama would face him with a businesslike attitude. It didn't matter if there were other people in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who took the book, left the library unceremoniously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san seems to be in a bad mood... Is it my fault?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama felt Takai's attitude that seemed to be angry, and Uehara should have felt the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... Takai-san usually does feel like that in the library, so I don't think you need to worry about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so... Does Takai-san come to the library often?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So much so, that you could call Takai-san a regular customer.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Does Touyama often talk to Takai-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to be very concerned about Takai and asked Touyama a lot of questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, we both love reading books, so we often exchange ideas.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right...I've never seen you two talking in class, so apparently the relationship between you two is very good. Did that angry feeling just now bother her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama didn't quite understand the meaning of Uehara's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No one knows the relationship between Touyama and Takai, so there shouldn't be any interruptions, right? Could it be that Uehara doubted their relationship? Touyama guessed so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is Uehara-san thinking of something strange? I'm not dating Takai.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;so... that's really good...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara put his hand on his chest with a reassuring expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's going on? Today's Uehara was a little strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when Touyama thought so, the cell phone placed under the front desk rang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gosh, I forgot to set the vibrate mode!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, Uehara-san, I'll go and set the vibrate mode on my cell phone.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Having said that, Touyama took out his cell phone and opened his cell phone screen to confirm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A message from Takai was displayed on the phone screen, and Toyama hurriedly looked at the contents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at the message displayed above, Touyama could not hide his surprise. To wonder why, because it was the message that made Touyama ask "why was it sent at a time like this?".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Let's get fucked today. Come to my house after school.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The message was very surprising because it was sent at a time like this, &#12302;Let's get fucked&#12303; such an immediate expression. Even Touyama himself was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hug, sorry, the library will be closing soon, let's talk about books next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that message, Touyama felt a little embarrassed to talk to Uehara now, so he decided to drop the subject.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is there something that has happened? Look at the way you're surprised by your cell phone.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps because Touyama read the sex invitation message in front of Uehara, Touyama's face was now in shock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, no, there's nothing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was sure that Takai must have deliberately chosen a time like this to send a direct message like "Fuck".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara or Takai, Touyama did not understand what the two of them were doing today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Seeing that you seem to be very busy, I'm too embarrassed to keep investigating you, I'll come again next time. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Uehara left the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, I'll be alone with Takai today, so I'll ask him for this information later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Uehara's back walking out of the library, Touyama's eyes returned to the message from Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had finished his work as a library committee member, came straight from school to Takai's house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was standing in front of the entrance, wanted to reach out and ring the doorbell. At this moment, the electric light behind the door suddenly turned on, and a shadowy figure was reflected in the frosted glass.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a single "click", Touyama took a step back along with the sound of the lock opening. I thought it was Takai who would come out, but I didn't expect the figure that showed his face from the other side of the door to be different from what Touyama expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, are you Yumi's friend?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A beautiful woman in her thirties, with delicate makeup and fashionable clothes, walked out from the entrance while exuding the scent of perfume.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, yes... is there Takai-san? I'm Touyama, her classmate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ara~ are you Yumi's boyfriend? It seems like that kid can't be underestimated.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was worried whether to confirm or deny that Touyama was called Takai's girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll call him, you wait here first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The woman returned inside the house without asking much about my relationship with Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Takai said that his brother was a student, it was probably his mother. It was almost night, but she didn't seem too surprised that a man came to look for her daughter at a time like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a while, the woman who was supposed to be Takai's mother returned to the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Did you call Touyama-kun here? I'll be down soon, tell him to come in and wait in the living room.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay. I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll go out, I'll ask you. Ah, do you need to use a condom? &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pfft!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What Touyama is going to do here seems to have been revealed. After all, I wouldn't think of him as my sex buddy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The woman who left the word blast, who should be Takai's mother, left Touyama in front of the entrance and left quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But then again... what happened to Takai's mom coming home on the premise that Touyama would fuck her own daughter when she met a strange man for the first time? Does that mean Ms. Takai already understands, or does she not care? Touyama was confused and didn't know how to judge her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, after all this, I was told that I can go inside, in short, I will go inside the house. Excuse me&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who knew the layout of the Takai family home well, walked into the living room without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the living room, Takai, wearing his casual clothes, was sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I didn't hear your mother was home.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't know either, I didn't expect her to be home. I don't know exactly what that person is doing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In addition, it seems that your mom thought I was your girlfriend, saying that you should use contraceptives well.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Again, that person thinks that as long as I don't get pregnant, everything will be fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the beginning, Takai had called his mother&#12300;That person&#12301;&#65292;It seemed that his family had a lot of complicated stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Instead of this, let's go to my room.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai stood up from the sofa, wrapped his arm around Touyama's arm, and pressed his chest against it. Although it wasn't big, you could feel the soft touch on his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Normally Takai wouldn't do this kind of inviting behavior, but today he was very active. Touyama was grabbed by Takai's arm and forcibly brought into his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once in the room, Takai suddenly pushed Touyama onto the bed and pushed her body down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, what's going on? I've always felt that you're a bit strange these days.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing the question about Touyama, Takai just kissed him quietly. It was a different kiss, passionate, and different from the usual kiss. Touyama only kissed Takai briefly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai pursued sensuality more aggressively than usual. After that incident, the two of them lay on the bed tiredly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, what's going on today? You've been feeling strange since this morning. Could it be related to Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama asked Takai about what was going on with him today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It has nothing to do with Uehara-san. And I'm the same as always, nothing has changed.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ever since Uehara started approaching Touyama, Takai's attitude has undoubtedly become strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Could it be... it's emburu, you're jealous?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The only reason I can think of is this. Although we are not lovers, but also we have an overlapping body relationship, there might be some idea of jealousy from there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......&#12301;We're only in a physical relationship. No-feelings like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Takai denied it, Touyama could hear the momentary pause between the words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that... Is there something wrong with me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Takai fell asleep without saying a word, but his hand was still holding Touyama's.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Beep beep beep! Beep beep beep! Beep beep beep!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama stretched out his hand from the bed, rubbed his sleepy eyes and turned off the alarm on his phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wah... I'm so sleepy... oops, I'll be late if I don't wake up now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yesterday, Takai fucked Toyama more intensely than usual, we played more than three rounds in a row. Touyama felt muscle pain and fatigue in his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Remembering Touyama from yesterday's affair, my dick had started to freeze again, and Touyama's dick became hard again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Shake it first and then go to school. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There seems to be more than enough libido to calm down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Taking off his pajamas and underwear, Touyama used Takai's messy figure last night as a side dish for his own power plant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan! If you don't wake up soon, you'll be late!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The door to the room suddenly opened, and Touyama hurriedly covered her lower body with the blanket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oops! Is it showing already!?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, no, it's okay... Anyway, I quickly covered my lower body with the blanket, even though I wasn't wearing my underwear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person who suddenly barged in was Touyama's younger sister, Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, did Onii-chan hear me? If Onii-chan doesn't hurry, you'll be late for school.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Na, Na, Naki, didn't I tell you to knock on the door first before entering the room?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama, who didn't lock the door, was equally guilty, even family members have their own privacy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahahaha sorry. But why does Onii-chan seem so anxious? Have you done something out of sight? Onii-chan is also at this age of puberty. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki's statement made Touyama feel very hot. But it was also because she was told that Touyama admitted that she was making excuses. So Touyama did not argue, but remained silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm awake, Naki, you can come out.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No? If I don't monitor Onii-chan, Onii-chan will fall asleep again.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how cute Naki was, Touyama was not so perverted that she could keep getting an erection while looking at her sister's face. Now Touyama's cock is completely withered, but there is still nothing to wear. You can't just get out of bed in front of Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, I said it's okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, Onii-chan will get out of bed now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For some reason, Naki was very stubborn and refused to leave the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... Naki hurry up and come out. Please...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's really going to be too late.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama thought that even if she was revealed to be Ngocok right now, he couldn't help but beg.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Well, that's... I was joking, but I really was shuffling...? yeah I'm sorry&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a flushed face, Naki hurriedly left the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Huh...she finally left.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki seemed to have realized it, but it was better than being seen with her naked cock. Even if detected, it could be taken as just Naki's guess and considered innocent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ups, I'm really going to be late.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama hurriedly got out of bed, made preparations for school, quickly finished breakfast, washed his face, and walked towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan wait for me. I want to go too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki is a third-year junior high school student at the same school as Touyama. Since junior high school and high school are in the same school, the way to school is also the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki, it's all because you prevented me from getting up this late, so hurry up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama left Naki, who was still lazing around, and quickly walked out of the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really~ Onii-chan is too much, leave your cute little sister and go alone.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki chased after her from behind. At the same time as Touyama was being followed by Naki, something soft touched his left arm. It was Naki who embraced her. And the true identity of that soft object was actually a well-developed chest for a junior high school student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is this bigger than Takai? Naki had already grown well... Touyama tried to restrain himself from realizing this kind of depraved thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, Naki, it's almost time for us to part ways, if you're seen by your classmates, you're mistaken.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and his family live near the school, so they can reach the school on foot without taking the train or can.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can gradually see other students around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki won't care even if I'm seen, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, that kind of thing should be taken care of. It's strange how brothers and sisters walk with their arms crossed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Other students are starting to come too, let go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Touyama forcefully pulled Naki's arm from her own.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Bad onii-chan&#65374;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You, where did you learn these kinds of things?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It doesn't sound like words you learn in junior high school, but high school students don't say them either. Touyama has read many books, and her knowledge is vast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? Toyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Touyama was about to reach the school gate, Touyama heard a girl calling him from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there a girl talking to me in the morning?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking back, Touyama saw a beautiful girl who was familiar to his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ahttt, it was Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning, Uehara-san&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning Touyama... Once again... Who is that cute girl? Is that your girlfriend...or something&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked at Naki, who was walking beside Touyama, with a troubled expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um? Ah, this is my younger brother. in junior high school&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yes, very good... I'm Uehara Marika, your sister's classmate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara breathed a sigh of relief and greeted Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan... is this your girlfriend?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki looked at Uehara with a hostile gaze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, we're just classmates.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ouh I see... it's okay. I'm his younger sister, my name is Touyama Naki. Uehara-senpai, thank you for taking care of Onii-chan.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, Touyama, your sister is very polite. And very cute. Naki-chan, please do me a favor.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, please do me a favor too. By the way... Uehara-senpai's breasts are very big. Uehara-senpai please don't tease Onii-chan.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was a boy who said it, it would turn into sexual harassment, but Naki said it to Uehara casually.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You, what are you talking about! ? Uehara-san, I'm sorry, my sister is a little strange.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay, I don't care... ahaha.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara said with a stiff expression that it was okay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Naki continued to stay near Uehara, who knows what else she would say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, let's go in.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After entering the school gate, the high school and middle school were in different directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was worried that Naki would say something strange again, Touyama went to class with Uehara as if he was running away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm really sorry for what happened to my sister just now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama apologized to Uehara as he walked towards the class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But because of Naki's strange words, Touyama, who wasn't completely at fault in the morning, was very worried about Uehara's tight breasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahaha, Toyama sister is indeed attractive. I didn't expect to suddenly mention my breasts.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Uehara touched her breasts with both hands as if to emphasize them. Touyama tried his best to remain calm, not allowing himself to become conscious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm going to the restroom, you can go to class first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Feeling a little embarrassed, Touyama did not choose to enter the classroom with Uehara, but instead excused himself to go to the restroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, see you in class.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh...I've been pretty tired since this morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The intense fucking with Takai last night greatly reduced Touyama's physical strength, in the morning, Naki consumed most of his energy, which made Toyama even want to skip class and rest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of Naki's strange behavior in the morning, Toyama lay down on the desk as soon as she entered the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning Yuki. You look tired in the morning, are you okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cute male student sitting in front of Touyama looked back and asked anxiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Chihiro... Good morning. A lot of things have happened in the morning.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just seeing Chihiro's face made me feel healed. With that innocent smile, Touyama could see that Chihiro was really worried about Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama looks a little tired, are you okay? You're not pushing yourself right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, Touyama was tired just from lack of sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, I'm just a little sleep deprived. Let me sleep before class starts.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand. I'll wake you up when sensei comes.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Please. But not to mention... Chihiro really looks like my girlfriend.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You, what are you talking about! ? I'm a man you know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... Seeing Chihiro like this, I'm starting to think that even a man would be fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro's femininity was truly no joke. Her tenderness could even make Touyama be mesmerized by her despite being of the same gender.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, why did you guys start making out and teasing each other so early in the morning?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just like yesterday, today Uehara ran to intervene in the conversation between Touyama and Chihiro.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Kuroshima hadn't come to class yet, it would be troublesome if he saw her. Touyama thought so, and looked around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning, Uehara-sama&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>TL/N</b>: <i>Here Chihiro spoke formal language to Uehara.</i></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro greeted Uehara politely like her senior.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okita-kun, good morning. We're classmates, so don't be too formal when greeting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning, Uehara-san! Is this ok&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, Okita-kun...you're too cute! You're so cute that I want to hug you. Are you really a boy?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Since then, Chihiro said the same thing when she met my sister before.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro went to Touyama's house several times to play, so she knew Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Did Okita-kun also meet Touyama's sister?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It seems that Uehara-san has seen Toyama's sister if asking such a statement.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I just saw her, and suddenly she said to me&#12302;Your breasts are too big&#12303;&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara remembered what happened just now and smiled happily. It's fine if you don't feel unhappy because of such talk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, your sister is still the same as always...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro could only smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;When I think of Chihiro's first meeting with Naki, I have to laugh out loud.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, don't think about it. It's so embarrassing...really&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro puffed up her cheeks and made a fuss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh, what? Your sister, what did your sister say to Chihiro?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara leaned forward with interest. Her magnificent breasts continued to show their presence in front of Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okay, that was very close.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama recalled Naki's words and deeds at that moment, while chasing away distracting thoughts. Looking away from Uehara's breasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Is that really a boy with a dick? &#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I remember what she said like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pfft!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara burst out laughing while spitting out his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ue, Uehara-san, this isn't funny.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, sorry...wait...ahahaha! ...Touyama's younger brother is really interesting...woohoo&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This seemed to catch Uehara's laughter, and he smiled, trying his best to contain it. However, Touyama also laughed at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... that's so embarrassing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Many people's eyes were focused on Touyama and the others. Probably because he had a good chat with Uehara, who was popular among the boys. Among them there were those who looked at Kurashima who came to class at some point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai... Although Touyama found his figure, he didn't seem to care about this place today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Compared to this... it was rather conspicuous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was Uehara and the others, who were always in the spotlight, it would be fine. But Touyama was not used to being looked at like this. This kind of gaze, mixed with feelings of jealousy and prejudice, could only make people unhappy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's almost time for sensei to come, Uehara-san should return to his seat.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order for the students not to continue struggling with this, Touyama interrupted my conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah ah, obviously I still want to chat some more. Then I'll come and play again after the lunch break.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not that I hate Uehara, but if it's so blatant, I still want to avoid active contact with him. Although Touyama didn't say it, he really thought so in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Lunch break today, I'm in charge of the library committee, so I'm not in class.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, is that so? I'll go to the library during lunch break.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It looks like Uehara is planning to go to the library. Touyama originally thought that Uehara would give up if Touyama took charge of the library committee work during lunch break, instead of staying in class. The result was an unexpected answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, the library is not a place to play.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama tried to speak in a tone like a library committee member.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Look, didn't you say that you would recommend me a book or something? Touyama also said that it wasn't a private conversation.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san still remembers that kind of thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But, the lunch break is very short, and there are many people returning books, so I don't think there is much time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, the lunch break time is very short, so there is no time to slowly select books, so only a few students come to borrow books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ehh-Is that so? That's really impossible... I'm too embarrassed to bother, so forget it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Overall, this afternoon's isturai was safe. Touyama let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm, sorry. I'll let you know if you come after school.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, if that's the case, why don't we go back together after school today? Chat over coffee at the coffee shop.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara's unexpected proposal made Touyama a little confused. With his character, even if he was rejected, he would probably bring it up again next time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama did not mean to make Uehara hate him. Touyama only hated that, as long as Uehara had a relationship with him, Touyama would definitely get someone else's attention. Touyama just wanted to spend his school life in peace.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when he was in trouble, Chihiro's figure entered his field of vision.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then... Since Uehara-san said so, may I also take Chihiro with us?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order not to become a situation where the two of them were alone, Touyama left the topic of conversation to Chihiro. If she were here right now, Uehara probably wouldn't mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm sorry, Yuki. I have something to do today, I have to go back early, so I can't accompany you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why does it have to be now!? Touyama, who had lost the way to retreat, had no other choice but to accept the request.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But if you thought about it carefully, if Uehara felt displeased with Touyama, he might not talk to him again in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Uehara has no intention of hating himself, let Uehara realize how boring Touyama is, and then Uehara will stop bothering Touyama and return to his original circle and live happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who thought of such negative things, was a sly horn in his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Isn't that so, it's a pity Chihiro can't come... Then Uehara-san, let's go back together today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really!? That's it! Well, I'm looking forward to after school.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara returned to his seat with a smile that was truly happy, not pretending.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Haha... she finally left... I didn't even have time for a nap.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The future of Touyama falling asleep in class was already a certainty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san seems to be looking forward to it, Yuki is also looking forward to it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro didn't have any strange suspicions, but hoped from the bottom of her heart that she would become happy. It was nice to be friends with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, it was precisely because Chihiro treated Touyama as her friend that she was able to get her work done without being too conspicuous in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, to stop being noticed by others, don't avoid Uehara strangely after school, but treat him as normal. Otherwise, it would be very rude for Uehara to ask him out. Touyama was very determined.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The library committee takes turns being in charge of the lunch break and library work after school. Touyama was in charge of today's lunch break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The lunch break is only 50 minutes, so the actual work time is about 30 minutes. Touyama hurriedly finished his lunch and walked to the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Chihiro, I'm going to the library.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, be careful on the way.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was also not very clear, it seems that large-scale schools would have a Sensei managing the library, mainly in charge of the operation of the school library. When the students are in class, the Sensei who manages the library would be in charge of the business in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Miyamoto-sensei, thank you for your hard work. I will be in charge of the lunch break."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun has been working hard. Then I'll take a break first, and I'll trouble you with the work at the front desk. The books that have been returned will better wait for me to return them to the shelves.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ok, I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The woman who said that and left the library was the teacher in charge of the library, Saya Miyamoto.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With long black hair and glasses, she was an intellectual beauty. Not only among male students, but also among fellow male sensei. Therefore, when Miyamoto-sensei was on duty at the front desk of the library, there were often many male students who came to her to borrow and return books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And now, the popular Sensei was taking a break, there were only a few students left in the library reading.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the lunch break ended, there was a rough door opening in the quiet library. Touyama stared at the uninvited guest who entered and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Touyama! How is this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as he entered the library, Kurashima rushed in noisily. The female students who were studying were startled. Does she know where this is?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurajima-kun, you're making trouble for others, please stay quiet in the library.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm asking you what this means&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kurajima-kun, I told you to be quiet, don't you hear me? look around you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The students who stayed in the library yelled at Kurushima, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;tsk&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima clicked her tongue loudly and left the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima really is a selfish person. Is a person who is said to be handsome so complacent?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm very sorry for causing inconvenience to everyone.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why am I the one apologizing?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What a troublesome man. Touyama watched Kurashima leave the library and sighed again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama-kun has been working hard, just leave it to me, you can go back to class.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, I know. I'll trouble you later, Sensei.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;Miyamoto-sensei came back from his break and announced that Touyama's work today was finished.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there was still afternoon class, but because of Kurashima's problem, Touyama really wanted to go home now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Speaking of Touyama-kun, Kurashima-kun seems to be standing outside the library, is he waiting for you?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That guy from Kurashima, I thought he would leave honestly, but he didn't expect to be standing outside waiting for me... This is really troublesome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's alright....&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so... but, it feels like she's very angry, is that okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I was just arguing with her about some boring stuff, it's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was probably because Kurashima found out that Uehara was going to go out with Touyama after school, so he felt unhappy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was entangled in these boring things, felt uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If something happens, let sensei know immediately.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it was a dispute about a female student, and Touyama was too embarrassed to discuss it with her. Touyama could not help but hold his head in distress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good, thank you sensei&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama walked towards the library door with heavy steps. Open the door and go out carefully while observing the situation outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ah? Isn't that guy from Kurashima...I got impatient and gave up?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who thought so, walked down the corridor towards the classroom, but when he was halfway, someone suddenly came to talk to him from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, I'm getting impatient waiting. I have something to say to you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking back, it was Kurashima who Touyama least wanted to see calling out to him. Was he hiding somewhere?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So, what is it? Since class is about to start, please hurry up.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were still about five minutes before class started.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I want you to refuse to go with Marika.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, Touyama was also thinking like this, but why would you want someone to reject it out of the blue?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama began to wonder if there was something wrong with Kurashima's arrogant nerves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that what Uehara-san asked Kurashima-kun to do? If it is, I don't care, if not, you're really nosy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika didn't say anything. After all, you forcibly invited Marika, right? That person is very gentle, so there was no way to refuse. A bastard like you doesn't deserve to play with Marika.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is she talking about the nobles of which world? It's really unclear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You seem to misunderstand, Uehara-san invited me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There's no such thing! Don't lie to me&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If it's a lie or something, you'll find out by asking Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima muttered to herself, how could it be...why would Uehara ask out a guy like this...or something like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Are you okay? It's almost time for class to start, so I'll go back to class first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I continue like this, I'll only be late for class, and it's just a waste of time to pay attention to a guy like this. Touyama forcefully left the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, hey, wait! I'm not done talking to you yet&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kurashima seemed to want to say something, but Touyama chose to ignore him and walked towards the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama walked quickly to class, and when he returned to his seat, he sighed while lying down on the desk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, you look tired, are you okay? Are librarians working so hard?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Touyama's tired face, Chihiro was very worried.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's not the librarian's business, it's mostly something else...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Blame that idiot for me not getting enough sleep here. What a troublesome man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, it's not obvious, but it's hard work. There are still classes in the afternoon, Yuki, please stick to it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro encouraged Touyama with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wanted to boil Chihiro's nail tartar and give it to Kurashima to drink, but on second thought, it was too wasteful to give it to that person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Chihiro...you're amazing. If you're really my girlfriend, I think I'll be very happy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro healed the spiritual power of Touyama, who had been cut down because of Kurashima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;They all say that I'm a boy... I feel ashamed after being said so many times like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The shy Chihiro looked like an angel in Touyama's eyes. Even though she was a boy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, it was just a joke. I'll sleep first, then wake me up when sensei comes.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was healed by Chihiro, decided to take a nap to regain his energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Are you going to wake up in your own bed? With such an escape, Touyama prayed that it was just a dream, and fell asleep in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Last night's sleepover with Takai, Naki's strange behavior in the morning, and Kurashima's confusing behavior during the day, caused Touyama's physical and mental strength to be greatly reduced since yesterday. In the case of sleep deprivation, Touyama, who was constantly dozing off, finished the afternoon class in a daze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara agreed to go out together after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it was Kurashima who found out about this, and Touyama was entangled by him during the lunch break. How deep is that man's jealousy? Are you so obsessed with Uehara?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For this reason, Touyama honestly didn't want to go out with Uehara. And his fans aren't just in the class, there are many people from the lower class to the upper class. If they knew, there would definitely be other problems.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since his relationship with Uehara, his peaceful life began to be threatened, and Touyama felt a sense of crisis.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama didn't hate Uehara, but rather liked her. After all, she was a beautiful and cute beauty, with an outstanding figure and gentle personality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to be close to Uehara, I want to hang out with her, I even want to fuck her. As a man, you must have such desires. Actually, there should be many male students around with this kind of feeling. And Kurashima was undoubtedly the most representative figure among them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Touyama, even if he could have a good relationship with Uehara, his peaceful life would be threatened.If these two things were balanced, he would definitely choose the latter. To ask why, because Touyama was very satisfied with the current relationship with Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The relationship with Takai was not sweet talk like liking or loving, but when he overlapped with her body, Touyama felt very satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Touyama's experience is only one person, Takai. But both of them have very good physical confidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For this reason, Yuanshan didn't particularly want to have a good relationship with Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama even thought that if he could, it would be better to make a friend who could tell the truth like Chihiro.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Uehara could be a good friend. However, there was a school circle status wall between them. Kurashima and Touyama's circles were not in line, this was the reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, are you listening to me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Someone poked Touyama's shoulder from behind, which brought Touyama back to his senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara-san</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah sorry. I'm a little confused.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to greet Touyama several times. But she was completely unresponsive on him. Perhaps Touyama was half asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Looking at Touyama, you didn't answer my call, I thought you were sleeping.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After thinking about Uehara-san for a while, I was half asleep.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh? I... I, like what...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara showed a somewhat surprised expression, her cheeks flushed slightly, and she lowered her head in embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uh, uh-it was...I was thinking of where to go with Uehara-san after school. not thinking of anything strange.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did the statement just now create a strange misunderstanding? Touyama felt anxious. But he was thinking about Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, that kind of thing... So, have you decided where we should go?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara showed a slightly regretful expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, Uehara-san said that if you want me to recommend a book, let's go to a bookstore and look around.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm, there seems to be a big bookstore in front of the station, right? uh... what's it called?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhh, it's Introspection Hall.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good! Hall of Introspection! Just go there.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who had decided his purpose in this way, quickly packed up his belongings and stood up from his seat. Looking around, he walked side by side with Uehara to the classroom door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed that the combination of Touyama and Uehara was rare, and the other students had directed their attention to them. There were so many differences between the beautiful Uehara and Touyama, it was only natural that they would attract attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't seem to see Kurashima's figure...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before leaving with Uehara, Touyama had worried that he would be constantly followed, but it turned out that he was unfounded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Takai is--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems like he's no longer in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reading in the library after school was a daily routine for Takai, so he should be in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Touyama and Uehara walked to the door and were about to leave the classroom, another student entered the classroom, Touyama and the others stopped in front of the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai! ?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With black hair and glasses, he walked into the classroom, glanced at Touyama and Uehara who were standing at the door, and passed by casually.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara left the classroom in turn with Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What were you thinking when Takai saw Toyama and Uehara walking together?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai himself said that they were not lovers but just sex friends, so there was no such feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Touyama doesn't care.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a comfortable relationship with Takai... that was all. Touyama said to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Because of that, Takai-san and I hardly talk at all. Touyama seems to often talk to her in the library, what kind of person is she?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I don't know why Uehara is interested in Takai, she shouldn't be suspicious of Touyama and Takai's relationship by looking at him like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;He and I only talked about books, so I don't know anything about him.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama knew almost nothing except that Takai's family was complicated. Takai didn't say anything about himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So...will she talk to me if I know better about books?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san wants to chat with Takai-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, we are classmates, so I want to have a good relationship. But Takai-san is usually alone and doesn't know what to say to me, so I thought books should be our chatting opportunity."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, Uehara was a good person who had no prejudice against anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama could not understand why Uehara was entangled in a circle with Kurashima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's why...that's why you asked me about that book.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In that case, Uehara's action of seemingly having no interest in reading could also make sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, that's not the case... it's Touyama... it's...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara had an indescribable expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? I what?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Nothing at all! Idiot&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did I do something that made her angry?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who could not detect a woman's mind, had female experience, but had no lover. This made him realize again that Touyama was an unwanted bastard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two exchanged their indoor shoes for flats while chatting and walked out of the school gate. Touyama, who felt the gazes of the other students, once again felt Uehara's popularity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't seem to care much about the attention of the crowd, and no matter where he was, he was a natural unadorned posture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I see... Is this what is called charm?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Toyama discovered Uehara's charm for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It takes twenty minutes to walk from the school to the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So what kind of books does Uehara-san like?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara, heading to their destination, Reflection Hall, is a large five-story bookstore. In order to avoid difficulties in finding books, you should decide in advance what kind of store you want to go to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Light novels, literary works, novels, etc. There is not so much time to explore one by one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm...I don't usually read novels...that's as much as I do when writing reviews.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In that case, light novels and character literature with a lighter style would be better. Touyama narrowed his scope.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You like what type? Like love or something else.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's true, I still like things related to love. I often watch romantic movies. There are also fantasy movies like adventure. I don't like scary and weird ones.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can feel that Uehara's preferences are quite common.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Uehara has otaku elements, I should be able to recommend some Romcom novels. So Touyama decided which type of shop to visit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was an otaku who loved watching anime and loved reading light novels. He didn't mean to hide it from Uehara. If you can't stand the house, then let go of the relationship, there's no need to force the relationship if you have different interests.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While asking Uehara's preferences, Touyama moved forward, and in a flash, he arrived in front of the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama goes to school on foot, so I won't be using the station. However, the station side was quite prosperous with everything from large bookstores to home appliance stores.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few minutes' walk from the station, you'll arrive at Reflection Hall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow, this bookstore is really big.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the building called Reflection Hall, Uehara was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there was a 100 yuan shop and a cafe, but today, when the paper books were almost sold out, it should be a very powerful thing to be able to sell books in an entire five-story building like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Referring to what Uehara said on the street, the two moved to the light novel shop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;For someone like Uehara-san who isn't used to reading books, I think light novels should be a good choice?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama took Uehara to the light novel shop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wow! Is it really okay for the cover to be so H?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the counter filled with books with colorful covers, Uehara looked at the cover illustration of the light novel, her eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama realized again that light novels were indeed male-oriented entertainment works.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There are many cover works of this kind in light novels. Especially Isekai themes. When it's a Romcom cover, it's usually wearing a uniform."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey...but the illustration is cute. But her breasts are so big! In reality, there won't be any high school students that big. Are the heroines of light novels all big-breasted?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, Uehara-san, I don't think you're that big.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama really couldn't say these words, just staring at the chest of Uehara who raised her uniform and nodded lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, if the standard of actual large breast size is put into a light novel, it should just be taken for granted, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama pointed at the illustration of the girl on the cover of the novel flatly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? These breasts are big. If this is normal, then real girls would basically be bad breasts. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, after all, it is an invention. Standards will also be developed based on the preferences of light novel readers.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The target group of light novels are mainly males from junior high school students to social people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... guys like big ones? Touyama also thinks bigger is better, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered her head, looked at Touyama, and threw out a question that Touyama had no idea how to answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, well... I don't hate it, I like it when it fits in my hand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To say that the only breasts Touyama was familiar with were Takai's pair of breasts. But it is hard to say that Takai's are not very big.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But it is very soft and the sensitivity is not bad. If you want to cut it, you can barely cut it. So according to Touyama it doesn't matter if it's not too big.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hum hum, Touyama likes small ones...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered his head and looked down at his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems Uehara misunderstood that Touyama likes small ones.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So, Uehara-san is okay with such illustrations? Because some people will hate it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Judging from the conversation, Uehara just saw the illustration on the cover very generally, and he was able to communicate with Touyama, who seemed to have no problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The words are fine. Let's just say I like it. And I also read manga etc.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If Uehara-san doesn't hate cute illustrations, that's fine. It seems like there are some recommended books.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I haven't discussed this topic with anyone else. But, people stare at my breasts all the time, and I hate those disgusting stares. But, Touyama didn't stare at me like that when you were talking to me, so I was very relieved.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, it was clear that the two of them were talking about the topic of big breasts and small breasts, but Uehara and Touyama communicated very generally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Teenage boys and girls such as junior high and high school students should avoid such topics because they are shy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Remember what I said yesterday that Touyama looks like an adult?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It sounded like something that had been said. Toyama began to search the memory of her conversation with Uehara during this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmmm, yes I remember.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In class, the boys around me are like children who fully reveal their intentions. So I don't really want to get in touch with them. But the girls in that small circle have a good relationship with me, so I can't lose it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it was a small circle led by Kurashima, so Touyama could probably imagine what it was like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why Touyama seemed calm was because of Takai's presence. Since Touyama could release his sexual desires regularly, Touyama didn't need to try his best to seduce other girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, Kurashima in the center of a small circle is like that. That circle is very troublesome.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The possibility of being ostracized or bullied is high if you leave your close circle. If you want to live smoothly at school, you can only join a certain circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, isn't that impossible? The so-called collective is such a thing. I think it's enough to try being yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I envy Touyama. No ties like that, looks free.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;On the contrary, my only friend is Chihiro. As a result, it's impossible to get the best of both angles like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Can't have the best of both worlds?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Although I'm very free, not bound by a small circle. But when it comes to school trips or other activities, I'm alone without any friends. And Uehara-san has many friends, so even if I participate in activities alone, I don't have to worry about anything and can enjoy it to the fullest, even though I feel bound by the small circle and feel unfree. Maybe it's this feeling&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A place like Touyama... really looks like an adult. I think this is good.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not the same as being like an adult or anything like that. Touyama felt that when she did not integrate into campus life as a microcosm of society, as a person, was it a disqualification.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm not like an adult. I just felt troublesome to others and chose to run away. If I were an adult, I would probably be able to understand my own social coordination and get along well in class. So Uehara-san is more like an adult than me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so? I don't know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I just have more opportunities to learn, and more knowledge to follow. I think of myself as a boring middle school student.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmph, it's true that you are an arrogant child who likes to reason.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It would be better if you could tone it down a bit.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You know, since I'm an honest person, I won't lie.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;To be honest, this cannot be denied. After all, Uehara-san is the same person as she appears on the outside. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's only in front of Touyama. Be careful in that small circle, it takes a lot of superficial work&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that Uehara can only show the same side of the surface in front of Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara must have suffered a lot. Even so, it's impossible to get rid of such a society circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Obviously I was explaining the book, but the topic suddenly went off track. What should we do Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Uehara said, Toyama was rather fond of reasoning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama himself felt a little embarrassed for telling some big truths to his classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I hope to read some books that can turn into an adult like Touyama!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In that case, it's better to look at the books in the school library, which can add a lot of superficial knowledge like me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Will I become a lonely person like Touyama? I feel so disgusting.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't deny that I'm a lonely person, but it's not because of reading that I become lonely, is it? Loneliness is my own attribute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't know if this is a masochistic joke.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Uehara giggled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That smile would fascinate any boy. It's a real expression that you can't see in class, but is only seen by Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, Touyama and the others left the Reflection Hall without buying anything. Since Uehara said that he wanted to chat some more, the two moved to the cafe and chatted about some bland topics, and the day ended like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The original purpose of the book selection was for Toyama to select some books in the school library to lend to Uehara. Although there were no works with extreme content and covers, there were light novels in the school library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was surprised to learn of this. The expression on his face at that time would make Touyama laugh out loud for as long as he remembered it.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Uehara and Toyama went to the Hall of Reflection, whenever Toyama was in charge of the library committee work, Uehara would show his face in the library from time to time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama! I'm here to return that book.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The book Uehara returned was a romantic comedy light novel that would make people ask "Is there such a thing in the school library?" Now Uehara seems to be completely obsessed with reading, and often comes here to borrow books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama asked Uehara to choose a pure love light novel at the beginning, and it also received interesting comments. Then I recommended a romantic drama like romantic comedy, and Uehara suddenly liked it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A heroine like romantic comedies generally doesn't exist. Men fantasize about women too much.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And it also often happens that you leave a very realistic comment like this to a daydreaming boy and then leave the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara walked step by step towards home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Takai could be said to be a resident of the library no matter if Touyama was there or not, and he would definitely show up here after school. Uehara had talked to him a lot recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, hey, Takai-san, this novel is very interesting. have you read it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai squinted at Uehara who was sharing a pure love light novel. Touyama looked at the scene with a relieved smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't read that type of book. Uehara-san, private conversations are strictly forbidden in the library. So please don't talk to me, it will hinder my studies.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The conversation between the two like this, without saying a word, was finally ended unilaterally by Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai can't read teen romance novels. He preferred the complicated adult type of stories, though Uehara had no idea what Takai liked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara wasn't afraid of Takai at all, and whenever they met, Uehara would try to ask him about his liking for books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Haha...I don't understand Takai-san's preference these days. The books that Takai-san reads in the library are too difficult to understand, I can't do it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of what Takai read in the library was pure literature and philosophy. The threshold is too high for Uehara who is still a beginner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey Toyama, do you know what kind of books Takai likes to read? Tell me about it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You want to try reading the book Takai is holding right now&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That book is too hard for me to read! I prefer some ordinary novels.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If you want to have a good relationship with Takai-san, you'd better ask her directly.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course Touyama knew what Takai liked. However, Touyama thought it would be meaningless if Uehara didn't ask Takai himself, so Touyama didn't tell him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really... you're so stingy, Touyama&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama wanted Takai to open up to Uehara and become friends. He felt that Takai's heart that had been lost in the complicated family environment seemed to be filled by this relationship with himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But this is only temporary. The filled hole would soon be opened. Toyama is just an ordinary high school student, and what she can do for Takai is limited. Respond only if he needs to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai did not tell Touyama his sincerity. Probably because Takai did not seek Touyama out much to perform such a task.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Touyama thought that if there was a same-sex friend like Uehara who treated anyone without prejudice, it should be different. At least the words of a friend who was willing to listen... Perhaps everything would be fine, and Touyama would no longer be needed either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama thought this was also possible. After all, it was normal.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During the lunch break the person in charge of the library was Toyama, there were no other students in the library except Takai, just the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I want to borrow this book&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After borrowing the book Takai brought, Touyama handed it to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The deadline for returning the book is two weeks later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai didn't take the book, but grabbed Touyama's wrist and pulled him to the side. Touyama leaned forward, his face close enough to kiss Takai. There was a faint scent on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, Takai brought his graceful lips close to Touyama's ear and whispered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey, Yuki.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why does that kid keep following me?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You mean Uehara-san?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Uehara seemed to want to have a good relationship with Takai, Touyama decided that it was okay to tell Takai, so Touyama told Takai what Uehara said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;He said Uehara-san wants to have a good relationship with you, Takai.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You asked me, I don't know either. I also rarely socialize with classmates.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Huh.. that's a weird kid&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so? He's a good kid with no prejudice."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;...... Does Yuki like him?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? I don't have such feelings for him...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What's the problem? suddenly asking this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai is also looking at Uehara-san a little softer?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama's words received no response from Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was unclear what Takai thought of Uehara, Takai cared about Uehara. Perhaps the day when the two become friendly will come in the not too distant future.</span></p>
