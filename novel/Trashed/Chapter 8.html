<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Love is Blind</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuto... do you want to continue searching for the culprit?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course, I must find the culprit, I must dispel people's suspicions of me...I will definitely find the person who hurt Marika.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, at the fast food restaurant in front of the station, Saori Ishiyama listened to Kazuto Kuroshima's confession with mixed feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama had been in the same class as Kazuto since he entered middle school. At that time, Ishiyama fell in love with Kazuto at first sight, and until now in the second year of high school, this feeling has not changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll try my best to be with people to find the culprit... But Uehara-san doesn't want to find the culprit? In this case...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not working. If it continues like this, that person... Marika will be taken away by Touyama. Once the culprit is found, Marika will be with me again.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this sentence, Ishiyama felt a pain in his chest, and his straight face turned downward.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama did not convey the contents of his mind to Kazuto, but buried it deeply in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if Ishiyama conveyed his feelings to Kazuto, who only saw Uehara now, the result would only be broken jade.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Ishiyama naively thought that as long as Uehara and Touyama were still in contact, Kazuto would give up. So Ishiyama created that group chat and spread the rumor that Touyama and Uehara had hooked up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the contents of the group chat gradually became exaggerated, and eventually developed into a situation that slandered Uehara. After the class meeting was revealed by Touyama, Ishiyama hurriedly deleted the group chat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I understand... I'll also ask my friends about it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it wasn't Ishiyama who posted the slander against Uehara, it was him who created the group chat. If Kurashima knew the truth, Ishiyama would probably be insulted and hated by him. That's why he pretended to help find the culprit. And Ishiyama could be with Kurashima while he was looking for the culprit. This thought made Ishiyama's tantrum unstoppable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, Saori.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No problem, as long as it's Kazuto's request, I'll do anything...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Ishiyama's sincerity and her own will.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I, I'll refill my drink again&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, who didn't want to tell the truth, felt a little embarrassed because of her shyness, and left her seat from Kazuto as if she was running away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama who had just left the fast food restaurant. Saw a group of people familiarly coming out of the karaoke across the street.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That...Marika and the others?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kazuto who looked across with his own eyes, saw five of his classmates, including Touyama, Uehara, Aizawa, Okita, and Takai, seemed to be having fun in front of the karaoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika... Are you with Touyama again!?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kazuto stared at Touyama's person with a fierce hostile gaze. Her bitter and twisted expression with jealousy and anger made Kazuto feel hurt again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Come on, let's go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama grabbed Kazuto's hand and wanted to turn around and leave, but Kazuto himself remained motionless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Saori, I'll be back later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kazuto untied Ishiyama's hands and started walking towards Touyama's direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then, me, I'll go with you too!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama also followed Kazuto behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two followed for a while, and the group of Touyama who came to the station dispersed in two directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the direction of the return road was the same, Touyama and Takai both walked in the same direction. Probably the same way home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The people have all gone back home, so, why don't we go back home too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... I'll follow Touyama and Takai. I've always felt a little weird about those two."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kazuto seemed to feel something and showed interest in Touyama and Takai. Ishiyama also seemed to feel something from the two of them, nodded silently, and followed behind the two of them without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While waiting for the train on the subway platform, Ishiyama and Kazuto continued to observe the two people behind the pillar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the train arrived at the station, Ishiyama and Kazuto boarded with them and sat side by side so that Touyama and Takai would not find out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two peeked at Touyama and Takai sitting on the train next to them, but they couldn't see clearly because they were blocked by other passengers. Even though they were sitting side by side, they didn't seem to say a word.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After arriving at their destination station, Toyama and Takai stood up and walked towards the exit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did they both go to the same station?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unexpectedly, both of them got off at the same station. Ishiyama and Kazuto also hurriedly caught up with them, and continued on their trail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After exiting the ticket gate, Touyama and Takai were moving in the same direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey... where are they going together? Are they trying to stay close together?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Confused by the unexpected actions of the two, Kazuto and Ishiyama, who had the same thought, continued to follow them. When they came to a house, the two stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama and Kazuto hid in the corner of the house and continued to observe it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai first entered the house alone, and after a while, the entrance was opened again, and Touyama was pulled into the house by hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai blushed as if he was inviting his lover into the house, as if he was thinking about something. Ishiyama subconsciously took out his cell phone to record this scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Are the two of them dating...?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... that kind of atmosphere.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you're just inviting her to the house, it should also be considered as friends visiting the house. But Touyama and Takai exuded a male-female atmosphere that was different from ordinary friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; That Touyama... obviously doesn't have a girlfriend... Could it be that she is now dating Takai!?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Here, there is no way to judge whether they are dating or not, calm down. I'll check again later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Touyama had a girlfriend, it would deviate from Ishiyama's original plan to let Kazuto give up on Uehara. Ishiyama judged it necessary to confirm this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;If this is true, it can be used to threaten Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kazuto muttered as if he didn't know who he was talking to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Saori, let's end it here today, there's no point in staying here, let's go back.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two hid their thoughts inside their hearts, turned around and returned to the station along the way they came.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If these two were dating... this photo would come in handy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ishiyama, she was like Kazuto, both of them didn't realize that love had made her blind.</span></p>
