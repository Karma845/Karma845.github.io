<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; The Lie Will Always Be Revealed</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan, when are you going to keep sleeping? Wake up soon~&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm...let me sleep a little more...good night...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably because I didn't sleep until late after reading the book, the alarm clock was already ringing in Touyama's room, but I unconsciously turned it off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really, you're really going to be late.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Naki seemed to say something, Touyama couldn't help his body if he couldn't move.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sticky and viscous substance....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait a minute? I'll fall asleep a little more...? I'll wake up soon, so let me sleep for a while... Excuse me...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Whoa...the bed is full of Onii-chan's odor. Good night......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Whoahh, Naki! ? Why did you climb into my bed?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My body suddenly warmed up, and I bumped into something soft, I opened the bed and saw Naki had slipped in and fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What's wrong, Onii-chan? Do you want me to sleep with you here? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't use that misleading statement! How can there be a brother and sister still sleeping together with their sister at this age?!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ain't there brothers and sisters sleeping together here?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Brothers and sisters sleeping together are indeed here!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I... really will be late later, I'll get out of bed now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's been ten minutes since I turned off the alarm, and if I don't get up, I'll be really late.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhhh, Onii-chan, don't push me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama pushed Naki away and kicked her out of bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama jumped off the blanket, hurriedly washed his face and brushed his teeth, and walked towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'll go first!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, what about breakfast?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Touyama hurriedly walking across the living room towards the entrance, his mother spoke to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, I'm running out of time, I'll buy some at the convenience store later.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She hurriedly put on her shoes and rushed out of the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan! I want to go together too, wait for me~&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki probably didn't have breakfast either, and caught up with Touyama from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Who do you think made me wake up so late? I'll leave you alone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah~ um, is Onii-chan planning to leave your cute little sister behind?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Naki seemed to say something, Touyama chose to ignore her and walked quickly to school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After walking a long way, I had a little time left, so Touyama, who wanted to buy breakfast on the way, stopped in front of a convenience store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Haha..ha...gan, Onii-chan is too much. Running so fast.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Naki, who was chasing after Touyama, complained, Touyama felt that it was fine if Naki didn't push herself. After all, there was still plenty of time before the start of junior high school classes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Naki didn't run much either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki, is your stamina worse than mine?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki put her hands on her knees, &#12300;Hahahaha&#12301; with a gasp.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Onii-chan knows I'm not good at sports, right? I strongly urge Onii-chan to be gentle with her little sister!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki said something inexplicable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's better for Naki to train more physical strength. It's bad to have such a big body and still have poor physical strength.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Putting aside Naki who was protesting him, just after passing through the automatic doors of the convenience store, Touyama met a woman he recognized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Touyama? Do you want to buy something?&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I entered the store, I saw Uehara who was shopping.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning, Uehara-san. I overslept today and didn't have time to have breakfast, so I wanted to stop by the convenience store to buy something.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, big Oppai!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as Naki saw Uehara, she suddenly said something rude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki, Naki-chan, good morning. That name is a bit embarrassing, can you stop calling me that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it was quite interesting to be called "big Oppai" in front of people, and everyone's eyes suddenly focused on Uehara's plump breasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki, don't use that name anymore. Uehara-san is also your Senpai, so don't be rude to others. You're no longer an elementary school student.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Too naive to say this, Touyama asked Naki to pay attention with a slightly reproachful look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes... I'm really sorry for calling Uehara-senpai in such a rude manner.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps knowing that Touyama was really angry, Naki seemed to ponder over it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, I'm not angry, so let's cheer up Naki-chan.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This should be a good medicine for Naki. It's not easy to let her get carried away like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay thank you. But I'm very jealous of Senpai's big breasts, so please don't tease Onii-chan with that pair of breasts.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki didn't reflect any regret at all!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahaha, Naki-chan is still the same. Speaking of brothers...that's right! Naki-chan has another brother, right?&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Naki only has one older brother, Yuki, standing here in front of you?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oops!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Toyama went to buy condoms earlier, she lied to Uehara that it was her brother who sent her to him. In this situation, the lie was revealed at once.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? When I met at the vending machine earlier, I remember Touyama saying that his brother asked him to buy it...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked at Touyama with a suspicious look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh, uh... is that so? I don't remember saying anything like that... Well then, if you don't go to school now, it'll be too late, so hurry up and let's go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, like a politician, pretended not to remember what he said back then, and walked to the cashier to get in line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's very suspicious. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how Touyama thought about it, it was a hard excuse to forgive, and Uehara looked at Touyama with fish eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Uehara did not investigate the matter, and the three walked together to the school gate. After parting with Naki, Touyama walked to the shoe locker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I mentioned the shoe locker, I thought of the note placed in my locker, and I carefully opened the shoe locker to look inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Nothing? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who heaved a sigh of relief realized how much his heart was hurt by the slanderous incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama, let's go after school, let's go home together.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Uehara rarely invited Toyama who was about to pack up and go home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah? Aren't you going back with Aizawa-san today?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Mika said she already came back earlier.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm well. Let's go back home together today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okee!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was in a good mood to get back together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Toyama and Uehara were about to walk out of the classroom together, they attracted the attention of the classmates in the class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the class meeting incident, there were rumors that Touyama and Uehara were dating.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Uehara didn't care much and pretended nothing happened, Touyama was a little embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two walked through the school and walked side by side to the school gate, and the eyes of the other students passing by were focused on them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was really cute. She had a beautiful appearance that attracted the attention of others. Touyama never thought that such a nice girl would have such a good impression on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This could only be blamed on Touyama's lack of confidence in himself, Touyama kept thinking&#12300;Why is Uehara-san so cute?&#12301;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Touyama also felt that if he was too humble, he would feel too sorry for Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You still have to have confidence. Touyama said to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two walked out of the school gate and walked silently for a while. Uehara seemed to have something he wanted to ask, looking at Touyama from time to time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That...I have something to ask Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was the first to break the silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama obviously doesn't have an older brother, so why did you lie to me at the vending machine?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't answer that question in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is estimated that Touyama at the time did not expect that the lies he had casually told back then would actually be strangling his neck now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few seconds of silence, Touyama's words came out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That...because I felt a little embarrassed to be seen by Uehara-san, so I lied unconsciously.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Regarding this matter, Touyama had no choice but to speak up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's true, if Touyama had a girlfriend, and bought it for...that...to have sex with that person?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked at Touyama with a sad face and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara must not know about Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama really wanted a reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That... Of course, I can't say, but do you still remember knowing about it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um. I want to know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;This matter is actually quite embarrassing to me... It's not a good thing, maybe it will make Uehara-san hate me. Even so still willing to listen?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I won't hate Touyama. So tell me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What I'm going to say next is all about Touyama's experiences and talks mixed with lies, so it's half true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So...that...that's what I used when I did it myself.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In short, I'll tell Uehara indirectly and convey the meaning to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Do it yourself?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unfortunately, this alone doesn't give Uehara any meaning. It seemed that only a more direct expression could be used.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama said nervously while making up his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That...that's what I use when I masturbate myself...right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if it was a lie, didn't Toyama say something really embarrassing to Uehara? What an embarrassing game this is!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Shake, Shake&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Eh! ?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was very surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Can Uehara-san accept this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Uehara could accept this statement, both parties wouldn't have to keep being embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmmm, I just don't understand that... You, you can do it yourself Touyama, can you tell me in more detail?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to be very interested, and was even more insistent on the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, there's such a thing as an airplane cup... ah, that's what imitates a woman masturbating. Pour lubricant into it.However, if I use it like this, not only will I be slippery with the lube there, but I'll also have trouble rinsing off afterward, so I put a condom on it...for masturbation."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama finished speaking in a half-sacrificing manner, and looked at Uehara in a dignified manner. He was so stiff that his neck turned red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ah, ah... Uehara was so innocent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; Uehara-san? Can you hear me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh, that...I heard it, oh? But, but, it feels like it's embarrassing for others to hear...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who had recovered, responded with an excited voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's it. I also feel embarrassed to say such a thing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since this is my experience, it should feel very real.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touy, Touyama too... that... also, are you also interested in erotic things?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course, after all, I am a healthy student... Of course I would be interested. That's why I use those kinds of things.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That is... that is, even if you do lewd things with me... that is....&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Um? I didn't think Uehara's words were going in a strange direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;And Uehara-san...what's wrong?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama understood what Uehara wanted to say, but deliberately pretended not to understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, can't! It's too embarrassing, I can't say it anymore... I'm so sorry for letting Touyama say such an embarrassing thing.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed like his embarrassment had reached its limit, and Uehara gave up and apologized to Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay. I was also wrong when I lied. But... I hope Uehara-san can understand this kind of thing about men.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it was a lie, should Uehara accept it?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand. For example, if you want to do lewd things, then...you should discuss it with me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Discuss...what to do after consulting him?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>TL/N: </b><i>Yes, you can practice fucking a dog, you just don't know, even though you've done it many times, you don't know🗿</i></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm, um... I see.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this way, Uehara ended up being fooled by an even more shocking lie. Buying a condom was meaningless compared to masturbating with a masturbation cup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ue, Uehara-san...! ?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he finally tried his best to step aside and let out a sigh of relief, Uehara wrapped his arms around Touyama's back from the front, ignoring the gazes of others and hugged him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I was relieved to know the reason for Touyama's lie...but...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara buried his face in Toyama's chest and continued his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;When I thought that Touyama might have bought him to do that kind of thing with other girls, I felt so sad... I would have been jealous of my invisible opponent. But that didn't happen though... that's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I really am a bad person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who lied to Uehara again, Touyama bought condoms to have sex with another girl, Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And now lied to Uehara again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was a betrayal to Uehara, who believed in Touyama so much. If Uehara knew the truth, how much her heart would be hurt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara told the truth that he would be very jealous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order to make Toyama leave a good impression on the other students in the class, Uehara helped her change her image. But on the other hand, he paradoxically didn't want others to take Touyama away from him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's okay, Uehara-san, don't worry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lies were constantly covered by lies, and what was waiting in the future?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama remembered Takai's face, which had gradually changed recently. Although there are family situations and other problems, but looking at him now, one day he no longer needs Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So at that time-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Obviously I have no right to bind Touyama to me, I'm sorry I said some words intentionally.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara muttered while moving away from Touyama's chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama couldn't say anything to Uehara right now.</span></p>
