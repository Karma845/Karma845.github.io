<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Touyama and Classmates' Perspective</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, I ran out of condoms&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked at the empty condom box, and complained in his heart that he "The one who always uses it, doesn't notice when it's finished and doesn't throw it away" putting aside the fact that Touyama was the last person to use it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even without a condom, you can just cum outside&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Touyama, no... It was a dream for all men, who spoke like that was his classmate Yumi Takai, who was lying on the bed naked and complaining to Touyama just now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's not allowed. After all, we're still in high school too, wouldn't it be bad if you got pregnant? I guess it would be better if we didn't do it today&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ummmm.. but I want to do it&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Takai, who had become sexually active, it was hard to say no for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Alright... I'll go to the convenience store first to buy it&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the first time we're going to fuck but run out of condoms, to be honest it's quite a hassle to buy them on purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Should I go too?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, I'll go alone. Besides, shouldn't you put your clothes back on?&#12301;</span></p><p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who had been naked put on his clothes again and left the house to buy condoms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, this is actually the house of the Takai family. She has a single parent and has an older sister. Her mother used to go to work to provide for the family, but she didn't seem to come home very often.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And her older sister seems to be in a semi-cohabitation with her boyfriend, and she hardly ever comes home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>TL/N</b>: <i>Semi-cohabitation is about living together but without the ties of marriage&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wasn't interested in other people's situations and didn't want to know more about it, so he didn't ask her anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even so, going to a convenience store (Toserba) seems a bit... I remember, there's a condom vending machine a bit further from here...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With his unreliable memory, Touyama walks around at night looking for condoms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh, there it is&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After walking for about 30 minutes, Touyama finally found a vending machine. There are very few people passing by here, and it seems that he can get it without having to worry about the eyes of other people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh? Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Touyama managed to buy a condom and was about to leave, a voice came from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama turned around to confirm that the owner of the voice was a familiar female classmate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama hastily stuffed the condom he just bought into his pocket. After all, it would be very troublesome if he explains it to his classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; Uehara-san, from my class, isn't?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara Marika, who had loose curls and dyed her hair brightly, belonged to the upper caste in the class due to her beautiful appearance and popularity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is beautiful and cute, with a large figure, magnificent breasts that can make her clothes stand out when she shows her presence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is also the most popular girl in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama had also heard that she was also quite popular among the boys in the other classes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Could it be that Uehara-san lives nearby?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No. Compared to that, what are you doing in a place like this Touyama? By the way, what was that thing you hid in your pocket just now?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara pointed at a condom vending machine that glowed in the dark.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looks like she has seen Touyama buy it. Luckily, Takai didn't come with him to buy it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um, like, what do you think?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... Are you going to use it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked very curious about an inconspicuous person like Touyama buying such an item.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Uehara wasn't teasing him. Instead, Uehara looked at Touyama's face with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhh, this is my brother who asked me to buy it. My brother said if I am willing to buy it for him, he will give me a tip later&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama chose the first lie that came to mind. Actually, he don't have an older brother, but Uehara shouldn't know about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that so... But, Touyama's house shouldn't be here, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For some reason, Uehara knew that Touyama's house wasn't near here. Touyama felt as if she was suspecting something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Even though I agreed to buy it, it seems to be inconvenient to go to a convenience store (Toserba) to buy it so I ended up looking for a vending machine that sells it. Unknowingly, I ended up going this far&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama continued to lie following the plot of the previous lie.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm.. well, forget it. Touyama doesn't seem to be able to use that kind of thing anyway&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara changed her serious expression now and suddenly became more cheerful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right, it's useless for me&#8230; Oh yeah, my brother is waiting for me, I have to go back soon&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it wasn't my brother who was waiting for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Touyama dragged the topic too long, he will be asked long and short, and will raises more suspicion. So Touyama chose to interrupt the conversation early on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Alright, see you at school tomorrow&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, see you tomorrow&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara are classmates, but they didn't talk much. Today was probably the longest conversation between the two of them so far.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The people around Uehara were all handsome people who formed a circle of higher ranking groups.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama wasn't good at handling this, so he tried his best not to get involved with them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">See you at school tomorrow...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, even if Touyama saw her at school, he wouldn't say anything. That's how simple his relationship with Uehara is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After parting with Uehara, Touyama rushed back to Takai's house. As soon as he entered the room, Takai who was lying on the bed was naked and fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What... Even though I've gone this far and back to buy it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama complained while looking at Takai's cute sleeping face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, because of what happened to Uehara just now, Touyama feels physically and mentally exhausted. So even if Takai says that she wants to do it now, he doesn't feel that way anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe it was good for her to fall asleep soon. Touyama thought while stroking Takai's hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order for Takai to not catch a cold, Touyama gently covered her with a blanket and left her house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just don't spread strange rumors in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Feeling so restless in his arms, Touyama walked on his way home.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The day after Uehara watched Touyama buy condoms, Toyama came to school and sat in his chair, Touyama planned to read a novel to pass the time before class was about to start.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama usually chooses to read a book during his breaks and lunch breaks. Because he likes to spend his quiet time reading. Of course, I wasn't a completely alienated person, but I also didn't have any special relationships with any of my classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Good morning, Touyama&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, today was different from the usual morning, as soon as Uehara arrived in class, she greeted Toyama. It felt like he had been in high spirits since morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, ah, good morning too, Uehara-san&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So far, I've never greeted Uehara in the morning, so, I don't know what wind is blowing here today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Toyama wasn't someone who didn't believe in this world, Touyama thought this was odd, since it was Uehara who had never greeted him in the morning until yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;We haven't seen each other since last night.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's right. so what can i help you with?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if&#12300;We haven't seen each other since last night.&#12301;But nothing special to say last night. If something goes wrong, hopefully it will be over soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's not that there's nothing you can help with... but, can't I talk to you? &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who felt it would be troublesome to talk to him, showed a cold demeanor and seemed to be offended by Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, not really&#8230; I'm sorry.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I always feel that Touyama is very cold, and you are much more mature than other boys.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I think that's quite normal. It's just, Maybe you think so because I'm a quiet person&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because the boys in the upper circle often got carried away to show their strength to the girls, so they seemed relatively stupid?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, this is what I meant! In other words, it is a very calm or optimistic feeling&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Talking to a girl like Uehara who was very popular in class would really stand out in class. Honestly, I wish Uehara could get away from me soon. Touyama thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika, it's not interesting talking to strangers like that, right? Let's go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The male student who suddenly interrupted the conversation, and the male student who spoke in a harsh tone was his classmate Kazuto Kurashima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The beautiful Kurashima and Uehara were from the same high caste circle. Touyama heard that Kurashima was very popular, and there were already a few girls who had told him their feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Kazuhito, this statement of yours is very rude.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For some unknown reason, Uehara seemed to care about Touyama, but Kurashima, who was reminded by him, looked displeased.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;&#8230;&#8230;Touyama, I was the one in the wrong.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was known in class that Kurashima liked Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite following Uehara's words and reluctantly apologizing, his bad attitude didn't necessarily mean he wasn't sorry at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's okay. I don't care.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the man who suddenly spat out obscenities in front of him casually, Touyama didn't want anything to do with her. It didn't matter if he was hated, so Touyama really didn't care.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika, let's go&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For some reason, Kurashima looked like Uehara's boyfriend. It could be seen that he was playing handsome to attract the attention of the other party, but Uehara looked embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, Touyama, tell me some interesting books next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Kurashima and Uehara joined the people in the circle. Touyama looked at them in a shady way of handling things, thought that it would be troublesome to think about associating with such a small circle, but it was still comfortable to be alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;Interesting book... Uehara didn't seem interested in novels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe only Touyama didn't know, maybe Uehara really liked reading books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was thinking about these things, sensed the sight, looked around, and met Takai, only to realize that he was watching him here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was Takai who looked away from Touyama and returned to the book he had just read.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if Takai saw the scene where Touyama and Uehara were talking just now, he probably wouldn't be jealous. To ask why he wasn't jealous, it was because she and Touyama weren't lovers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai and Touyama only have sexual relations, which are called sex friends. Not one of those bloated relationships that are captivated by each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They start to approach each other after school. Touyama is in charge of the book committee's work in the library, and accidentally chats about books with Takai, who comes to return the books. One day, I was invited to his house with the excuse of borrowing a book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Want to sex with me?&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In Takai's room, Takai whispered softly to Touyama. So, Toyama, who had no reason to refuse, overlapped with his body and had a physical relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Inviting himself easily made Touyama think that Takai must be a Bitch, but to his surprise, Takai was actually a virgin. However, Touyama himself is also still a virgin, and this is the first time these two continue to fuck while trying and making mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama is also an ordinary high school boy with a high sex drive. For a while, in order to satisfy sexual desire, Touyama indulged Takai's body. And Takai doesn't seem ready to satisfy his sexual desire, but to act like a spoiled child for Touyama, Takai fills something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such Takai and Toyama don't talk much in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So no one in class knows that Toyama and Takai are sex friends.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg2MCYeyN14saJlBWauQK_vRGDt-Jhtj8bBGGBCMiyN5B-uTz8lkMiLLPKWrkaLt4HcwQ51-Rscz1HjiH4ie4NAp1QTlPn-WzrIVzjkzVBd461PhA4Ag3WoVex_n1rP60scVffDE0-ZwOy257vaVPZ25irI0V_aL_B25ua4Yb5t71s-dK9nXBKEV-2/s800/t86reFf.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg2MCYeyN14saJlBWauQK_vRGDt-Jhtj8bBGGBCMiyN5B-uTz8lkMiLLPKWrkaLt4HcwQ51-Rscz1HjiH4ie4NAp1QTlPn-WzrIVzjkzVBd461PhA4Ag3WoVex_n1rP60scVffDE0-ZwOy257vaVPZ25irI0V_aL_B25ua4Yb5t71s-dK9nXBKEV-2/s16000/t86reFf.jpeg" height="500" width="350" /></span></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span>
