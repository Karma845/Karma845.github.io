<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Crime Cast</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It wasn't long since Uehara started going in and out of the library, while on his lunch break, he was also chatting with Touyama and Chihiro in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Seeing that you've been coming here a lot lately, is it okay to leave those people in the circle alone?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No problem. The people in the circle over there have been really annoying recently. Kazuhito is definitely not my boyfriend, but he still wants to keep me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, whenever Uehara came to Touyama and the others to play, Kurashima would make a special trip to bring Uehara back. However, in the past few days, Kurashima only looked from a distance and did nothing, had he given up?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama said earlier that you can't have the best of both worlds, so I also want to be free. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Inability to have the best of both worlds?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro, who was listening to the conversation between the two, knew what those words meant, but had no idea what they were talking about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Simply put, Uehara-san has many friends, but is bound by a small circle. And I'm the one who is free, but has few friends.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama briefly explained to Chihiro.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes... I understand what you're trying to say. It's the kind that chooses one, and has to sacrifice the other.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro had a very good mind, and now Chihiro could probably understand what Touyama meant by just explaining it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But, Uehara-san is this alright? Seeing that Kurashima-kun has come to take you back several times, he might hate you if you continue like this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike Touyama, Chihiro had a very kind nature and wouldn't speak ill of anyone, even if it was Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It doesn't matter if she hates me. I'd rather say that if she hates me right away.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It seems like Uehara-san really hates Kurashima-kun.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Kurashima, who was so obsessed with Uehara, didn't take any action. It only made him feel that something was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama looked at the other free person, Takai. He still didn't care about Touyama and the others today, and remained alone.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Touyama, who came to school, opened the shoe locker and was about to change shoes indoors. He found a piece of white paper like a leaflet in the locker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What is this?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I opened it, I saw this sentence written in scribbled handwriting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Don't let me get carried away.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">These are all evil words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is this finally the time I've been worrying about starting?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The thing that Touyama had been worried about for a long time had happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason was undoubtedly that Touyama's relationship with Uehara, a very popular girl in the class, had improved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it turned out to be handwriting... Touyama was really confused, just by comparing the handwriting, you could instantly determine who wrote it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can be seen that this is purely emotional and reckless behavior of the perpetrator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if this was done individually or collectively, but one day we will know. Touyama calmly analyzed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama didn't care about the extent of this abuse, but he didn't want Uehara to know. With Uehara being in the upper caste, perhaps Uehara would think that this was his responsibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What Touyama feared most was people other than himself being subjected to harassment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although he was very worried about Chihiro, who was closest to him, Chihiro was different from Touyama, she was very good at dealing with people and getting along with other students. So it should be okay... Touyama thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama had been vigilant since that day, but nothing happened and that day had already passed.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The day after Touyama's shoe locker was full of notes or words of abuse, Touyama, who came to school, carefully opened the shoe locker. There was nothing inside the locker except wabaki. Touyama also checked his wabaki, just in case, and there was no sign that his wabaki had been tampered with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama let out a sigh of relief and walked towards the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who entered the classroom to make sure that Chihiro who was sitting in the front had not come, placed his schoolbag on the desk, pulled out a chair, and sat down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Open the bag and take out the textbook for the first class. Just when Touyama wanted to put the textbooks into his cabinet, there seemed to be something stuck in it and the textbooks could not go in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I looked at the cabinet, it was full of trash. When I took it out, it was all trash like snack bags and confetti. The cabinet has become something of a classroom garbage dump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Was this also done by the people who entered the note?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, spam mail and harassment must be done by the same person or group of people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Touyama preferred that instead of being sneaky, the other party might also be able to come directly to him. At least Touyama could fight back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite being bullied like this, Touyama remained calm. After all, if the other party used force, Touyama would fight back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, good morning... ah? You look really scary, what happened?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro, who came to class, looked at the face of Touyama, who seemed to feel disobedience and showed a worried expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, nothing. I just felt that today's class was very troublesome, and I was thinking of going home or not.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama hurriedly put the trash back into his bag, and pretended that nothing had happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;But seeing the look on your face... if you have any problems, let me know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course. The only friend I can confide in is Chihiro."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To defuse the atmosphere, Touyama replied with a masochistic stalk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't think that's the case. Doesn't Yuki still have a classmate Uehara-san now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Chihiro said that Touyama still had Uehara, Touyama himself did not seem to consider him a friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the three of them often ate together these days, they still did not feel that close.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, Touyama turned his attention to his other classmate, Takai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As usual, Takai was reading a book by himself quietly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama could not concentrate too much in class, and it was already time for lunch break. Uehara, as usual, came to the seat beside Touyama and Chihiro and opened his lunchbox.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Uehara was believed to be the cause of the harassment, Uehara was innocent. However, if he continued to have a relationship with Touyama like this, the harassment would probably be directed at him. However, it was also very difficult to tell him that it was best not to stay with himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about this, Touyama came to a conclusion. That was to accept it as usual and pay attention to the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, today's lunch break was different from usual. While looking at their cell phones, classmates whispered to spy on Touyama. Touyama could feel the air of contempt and hostility in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ever since Uehara joined Touyama's circle, although Uehara would attract some of the other classmates' attention, Touyama could feel that it was not the same as before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I always thought everyone looked a little strange. I feel like we're being watched."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, that's a very annoying feeling.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro and Uehara also realized something was wrong in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika, can you come here?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when Touyama and the others were confused, Mika Aizawa, his classmate, called out to him. Touyama remembered that she was in a small circle with Kurashima and Uehara, and had a good relationship with Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Aizawa? Is something wrong?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I have something to say to you... It's a bit conspicuous in class, can you step out of class for a moment?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Touyama is coming too.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Me? Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Be quiet and follow me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa was petite, with waist-length hair tied into a double ponytail. Contrary to her appearance, Touyama heard that she was a girl who could take care of people very well, the type who could explain things very clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, okay...I understand.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama who was being stared at by Aizawa, was like a frog being stared at by a snake, so Touyama could only follow her obediently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm sorry Okita-kun, can I borrow these two people for just a moment.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, please don't eat Yuki.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Touyama, who was about to be invited out of class with what was said, Chihiro said to Aizawa jokingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;A-I won't eat it! Alright, you two, let's go.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa left the classroom with Toyama and Uehara looking embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Seriously, doesn't it make me a horrible person to call those two...really.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa, who awkwardly walked in front of Touyama and Uehara, led the two of them to the vending machine at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So, Aizawa, what do you mean by something to say? Is it something you can't say in class?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Marika noticed it too, right? There's a strange atmosphere in the classroom right now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How much can I feel... The atmosphere is not the same as usual.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What about Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa glanced at Touyama and asked for his opinion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm the same as Uehara-san's opinion. I can feel that my way of getting attention is not the same as usual, maybe this feeling.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What is it... it seems like you two don't know yet. Look at this.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa took out her cell phone and showed it to Toyama and Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Look, isn't there a very mediocre guy in the class, what's his name? A guy who has a good relationship with a guy who looks like a girl.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Is that what you mean: Touyama&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Yes, I've heard that Uehara is dating that guy.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Eh? That's inappropriate. Really very inappropriate.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Heard, the two of them were seen on a date at the bookstore in front of the station, Uehara used to go to the library when Touyama was still a member of the book committee.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;It seems that's the case.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;If that's true, it really makes me jealous.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;After saying that, why do the two of them look so far apart? &#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;It's just a rumor, it's not clear what happened. Don't believe it too much.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What is this! ? How can I date Uehara-san?&#65281;&#65281;&#12301;&#65311;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What was displayed on the phone screen was a relationship about Touyama and Uehara based on rumors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is that a lie!? I'm dating Touyama?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who couldn't hide his surprise, somehow looked happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In the beginning of my lunch break, I didn't know who invited me to this anonymous group chat. Since it had something to do with you, Touyama, so you weren't invited.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's why we're being watched like that in class... I'm sorry, Uehara-san, there's a strange scandal going on.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Why is Touyama apologizing? It's not your fault, right?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... I think Uehara-san would hate dating someone like me, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Not to hate or anything! I'd rather say I'm happy... oh... or something like that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who lowered her head slightly, probably feeling embarrassed, and her voice got smaller, so small that Touyama couldn't hear her clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ue, Uehara-san! ? Well, even if it's a joke, it's really going to be misunderstood&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wouldn't that make people say that? Or does Touyama hate being gossiped about with me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered her head and raised her eyes to see Touyama's expression</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Okay, it's so close!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was so close that Toyama began to notice the beautiful shape of Uehara's pink lips, and turned her face away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#12300;I'm not talking about disturbing things... it's..........</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhhh... are you two really dating?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa, who had been silently listening to the conversation between the two until now, coughed a few times on purpose and asked with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, it's not like that!? We're not dating! Right, Uehara-san&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably because of embarrassment, Touyama was desperate to deny it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't deny it so emphatically...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to be dissatisfied with Touyama's answer, who was trying to deny it with all his strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I didn't think it was possible for you to be misunderstood like this...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aizawa probably realized this kind of bickering was like a couple of idiots. Touyama and Uehara did not refute her, but remained silent with embarrassed expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In short, you two should be careful, and stop spreading weird scandals.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Aizawa-san, thank you for telling us about this. I'll be careful next time.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Okay, I'll be careful too&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was worried about his strange scandal with Uehara spreading, and Touyama was determined to act carefully next time. But Uehara seemed to have no sense of crisis and didn't seem to care much about his scandal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Is this kid really going to be careful... if there's anything else, I'll let you guys know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama knew very well that Aizawa, who was staring at Uehara helplessly, Aizawa was actually very worried about her friend.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the day I heard about the anonymous group chat from Aizawa, Touyama visited Takai's room after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What happened today?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who felt that Touyama was different from usual, asked in a gentle tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No... it's...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Touyama's vagueness, Takai picked up the cell phone beside the sofa and operated it a few times, then handed it over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama was surprised by the information displayed on the phone screen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although he was surprised that Takai was also invited to his group chat, the more serious problem was the content of the group chat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This, this... What was going on here?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Touyama looked at the contents, Touyama's face suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The contents of the group chat had been updated a lot since the lunch break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Uehara-san seems like a picky girl.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Eh? seriously? Will you fuck her?&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;No, it seems Uehara-san likes to fuck people for a fee.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Isn't that cheating?&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Very surprising, I didn't expect Uehara-san to be such a person.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;But, if I can fuck Uehara-san for money, I'll give it too.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Indeed, although Uehara-san is a promiscuous girl, she not only has a pretty face but also has a nice body.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;I really want to enjoy a handful of those marvelous breasts.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;It seems that the reason why Kurashima-kun wasn't targeted was because he refused to give her money.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Seriously? Kurashima-kun is too pathetic.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;By the way, Uehara-san seems to be friends with Touyama-kun.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;I heard from the girls in class that they saw Touyama-kun giving money to Uehara-san behind the school building.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;Otherwise, how could a good woman like Uehara-san find Touyama-kun as her partner.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;In the end, Touyama-kun didn't date Uehara-san, but Touyama-kun gave her money to fuck her.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;It's true, it's true, Touyama is considered a Kaizi www&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The group chat log is full of baseless lies and slander.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinIUkUGI33IAdov_MmP-EsI9b_VQTxJU8vAGeIFgKxxBNq-sUpJqc6PLV8GuA6Cu4OOVZbHU_6w7KQN6QwzPYmo4oX4QGeYQgdl3QsEZfzySwZUUdvOZ5pnjcWVWcFizAmk78KHvmj1kEaW-AgFx0Mm5jHGCwhQ_ZvCrNgrdtGwDnKApPSKsGEajnF/s800/nBboqpP.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinIUkUGI33IAdov_MmP-EsI9b_VQTxJU8vAGeIFgKxxBNq-sUpJqc6PLV8GuA6Cu4OOVZbHU_6w7KQN6QwzPYmo4oX4QGeYQgdl3QsEZfzySwZUUdvOZ5pnjcWVWcFizAmk78KHvmj1kEaW-AgFx0Mm5jHGCwhQ_ZvCrNgrdtGwDnKApPSKsGEajnF/s16000/nBboqpP.jpeg" height="500" width="350" /></span></a></div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What... what the hell, this is ....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama's heart was beating faster and faster, even he himself could hear it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There's a tingling pain in front of my eyes, and I'm finding it hard to breathe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I was invited to this group chat during my lunch break today.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is estimated that Takai and Touyama have not communicated much in class, so Takai was invited to this group chat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;During lunch break, Aizawa-san showed me the contents... But now, it's much worse than before...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Uehara looked normal when we met at the library. So these new messages were sent during after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not just me, but Uehara-san is also a target of harassment? Why? Isn't he a popular character in class? Or is he more cute and hateful?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama repeatedly asked and answered himself with a bitter expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's all my fault... If I hadn't gotten involved with Uehara-san, I wouldn't be like this... Damn it!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Driven by thoughts of self-blame, Touyama clenched his fists so hard that his nails would dig into his palms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A soft and fragrant scent enveloped Touyama's dejected head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Don't blame yourself. It's not Yuki's fault.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai hugged Toyama's head to his chest to comfort him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;However, what should I do?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama thought that even if he was slandered, it didn't matter, but if it continued like this, Uehara would also be hurt by the class crime.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was only Uehara, Touyama wanted to do something. But he couldn't think of anything right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't know what to do either. But be patient with me now. Then, Yuki can go find a way to protect Uehara-san.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I understand. I hope Takai can treat us the same as before. Even if Takai gets involved, I will regret it.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm fine with that. After all, I've been talked to by Uehara-san so far.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Takai hugged Touyama tightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two naked people hugged tightly, and Toyama who buried his face in Takai's chest finally calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, this slanderous behavior must stop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama swore in his heart.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next morning, Touyama rubbed his sleepy eyes, sorting through what happened yesterday at breakfast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was suspected that the culprit who initiated the slander in the group chat was a boy who had a good impression of Uehara, it was also necessary to consider the possibility that the culprit was a girl, so Touyama thought about it carefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the messages said</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12298;I heard from girls in class that they saw Touyama-kun giving money to Uehara-san behind the school building.&#12299;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's possible that the boy a girl likes has a good impression of Uehara, so he hates and acts like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The culprit must be someone in the class. But what could be done to stop this slanderous behavior, Touyama was completely at a loss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The idea was at a dead end, and the feeling of helplessness made Touyama lie down at the dining table in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What's wrong with Onii-chan? Are you feeling unwell?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing the lethargic Touyama in the morning, Naki asked anxiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm just a little sleep deprived, it's fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was lying on the table, raised his head and tried his best to pretend to be calm so as not to worry his sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You said that you came back late last night. If you didn't sleep well, it won't work. I've heard that lack of sleep can shorten one's life. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I spent a long time with Takai yesterday, I came back late at night, but I couldn't tell my family that I was actually with a girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ahhh, I'll keep that in mind. After all, if I die, Naki will be very sad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, so what if I can't smell her Onii-chan?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki was more worried about the smell than Touyama's life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This strange place really had Naki's style and couldn't help but smile. Thanks to her, Touyama had a bit more vitality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Naki, thank you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um? I didn't do anything to make Onii-chan thank you. How strange Onii-chan is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No, I always get energy from Naki. &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama put his hand on Naki's head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Wait, don't treat me like a child&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naki looked a little embarrassed, but smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Time passes slowly, and if you don't go out, you'll be late for school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Going to school is scary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If only Touyama himself was gossiped about, it would be fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But I'm afraid that important people around me will get hurt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Takai agreed to protect Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama gritted his teeth and set foot on the road to school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To protect Uehara from this baseless slander.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I'll go to school first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, Naki also wants to go together&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Naki was in junior high school, this school was also in the same area. Since she didn't know who would see her, Touyama couldn't go to school with Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, I can't go to school with you. Sorry again, but I hope Naki can go by herself.&#12301;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Why, is there something wrong with Onii-chan. tell me why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I can't say. Because Naki is very important to me, we can't go together. I hope Naki can understand this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Touyama told the reason, Naki would definitely do something in anger. A perpetrator who sensed Naki's actions would probably target him. Touyama didn't want to involve others anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......I understand. Since Onii-chan said so, I can only do so.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, be the most obedient good boy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama let out a sigh of relief after finally persuading Naki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Then I'll leave first.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh yes, I understand&#12290;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this way, Touyama and Naki went to school separately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who came to school, confirmed that there was nothing else in the shoe locker, then changed shoes into the room and walked to class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama took a deep breath in front of the classroom, and walked to class with his consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472;&#9472;&#65281;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as Touyama entered the classroom, the eyes of all the students were focused on Touyama. Apparently, almost all the students knew about the contents of the group chat. Most of them chose to believe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking around the classroom, I did not see Uehara. It seemed that he had not arrived at school yet, which made Touyama let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, can Uehara withstand such a distinct curious gaze?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Touyama himself, who was usually regarded as a Kaizi, could not erase the nausea in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bathed in this strange sight, Touyama walked to his seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe I came out late today, and Chihiro was already sitting in her seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Chihiro, good morning.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama sat down and greeted Chihiro who was in the front seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki? Good morning. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro turned around, her expression clearly a little unhappy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the group chat I saw yesterday, there was only one bad and slanderous word about Chihiro, and that was calling her&#12300;A guy who looks like a girl&#12301;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It seems Chihiro also knows about that group chat.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... Although I wasn't invited to the group chat so I don't know about the details, but my friends in class told me. It seems like Yuki knows it too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Of course I know.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;The lie was written so much, Yuki, are you okay? If this goes on, it will be misunderstood by the students in the class. We have to find a way to clear up this misunderstanding&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I'm fine, but I'm a little worried about Uehara-san. After all, she's the one who's written the most of those baseless things."&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, the students who had been paying attention to Touyama and the others suddenly focused their attention on the classroom door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara walked in from the classroom door. Bathed in the eyes of her classmates, she looked the same as always.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Didn't you know?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under the watchful eyes of her classmates, Uehara sat in her seat as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama hesitated whether to greet her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What should I do? Do I want to ask Uehara-san?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when he was troubled by this, Miyamoto, the homeroom teacher, relentlessly walked into the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Damn it!!!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama cursed his hesitant and slow judgment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, calm down.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chihiro, who was sitting in the front, looked at Touyama and whispered to him not to worry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It just started today, so it doesn't matter if it's not now. Just wait until break time or lunch break to talk to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama took a deep breath to calm himself down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, Touyama failed to talk to Uehara during the break, and the time came for the lunch break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who usually came to Touyama's side, did not come today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyama looked over to where Uehara was sitting... She was chatting with Aizawa, a relative and friend of hers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, can I borrow a little of your time?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This won't work anymore. Touyama made up his mind and spoke to Uehara who was chatting with Aizawa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama... I'm sorry Mika, I'll be leaving for a while.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, Aizawa-san, for interrupting while you were chatting.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I don't care, slow down&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite Touyama's sudden interruption, Aizawa didn't seem displeased, just waved her hand and returned to her seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, it's really uncomfortable talking here, let's leave the class and go somewhere else.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, I think that's better.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara looked around the classroom and replied. It seemed that Uehara understood that she was now the object of the students' attention and interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara stood up and walked towards the classroom door with Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Hey, those two people... is it true what they said in the group chat? &#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Is he going to give money behind the school building? &#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;No, how could she do that kind of thing at school. It's just a rumor.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can hear the topic of the two, but everyone seems to doubt all kinds of rumors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama and Uehara glanced at the chatting students, and walked out of the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, are you okay?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;eh uh... I'm fine&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Uehara said that he was fine, Touyama could feel that he wasn't as active as usual and looked a little tired.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What would Uehara-san like to drink? I'll treat you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two people who left the class came to the vending machine at the end of the corridor where Aizawa and Touyama were talking yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh, that's not necessary. I'll pay for this myself.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;After all, I brought Uehara-san here, so I'll treat you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara closed her mouth, showing a thoughtful look for a moment, then opened her mouth and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;In that case, then... I'll just have milk tea&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama bought a drink and handed it to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Thank you, I've always felt that Touyama is very good at dealing with girls. When I said, "After all, I invited you here," you didn't feel embarrassed at all, and said it with dignity."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Oh I see. There are many boys who are confused when they come in front of me and don't know what they want to say.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yeah, it's not that I can't understand those boys' feelings.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How to say it? &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;For that boy, Uehara-san is Takahashi no Hana. It's natural to feel nervous when standing in front of you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So huh? I'm not an idol, I'm just an ordinary girl.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara didn't seem to realize her own charm. To all kinds of boys around here, she was an untouchable existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for Kurashima, it was probably because he was too popular and too confident, so he didn't think that way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Maybe Uehara-san doesn't think so, but the people around think so.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... is that so? &#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara still doesn't seem to understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san is pretty, cute, and has a great personality. For the boys in the class, Uehara-san should be the girl that all the boys want to be girlfriends the most.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Eh? ...It's just that, even if you praise me like that, what should I do...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who was suddenly praised by Touyama, was suddenly confused. This not-so-confident and humble demeanor was also her charm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touya, Touyama... That... that too, do you want me to be your girlfriend too? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ah? In some strange place, Uehara misunderstood? Uehara lowered her head with flushed cheeks and looked at Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, no, that's just general rhetoric, not my opinion&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Say it, say it. ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara lowered her shoulders regretfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yes, yes, talking about Uehara-san's charm&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;And also, do you want to continue this topic? I'm a little embarrassed...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Being teased so high makes me a little confused. But this topic is related to the slander that is happening now, so it can't be avoided.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So to the point, besides the scandal between Uehara-san and me, there are many new things, Uehara-san, did you know?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was no point in hiding it, Touyama started straight from the core issue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hmm... Last night, Aizawa sent me a screenshot image&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Takai told Touyama, Aizawa also seemed to be on Uehara's side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's a good thing to say. Simply put, it was done by a girl who hates Uehara-san's popularity, or a boy who is jealous of me having a good relationship with Uehara-san recently.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;How...we obviously didn't do anything...why...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it was cruel, it was better to let Uehara know the truth. Touyama did not choose to say subtly, but to tell the truth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That...it's all because of me that I got Touyama involved...&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unsurprisingly, Uehara mistakenly thought that he had caused slander about Touyama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's wrong! I'm the target because I'm an evil bastard. Didn't everything happen when you weren't with Kurashima-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Really!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;She will identify with someone stronger than herself like Kurashima-kun, and will feel that if her opponent is a handsome man as popular as him, there's nothing she can do. But if her opponent is me who is less popular than her, she will definitely think how Uehara-san can get along with a guy like me, so I will become jealous and even hate her.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This slander was briefly like this, so it could be considered that Touyama had provoked it himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So the cause of this incident is me. I apologize for dragging Uehara-san into this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;No...it's not Touyama's fault. Why did it become like this? There is no difference between people. How long will this go on? ......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It may be incomprehensible to Uehara, who lives under the sun, but Touyama who has been buried in this world, has personal experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;It's impossible to be like this. So, what to think about is what we should do next."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That's what you said...so what should I do? I don't know what to do at all.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara mumbled as if she was exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Uehara who was drowning in sadness, Touyama thought desperately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to make Uehara sad again. Is there a good way to solve this situation?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two were silent for a while. After a while, Touyama showed an expression that suddenly thought of something. Touyama spoke slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;......Uehara-san, I have an idea.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh? Did you think of a good way?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Aah, if things like this continue, not only will the situation not end, it might even develop in a worse direction. So it's up to us to take the initiative."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yeah, I don't think it would be better if we just leave it alone... So, what's your plan?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama told Uehara what he was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;That way...."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Although this will make Uehara-san the target of public criticism, can you do me a favor?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The method Touyama thought of, having to face those who slandered together with Uehara. The risk is incalculable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;...... Well, I understand. I believe in Touyama. I won't be afraid if we're together.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry, I can only think of this way.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;There's nothing like that. Touyama is very worried about me. Everything will be fine.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara saying so made Touyama feel somewhat redeemed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, the action will be included in tomorrow's short class meeting.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Um! I see. Don't push yourself Touyama.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, leave it to me.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Will this really go well? Toyama, who was full of anxiety, pretended to be strong so that Uehara would not notice.</span></p>
