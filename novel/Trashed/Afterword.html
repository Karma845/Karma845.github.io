<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hello everyone, I'm Yamamoto Takeshi making my debut with this book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Have you ever seen a condom vending machine?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many condom vending machines near where I live. The vending machines always shine brightly on winter nights, so I thought of making this story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you feel embarrassed to be seen by others when you buy something from a vending machine?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What if the protagonist is a high school student?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are still seen by the heroine who has a good impression of the protagonist, what will everyone think?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I fantasized about such a scene in my mind, and gradually became curious about the further development, so I started to write down these thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It took only three weeks to start writing from the impromptu intention to the end of the competition. But I finally finished writing it, and the rankings rose smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the 6th Web Contest, I won a special award in the romantic comedy category and the ComicWalker manga award. My work has also been revised and remade a lot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder if everyone enjoyed the story that unfolded differently from this web version?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you find it interesting, you'll want to keep reading. It will be my pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Allow me to say thank you here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Actually, before writing this piece, I had finished my first web novel. I had considered breaking my pen to focus on the writing I was interested in (in fact I did tweet about breaking my pen).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, I got it from many of my followers on twitter&#12302;A festival like competition should be enjoyed.&#12303;such words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it wasn't said by Shufeng sa, I'm afraid this work wouldn't exist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Many thanks to Shufeng Saさん who gave me a lot of support behind the scenes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Nakana, who is in charge of the editorial department of Kadokawa Sunikabunko, for providing advice and consultation on manuscript revision for me, a newcomer who can't even tell the difference between left and right. .</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would like to thank Asahina Hikage-sensei who was in charge of the illustrations, drawing "Isn't this a direct output of the character's image in the author's mind?" I am very grateful for such beautiful illustrations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jun, who is in charge of the mangization, and I are looking forward to the release of the manga version.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I was struggling with how to write, I am very grateful to Ryuto Mitsu, Mitsuhiyo, and Shushan Mitsu who gave me a lot of advice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, I would like to thank the readers who have read and supported the Web version and the light novel version, as well as all the relevant personnel who have done their best to release this work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I sincerely hope that this work will sell well, and a second volume will be released, so that the story of Touyama, Takai, and Uehara can continue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The manga version of this work is scheduled for&#12302;Dentsuki Monthly Comics&#12303;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stay tuned for the manga version too!</span></p>
