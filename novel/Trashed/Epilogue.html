<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the incident at the sports equipment warehouse, the secretly photographed photos of Touyama and Takai have not turned into rumors, and Kurashima and Ishiyama have done nothing to Touyama and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school, Touyama was in charge of the library committee members' work in the library as usual, and Takai read quietly beside him as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Touyama! I came here to play&#65281;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The library door slammed open, and Uehara rushed in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, please stay in the library. And this isn't the place to play.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Hey hey, sorry. But, isn't there anyone here right now? It's okay to be a little noisy.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara also appeared in the library as usual, behaving the same as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama pointed to the table where Takai was, and looked at Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;So Takai-san is here? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to you.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who saw Takai's figure, ran to his side and talked to him as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, it's okay, I don't care.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai looked at Uehara who was standing beside the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara and Takai looked at each other with their eyes facing each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He's so cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara seemed to be attracted by Takai's eyes that couldn't read emotions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The mysterious atmosphere that Takai exudes, as well as the ghosts that break out when you touch it, fuel its charm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Am I going to salt the enemy?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Helping Takai change his image and maximize his charm made Uehara regret a little.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara remembered what happened in front of the sports equipment warehouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara remembered the conversation between Touyama, Takai, and Kazuto. Kazuto said that he saw Touyama entering Takai's house, but Takai didn't deny it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Later at that time, Takai used Yuki to call Toyama. That was the name the two of them used when they were together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara was very confident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Could it be that he had not entered the space between the two of them?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking of this, Uehara felt a pain in his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Uehara put that idea behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, the courage Touyama showed at the class meeting that day did make Uehara to fall in love with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to give up!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uehara, who had such a strong desire, brought his face close to Takai's ear and whispered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;I won't give up Yumi.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this, Takai looked at Uehara again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai, who was always expressionless, widened his eyes in momentary surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Me too!&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Takai left those words, his eyes returned to the book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As usual... it was a lie of self-satisfaction with his status. After Uehara declared her rival love for Takai, the gears that started spinning could not be stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Uehara-san, please don't disturb Takai-san's reading.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touyama, who was worried that Takai would be disturbed, came to talk to Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Takai-san, that's not it, is it?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300; Uehara-san, you've interrupted my reading, please don't talk to me if you're okay.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Eh!? Takai-san, this isn't what you should say, you should say&#12302;don't interrupt my reading anymore&#12303;&#65281;&#65311;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing their conversation, Touyama couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, holding his stomach and squinting at Takai, Touyama still noticed that he had an expression that Touyama had never seen before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, Takai was smiling at that moment.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoaNE9-HAJffy9vgpZQXhN4WMu9WLKqSd3BNrQqQLZTSMjbLWgy0pf3FcMe-K3SosNGAA2nq5hztfyuVUSVE1k_QJoS8IwOjQrj0_3wkEvjHAt0iNAI_89RtDKJE8AdmdLAv-qww3SJCwnL5CVhOfL7_EdrOpPqN2_Tji98ZKbMd7dGpDm0hnBIj4U/s800/1655577150471.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoaNE9-HAJffy9vgpZQXhN4WMu9WLKqSd3BNrQqQLZTSMjbLWgy0pf3FcMe-K3SosNGAA2nq5hztfyuVUSVE1k_QJoS8IwOjQrj0_3wkEvjHAt0iNAI_89RtDKJE8AdmdLAv-qww3SJCwnL5CVhOfL7_EdrOpPqN2_Tji98ZKbMd7dGpDm0hnBIj4U/s16000/1655577150471.jpg" height="500" width="350"/></span></a></div>
