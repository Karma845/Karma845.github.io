<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; What Was Takai Yumi Really Thinking?</h3>

<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">[Takai Yumi's POV]</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the night Yuki and Uehara went to the movies, I spent my time quietly in my room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I wanted to sit at my desk and study, I couldn't devote myself to it. I wanted to read a book, but I couldn't concentrate. As a result, I had to lie in bed doing nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe the two of them are now dating...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably, Yuki and Uehara are now having sex like I used to do with Yuki in this room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking of this, I felt lonely, I reached out my hand, touched the lower part of my body, and touched my pussy through my pajamas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;What......&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Click&#178; SMSー&#65281;Click&#178; SMSー&#65281;Click&#178; SMSー&#65281;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just when I was about to start Colmek, my phone vibrated. I who was now ready to concentrate on Colmek was startled by the vibration of my cell phone that I placed beside the bed, and my body also shook in shock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hurriedly picked up my cell phone to confirm, and a message from Yuki was displayed there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;I'm at your door, Takai, can we meet now?&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I should have sent the message to Yuki who was watching a movie with Uehara. But suddenly Yuki came to my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hurriedly got up from the bed and walked quickly towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Yuki, you cut your hair. And it's also very cool.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki who appeared in front of me not only cut her hair, but also wore simple and fashionable clothes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Ah, ah, because I was too shabby from dating earlier, so I asked Uehara-san to help me pick out a new outfit.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki is perfect for this refreshing look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can be seen that Uehara knows Yuki very well and tried her best to dress her up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;You look...cool now?&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Thank you. I'm glad to hear Takai say that.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki who was praised by Takai smiled brightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Sorry for the sudden visit. I just wanted to meet you unexpectedly.&#12301;</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGUzfdbOZrRMF1MYEKphv8eakBQM3XLXwvLzkx4bS0PGMafto3Nem3iUjFrmY898J9-pjm7uoLwCI1OVKBeYC-SuBxnXfPQjrm9CEyUBdW0m0dGv7jZZ7tF7p1u7Q5s9EVrg-A1f4Yg0hproUNjguAxPCWlZNfbEiX3ZT6cL6QMWGqcNHYfLSJGfBn/s800/0PgC1n0.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGUzfdbOZrRMF1MYEKphv8eakBQM3XLXwvLzkx4bS0PGMafto3Nem3iUjFrmY898J9-pjm7uoLwCI1OVKBeYC-SuBxnXfPQjrm9CEyUBdW0m0dGv7jZZ7tF7p1u7Q5s9EVrg-A1f4Yg0hproUNjguAxPCWlZNfbEiX3ZT6cL6QMWGqcNHYfLSJGfBn/s16000/0PgC1n0.jpeg" height="500" width="350"/></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki took the initiative to seek her sensuality from Takai, especially when her heart was aroused, there seemed to be something going on with Uehara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, as long as Yuki seeks me out, Takai will respond. No reason is needed for this. Because this is the relationship between Yuki and Takai, as sex friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12300;Well, that's fine, there's no one at home right now. I also really want to meet up with Yuki now.&#12301;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai who was happy when Yuki said she wanted to meet him, unconsciously gave the same answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki's eyes widened in surprise, she didn't expect Takai to say such a thing. Takai was also surprised that she said such words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki who was stimulated and excited by Uehara, and Takai who just wanted Colmek. Both of them were more excited than usual, and their Entotan was more intense than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai looked at Yuki, who was tired and sleeping beside him, and thought to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki, who made changes little by little, and Uehara, who continued to influence him, were a perfect match.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Yuki and Uehara were dating, they would be happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once again, Takai hated his empty self just for getting something from Yuki but not returning it.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki and Uehara were on their lunch break on the second day of their date, and Takai was reading a book quietly and alone as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But today was the only time, I couldn't concentrate on the book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Touyama and Uehara-san seem to be on a date.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Eh!? Is that for real?&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Sorry, it seems to be true. It's said that Ishiyama-san and the others accidentally met Touyama and Uehara-sam on a date at a shopping mall.&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;This is really strange... During the class meeting yesterday, I thought it was strange, and sure enough, now those two people are really dating....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Both of them must have done it before, right?&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#12302;Don't say that... just imagining it can make me faint...&#12303;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why I can't concentrate on reading is also because there are conversations like that everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With the rumor that Uehara and Yuki, who was popular in class, were dating, it wasn't hard for me to imagine how badly the male students in class were getting their hearts broken over it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I usually don't care about the conversations between my classmates, I myself, like those boys, couldn't hide the trembling in my heart when I heard this rumor. As proof, I couldn't focus on reading the contents of the book into my mind at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takai looked at the small circle of Yuki who was surrounded by several students chatting and laughing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuki who was teased by the rumors showed a confused expression, although Uehara denied it, Uehara still showed a happy smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Uehara's smile made Takai feel heartache and this pain had never been experienced before, and his mood became very depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's wrong with me... This depressed feeling in my heart... It's always painful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Yuki came to the house last night to look for myself, my mood was still not relieved.</span></p>
