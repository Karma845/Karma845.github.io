<h3>Chapter 28 - Villager A is noticed by the Villainess.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time went on, and the summer vacation came, which starts tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, I have been moving around collecting information, since there is nothing I can do during this period of uncertainty about the route. While on the other hand, Amy seems to have managed to complete the events smoothly. She is surrounded, and treated like a princess, by not only the crown prince but also the other capture targets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the capture targets other than the crown prince are also aristocrats. And except Claude, the third prince of the neighbouring country, they all have fiancées. Since their fiancées were not enrolled in the school, no problems have occurred. But the ripples were spreading after all. Personally, I think it would be nice if Amy could only stick together with Prince Claude, who has no fiancée.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, It seems Amy is aiming for the reverse harem route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m not sure yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, looking at Amy and Co., it seems that the distance to the crown prince is the closest, but at the same time, the distance to the other capture targets is also quite close. And at this time, this much intimacy with Prince Claude only happens in Claude&#8217;s and the reverse harem route. Furthermore, in Claude&#8217;s route, the flag with the Chief knight&#8217;s son Leonardo has already been broken. So Leonardo should be a little away from Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, the flow will be almost the same as the Crown Prince&#8217;s route, which has the advantage of being easy to read.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I head towards the auditorium to attend the closing ceremony. There, a crowd was gathering around the wall of the auditorium, where the test results of the final exam were posted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place Allen (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">2nd place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (497)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">12th place Oscar von Wimlet (413)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">13th place Heide Marie Asmus (412)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">14th place Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (411)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">28th place Vandaren von Ceben (386)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">29th place Isabella von Luinberg (385)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">38th place Glenn Weitberg (375)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">39th place Leonardo von Jukes (321)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, it seems I was able to get a perfect score.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is natural to get a perfect score, because even Japanese Middle school students are studying more advanced content than this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, still, I did my homework to study for the preparation and review test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I&#8217;m a commoner. Poor grades can result in a dropout, so I have to keep my grades as good as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the classification after the summer vacation will be decided by comprehensively judging this result with the results of the magic and swordsmanship exam, the results of free research during the summer vacation, and the social status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh, social status. Seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, the Chief Knight&#8217;s son&#8217;s grade is the lowest. Is this okay?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even in the game, there was a description that the results were not good. And there must have been an event in which Amy became friendly and taught the subjects while increasing the likability. But, what is going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because they were busy teaching kindly to Amy, who is in 3rd place, how to cope with her surroundings, they got stuck with this grade &#8230; No way that is the case, or is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the story has derailed, so let&#8217;s return to the current situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my case, I don&#8217;t have any social status,  the test is perfect, and the magic test was adjusted to be a little weaker than the son of the Court Magician. Though swordsmanship is no match for opponents who have blessings and skills, I think I still have a good point in it. Maybe it&#8217;s a little above the average.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So my evaluation by the school teachers seems to be a commoner with average wind magic abilities, maybe?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I wouldn&#8217;t drop out of school with this result.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn my heels back and enter the auditorium. Then, after waiting for a while, the boring closing ceremony begins. When I return to the class after listening to the long story of a great man, the homeroom begins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, by calling each person&#8217;s name, the answer sheet is returned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun, you were the only one with a perfect score. I heard that you were a genius since the beginning of our school system, but you have shown your talent without regret. Everyone, please give Allen-kun a big round of applause.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was called and went to the front, the teacher said that. Although I&#8217;m happy about it, I still feel a little troubled as I didn&#8217;t want to stand out so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, the aristocrats will not applaud the commoners anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so, but there is one person who is applauding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Anastasia, who was scratched from the first place. And the noble daughters who surround her, who seem to have a relatively close relationship with Anastasia, also applaud me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deeply thanked Anastasia and everyone else for their applause then returned to my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when everyone&#8217;s answer sheets were returned, the contents of the free research during the summer vacation were explained. It seems that anything can be done, and no evaluation criteria are there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. In other words, it is like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a well-established school with a strong social disposition. And this free research is used as an evaluation standard for classification, as you can&#8217;t put a great aristocrat in the lower class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. Not again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t get bothered by it. I can listen to the elf folklore and put it together in a report, or if I want to, I can also make a report on the discovery of the Orc Dungeon or the other achievements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a ruin exploration event for Amy and the capture targets, but there is no way to intervene in it. In the first place, all I have to do is, stop Anastasia from getting angry and cause the so-called otome game template events. Then, Anastasia, who had stopped bullying Amy, would be completely acquitted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how effective it will be in this country where social status and power speak for themselves, but I&#8217;ll do what I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the homeroom was over and I left my seat to return to the dormitory, Anastasia called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly put my right hand on my chest, and my left hand behind my waist then turned and knelt to thank the vassals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a tone that doesn&#8217;t seem like a duke&#8217;s daughter. But, even in the game, Anastasia always spoke in this tone when talking to a person of lower status. I was surprised at first and had a preconceived notion that she must be a proud villainess-like character. But it feels nostalgic seeing her like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I humble myself as a person of lower status without regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I am honoured to have Anastasia-sama remember my name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good. We&#8217;re in school, so you don&#8217;t have to show such respect. Stand up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got permission and stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are qualified as an adventurer, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Have you ever entered the Dungeon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If it&#8217;s the Goblin Dungeon, I have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Okay. I&#8217;ll send a messenger later. I&#8217;m sorry for stopping you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Anastasia walked away along with her entourage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will a messenger come?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I get noticed by her?</span></p>
