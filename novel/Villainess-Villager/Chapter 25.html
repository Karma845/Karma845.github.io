<h3>Chapter 25 - Villager A Enrolls in High School.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m finally 15 years old. My situation right now is like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Allen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rank: C</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age: 15</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessings:</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind God</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Skills:</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple Chant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">No Chant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Place of residence: Lurden</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Possession: 34,519,728</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Level: 37</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strength: C</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magical power: A</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Achievements: Goblin Dungeon Conqueror, Goblin Slayer, Orc Slayer, Youngest C Rank</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became the youngest C-rank adventurer. And even after paying 20 million for entrance and tuition fees, I will still have plenty of savings. It&#8217;s thanks to that pedestal that I was able to make so much money. It can be said that my life as an adventurer is quite successful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, I didn&#8217;t intend to raise my rank to C. But when the Orc Slayer achievement popped up in my guild card, pressure from the authorities intensified. Also, master was pushing me to become the youngest C ranker. So when I took an escort and subduing thieves requests at the age of 14 years old, I ranked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, my level is 37. Compared to the game, it is a level where you can win the final battle with Anastasia, who succumbed to darkness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, my swordsmanship didn&#8217;t play any role in battle. But the sword training I received from master was indispensable. Thanks to that, I managed to pass the entrance examination for swordsmanship, even though I couldn&#8217;t beat the examiner. Needless to say, I passed the magic test. If anything, it was harder to adjust my strength so that I wouldn&#8217;t stand out too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I used the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill to hide all of my skills and blessings except </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Given that, If a student with so many skills enrols in school, then he/she will definitely get involved in some trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that I shouldn&#8217;t stand out until the villainess condemnation event is very important. By that time, the only things that will be different from the original should be the circumstances related to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and a mob character, i.e. me getting mixed with the school environment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I need to do is, let the events proceed as much as possible according to the game, and stop the condemnation event, which in turn will stop the villainess Anastasia from succumbing to darkness. Doing that will save me, my mother, master, Monica-san, my seniors, and additionally, all the people who live in the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s do it!</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And like that, the season where the Sakura petals danced in the air came. I finally got enrolled in the royal high school- the stage of the otome game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pass through the gates of the Royal High School wearing a brand new uniform with a blazer. From there, I head to the auditorium, which is the venue for the entrance ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the entrance of the auditorium, the results of the entrance examination are posted in order from top to bottom. The student&#8217;s classification is also written.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">2nd place Allen (Special)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">3rd place Amy von Brayes (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">4th place Markus von Beinz (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">5th place Claude Justine de Westerdale (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">6th place Oscar von Wimlet (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">7th place Margaret von Altomund (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">11th place Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">21st place Leonardo von Jukes (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──── Below, B class ────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">22nd place Vandaren von Ceben (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">23rd place Heide Marie Asmus (General)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">24th place Isabella von Luinberg (Noble)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">39th place Glen Weitberg (General)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems, this year they are accepting a total of 39 students. The parentheses after the name seem to indicate the type of examination. (Noble) is for an aristocrat, (Special) is for a scholarship student, and (General) is for the general populace. By the way, being a scholarship student only gives the benefit of exemption from the written examination, no other support such as exemption from tuition fees are given.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for some reason, I ended up in class A. I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in the event, so I would have preferred class B, but &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it can&#8217;t be helped. In class A, everyone except me is of course an aristocrat. Even in class B, there are only 3 commoner students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat on the back corner seat of class A so that I wouldn&#8217;t stand out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I&#8217;m not allowed to start a conversation with my classmates. According to what I learned in the etiquette class before enrollment, it is profane to start talking to aristocrats as a commoner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it seems that it is forbidden to speak until you&#8217;re asked from the other side. And even if you talk to him/her once, you are not allowed to talk to him/her if the other side does not allow you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to stand out from the beginning, so this is fine. But I enrolled with normal expectations, so it&#8217;s quite shocking that from the start I&#8217;ll be lonely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for a while, all at once, the students came in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia came in with her entourage. As expected of her ridiculous beauty. Unlike an ordinary person like me, there is an elegant and inaccessible aura around her. Even though she is such a beauty, she looks like a statue because of her expressionlessness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia glanced at me, but seemingly uninterested, she sat down in the front row.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, His Imperial Highness Prince Karl Heinz comes in. The remaining four capture targets are also here in full force. All of them are releasing a terribly handsome aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was a girl who had played the game, she would have gone squeaky in this place, but when I see them, I get sick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In-game, I had to increase their interest. As I don&#8217;t have that kind of hobby, I suffered a lot of mental damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They also glanced at me and sat next to Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then came Amy, the heroine with the characteristic pink hair. She was a baron&#8217;s daughter and had been raised as a commoner until just a few months ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I glanced at her, she came closer to me and called out with a sweet voice like sugar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning. I&#8217;m Amy von Brayes. You&#8217;re the Scholarship student, Allen-san, right? Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Impossible! At this entrance ceremony, the heroine should have been thrilled to see the crown prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nice to meet you, Amy-sama. I&#8217;m Allen, commoner Allen. Be kind to me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretended to be calm and answered her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san, you got a perfect score in all subjects and graduated by skipping class at the age of 11, right? At that time, I was a commoner and attended the same school, that&#8217;s why I remember you being the hot topic in gossips.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy looks up at me with a slight blush and glittering eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cu-cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of the heroine of an Otome Game. No wonder that the capture targets fall for this cuteness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the game, did the character speak in such a sweet and stupid way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, my school life started with a feeling of turmoil from the beginning.</span></p>
