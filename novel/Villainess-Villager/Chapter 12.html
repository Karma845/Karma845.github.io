<h3>Chapter 12 - Villager A Really Wants to Fly.</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I was back in Frissen after helping a certain wyvern in the Valley of the Flying Dragon, and I just want you to see this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Allen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rank: E</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age: 12</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessings:【Wind God】</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Skills: 【Concealment】【Appraisal】【Alchemy】【Wind Magic】.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Place of residence: Ruhrden</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cash on hand: 3,009,012</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Level: 1</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1679333811"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1864618928"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strength: E</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic power: D</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blessing wasn&#8217;t【Wind Magic】 but 【Wind God】, and 【Wind Magic】 had been added to my skills. Moreover, even though I haven&#8217;t done anything, my magic power had gone up two levels from F to D.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not too sure about the【Wind God】 blessing, but if we&#8217;re talking about a D level in magic power, If I recall correctly, I think even Markus only had around this much when they were condemning Anastasia at the academy. Ah, just in case you forgot, Markus was the son of the kingdom&#8217;s court magician.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, anyway, since it&#8217;s a god&#8217;s blessing, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s amazing. And thanks to the addition of the 【Wind Magic】skill, I can now use the wind magic I wanted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I&#8217;d like to move on to the next plan to change the future scenario. My next goal is to secure a means of transportation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may be wondering what I&#8217;m talking about, but I want you to think about it like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fastest means of transportation in this world is by horse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you keep changing horses and ride all day, at best, you can only travel hundreds of kilometers a day.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1224525347"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-13914044"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">An ordinary horse-drawn carriage would only be able to travel a few dozen kilometers a day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what if there was a way to travel at a speed of several hundred kilometers per hour in this world?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, that&#8217;s something I want to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, the goal of this mission is to create a glider. But rather than a normal glider, I want to make one powered by wind magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it simply, a glider is like an airplane that is insanely light and can fly without an engine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been an aeronautical engineer in my past life, and I know enough about the technical aspects of a plane so of course I can fly one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I started making a blueprint of the plane.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fuselage is cylindrical in shape but I changed it a bit so it could shoot out wind magic to propel itself. I also used a wyvern magic stone as a catalyst to activate the magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I set up three wheels at the bottom so I could take off smoothly&#8230; And hopefully also land back down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flattened the front part of the fuselage so I could operate the glider from there. I&#8217;m planning on using my right hand to supply the engines with magic power, and use my left hand to manipulate magic to control the tail rudders.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1941088885"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2040431174"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The airfoil shape of the main wings will be orthodox and streamlined.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The material will be mainly wyvern bones membranes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, using the 【Alchemy】 skill, I put the blueprint I made into a magic circle and gathered the necessary materials to refine the glider.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But really, this 【Alchemy】skill is so overpowered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, Amy could quickly create a &#8220;comfortable carriage that doesn&#8217;t shake&#8221;, so I expected to be able to do something like this, but I didn&#8217;t expect it could completely recreate a blueprint&#8217;s design by using a magic circle this easily. I thought it was possible, but I still couldn&#8217;t help but be surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the magic circle is done. The shape of the glider, with the exception of the wind magic engine, is something that has been proven to fly in my memory in my previous life, so there should be no problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I came to an open area some distance from the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The grass is overgrown, so I use the wind magic I just learned to cut down the grass at once.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mana, the root of all things, gather in my hands and be the wind that cuts down my enemies. Wind Cutter!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the【Wind Magic】skill, the chant magically appeared in my head.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1886504397"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1052112692"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After cutting down the grass, I used【Alchemy】to flatten the ground and make a 500-meter-long runway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to my magic power being raised to D, I didn&#8217;t feel tired at all even after using this much. This was amazing!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, when the runway is finished, I take out the magic circle I wrote on a piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I placed two wyvern magic stones, a membrane and one femur to activate the magic circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8221;Refine!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I activated the skill, the magic circle started to emit light. The light gradually molded itself in the air and when the light disappeared, it created a glider just as the blueprint says.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to my cheat skills, I hopped inside the cockpit and fastened my seatbelt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I grab the handle with my right hand and activate the wind magic engine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mana, the source of all things. Gather in my hands and become the wind.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Wind Magic】activates and the magic circle carved into the magic stone blows out a powerful gust of wind.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-7442723"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1148844835"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Fwoooooo*</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tremendous gust of wind blows out of the engine and the glider begins to accelerate rapidly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, I&#8217;m going to throw up&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The g-force was so intense that I felt like my body was being crushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, the next thing I knew was that the glider was flying through the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whoaa! It worked!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The glider was gaining altitude very quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trees in the forest were getting smaller and smaller, and we were getting higher than even the mountains around us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This feels good. I haven&#8217;t been up in the sky in so long.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using my left hand, I used【Alchemy】 to make the horizontal tail rudder return to a level position, the glider balanced off to a stable flight.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1476148182"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-442740280"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there was no such thing as a GPS, I flew towards the royal capital, Lurden, relying only on the street roads that looked like small lines drawn on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was definitely way faster than a carriage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it felt really, really good. With me onboard, the glider went over city after city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t that the castle of Lurden?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself, pleased to see a small, familiar castle in the distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance I had travelled by carriage for days had been returned to in just a few hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technology is also overpowered, huh?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to prepare for the landing, when I realized something important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, where am I supposed to land this thing?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no seas or rivers big enough to make an emergency landing near Lurden. The streets weren&#8217;t wide enough either, and there were people passing by the plains.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-607529962"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2010252953"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I realized something even more important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Oh damn.&#8217;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t even have a parachute.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flew around the area trying to find a suitable spot, and just when my mana was starting to run low, I found a lake deep within the northeast forest where the ruins were.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You couldn&#8217;t get to this area in the game, but the northeast forest was a pretty low-levelled area with only horned rabbits and, though rarely seen, goblins, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too dangerous. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Okay, let&#8217;s make an emergency landing here.&#8217;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I circled around and gradually lost altitude. I had already stopped using magic so the engines were essentially off and I was just gliding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The glider was gradually losing speed and altitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lake was kind of elliptical in shape, so I adjusted my flight path to enter the lake from the longer side.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn. I&#8217;ve never done an emergency landing before, not even at training!&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1645026821"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-560712059"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swore unintentionally, but this was all my mistake. Be that as it may, it would be really embarrassing to die here after focusing on the future scenario this much.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I focused all my attention on controlling the glider and aimed to make the water a landing track.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The glider skimmed over the trees and descended into the lake.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entry angle wasn&#8217;t something I was used to, but I did my best to adjust the horizontal tail rudder. I also pushed against the force of the glider with my wind magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have put flaps on the wings if this was going to happen. I could have slowed it down more!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The glider landed on the water and a large splash of water burst out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the lake wasn&#8217;t long enough and the glider flew across the lake and off to the other side. The glider&#8217;s tail bumped into the terrain causing the glider to point up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a loud boom, the glider&#8217;s belly crashed straight into a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, the water had taken off a lot of the momentum and so the tree had, though violently, stopped the glider.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t get thrown out of the plane because of my seatbelt, but every single part of me hurt.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1552515523"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-690023234"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t anything fatal, at least, but using this glider again was going to be impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking that, the glider turned into something like fine sand and disappeared. Apparently, things made with the 【Alchemy】 skill are like this when they break.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8221;Ah, I failed.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After muttering that, I used my【Concealment】skill to walk towards the town of Lurden.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I had successfully flown with my glider, I had lost a lot of precious material and gained a lot of scrapes and bruises.</span></p>
