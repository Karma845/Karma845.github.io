<h3>Chapter 7 - Villager A Learns Alchemy in a Suspicious Store.</h3>

<p>In a secluded back alley where you could barely see, there was a staircase off to the far side, hidden from the main streets. There was not enough light to show you what was inside. ‘There couldn’t be a shop here’ is what most people would think.</p><p>It was a really unsettling feeling.</p><p>But if I didn&#8217;t proceed, I wouldn&#8217;t get anything, so I go onwards, down the stairs, and into the darkness.</p><p>The passage didn’t lead straight down. There were two times when the stairs levelled off to a landing, and when I continued, there was a door.</p><p>‘The Lurden Store.’</p><p>That’s what was written on the sign on the door, but it didn’t seem like they were welcoming visitors.</p><p>I deactivate【Concealment】and knock on the door.</p><p>After a bit, I heard an old woman&#8217;s voice from the inside.</p><p>&#8221;Who is it?&#8221;</p><p>I use the [Appraisal] skill on the door. To enter the Lurden Store, I needed a code that changed every day. If I didn’t answer the correct code, I wouldn’t be able to enter. In the game, I never had to do anything to go in so I wasn’t really curious. But in reality, it’s pretty annoying, huh?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-411935612"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1860941894"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>I answer back the exact words the I got from the【Appraisal】skill.</p><p>&#8221;A rabbit jumped in the east forest today. Tomorrow we&#8217;ll move south, but before that I want to make a meal of it.”</p><p>*Gacha*</p><p>And with that, the door opened and I entered. In it, was the same Lurden Store that you saw in game.</p><p>The small six-mat shop was crammed with questionable items. Skeletons, lizard tails, books, dried flowers and plants, all of which I had no idea what they were used for.</p><p>And a wrinkled old woman sat at the back counter.</p><p>“Welcome. What can I do for you?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“I want the 『Scroll of Alchemy』.”</p><p>The old woman&#8217;s eyebrows twitch. Then she lets out a muffled laugh.</p><p>“Good. I like you, how about 14 million for it?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-244972254"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1954569897"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.”</p><p>“Then, please wait while I get it.”</p><p>The old woman grinned as she walked to the back of the store.</p><p>And after a while, she returned with a scroll and few small stones.</p><p>&#8221;This one is the『Scroll of Alchemy』and these ones are magic stones from goblins. I&#8217;ll give you three as a service.&#8221;</p><p>I immediately used my 【Appraisal】 skill to appraise the scroll.</p><p>────</p><p>Name: Just a scroll.</p><p>Description: a scroll labeled alchemy. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as memo taking and calligraphy.</p><p>Grade: Common</p>
