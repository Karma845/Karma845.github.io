<h3>Chapter 21 - Villager A Becomes Goblin Slayer.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Should I reduce the calibre to improve the penetrative ability, or should I modify the bullet?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I&#8217;m doing the trial and error method repeatedly at the experimental facility attached to Lurden Airport, which I made secretly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The goal is to modify the weapons to defeat the Goblin Lord with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kalashi&#8217;s bullets did not pass through the Goblin Lord. In the first place, guns were basically made to kill humans. And the damage caused by them is highest when a human gets hit by a bullet, and it remains in the body in a deformed state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Large calibre, i.e. the larger the diameter of a bullet, the less chance of it penetrating out of the body. In other words, the ability to kill humans increases, i.e. the power increases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, if you make the calibre smaller, it will easily penetrate out of the body. So, the killing ability will be lower. Also, you have to hit the key vitals accurately to defeat a human with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now the problem is that I&#8217;m dealing with monsters, not humans. I don&#8217;t understand why such a full-scale battle part was incorporated into the world of otome games. Anyway, that&#8217;s the case, so there is no choice but to deal with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kalashi uses a standard 30 calibre 7.62 x 39 mm bullet. So, I made another rifle with Kalashi&#8217;s specs and modified the calibre to 22. I named it Nikov. Now that I think about it, the Soviet Union had made something similar as a successor to the AK-47.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it called AK-74?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 22 calibre was more successful on the US military&#8217;s M16, but I&#8217;m not familiar with that design.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Weapons made by the former Soviet Union were on the market here and there. Touching the real thing was easy. Also, it had its charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, both Kalashi and Nikov are similar in appearance, but the mechanism is entirely different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, regarding the other modification, i.e. improving the bullet. The first thing that comes to mind is to make a Full Metal Jacket bullet (a.k.a FMJ bullet) that covers the bullet with hard metal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, I didn&#8217;t do it because it was troublesome to procure brass to cover it, but it may be good to use this as an opportunity to envelop the bullets. Better yet, it would be nice to find a tungsten deposit somewhere, but it&#8217;s not so convenient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went on, doing trial and error repeatedly for two weeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, both the 22 and 30 calibre bullets became FMJ bullets with an iron core and a brass coating. They were powerful enough to lightly penetrate an iron plate of about 5 mm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for using FMJ in both the guns is that I wanted to avoid leaving lead residue in the gun cavity and muzzle, which could cause an outburst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, let&#8217;s go to the Goblin Dungeon for a trial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately got on the Buitor and flew towards the Goblin Dungeon.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived at Stresen Airport in less than an hour. Of course, I made it secretly here as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is built on the opposite side of the Goblin Dungeon from the Stresen village. So it won&#8217;t be discovered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have any reason to go to Stresen village, so I just head for the Goblin Dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move forward holding Nikov while putting Kalashi on my back. As before, the lantern is lowered on my waist, and the 【Concealment】 skill is in effect while moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are fewer goblins than last time, but still, a decent number of goblins are there. I proceed while defeating all of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I got to the boss room, I had about 40 goblin magic stones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, in the boss room, I meet the boss gang- Goblin Lord, two Hobgoblins, and two Goblin Mages again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like last time, I shoot and kill the Goblin Mages and Hobgoblins first. Then use a smokescreen to hide and go behind the Goblin Lord.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandandandandandan …… Click</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikov has run out of bullets, but it has penetrated properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Goblin Lord, who is spilling blood from six bullets in his body, roared and rushed towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jump to the side and avoid it, then switch to Kalashi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandandandandandan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One-shot hit the Goblin Lord between his eyebrows. It might have pierced his skull as his movement stopped, and he collapsed as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time I was able to win by a margin. When I collect the magic stone, I touch the labyrinth core and transfer it to the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, I head for the second lap. Goblins are no longer my opponent unless I&#8217;m careless. I reach the boss room without any problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got about 20 goblin magic stones this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no one in the boss room because I defeated it earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, touching the labyrinth core again, I move to the entrance and head for the third lap. On the third lap, I was able to collect about 20 goblin magic stones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the boss room, I saw two Hobgoblins, two Goblin mages and the Goblin Lord for the third time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I know the strategy, I punctured the Hobgoblins and Goblin Mages with holes using Nikov and then used Kalashi to puncture holes in the Goblin Lord.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I collected the magic stone quickly and went to challenge the next lap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if I traverse the Dungeon like this, the boss who should have been dead will be revived once every two laps. Though it takes a week to revive naturally, if you traverse in a row like this, the boss will revive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, if you keep doing this in the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain in the summer of the second year, you can easily clear the main route without paying. Of course, I didn&#8217;t discover it myself. It was written on the Wiki when I looked it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My goal in the future is to do that and raise the level before enrollment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, I went on traversing the Goblin Dungeon every day for about a week and made a total of about 100 laps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to sell the goblin magic stone to the guild on my way home, but I was astounded by what master told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen-boy. Why is the Goblin Slayer title in your achievement record?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master, what is that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This title is given to those who have hunted more than 1,000 goblins in a year. Do you have any grudge against the goblins?&#8221;</span></p>
