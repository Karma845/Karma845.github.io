<h3>Chapter 30 - Villager A Suspects Amy.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a moss called Luminous Moss (T/N:- it was called &#8216;Akarigoke&#8217; in the raw, which means &#8216;moss emanating light&#8217;) in this ruin, which illuminates the inside with a decent amount of brightness. Therefore, there is no need for lights such as torches and lanterns at this ruin. But do note that this is not the case with other Dungeons or ruins.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the ruins, I spoke the lines of the adventurer who guided the princes &amp; Co. in the game. I should proceed as much as possible according to the game to avoid uncontrollable situations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, who heard my lines, was looking at me while muttering something. When I noticed it, I instinctively asked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy-sama? Is there any problem?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ah, umm, as expected, adventurers are so familiar with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Thank you. If you have any concerns, please feel free to voice them.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little uncomfortable with how she said those lines with a strangely sweet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I proceed into the ruins with this discomfort, without understanding what it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wow, amazing. The walls shine so much. It&#8217;s beautiful &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, but Amy is more beautiful, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy is impressed by the scenery, and the Crown Prince praises Amy. It&#8217;s the same as the interactions in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia looks at these two people with cold eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, we arrive at the end of the ruin. Then Amy tries to move to the left, so I stop her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy-sama, there&#8217;s just a small room with nothing in it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy asks me so with a sweet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy wants to see it. It&#8217;s okay for a little bit, right?.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, the crown prince covers up for Amy, so I move into the small room on the left. And Amy, who came in after me, walked straight towards the back right corner of the small room as if being sucked into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. Is it like that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As Allen said, there is nothing in this room.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia leaked her thoughts. There, while seeing Amy&#8217;s actions, I remembered a perfect story and got on Anastasia&#8217;s soliloquy to hit a jab on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It seems that the goblins were nesting in this site about seven years ago. At that time, I was still a child. So I couldn&#8217;t participate in the subjugation. But, what I heard from the seniors in the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild is that it seems, in this room, the goblins stored their collected treasures. However, since all the adventurers brought them back during the subjugation, there is nothing left now. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I hide the fact that I secretly stole the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and picked up the silver coins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Did something like that also happen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia nodded as if impressed with my explanation. Her expression was not frozen as before but had a tinge of girlishness suitable for her age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, while listening to our conversation, moved to the other corner, then checked the ground and whispered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Amy, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Um-umm, nothing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Crown Prince, worried about Amy&#8217;s suspicious behaviour, asked her about it. Amy replied in a hurry. As expected, there is a familiarness in her actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I haven&#8217;t confirmed it yet. But I wonder if Amy knows about this world like me, that is, that Otome game&#8217;s settings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the point that she wanted to enter this small room, the point that she walked to the right-back of the room, and the point that she examined the opposite corner. It seems she wanted the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the game mode, which I&#8217;ve confirmed, from the silver coin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> should have dropped in any of the easy, normal, and hard modes of the game. And there shouldn&#8217;t be any other game modes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did Amy think of this situation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s move on. Guide me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Crown Prince ordered me, I stopped thinking and resumed to guide around the ruins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After, I guided them around, collected herbs and observed blue slime. We came to the deepest part of the ruins, where the Dungeon core was said to have existed when this ruin was a Dungeon in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is the part where the Dungeon core was said to be when it was a Dungeon. However, I don&#8217;t know when it disappeared and why it disappeared. I don&#8217;t even know if this was really a dungeon or not.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained that, Anastasia curiously dug around the wall. Amy, on the other hand, is boringly playing with her hair. Perhaps, she&#8217;s no longer interested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Chi, I didn&#8217;t get to see a big monster in such a place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness Claude, aren&#8217;t we with Amy? Shouldn&#8217;t we be pleased that the danger was low?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, Markus. There can be no danger to Amy because I am with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leo, the best way to protect your loved one is to stay away from danger, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? It seems Markus is not confident in protecting Amy from danger. If it&#8217;s me, I can protect her in a cool way, though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For what the hell did these guys come here? Even if Amy is capturing them, if the future Lords with authority act like this, won&#8217;t the future of this country be in jeopardy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, the charmed reverse harem&#8217;s ruins exploration date, which was also a ruins survey for independent research, ended with sharp mental damage for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? But in the game, Anastasia was quite sarcastic about Amy, who was clinging to the crown prince. It seems nothing happened.</span></p>
