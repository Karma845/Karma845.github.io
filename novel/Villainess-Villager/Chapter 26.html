<h3>Chapter 27 - Villager Attends a Class.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s been a week since I entered high school. As expected, I&#8217;m alone. No one talks to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became the perfect lonely guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Amy was the only one who talked to me on the day of admission. She seemed to have successfully completed the meeting event with the crown prince and has lost interest in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince is also taking care of Amy&#8217;s this and that, saying &#8216;Amy-san was a commoner before, so she would have trouble understanding many things&#8217;. But it seems that I, a real commoner, have no use for him. So I get ignored in the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we pass each other in the hallway, I have to bow my head. So I don&#8217;t get the chance to talk to him. By the way, private rooms are given in the dormitory. But, the buildings are different for the aristocrats and the commoners. So meeting each other is not possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expected to get ignored by others. But, after being spoken to once, getting ignored became mentally harder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, there should be an event where Amy, who should have the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">blessing, uses healing magic. Orientation of the classes is also over. Full-scale lessons will begin today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first class is on magic exercise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed the aristocratic classmates to the training ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Let&#8217;s start the lesson. It may be boring for those who can already use magic. But, learning the basics of controlling it well comes first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher explains so while addressing the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;People who can use magic already raise their hands&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to the teacher&#8217;s call, everyone&#8217;s hand went up. Of course, I also raise my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm? In the first place, since there was a magical entrance exam, everyone can use it when they enter the school, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it possible to enrol without using magic?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gununu. It&#8217;s not like it was a waste of effort, but it&#8217;s kind of disappointing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Then, Crown Prince Karlheinz. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s simple, can you show us a little?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, leave it to me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the crown prince comes forward and starts chanting with full confidence. I don&#8217;t know what he is saying because he is far away. But when he created a fireball, he threw it toward the target, which hit it directly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clap clap clap&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone from the class burst into applause. So, wrapped up in it, I also applaud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the crown prince has the blessings of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Fire magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, just like the protagonist of a story. In the game, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">blessing effects were like buffing yourself and your friends when you lead them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In this way, if you control it correctly, you will be able to hit it firmly even if it is so far away. On the contrary, if you do not control it, you will not hit the target, or in the worst case, it may run out of control and backfire.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher explains the precautions for using magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, next is Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia came forward when she was called by the teacher. At this time, Anastasia and the Crown Prince didn&#8217;t even look at each other, let alone exchange words. No, Anastasia thanked the prince, but the prince ignored it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the relationship between the two is still quite awkward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia creates an ice arrow and shoots at the target. The ice arrow shot by Anastasia destroys the target and stops after hitting the wall behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clap clap clap&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again everyone burst into applause. Apparently, at present, Anastasia has better magical abilities than the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Anastasia&#8217;s blessings are </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The only characters who have two blessings are the Crown Prince and Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the prince thought that his fiancé had disgraced his honour. His face turned bright red and demanded a do-over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia, destroying the target even though I was unable to. Do you want to disgrace my honour?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t mean to &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia says so and bows silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Enough, I&#8217;ll show you my full power.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, the crown prince begins chanting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, don&#8217;t!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia tries to stop the prince, but it was too late. The prince creates a huge fireball on hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ku, Uu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince moans, and Anastasia&#8217;s voice, similar to a scream, echoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next moment, the crown prince&#8217;s fireball went out of control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fireball explodes at hand, and the flame spreads wrapping around the entire area. But, the very next moment, Anastasia froze the surroundings and quickly extinguished the prince&#8217;s runaway flames.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, while looking worried, rushed to the prince with a sweet voice. Then she used healing magic to heal the burned crown prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia stares at the situation with a surprised expression. Also, the teachers watching didn&#8217;t stop the treatment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About 10 minutes after that, the prince&#8217;s burns were completely healed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm? Did it take so long? Wasn&#8217;t it just described in the game?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, this is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the crown prince stares at Amy in a surprised manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness! Are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia tries to hand a handkerchief to the prince. but the prince refuses it and stands up. While putting his hands on Amy&#8217;s shoulders the prince thanked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, it was there. An event still like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Amy. What a wonderful power it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s, I was just praying for Karl-sama &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anastasia saw this situation, her eyebrows twitched, but she turned her back and went away without saying anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it my imagination, or did I see Amy glance at Anastasia&#8217;s situation with a slight grin on her mouth?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Today&#8217;s class is over. Now that you know what magic is like, let&#8217;s train hard from today. That&#8217;s it, dismissed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the teacher said so, he quickly left the training ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, this was the event. The teacher who did not stop it properly was also a teacher. And the crown prince, who was disgraced by his fiance, threw childish opposition and messed up the lesson. He treats the original saviour who stopped the runaway magic, the villainess, his fiancé, wickedly and thanked Amy only.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it&#8217;s a loose and convenient otome game event, it doesn&#8217;t feel good after watching such a funny farce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I think so, I can&#8217;t do anything now. I obediently left the training ground.</span></p>
