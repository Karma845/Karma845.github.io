<h3>Chapter 30 - Villager A acts as a guide.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since the school&#8217;s figurine lifestyle has come to a halt, I was thinking of traversing the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain to make money. But something unexpected happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the third day of summer vacation, I&#8217;m at the entrance to the northeastern forest, where the ruins in which I got the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is. Other than me, Anastasia, the Crown Prince &amp; the other capture targets with Amy, are also present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness, and everyone present here, thank you for your time today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kneel and thank my vassals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince said so bluntly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he isn&#8217;t interested in me at all. He is watching Amy with affectionate eyes while Anastasia looks at such a prince with cold eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the reason why everyone came to such a place was that I was asked by Anastasia to help the princes in their independent research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it is a request from the Duke&#8217;s daughter, to a commoner like me it is actually an order. So I don&#82#8217;t have the option to decline it. If I refuse, it is obvious that I will be kicked out of the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, for the time being, I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;ll be able to submit it under a joint name. But, I&#8217;m a person of low status. Therefore, I&#8217;m sure from writing the manuscript to proofreading the report. I have to do it alone. So it feels complicated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I&#8217;ve complained a lot. In short, this is an event where the heroine Amy gets the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the game, during the prince route or the reverse harem route when the prince was a member, Anastasia followed along and hired an outside adventurer to guide him for safety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that the event has changed a little because a foreign element called me is mixed in the school. Perhaps Anastasia thought it would be better to use a convenient adventurer in class for free than to hire an unknown adventurer from outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the fact that all the capture targets are here means that Amy is aiming for the reverse Harem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You know, it is quite difficult to clear the reverse harem route. I have to move around and set flags thoroughly, but apparently, Amy is doing well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s mentally irritating when the girl I like gets intimate with my friends one after another. But it seems that everyone here isn&#8217;t like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Amy seems to be quite disliked by the girls in her class, and bullying seems to be gradually escalating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Anastasia doesn&#8217;t seem to be involved in that, and it doesn&#8217;t matter to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, are you all ready? If you don&#8217;t mind, then I will guide you all to the ruins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, no problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then I will move on. Along the way, there is a horned rabbit monster called Horn-Rabbit. If you&#8217;re not careful, you may get stabbed by the horn and get injured.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh. Who are you referring to? As if I will lose to the likes of a Horn-Rabbit?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prince Claude said so as if trying to make a fool of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I also have been training firmly to become the knight leader in future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The likes of a Horn-Rabbit, I&#8217;ll kill it with a single blow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh. I&#8217;ll make a barbecue of such Horn-Rabbit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, if you burn the Horn-Rabbit, only charcoal will remain.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Others also verbally opposed my words. Firstly, Leonardo, Oscar, Markus, and finally Prince Karlheinz.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I don&#8217;t think I could eat the Horn-Rabbit even if it was roasted, without draining the blood properly. But I decided not to put in a tsukkomi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, Umm. I&#8217;m sure Allen-san was worried, so he said that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy speaks with a strangely sweet voice to the capture target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, as expected. Amy will care for the commoners also.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s my Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Amy doesn&#8217;t belong to Claude, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. She is mine, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, she is mine&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s &#8230; I &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a nauseating exchange going on in front of me. When I glanced at Anastasia, she was giving a frozen look to the crown prince and Co.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anastasia noticed my gaze, for a moment, she had a slightly embarrassed expression on her face. But soon after, she coldly told the six people with a frozen expression again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, His Majesty will be worried if it&#8217;s too late. Let&#8217;s start.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince, who had a slightly sullen expression, clicked his tongue, perhaps because he was angry at the fact that his sweet mood got watered by this exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Let&#8217;s start. Now, move.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say anything, No matter what, he is a crown prince. I can&#8217;t be rude. I expressionlessly gave a small reply, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and guided them to the ruins.</span></p>
