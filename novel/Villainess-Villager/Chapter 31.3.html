<p><b>Side &#8211; Amy (1):-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m Amy, the heroine of this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lived in poverty downtown, but when I hit my head in the carriage, my memory returned suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s when I noticed. This world is the stage of my favourite otome game [Magical</span><span style="font-weight: 400">☆</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Fantasy~Love&#8217;s Heart-Racing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">♡</span><span style="font-weight: 400">School Life], and I am the heroine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just a high school student in my previous life. But I died from hitting my head when a car that ignored the traffic lights hit me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I try to compliment my previous life, it wasn&#8217;t good. When I talked to the class leader once, I was bullied by all the girls in the class. Besides, the boys made fun of me while saying fatso or gorilla without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I have no friends, as a matter of fact, of course. Even though I&#8217;m not bad at all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyways, because of that, I was playing this otome game when I had free time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, unlike the monkeys in the class, the men in this game look at me properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, probably that&#8217;s why God prepared the heroine&#8217;s life as a second life for such a poor me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, it&#8217;s really a reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My priority is Karl-sama. But the other good-looking guys will also love me if I choose the reverse Harem, you know? The reverse Harem is mainly Karl-sama&#8217;s route, and I have memorized all the options. So I won&#8217;t make a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I couldn&#8217;t arrange the funds, I will take the time to capture them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, if I clear the route, I will be the saint of charity blessed by the spirit of light, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I will get to live a life like a princess who can wear beautiful dresses and live in a luxurious castle surrounded by handsome men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I keep on living, and I was right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken over by the Baron family when they found out that I was the daughter of Baron Brayes. Moreover, they also discover that I was receiving the protection of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, this I is an aristocratic daughter and the saint&#8217;s hatchling, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I can&#8217;t stop laughing already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Studies are also surprisingly easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was living in poverty, there was a boy who was said to be a genius at the school I attended. Being called a genius in something of this level, even I can do that much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t do it, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, if it&#8217;s at this level, I didn&#8217;t have to study at all. And the heroine was set to be smart, but she didn&#8217;t graduate by skipping grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if I change the scenario of the game, I don&#8217;t know if I can proceed through to the reverse Harem end properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aren’t I a true genius to notice up to such length? (T/N:- yes, you&#8217;re a fool to mix up reality with fantasy.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I enrolled in the Royal High School to enter the stage of the game. In the game, the villainess Anastasia was in 1st place, and I was in 2nd, so I made a careless mistake on purpose in the entrance examination, but somehow I was in 3rd place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Allen!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For him to get in my way! I was a little irritated, but I remembered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy was the genius who was there when I was in that school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t see a mob character like him in the game. What is happening?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little worried, so I sat next to him at the entrance ceremony and talked to him. The heroine at this time was only looking at Karl-sama from a distance, so there should be no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning. I&#8217;m Amy von Brayes. You&#8217;re the Scholarship student, Allen-san, right? Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nice to meet you, Amy-sama. I&#8217;m Allen, commoner Allen. Be kind to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that with a slight glance and a sweet voice, he easily got swayed by it. Though he is pretending to be calm, isn&#8217;t it visible that he fell for me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san, you got a perfect score in all subjects and graduated by skipping grades at the age of 11, right? At that time, I was a commoner and attended the same school. That&#8217;s why I remember you being the hot topic in gossip.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, he got bright red on his face and became fidgety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, there seems to be no man who will not fall for my heroine face and voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but I don&#8217;t like his face because he looks like a nerd. I should use him as a convenience when he seems usable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I stopped talking to him afterwards because it&#8217;s a waste of time. And he was so overlooked that I didn&#8217;t even know if he was always in the classroom.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I managed the events smoothly and set the reverse harem flag just like the game. Then, as if I was interesting, the capture targets were fascinated by me and started to hang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels good already. All five of the class&#8217;s top caste boys are in love with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I&#8217;m getting harassed, I&#8217;m not angry when I think that the hideous people were feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a pleasure to see the awkward expression of the villainess who is desperately trying to regain Karl-sama&#8217;s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This woman was messed up in the game. It feels refreshing, to be able to see the awkward appearance in reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels like &#8216;serves you right!&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, she is beautiful, she has good etiquette, she can study, she is blessed with blessings, and she can use magic. Also, she is a rich duke&#8217;s daughter and is promised to become a queen in the future from a young age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This woman who was born with all that and lived without any inconvenience will fall down, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, in the end, she gets banished when her engagement is cancelled, gets group raped and sold. Then in the future, she will be killed by her beloved ex-fiancé and the woman who robbed him, so don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s funny?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, what kind of expression will that woman have? I&#8217;m getting thrilled just imagining it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, some unexpected things happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, the final exam. The villainess who was supposed to lose to me in the next final exam lost to that nerdy genius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was the same as the game where both the villainess and I missed the perfect score. I think it&#8217;s okay because it&#8217;s not out of the scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the other one is that the game mode was extra mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The extra mode is a mode that appeared later, but it&#8217;s a very difficult mode because you can&#8217;t use </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, instead of that, you can take additional skills, that&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s a mode for advanced players who have worked hard like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was originally poor, so there is no problem in capturing without </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. I remember all the options, labyrinth traps, and weaknesses of the enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other than this, right. I wonder if the adventurer who was the guide that the villainess brought to explore the ruins was that nerd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it seems that the nerd made all the reports with the villainess. He is unexpectedly useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s it! I came up with a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the villainess is banished ungracefully, shouldn&#8217;t we keep her as our servant?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a good treatment for that woman to be used by a heroine like me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, as expected of me, isn&#8217;t it. How merciful the future benevolent saint is!</span></p>
