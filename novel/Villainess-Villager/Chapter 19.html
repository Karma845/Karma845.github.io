<h3>Chapter 19 - Villager A captures the Goblin Dungeon</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Allen. I&#8217;ve accepted the request to get rid of the goblins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, finally someone came. I&#8217;m the village chief here. Quite a young boy you are. Well, thank you for accepting the request. I was in trouble because no one has come for the last six months.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I greeted the old man, who is the village chief, I was taken to the house which was rented for my stay. According to the contract of the request, the village will provide accommodation, so the rent is free. But I have to pay for meals myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reward for subduing goblins is 1,500 cents per kill. It also includes the price of the magic stone that is offered as proof of subjugation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, goblin&#8217;s meat is inedible. Sometimes they have weapons, but they&#8217;re tattered and useless, and goblins&#8217; magic stones aren&#8217;t very expensive except for large rare ones. They roam in groups, so you also have to face the danger of losing your life while attacking them. From an adventurer&#8217;s point of view, there is very little gain in fighting them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they build a nest and gather like the ruins of the royal capital, you may have the treasure they collected, but if they didn&#8217;t hoard any, you won&#8217;t really make a lot of money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, due to such circumstances, adventurers will not come unless some convenience is provided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why this village provides accommodation for free. But meals are not free, so it costs about 2,000 to 3,000 cents a day just to stay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s natural that no one will come for about half a year. I will also leave after completing the request and raising my level.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning I head towards the Goblin Dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my hand is an AK-47-style automatic rifle, created with the help of the【Alchemy】skill. I named it Kalashi. Of course, the origin of the name comes from its inventor Kalashnikov.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the mechanism does not use a gunpowder explosion, but the burst of compressed air using wind magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a lot of trouble with it because the reload and magazine mechanism were not working properly. Its development was proceeding in parallel with the development of Buitor but was finally completed to be launched in a real battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Why am I so familiar with how guns work, you say? That&#8217;s because I was a gun otaku in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my previous life, I loved airplanes and guns, and my childhood dream was to be a fighter pilot. Also, when I was a college student, I participated in the trial shooting, maintenance and dismantling experience tours in the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The career I finally chose in my previous life was an aeronautical engineer, but in this current situation, I don&#8217;t need to be cautious about using a gun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I can see a goblin in the distance. It&#8217;s probably a goblin wandering out of the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aim Kalashi while holding it, then pull the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dahn, Dahn, Dahn*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only one of the three shots hit the goblin&#8217;s right chest. As expected it&#8217;s hard to aim perfectly. I need to increase my marksmanship along with my sword training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dahn*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached the cringed goblin and shot him down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have the ability to shoot through the key points from a long distance. Then there is only one thing I can do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use my 【Concealment】 skill to hide and search for goblins. And when I walked for a while, I saw three goblins walking together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went around and approached them from behind, at a distance of about 5 meters I fired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dandandandandandan……*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected at this distance, the bullets hit the mark, and the goblins collapse. When I get closer, I strike the still-breathing goblin&#8217;s head and kill it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha. What the! Isn&#8217;t it an easy victory?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little excited about the fact that even multiple goblins, which were scary when I was 8-years old, can easily be defeated. But, let&#8217;s do the things that need to be done first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I don&#8217;t burn the body and dispose of it, it will attract other monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the goblin magic stone from the bodies and hurriedly disposed of the bodies by burning them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I finished today&#8217;s hunt by defeating 15 goblins in the forest, then went to the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Today&#8217;s delivery is 12 goblin magic stones. Can you please confirm it, Chief?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give 12 goblin magic stones to the village chief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm. Well done. Then your guild card.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give my guild card. The village chief took out a guild card with a different colour from mine and touched my guild card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Request number: RR1STL154, permanent request, content: Goblin subjugation. Total number of subjugation 12. Approved by the client ”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fulfilment of the request is now approved. This world is convenient in some parts, but it was originally a world of otome games with loose settings. So, it&#8217;s a loss, if you care about how things like this work.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next day, I went out to get rid of the goblins again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, one of the seven magic stones that I didn&#8217;t report yesterday was broken when I killed the goblin, and the remaining six were used to make bullets with 【Alchemy】.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using 【Concealment】 skill to approach the goblins from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, shoot at the vitals and stab the survivors to end them, after that take out the magic stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Burn the corpse to dispose of it and then the extermination is over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After doing this for about a week, I no longer see any goblins in the forest, around the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s about time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I decided to enter the Goblin Dungeon.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my waist is a 300,000 cents magic lantern that I bought in the guild for this day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a magic item that can be lit with magical power. I also brought the torch just in case, but it wasn&#8217;t easy to use, so I hastily bought it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be possible to make it if I do my best with 【Alchemy】, but I can&#8217;t make it because I can&#8217;t use fire magic. No, it may be possible if I do my best to research, but it seems to be difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it can be solved by using money, then I don&#8217;t want to waste my time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly proceed through the Goblin Dungeon, relying on the lights of the lanterns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t seem to be that messy, but the encounters are at least once every five minutes. Sometimes one, and sometimes about five of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I kept using the 【Concealment】 skill, but I couldn&#8217;t make a surprise attack well. Apparently, they don&#8217;t seem to notice me, but notice the light of the lantern, and approach with a confused face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s a surprise attack in the sense that I&#8217;m going to do it with Kalashi when they approach defenceless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I feel like an Atlantic football fish. (T/N: for reference, a family of deep-sea anglerfish.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I proceed without heeding the danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To stop my sister from pestering me I had to crazily play this shitty game, so I remember every detail about this game. And as per my memory, there are no gorgeous treasures here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Goblin Dungeon has a total of five floors. And at the lowest floor, the dungeon boss, Goblin Lord is there with his minions two Hob Goblins and two Goblin Mages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived in front of the boss room in no time. The number of magic stones I have obtained so far is well over 100.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took a breath, to calm my excitement, I pushed the big door of the boss room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gigigi, the door of the boss room opens, and when I went in, I saw the figures of the five monsters I expected to see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aim with Kalashi to shoot the goblin mages first. The first one to attack wins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan……*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The goblin mages become bloody and fall when I emptied the magazine on them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use 【Wind Magic】 to create a breeze and blow the sand made from 【Alchemy】 toward the bosses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the 【No Chant】 skill that I got from that pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter who I get it from, a skill is a skill. There is no sin in using the skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reload Kalashi when they lost sight of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, activate the 【Concealment】 skill and approach the Hobgoblins who are looking for me. I aim at their head from behind and pull the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan……*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shoot the bullets in their head from a distance of around 5 meters, then hide again using the smokescreen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that while changing the magazine, I get behind the Goblin Lord with the 【Concealment】 skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan……*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, shot in the head from a distance of around 5 meters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gaaaa&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite being bloody, the Goblin lord raised his sword and tried to hit me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, of the Lord type monster. Even in the game, it was not possible to defeat him with only firepower, so I had a hard time defeating him. However, I had expected this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the goblin magic stones I&#8217;ve collected so far, used 【Alchemy】 to create water balloons, and threw them at his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it lands on the Goblin Lord&#8217;s face, it bursts and a transparent sticky liquid adheres to his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gyaaaaaaa&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Goblin Lord holds his eyes while facing down. The contents were simple, it is a blinding sticky liquid in which pepper components are dissolved, that is, a liquid in which components that hurt the eyes are concentrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mercilessly shoot bullets into the Goblin Lord, who holds his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Dandandandandandandandandandandandan …… Click*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot it all. The Goblin Lord is lying on the ground, but it&#8217;s still moving. I was surprised to see that he was still alive even though I punctured him with holes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aim at the neck and activate the wind cutter with the 【Wind Magic】 skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw a slight scratch on the skin of his neck, I kept using the wind cutter in the same position. Thanks to the acquisition of 【No Chant】 and 【Multiple Chant】, the wind blades deepened the wound on his neck one after another, and finally, the head and torso were separated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, defeating the Goblin Lord was harder than I had imagined. In the game, there was a setting that if you throw pepper powder, he will be incapacitated with pain for a while. So I prepared it as insurance, and I was right for doing so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I didn&#8217;t do it, then I would have been dead by getting hit once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the equipment needs to be modified again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly dismantle the bodies to take out the magic stones. In particular, if I bring the Goblin Lord magic stone to the guild, I will be certified as this dungeon&#8217;s conqueror. This is considered an adventurer&#8217;s achievement, so I will submit it to the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this the Goblin Dungeon is clear, unfortunately, there is no treasure for clearing it. A long time ago, the dungeon had already been conquered, so the first one to conquer it had taken away the treasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This dungeon is unpopular not only because defeating goblins doesn&#8217;t make money well, but also because you can&#8217;t expect any treasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I move to the back of the boss room, a round sphere that glows black is floating in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the core of the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached out and touched the dungeon core with my right hand, I was surrounded by light, and the next moment I was standing at the entrance to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the sense of accomplishment of the dungeon capture, I returned to the Stresen village with a relaxed gait.</span></p>
