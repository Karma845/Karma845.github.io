<h3>Side &#8211; Anastasia (4)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the incident at the cultural festival, my relationship with His Highness has completely collapsed. His Highness does not speak to me, nor do I. If we pass each other, we only greet one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as His Highness hates me, I also no longer have any interest in him. Thereby, I&#8217;m not going to bother myself to warn that woman. I&#8217;ve strongly told my friends about this, so they&#8217;ll also endure from becoming unruly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When days like this were going on, one day, I was suddenly taken out of the classroom by His Highness. Apparently, that woman woke up this morning and found her pen burned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how they reason it, but it seems they blame me for this crime. There is a servant in my room who can confirm my schedule, but His Highness doesn&#8217;t even want to listen to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this how His Highness will be when he takes the crown in the future?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia! Give up already. What are you thinking about harassing the kind-hearted Amy by burning her pen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness, I didn&#8217;t do that, and I have told my friends not to do this kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But considering the situation, there can be no one other than you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Miss Anastasia. No matter how cute Amy is, being jealous is ugly, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that not only His Highness but also Prince Claude has become a fool. To what extent does that woman want to corrupt the men?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed loudly. Then that woman stared at me from behind His Highnesses and grinned to provoke me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, so that&#8217;s what it is, really worthless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be told such a thing without evidence. So, excuse me, the lessons will start soon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed and then turned to go to the classroom, but Leonardo grabbed my wrist and stopped my steps by force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait. The talk isn&#8217;t over.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leonardo von Jukes, I didn&#8217;t allow you to touch me. You, a Viscount&#8217;s son, dare to touch me, a Duke&#8217;s daughter, without permission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! If you plead guilty, I&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that a threat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s bad that you don&#8217;t plead guilty. There can be no one other than you, who did this to harass Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the conclusion that I did it was first, and it seems every wrongdoing is pardoned because of that conclusion. There will be various problems if a man like him joins the Knights and becomes the Knight Captain in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was just this man alone, I could have handled it. But to be surrounded by so many people and being treated like this by someone superior in both size and strength is still terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it would be better for my father to take care of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, Allen approached while making loud footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me for disturbing you while you were conversing! Itâ€™s almost time for the class to start!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen knelt saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tch, enough. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of Allen&#8217;s words, His Highnesses &amp; Co. returned to the classroom steadily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I get helped? Does that mean that time too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you &#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, it&#8217;s time, the class will start.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Allen interrupted my words and quickly returned to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was beating fast, probably because of the horror I went through. So for a few moments, I stood there in a daze.</span></p>
