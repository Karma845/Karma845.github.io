<h3>Chapter 21 - Villager A does filial piety.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-boy, aren&#8217;t you amazing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I submitted the Goblin Lord magic stone to master and had him buy it. With this, my guild card will have a record of conquering the Goblin Dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came back to Lurden from Stresen village with a carriage and directly went to the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also you&#8217;ve defeated a total of 138 goblins. With this, Stresen&#8217;s goblin problem seems to be okay for the time being. Well done, Allen-boy!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master said that while patting my head roughly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, the permanent request to exterminate the goblins in Stresen village was withdrawn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, my guild card now looks like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Allen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rank: E</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age: 12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessing:〖Wind God〗</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Skills: 【Concealment】【Appraisal】【Alchemy】【Wind Magic】【Multiple Chant】</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Place of residence: Lurden</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Possession: 5,519,416</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Level: 6</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strength: E</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magical power: D</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Achievements: Goblin Dungeon Conqueror</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The level has reached 6. Obtained the subjugation reward of 200,000 cents. The Goblin Dungeon conquering reward, or rather the real profit was on the sale of the Lord&#8217;s magic stone of about 500,000 cents, is also obtained. (T/N: what the! he just soloed a dungeon while being lvl 1.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next strategy is to raise the level by high-speed laps in the Goblin Dungeon. I would like to raise the level so that I can challenge the next dungeon, but when it comes to high-speed laps, I want a weapon that can defeat the Goblin Lord in one shot. Otherwise, it will be difficult to conquer the Orc Dungeon, which I planned for the next one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I will be researching and developing new guns for a while, for that, I would like to change my house. I can&#8217;t sleep in the same room with my mother in a small one-room house forever, can I? Moreover, I also need a warehouse to store supplies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to move to an apartment of about 2 LDK or 3 LDK and give my mother a better life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I went home after completing the guild procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mom, I&#8217;m home&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen. Welcome back. Did you get hurt?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I came back after conquering the Goblin Dungeon. How were you mother?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, your mom is always fine. Also Martina-san from next door &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s nothing but an everyday parent-child conversation, which makes me feel warmer than anything else. As expected, I can&#8217;t let destiny take away my important mother from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, mom. I&#8217;m starting to make a lot of money, so why not move to a large apartment together?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bring out the main subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, You can still live in this house, right? And spend the money you earn yourself. You don&#8217;t have to spend it to look after your mother.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I thought she would say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not the case. Me being an adventurer requires me to have a lot of luggage, but I can&#8217;t put too much here. Also if I live separately, then it will be a waste of money. That&#8217;s why I want to move and would be happy if mom also comes with me. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mother looks at me and thinks for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Also, I often leave my house for requests and all. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if mother lived with me and take care of the things &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A soft touch wraps me when I became all jittery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tightly hug her, still, she embraces me kindly</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Stupid. you don&#8217;t have to say so much, your mother knows well, doing what will make Allen happy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always I end up getting consoled. It always fills my heart with warm feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m off tomorrow, so why don&#8217;t we look for a new house together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yup!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded obediently to my mother&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, that&#8217;s why you came to the guild with your mom.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master looked at me with an astound face and said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m indebted for always taking care of my son. Is he doing well? Is he inconveniencing everyone?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. Allen is doing his best. Umm &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen&#8217;s mother, Katerina. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m the receptionist, who taught Allen-boy swordsmanship, it&#8217;s Rudolph. Nice to meet you. Allen-boy is the newcomer whom the guild has lots of expectations. He has a good track record, and above all, he has the guts to continue to keep up with it almost every day for 4 years. There are many people who care about him, so if he goes up to D rank, there will be many people who will invite him to the party. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you so much for always helping him&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, right? talking about parties, If you put an E rank in the party, he/she will be disliked because the requests you can receive will be limited, but if he/she were to be of D rank, then there will be no limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;m getting better, but I also have a plan of fate destruction. What should I do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, well, I will think about it when my rank will rise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I think about it now, it&#8217;ll be of no help, so I&#8217;ll return to the main subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why, master. I want you to introduce us to a good property.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As I told, Allen-boy. The guild isn&#8217;t a place to look for real estate. Though I can introduce you to a property, it&#8217;s for adventurers. It&#8217;s in an unsafe place, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s suitable for ordinary people like Katerina-san to live in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, please introduce us to a real estate agent!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. Today Allen-boy is eating more than usual. If that&#8217;s the case &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Allen-kun, are you moving?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monica-san called from the side. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be working hours yet, because she is wearing plain clothes. Won&#8217;t she suddenly hug me today?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Monica-san. I&#8217;m starting to make a little money, so I thought I&#8217;d move to a slightly larger room with my mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That’s great. Then, why don&#8217;t you come to our place?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen-kun? What did you imagine?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Monica-san licks her lips bewitchingly. An ordinary person would be surprised at the gesture, but, to me, it looks like an illusion of a snake sticking out its tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, no, no&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she saw I was having a hard time answering her, she changed the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My dad runs an apartment, so I can introduce you to a house that is right for Allen-kun to live with his family, you know? Oh, Allen-kun&#8217;s mom, I&#8217;m Monica, I work as a waitress here. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Katerina. Thank you for always looking after my Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though late, They exchange greetings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. If it&#8217;s Monica-san&#8217;s place, then it will be safe. But isn&#8217;t it a little expensive?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If it&#8217;s Allen-kun, how about 100,000/month? Well, look at it before deciding.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is 100,000 a little expensive? No, even in that battered apartment, it would cost about 60,000 to 70,000, probably. Isn&#8217;t it a bargain?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go and see it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, it&#8217;s decided!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I decided to go and see Monica-san&#8217;s father&#8217;s apartment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We start walking behind Monica-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after walking toward the center of town for about 5 minutes, Monica-san stopped before a magnificent stone building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here. Only the rooms on the 4th and top floors are vacant. It&#8217;s not very popular because it&#8217;s difficult to climb up and down.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying so, Monica-san unlocks the common entrance and climbs the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, we were staying on the 5th floor. So it can be said that the 4th floor will be a little easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here, this room.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door and went in, I found a 3 LDK apartment occupied with a kitchen, a toilet and even a bath space. It seems difficult to pump water, but a faucet is there. What does it mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a shared wall in the courtyard. Also, as you can see, there are magic tools for using water. Here, put a water magic stone in the outlet next to the kitchen. Now, If you twist the faucet, water will come out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing. Were there such devices too?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also, this is a magical tool for light. This will shine if you put a magic stone filled with magical power here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, Monica-san put a magic stone-like thing in it and the ceiling lit up white. It&#8217;s like the fluorescent light on the ceiling of the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Monica-san. Such a good room for only 100,000 is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Katerina-san, it&#8217;s okay. Allen-kun is a promising adventurer with a good future. I think it&#8217;s worth the investment.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The street, viewable from the window, is not as big as the main street, but there is some traffic, and it is kept clean. In that case, there seems to be no security problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Monica-san. Thank you. I will take it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! to those you are indebted to &#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Katerina-san. That&#8217;s fine. When Allen becomes even better, I&#8217;ll get it back from him!&#8221; (T/N:- she is talking about favour)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Monica-san &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, our selection of a new house was completed after visiting the first one.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, is it over?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, master. I have decided to accept Monica-san&#8217;s favour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so. Good for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monica-san next to me winked when I looked at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the feckless senior adventurers, who drinks at the guild&#8217;s bar since morning, calls out after hearing master&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s good? Allen-boy?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how many feckless seniors there are cause there are too many. But I remember his name properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Jerad senpai. I&#8217;m moving with my mother.&#8221; (T/N:- senpai=senior)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, did our little Allen-boy finally become so good?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m still small though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master says, interrupting us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So when are you moving?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, it seems that I can move anytime, so I will take some time to sort out and then gradually move in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What, do it quickly. Hey, all of you, our Allen boy is moving with his mom. Let&#8217;s help him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, I&#8217;m not good at it. Also, requests are there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh. Allen-boy&#8217;s home is a hundred times more important than the requests. I&#8217;m worried about it. You should just shut up and come with us.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is cool even though he is a feckless senior. I&#8217;m so grateful that tears might come out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you&#8217;re blessed with such wonderful seniors. Listen, you should take good care of these people. Senior adventurers, I&#8217;m Allen&#8217;s mother, Katerina. Thank you, everyone, for always supporting and looking after Allen. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m Jerad. Well, don&#8217;t worry. For every one of us in this guild, Allen-boy is like our own kid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. I don&#8217;t know if I will ever be able to repay this gratitude. Can I ask for help?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to thank us. There is no such modest guy in this guild. All right! You guys, we got permission from Allen-boy&#8217;s mother. It&#8217;s time for celebration!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, for some reason, all the feckless seniors who hang out in the guild got ready to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A total of about 30 rough people carried the furniture and tools out of the rundown apartment and one after another walked towards the new home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of the adventurers is what I thought. I pull a cart to carry my luggage, but what&#8217;s with this seniors?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, my mother is organizing the things brought in at the new house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the relocation was over, everyone came to the guild tavern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Adventurers, thank you for your help today. Also, thank you for always taking care of my Allen. Thanks to everyone, We were able to move to our new house safely. I know Allen may cause inconvenience to you all in future, so I would appreciate your generous guidance. With this, I wish you all the best of luck and happiness, Kanpai!&#8221; (T/N:- Kanpai=cheers)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The banquet begins with the toast from my mother. For some reason, the seniors are looking at me with a reliable look. I moved to a nice house. Even if only a little, life here has become better. For these little changes, I will do my best so that we can enjoy an even better life. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, not just my mother. Master, Monica-san, and the adventure seniors, I want to protect this future where everyone is laughing and living.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this also, I have to do something about that fate. I renewed my determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen-boy. Your mother is beautiful. Hey&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master! Don&#8217;t try to make advances on your disciple&#8217;s mother.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take it back! Master is excluded!</span></p>
