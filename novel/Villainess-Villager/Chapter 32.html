<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; Villager A Stops the Villainess.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, autumn has come. Speaking of autumn, it&#8217;s the season for cultural festivals. You may be wondering why there is a cultural festival in such a world. Well, it&#8217;s a Japanese otome game. So, there will obviously be a cultural festival in this school as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, it was an event in which Amy collaborated to organise an exhibition while working with the capture target. This time it looks like the reverse harem route, so it seems that all the capture targets, Amy and the villainess will be exhibiting something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, at this cultural festival, you can do anything within the bounds of common sense. Also, it seems that it has nothing to do with one&#8217;s grades. However, participation is mandatory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the independent research gave a huge toll on my spirit and the event that I want to stop at this cultural festival happens in the corridor, so there is no need for me to get involved with Amy&#8217;s group this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, after something like that, even Anastasia probably wouldn&#8217;t ask for my help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking so, I decided to do an Orc meat skewer stall by myself and completed the necessary procedures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m an adventurer. So, hunting an Orc and doing a dismantling show would be fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about that, Anastasia called me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, what is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Have you decided what you will do at the cultural festival? If not, why don&#8217;t you help His Highness again?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wow, really? We hadn&#8217;t talked much since then, so I thought I wouldn&#8217;t get asked anymore, but this was surprising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Actually, I have already submitted an application for an Orc meat skewer stall.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Is that so? I&#8217;m looking forward to it. Good luck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bow to say that, but the expression, which usually stays frozen, seems to be a little downhearted. Somehow I feel guilty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, but if it&#8217;s absolutely necessary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll go eat it because it&#8217;s a big deal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia then turned back and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, but Amy is also suspicious, so it may be better to keep an eye on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking so, I decided to act to stop the worst.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today is three days before the cultural festival, and I have infiltrated the workroom of Anastasia&#8217;s group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems the Crown Prince &amp; Co. decided to do an exhibit about the downtown culture of this country. In short, it looks like they have created a place where Amy can play an active role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, just like in the game, the Crown Prince &amp; Co. are making the exhibition in a group, but no matter how you look at it, Anastasia is just moving around. It seems that Amy and the capture targets have decided everything entirely. Anastasia was not given the right to choose and was told to manage the booth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much I have to be there for the future&#8217;s sake, even I&#8217;ll get sick, I think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And recently, when there are no capture targets, where Amy and Anastasia are alone, Amy becomes sarcastic. Even now, she started her sarcasm again without noticing that I was watching them with </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, you are still here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s not cute like that, you&#8217;re not loved by Karl-sama, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Our engagement is not like that. It&#8217;s for the country.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was good that I was watching it. Apparently, the event started in an unexpected place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? But that kind of Karl-sama looks cute, don&#8217;t you know? I&#8217;m sure, Karl-sama and the citizens understand that a cute queen is more good, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, it felt like the air in this room had cooled. Even though the air was cold, it wasn&#8217;t like the weather changed. The air itself was physically cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As evidence, cold air is visibly swirling around Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? What&#8217;s wrong? It&#8217;s no good. Look, the future Queen is smiling.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Amy posed with a smile and shook her neck as if to incite Anastasia. Her hands were squeezed and only the index fingers were raised such that the fingertips were placed on her left and right cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was doing the so-called cheek and finger flirty pose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it was scary how Amy&#8217;s face was smiling, yet her eyes weren&#8217;t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, are you insulting me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Noo, Anastasia-sama, you&#8217;re scaring me.&#8221; (T/N:- Imagine it as if doing it to anger someone.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was getting frustrated while watching from the side. Anastasia, who is not yelling at her from this, is great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the conversation in the game was more flowery. It was not a terrible conversation like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No doubt, she is trying to anger Anastasia to raise her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a pity that I can&#8217;t record this because I don&#8217;t have a smartphone, so I keep watching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia sighs loudly and begins her sermon, which I don&#8217;t know how many times she had told her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Listen, this country has a social status system. It can&#8217;t be overturned even by the students of the same school. So behave yourself.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Amy argues without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s strange because Anastasia-sama and I are both humans. Everyone is equal before God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s the story before God. I&#8217;m just telling you to behave according to your status. To begin with, what do you think you are? Cuddling with men who have fiancées. Don&#8217;t do anything that will mislead others!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Anastasia&#8217;s patience was running out as her voice gradually became louder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not the case, I and Karl-sama are friends. Also, Marx, Leo, Oscar, and Claude are all-important friends. Don&#8217;t blame my friends!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s weird. Choose a man without a fiancée!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll not let an outsider like Anastasia-sama interfere with our friendship!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the air got colder, the capture targets rushed in after hearing the noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Anastasia. What the hell are you doing? Weren&#8217;t you both preparing things? Didn&#8217;t I warn you not to quarrel? Can&#8217;t you do that even though you usually say things while making yourself look great?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness! That&#8217;s, this woman!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama. I only wanted to get along well, but Anastasia-sama was rude to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Amy&#8217;s messed up explanation, Anastasia tried to protest, but the Crown Prince yells at Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! Shut your impudent mouth now! It&#8217;s an order!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu~tsu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The relationship between me and you is when we are outside. Don&#8217;t bring that relationship to the school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Under&#8230;stood……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia then resumed her work with a frozen expression.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, in the evening, the capture targets went out of the room with Amy. Anastasia, who had been working for a while with a frozen look, left the room with all her belongings. Perhaps she was going to take a break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sneak out after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as I walked down the hallway for a while, I saw Amy standing with her back against the wall. There she smiled and said, provoking Anastasia when she passed in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What a klutz. How do you feel about your fiancée getting robbed?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia&#8217;s eyes opened wide when she heard those words. Then, with her face bright red, she raised her right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fue~cushion&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I sneezed as loud as I could after undoing my concealment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Astonished Anastasia, stopped in her posture without swinging her right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Oh? Anastasia-sama? And Amy-sama also? Ah, maybe you were talking? Excuse me!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, I ran away from the place in a rush as if I happened to be there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped Anastasia&#8217;s actions with a perfect performance that I think is Oscar-worthy. I got out of the sight in the shadows and activated </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> again, then returned secretly and resumed monitoring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems useless to say anything to you, but remember. Your Highness is the future king of this country. You who do not understand the role of the royal family and the aristocrats are not suitable for him. Don&#8217;t approach His Highness. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia said so with a frozen look and left without hitting Amy&#8217;s cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Amy, left on that spot, regretfully glares at her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is the meaning of this? That mob called Allen shouldn&#8217;t even appear in extra mode?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While muttering to herself, Amy also left the place. And shortly after that, the Prince &amp; Co. chased after Amy and passed in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what is an extra mode? Does that mean there was a mode I didn&#8217;t play?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no such information even on the Wiki&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content was quite different, but this was the event I was trying to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, Anastasia, who was furious, slapped Amy&#8217;s cheek, and surprised by that, Amy crouches down and begins to cry. Then, the Crown Prince and the route&#8217;s capture targets appear and unilaterally blame Anastasia. And the relationship between Anastasia and the Crown Prince shatters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it looks like it&#8217;s already collapsed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I removed my concealment when I couldn&#8217;t see anyone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, there is one thing that is clear about this time. As expected, Amy is the same as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can say it definitely this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, a woman who has played that game has reincarnated as Amy and is trying to follow the game scenarios to capture the reverse harem route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that&#8217;s it. As a woman, it may be a dream-like situation to get surrounded by handsome men. If I had reincarnated as the main character of a gal game, I might have aimed for the Harem route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t like it!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the destruction of the capital city that is waiting for Amy if she proceeds with the capture targets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not the world of that game, but the reality in which mother, master, senior adventurers, Monica-san and all the people who took care of me are living.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll do it thoroughly.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I renewed my determination.</span></p>
