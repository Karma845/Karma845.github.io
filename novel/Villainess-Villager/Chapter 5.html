<h3>Chapter 5 - Villager A Engages in Item Trading.</h3>

<p>It’s been around two weeks since I stole the scroll from the ruins. Like usual, I came to the guild today to do some more sewer cleaning, but there was definitely more activity in the guild today compared to usual.</p><p>“Uncle, what’s going on?” I asked the old man at the reception desk.</p><p>“Oh, why if it isn’t Allen.” He said “Apparently they found a goblin’s nest in the ruins northeast of here.”</p><p>Oh huh, it seems like they already found the goblins.</p><p>“You see; goblins are a species that rapidly increases in numbers. So if we left them alone, they’d start to cause bigger problems, so the guild decided to form a subjugation party. And if we found the goblin’s hoard, we’d also make a decent profit.</p><p>‘Was that why there were no goblins in the game?’ Maybe in the game’s scenario, the scroll was the only thing left unfound, so Amy got it many years later.</p><p>“Well, it’s still a bit too early for you to join, kid.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know.”</p><p>Anyway, that place didn’t concern me anymore. I was more than satisfied with getting the【Appraisal】skill.</p><p>Speaking of which, I also hid the【Appraisal】skill since it would be really suspicious if the number of skills on an 8-year-old’s guild card suddenly increased.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-572110350"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1153561082"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>Now, for my next goal, I needed money. Specifically, I needed to make 15 million cents.</p><p>‘Why does he need that much money?’ you might ask. Well, to enlighten you, it’s so I could buy another extremely broken skill called using the『Scroll of Alchemy』. This thing was completely broken, but as for explaining why&#8230; I’ll leave that for another day.</p><p>To begin with,『Scroll of Alchemy』is a so-called premium item that can only be bought by paying for it, and can be bought at a suspicious store called the Lurden Store. By the way, this shop was where you bought premium items in the game. You can buy all types premium items, from the『Scroll of Alchemy』to magic stones, at this store.</p><p>And the『Scroll of Alchemy』was priced at an amazing 13 million cents! The price changed depending on how far you were into the game, but the highest price I paid was 15 million cents.</p><p>I just couldn’t beat the reverse harem route, so I gave up and cried rivers of blood as I said goodbye to my beloved ¥10,000 friends to exchange for cents so I could get something more important! CG Pictures of&#8230; pretty&#8230; boys.</p><p>No&#8230; I’m remembering it again. *hic*</p><p>Well, anyway, the key to my plan is this【Alchemy】skill. Using this cheat skill, I could overcome the future scenario.</p><p>In order to do that, the first thing I need is money. I have to get more and more money!</p><p>After finishing the guild chores in the morning, I changed into the best clothes I could find and went to the area where the traveling merchants set up their stalls.</p><p>In the game, this district is where you came to date your favorite character, and if you raised a flag, you&#8217;d get an exotic accessory or something as a gift, but today I&#8217;m not looking for accessories or dates, I&#8217;m looking for bargains.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-824743986"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-513620699"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>Right now I only have a little over 5,000 cents in my pocket, but I&#8217;m looking for a something cheap that I can buy with this.</p><p>I didn’t have any magic stones yet, so it&#8217;s not the completely overpowered【Appraise】skill, but it was still great to be able to figure out exactly what I saw and how much it was worth.</p><p>I took a quick look at the cheap accessory shops.</p><p>Some accessories were selling for as little as 1,000 cents!</p><p>And then my eye was caught by a pair of dirty earrings in the 2,000 cent section.</p><p>【Appraisal】</p><p>──</p><p>Name: Earrings of Strength</p><p>Effect: The power of the wearer of these earrings is increased slightly.</p><p>Grade: Rare</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-509358152"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-405598046"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>Price: 300,000 cents</p><p>──</p><p>“Uncle, these earrings&#8230;”</p><p>“Oh those ones? Yeah, those won’t do, there’s only one of them after all. You’ve got to give a girl a proper one or else she’ll hate you, okay?”</p><p>“O-oh. No, I’m just asking about the earing”</p><p>‘I mean, in the first place, I’m just 8 dude. What are you expecting me to do?’</p><p>“Oh, so that’s what you wanted. This was sold by the wife of a merchant I used to do business with to get out of debt. Well, rather than that, tell me more about the girl you’re giving these earrings to.”</p><p>“That’s not what this is for, but I’d like these earrings please.</p><p>“Huh? Okay, sure! That’ll be 2,000 cents.”</p><p>“Can I pay using the guild card?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-49142737"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-636030468"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“No problem!”</p><p>I touch my guild card with his.</p><p>『 You will pay 2,000 cents. Is that correct? 』</p><p>A screen suddenly appeared in front of me, and I touched ‘Yes’. That completes the payment.</p><p>I got a really good deal out of that. I’d be satisfied if I could sell this thing for even half its price. I could probably do that if I sold it to some adventurer or shop that specializes in selling to them.</p><p>While looking for more bargains, I came across a tattered and dirty glove for 1,000 cents.</p><p>【Appraisal】</p><p>──</p><p>Name: Fireproof Gloves</p><p>Description: Magical powers protect the wearer from flames. It is very hard to burn.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-850356788"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-469061296"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Grade: Rare</p><p>Price: 70,000 cents</p><p>Note: Soiled, but washable.</p><p>──</p><p>‘I see. So if I washed them, would the price increase?’</p><p>&#8220;Mister, I&#8217;ll take these gloves, please.”</p><p>“Sure! Will you be using them?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>I paid him 1,000 cents from my guild card.</p><p>Not even 30 minutes have passed, but I’ve already gotten some really good stuff</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-343725126"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-757243291"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>With a little over 2,000 cents, I went back home.</p><p>When I got home, I washed the dirty gloves in the communal washroom. While I was there, I also did the laundry since it was still early in the day and the sun was still high.</p><p>After around two hours of washing the dirty gloves and laundry, I hung them out to dry by the window. The dirt on the gloves was more stubborn than I thought so it was a pain to wash them, but with this weather they’d be clean and dry by evening</p><p>And with the stubborn stains removed, the value of the fireproof gloves had risen to 100,000 cents.</p><p>* * * * *.</p><p>The next day, after finishing school, I came to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild with the goods I bought yesterday.</p><p>&#8221;Old man,&#8221;</p><p>“Hey, kid. So what will it be today? More chores?”</p><p>“Well, yeah, but that’s not all I came here for. I got some stuff I want to sell, could you check them out?”</p><p>“Oho. Well, let’s see them.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2012178106"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1563794139"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>I decided to talk to the usual old man at the reception desk about it. This old man was actually a former adventurer who got injured and retired to become an employee of the guild. It was a bit late now, but apparently his name was Rudolph.</p><p>Apparently I had started getting attention as the only kid who kept cleaning the ditches and sewers. The other kids couldn’t stand the smelly, disgusting, and difficult job so they quickly gave up.</p><p>‘Yep. The job kinda sucks. I know how you guys felt’</p><p>But that’s why I think the receptionist old man and the other older guild members who like me so much, since I had the guts to keep doing it, won’t take advantage of me.</p><p>&#8221;I want to sell this『Earring of Power』and 『Gloves of Fire-Protection』”</p><p>“What? Where did you get such a treasure?”</p><p>“I bought it at the market for 3,000 cents.”</p><p>Hearing this, the old man looks at me with a slightly pitying look.</p><p>“Oh. I hope it&#8217;s not a fake. Let me see.”</p><p>That was definitely a normal reaction. Even I’d feel suspicious if I heard that story.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-646231311"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-205900116"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>I handed him the items.</p><p>And at that moment, the old man&#8217;s expression changed.</p><p>&#8220;Hey kid, I&#8217;m going to go into the back to examine this in more detail so just wait a bit here.”</p><p>The old man ran to the back room of the counter with the items.</p><p>I could hear the old man and someone else talking in the back room. Every now and then, you can hear a surprised voice saying, &#8220;What!?”</p><p>And after a while, the old man came back.</p><p>“Kid, if you just sell this in the streets, there’s a possibility that dangerous people would come and target you. Would you mind selling it to the guild at a fair price?”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>“Then, we’ll buy the earrings for 250,000 and the gloves for 60,000 for a total of 310,000 cents. They glove are in slightly bad condition. If they were good as new, you could sell them for 500,000. Sorry, about that.</p><p>“No, that’s fine. I’ve never seen so much money in my life before.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-572505403"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1699657096"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>For now, it would be best to agree. We could still get a lot more money in the future, so let’s take a loss to day to turn a profit tomorrow.</p><p>“Okay, then I&#8217;ll transfer the money to your guild card.”</p><p>Then the old man processed the transaction.</p><p>“Listen here, you just got lucky this time. If you get carried away, you’ll get scammed or even worse, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>This old man is really kind.</p><p>After this, I cleaned the ditches for the guild and went home.</p><p>─────────────────────────</p><p><strong>〇</strong><strong>About the grade of the items</strong></p><p>Legendary: Mythical and Legendary Valuables.</p>
