<h3>Chapter 10 - Villager A Meets Someone Unreliable in the Valley of the Flying Dragon.</h3>

<p>I exit the carriage and take a look at my surroundings. I had finally arrived at Frissen, the village closest to the Valley of the Flying Dragons. This place was, ironically, not inhabited by dragons, but by wyverns.</p><p>To be precise, wyverns aren&#8217;t dragons, but they look the part, which is why they called it the Valley of the Flying Dragons anyway.</p><p>And the reason I came here was, of course, to get to the Temple of the Wind and obtain the『Book of the Wind God』that was supposed to be enshrined there.</p><p>And the strategy was also, of course, to use【Concealment】and sneak in as usual. This is what they call &#8216;simple is best&#8217;.</p><p>&#8216;I mean hey, it&#8217;s worked so far.&#8217;</p><p>In the game, you could come here in the summer of your sophomore year to try and beat it. But I distinctly remember that the difficulty here was incredibly high, and that some of the events were clearly in bad taste.</p><p>The event went like this: First you&#8217;d have to enter the valley and kill over 100 wyverns, and then you&#8217;d have to defeat the black wyvern lord that lead them to get to the entrance of the temple.</p><p>After a quick dialogue segment, you&#8217;d enter the temple where you&#8217;d find the wyvern lord&#8217;s nest.</p><p>In the nest, there was a white wyvern lord with a ribbon around its tail and their children. Then it gets revealed that they were the wife and children of the wyvern lord that you had just beaten, and so they come at you furious that you just killed their husband and father.</p><p>Amy tried to persuade them, but naturally, she fails and it then goes to the battle segment. After defeating the white wyvern lord and their children, she finally gets the『Book of the Wind God』</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1589611666"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-730435913"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>Amy does regret the fact that she couldn&#8217;t persuade the white wyvern lord, but as she&#8217;s doing this, the dude you were aiming to date then comforts her and they share a moment together and increase their affection.</p><p>To be honest, considering they just broke into the black wyvern lord&#8217;s nest, killed him and his family, and stole their stuff, I think it was just a complete robbery. And even in the real world, while I was looking at some forums about this, I don&#8217;t think I was the only one who thought Amy&#8217;s persuasion was hollow and insincere.</p><p>Now, game aside, I set off with a week&#8217;s worth of food. It&#8217;s two days to go one way from Frissen to the Valley of the Flying Dragon by mountain road, but I decided to take a little extra just in case. But if I couldn&#8217;t reach the valley in two days, I decided to turn back.</p><p>There wasn&#8217;t any reason for me to push myself yet.</p><p>So I used【Concealment】as usual to continue on the mountain path. It&#8217;s not just the familiar horned rabbits in the royal capital, but also ferocious demons such as Big Boa, Blood Deer and Great Bear.</p><p>I&#8217;m kind of curious about them, but I want to avoid unnecessary battles. Aiming for the mountain where I was headed, I proceeded carefully so as to not suddenly cut off【Concealment】.</p><p>And in the evening of the second day after leaving Frissen, I arrived at the Valley of the Flying Dragon.</p><p>Indeed, it was a sight to behold. There were huge winged lizards in the sky. If I saw them without any prior knowledge, I&#8217;d definitely think they were dragons, too. But in reality, they were a sub-dragon species that weren&#8217;t as strong as true dragons. The difference between a dragon species and a sub-dragon species is simple: a dragon species has a breath and roar attack, while a sub-dragon species does not. I&#8217;ve heard that the difference between having a long range breath attack and a roar that grants a substantial debuff, was quite large, and the difficulty of defeating them is was completely different.</p><p>Well, since it was already getting dark, I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to enter the valley today and camped in the valley. And even in this camp, the 【Alchemy】 skill is playing a big role.</p><p>In the game, it&#8217;s mainly used to make weapons and armor, potions, and to strengthen weapons using magic stones. However, towards the end of the game, you were able to use it as an overpowered skill to build carriages and huge forts. You were even be able to make a magical tool to temporarily weaken Anastasia, who had fallen into darkness as the final boss of the game.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1491580869"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-679228863">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>Now, the ability to build huge forts means that it&#8217;s easy to build small, half-basement campsites. We can dig down into the ground in the shade of the trees to avoid disturbing the wyverns and make a ceiling with dirt.</p><p>All we had to do was drill a hole in the ground to prevent myself from suffocating, make a place for the fire, build a chimney to let the smoke and carbon dioxide escape, and we were done.</p><p>This way, I wouldn&#8217;t be attacked so easily because I dug a hole and almost completely burried it.</p><p>Well then, I was alone, but good night anyway.</p><p>******</p><p>The next morning, after dismantling the encampment after making sure there was nothing around, I headed towards the Temple of the Wind.</p><p>Of course, I used my【Concealment】skill and brazenly walked in.</p><p>For some reason, there was a single path that conveniently went down to the bottom of the cliff, and so I just went down it. In the game, the wyverns incessantly attacked me and held me down, but fortunately, there wasn&#8217;t a single wyvern that noticed me.</p><p>After 30 minutes of descending to the bottom of the valley, we climbed the stairs to the Temple of the Wind. And when I reached the top of the stairs, I found a plaza where a black wyvern lord was curled up in the sun.</p><p>He seemed to be sleeping very comfortably, so I slipped in carefully so as to not wake him up and stepped into the temple.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-895925996"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1676598882"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>Hm? There wasn&#8217;t a white wyvern lord?</p><p>Come to think of it, he had kids in the game, so maybe he wasn&#8217;t married yet.</p><p>Although I was quite curious as to how he found his wife, what mattered more was my safety, so this worked out in my favor.</p><p>And so I continued onwards up to the altar where the Book of the Wind God was supposed to be enshrined in.</p><p>I walked a bit further but&#8230;</p><p>&#8216;What..?&#8217;</p><p>The book wasn&#8217;t here.</p><p>It&#8217;s just like the time with the goblins. Was there an event that hadn&#8217;t occured yet?</p><p>While I was starting to panic, I felt a light tap on my shoulder.</p><p>&#8220;Hey, human. You got a minute?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-112904944"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1518119338"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>&#8216;Huh?&#8217; Bewildered, I looked around to try and see anyone else in the room.</p><p>&#8220;No, no. I&#8217;m talking to you. Even if you covered yourself up with【Concealment】, I can still see you.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p><p>In my shock, I accidentally deactivated【Concealment】. But when I hurriedly tried to cast it again, someone stopped me.</p><p>&#8221;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s safe here.&#8221;</p><p>And that&#8217;s when I saw him. Standing beneath a halo of sunlight, before the altar, stood a stunningly handsome man with green hair and golden eyes.</p><p>&#8220;I am the God of the Wind and I have a little favor to ask.&#8221;</p><p>A man who called himself a god had appeared, but there&#8217;s no doubt that he has form divine power judging by the way he appeared and the how he discovered the【Concealment】skill. If I didn&#8217;t do as he wanted, he might kill me&#8230; As long as I couldn&#8217;t use【Concealment】I had no hope of escape&#8230; What do I do?</p><p>&#8220;No, no, I won&#8217;t go that far. If you don&#8217;t listen, you just won&#8217;t get what you want.&#8221;</p><p>Huh? Could it be that he can read minds?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1612780228"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2071448407"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m a god. I can at least read human minds, and the skills humans use are just as ineffective.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;O-okay, God. What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Good. But first we have to wake up that damn lizard sleeping in front of the temple.&#8221;<br /> ・<br /> ・<br /> ・<br /> &#8220;Whaaaa&#8211; wait a minute, God. If you do that&#8211;&#8221;</p><p>&#8216;The wyvern would definitely kill me.&#8217; I tried to stop him, but it was too late.</p><p>The god who ran with tremendous momentum hit the wyvern lord with a good punch.</p><p>With a comedic sounding &#8216;whoosh&#8217; like the ones you could hear in cartoons, the wyvern lord was sent flying and crashed into a cliff on the far side of the valley. With his head stuck in the cliff, his body dangled lifelessly.</p><p>&#8216;Huh? Was that really okay? Didn&#8217;t he just die?&#8217;</p><p>With that thought in mind, the god flew up to the wyvern lord, pulled its tail, and dragged it back to the plaza in front of the temple.</p><p>It was a really surreal sight, seeing a flying man drag a lifeless dragon-looking thing across the sky.</p><p>What a fearsome god. Should I pray to him or something?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-285341653"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-153056640"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>&#8221;Um, God, what in the world are you&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, I just needed a little bit of help with this kid. Come on now, introduce yourself.&#8221;</p><p>After being told that, the Wyvern Road reluctantly turned its head towards me.</p><p>Thank goodness. The wyvern lord seemed to be alive and well.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m.. uh. uh, well, uh. I-I&#8217;m&#8230; my name is, uh, Je-Jerome. The, uh, uh, wyvern lord&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>His voice kept getting quieter and quieter until I could barely hear what he was saying at the end.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Allen. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</p><p>For now, I held out my right hand. Then the Wyvern Road, whose name is Jerome, ran behind god in a flash.</p><p>Well&#8230; I mean, he tried to. I could still see him plain as day.</p><p>&#8220;Come on, shake his hand. Where are your manners?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-162656933"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1349365183"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>After he was told that, he shakily lifted his right leg up to me, but as expected, they were way too big. So I gripped the very end of his fingernails and tried to move them up and down lightly.</p><p>&#8220;Nice to meet you.&#8221;</p><p>When I said that, as if his previous shy self was a lie, a smile bloomed on his face and his tail started shaking around.</p><p>What are you&#8230; a dog..?</p>
