<h3>Side &#8211; Anastasia (3)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was eventually banished from His Highness&#8217;s group on the night before the cultural festival. The reason was that I bullied that woman. But I definitely didn&#8217;t do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Margaret &amp; Co. had formed a separate group, so I managed to get things done by joining them. But with this, I am not going to get myself involved with His Highness anymore at school events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was even thinking about the future of the country so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sigh, it is a shame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the day of the cultural festival, I invited Margaret to go to Allen&#8217;s stall. When we reached it, we saw an Orc hanging in front of his stall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that he went out somewhere in the name of shopping from the day before, but I am surprised that he really caught one whole Orc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Goblins are still manageable, but orcs are usually deadly. Hardly any students in this school can hunt an Orc, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you have started already. Can I have one skewer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say so, I introduce Margaret to Allen. Apparently, he obtained this Orc from an adventurer and will hold a dismantling show after this. Moreover, he seems to have good quality Orc meat besides this Orc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Allen skewers the meat and begins to grill it in response to our order, it makes a gentle noise, and a savoury smell begins to drift around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the students around his stall seem to be hesitating because they are unfamiliar with the Orc meat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alright, let&#8217;s help with one promotion here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Margaret, you&#8217;re very familiar with Orcs. As expected you are still eating Orc meat in the Altmunt county, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that loudly, Margaret, noticing my intentions, responded with a loud voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, of course. It is a speciality of my Altmunt. I think Orc meat is healthier and tastier than pork. Moreover, &#8216;upper&#8217; rank loin is not easily available in the royal capital. It is rare after all. There is no loss in eating it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After our conversation, the students who were watching from a distance also ordered one after another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama and Margaret-sama also, thank you very much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We just talked to each other, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen is much stronger than the man who has fallen into a fool. Margaret also seems to have a good impression of Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Subsequently, at the dismantling show, albeit a little grotesque, the Orc was dismantled with a brilliant hand, and the fresh meat got sold at an unbelievable price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We couldn&#8217;t confirm until the end, but Allen&#8217;s stall was sold out and closed without waiting for the end of the cultural festival.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when I was looking over the embroidery exhibition, which is our feature of the cultural festival, Allen came to visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Woah, Allen, you came.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Um, excuse me for disturbing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen then asked me with a mysterious look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you saying it questionably?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed after asking that question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. Now that I think about it, I didn&#8217;t tell him that I got kicked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was kicked out of His Highness&#8217;s group yesterday. So Margaret picked me up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen, who heard it, was utterly speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a face like that. Well, take a look at it because both Margaret&#8217;s and mine are on display.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, but I don&#8217;t know about embroidery &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying so, Allen is looking around the embroideries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I feel embarrassed to let Allen see the embroideries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about it, Allen gave a ridiculous impression when he saw my embroidery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s good or bad, but I got hungry when I saw Anastasia-sama&#8217;s embroidery.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to answer that, but I was embarrassed, so I looked down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, since everything happened yesterday only, I didn&#8217;t get the time to choose or make new ones, so I casually brought in the fruit and cake embroidery that I made a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But! But! Doesn&#8217;t it seem that I&#8217;m only interested in sweets!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though there were more feminine embroideries like floral patterns and small birds. It&#8217;s embarrassing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Margaret who came back to break such an awkward silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen-kun, you came. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, even if I do not know embroidery at all, what I do understand is that I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Well, the men are like that. By the way, the cultural festival is about to end. So we better clean up and go to the auditorium.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yes. Thank you for today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen, who sensed her intention, goes out of the exhibition room obediently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, what happened? Your face is bright red, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, I wish I had brought another embroidery.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I see. I&#8217;m sure I have a full appetite.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say.&#8221; (T/N:- Ah, cute. I literally imagined her saying that.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an event that made me realize the meaning of the phrase &#8216;I want to dig a hole and hide in it.&#8217;</span></p>
