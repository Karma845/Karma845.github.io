<h3>Chapter 17 - Villager A confronts evil spirit.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought I had landed in a human village, it turns out to be the elf village that should have been in the lost forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did this happen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a completely suspicious person, I obediently followed the instructions of the elves and was taken to a big house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, an elf, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, right. Can&#8217;t you understand by seeing me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ask one of the guys with the bow, but that attitude, so unfriendly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The inside of the house looks similar to the house of the elf queen shown in the game. And on the throne, the beautiful queen I saw in the game is sitting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are a human, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, my name is Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, Allen-san, for what reasons did you come to this village?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen begins her interrogation</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I got lost. I was actually trying to go to another human village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please be quiet. But, our village is protected by the power of spirits. You humans and demons should not be able to pass through that forest. How on earth?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I came from the sky&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;From the sky, you say? Does that mean you have the magical power to keep flying over that forest?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, yes. If you say it like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like the Queen got shocked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Her Majesty, that shouldn&#8217;t be possible. I can&#8217;t feel that much magical power from this person.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An aide-like man seems to be suggesting to the Queen to prove me wrong. I have a hunch that such a character did not appear in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Certainly, I don&#8217;t feel strong magic power, but &#8230; right, Allen-san. Do you have any blessings?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I say? Well, the opponent is not human but the elves who were supposed to hate humans in the game, so it&#8217;ll be okay probably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;For the time being, I did receive the blessing of the〖Wind God〗.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen stood up in a surprised manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is- is that true?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unlock the〖Wind God〗on the status that was hidden by 【Concealment】 and show the status of the guild card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ooh! God didn&#8217;t abandon us.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m impressed with how they exaggerated, but what exactly does that mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm&#8230; Your majesty. I can&#8217;t seem to perceive the story at all &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m sorry. Allen-san, no, Allen-sama. Please save our village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did the event start? There shouldn&#8217;t be any monster-related casualties for the request yet?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, an evil spirit has appeared in the lost forest. At first, it was only active in the lost forest, but gradually it started coming closer to this village.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an event I knew nothing of. Did the evil spirit appear before the monsters appeared? What a series of disasters!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While keeping in mind the impressions of other people, I try to match the story for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, what has it done?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That evil spirit chases us and the spirits. However, because of its slow movement, no one has been injured yet. But, if this goes on, damage may occur and eventually, we will not be able to protect the forest and the village.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In other words, an evil spirit is attacking you, so I need to repel it, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, you are blessed by the god of the wind. If it&#8217;s you, I&#8217;m sure you can do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that kind of request fall under the priest&#8217;s territory?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I want to invite as few humans as possible to this village because there is an unfortunate history between humans and elves.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. It wasn&#8217;t drawn in the game, so something like this also happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother! You don&#8217;t have to rely on a human, like him. I&#8217;ll get rid of it for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cute girl of about 15 years old came in. I knew her. She was the one who asked to get rid of monsters in the game. I remember her being the princess of this village, and contrary to what she looked like, she was in her mid-20s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sheryl Laura! I&#8217;m talking to a guest right now. Please go back.&#8221; (T/N:  in the raw, name of the princess was シェリルラルラ. If anyone can translate it, do suggest it to me in the comment.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The evil spirit has returned!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the evil spirit just appeared during our conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get rid of it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sherry! Wait! Sherry!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san starts running. Also, some elves chase after her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama &#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um &#8230;  do I have to go? Huh! Okay &#8230; I&#8217;m going, but don&#8217;t expect much, okay!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were staring at me with a very expected expression, which made me feel very uncomfortable. So, I decided to go see it for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">****</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we came to the square, but what&#8217;s that strange thing supposed to be?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man with a wizard-like vibe is raising his hands diagonally up in front while moving slowly. He seems to be moving with the gesture of chasing something&#8230; right, something similar to butterflies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, his movement is rather slow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, that man is also very slender, or it may be said that he looks ghastly. His wizard&#8217;s robe is also tattered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, no doubt. He is a completely suspicious person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuu, you came, evil spirit. Take this!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san shoots an arrow. However, the arrow that should have hit the suspicious person changed its trajectory and deviated before reaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty, is that the evil spirit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That black, ominous fog-like thing chasing the spirits is the evil spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A spirit? A black fog? I can only see a suspicious person chasing something alone that I can&#8217;t see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, can you see the true identity of that fog?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, is it not visible?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence flows between me and the Queen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Sheryl Laura-san and the elves in the village are in a state of panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the suspicious person closed in, the elves got frightened and started crying and fleeing. Some frantically fired arrows and even began to cast magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, neither the arrow nor the magic reached the suspicious person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, I&#8217;ll help you to see the spirits temporarily.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Queen put her hand on my head, it felt like something entered my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How do you like it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at the suspicious person again, I can certainly see something like a small light beyond. If you look closely, it looks like a little girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s true. He was already a suspicious person, but now he looks like a more problematic suspicious person.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In that case……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t look at me with such praying eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;For, for the time being, I&#8217;ll try to persuade him.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said so and started walking towards the suspicious person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, the wizardly old man? it&#8217;s a crime to chase after a little girl like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out, the suspicious person was stunned.</span></p>
