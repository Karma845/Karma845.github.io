<h3>Chapter 11 - Villager A Plays Matchmaker.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; so god, what am I supposed to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, here&#8217;s the thing. I want you to help this boy score a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;what?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Huh? It&#8217;ll be a problem if you start losing your hearing at your age, you know? Anyway, I said I want you to help this here Jerome find a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, I didn&#8217;t hear it wrong. Why is god making me help a wyvern lord get married?</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because if Jerome and his beloved Melissa have a kid, with my blessings, the kid would have the potential to become a Sky Dragon.</p><p>&#8220;Um. I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. You don&#8217;t know much about this sort of thing, do you, Allen? Well, it&#8217;s a long story so&#8230; ah well, whatever. I&#8217;ll give you my blessing if you help Jerome and Melissa get a little lovin&#8217;. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>What should I do..?</p><p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad deal.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-25308407"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center; " id="foxaholic-1260088654"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll give it a shot.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I knew if it was you, you&#8217;d definitely agree. You know, I was just about to leave the『Book of the Wind God』here and go home because it was getting annoying, but thankfully you came! Now this&#8217;ll be a perfect way to kill time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hmm? Didn&#8217;t this guy say something really irresponsible just now?</p><p>&#8220;A-a-a-adden&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome bit his tongue when he tried to speak. Wow, I&#8217;m supposed to help this guy, huh?</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right. I&#8217;ll help you in any way I can. So, what&#8217;s this Melissa girl like?</p>

<p>&#8230;.</p><p>Jerome, you&#8217;re squirming.</p><p>Show some backbone, will you? Aren&#8217;t you a man?</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. Let me show you.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-662818670"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2002006881"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>

<p>As God said this, a screen appeared in front of me. In it was a lone white wyvern lord flying gracefully in the sky. It had a familiar ribbon wrapped around its tail.</p>

<p>Oh, so this really was how it was.</p><p>I entered the scenario too early. I&#8217;m sure that if I hadn&#8217;t come at this point, the God of Wind will have gotten bored and left the『Book of the Wind God』in this temple and returned to the divine realm.</p>

<p>But Jerome will do his best to win Melissa anyway, and become a married couple. And when they had just become husband and wife, had a child, and were about to reach the peak of their happiness, was when Amy and the others came in and destroyed everything.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s rough, buddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm? Allen, why do you think of the future as a fact? Well, that&#8217;s okay, Allen, you&#8217;ve already promised to help, so you can&#8217;t wait for me to go away, okay? Don&#8217;t worry, if you don&#8217;t help and run away, I&#8217;ll send you to hell in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s not reassuring at all.&#8221;<br /> ・<br /> ・<br /> ・<br /> Okay, let&#8217;s think of something else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, then let&#8217;s start the strategy meeting. A great strategist once said, &#8216;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles&#8217;. So let&#8217;s start by getting to know her. So Jerome, tell me about Melissa&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome, you&#8217;re squirming.</p><p>I want to punch this guy. He&#8217;s seriously driving me crazy.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-527068275"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-691309769"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to do anything at this rate! Hurry up and spit it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;ll tell you, I&#8217;ll tell you&#8230; Don&#8217;t be so angry.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Okay, tell me everything you know.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Y-yes. Melissa is a white wyvern girl with a trademark stylish bow t-tied around her tail. She&#8217;s very pretty&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And then? What what does she like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome, you look troubled.</p><p>&#8220;Wait, have you even talked to her?&#8221;</p><p>Jerome, you&#8217;re sweating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then aren&#8217;t you just some stranger to her? I mean, honestly, aren&#8217;t you just some stalker?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome, you look shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haaa&#8230; alright then, we&#8217;ll start by saying hello and getting to know her a bit more.&#8221;</p><p>Jerome you&#8217;re squirming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is. That. Clear?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;H-hiiiii&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">******</p>

<p>We got God to take us closer to where Melissa was resting her wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, you got this. First greet her like this: &#8216;Hello. My name is Jerome. That&#8217;s a nice and stylish ribbon. May I sit next to you?&#8217; And then you talk to her. Then while you&#8217;re talking to her, randomly ask her about her hobbies and favorite food and whatnot, and then you compliment her on it and after awhile, ask her if she wants to go out with you sometime. Go on, you can do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome flaps his huge body into the air and flies to Melissa.</p>

<p>I watch Melissa from a distance with God.</p>

<p>Jerome landed at Melissa&#8217;s side and he shuffles on closer to her.</p>

<p>Melissa raises her head and glances at Jerome.</p><p>&#8220;Who the hell are you? You want something?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;H-h-h-he&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Melissa made a face like she was looking at trash and then she just flew away.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">******</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, so here&#8217;s our next move. If you can&#8217;t talk to her, then let&#8217;s give her a gift. What&#8217;s something wyvern girls like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh, meat?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s go with that. Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-y-yes!&#8221;</p><p>Then Jerome flew off into the distance.</p>

<p>And so here I was with god, watching Melissa from a distance.</p>

<p>After a while, Jerome, with blood all over his face, flew in with a huge worm in his mouth.</p>

<p>As soon as Melissa saw Jerome, she let out a scream and flew away.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center">******</p>

<p>&#8216;Okay, if you can&#8217;t talk or give a gift, you&#8217;ll have wow her with fashion. What do wyvern girls think looks cool?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, yeah, um, um, a crown of flowers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you say so. Let&#8217;s go with that. Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-y-yes!&#8221;</p><p>And so Jerome flew off into the distance.</p>

<p>And so here I was with god, watching Melissa from a distance.</p>

<p>After a while, some kind of huge clump of trees and grass comes flying by.</p>

<p>When that strange object landed on Melissa&#8217;s side, she let out a scream and flew away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p>I drew a magic circle on the ground and visualized a clear image in my head. If you have a clear image of what you want to do, the skill will guide you on how to finish it.</p>

<p>Then I put the Hornrabbit magic stone in the center of the magic circle.</p>

<p>&#8221;Refine!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could feel my magic power get drained into the magic stone. The magic circle flashed, and a large white tie appeared wrapped around Jerome&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>The process left me completely exhausted and I fell to the ground panting.</p>

<p>&#8221;W-well, I guess it&#8217;s something like this?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, oh, thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome was so moved that he tried to shake hands, but I hurriedly avoided it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You idiot! If you do that, I&#8217;ll be crushed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Uh. S-sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. Well, look at that. You&#8217;re starting to look really coo―&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;KYAAAA&#8221;</p>

<p>We heard what seemed like Melissa&#8217;s screams from the distance.</p>

<p>Jerome runs out of the room in a hurry.</p>

<p>While being carried by god, we quickly follow after him.</p>

<p>In the sky above Jerome, there was Melissa surrounded by about 30 Wyverns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh-who the hell are you guys!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome tried calling out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grrrrrr&#8221;</p>

<p>The wyverns around him just growled and ignored him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems the wyverns around him are too young to speak. They seem to want to vent their young<br /> male libidos&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before I could ask about the situation, god answered me ahead,</p>

<p>They&#8217;re like beasts. Attacking a single girl with a group!</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away from Melissa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome charges at the wyverns that have gathered around Melissa and tries to shake them off one by one.</p>

<p>Despite being outnumbered 1 to 30, Jerome was trying his best to beat the wyverns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t allow anyone to hurt Melissa!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Jerome tried to bite down on another wyvern even when he started to droop down from the sky and was covered in wounds, he fought to protect Melissa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Melissa was there, her eyes glued onto Jerome&#8217;s figure.</p>

<p>Eventually, after barely fending off the wyverns, Jerome finally fell to the ground listless.</p>

<p>With his body slamming onto the ground, a loud thud resounded out and dust rose to the air.</p>

<p>&#8221;God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so god lifted me onto the collapsed Jerome&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerome!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually, the dust cloud cleared. There, was the sight of Melissa supporting Jerome from under him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; Huh? Me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could hear Jerome&#8217;s voice</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerome, You&#8217;re okay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allen? I guess so&#8230; Huh!? Me-Me-Me-Melissa!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerome, realizing that he was on top of Melissa, turned red and tried to jump away.</p>

<p>But Melissa caught him with her tail, and wouldn&#8217;t let it happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;So your name is Jerome. Thanks for saving me. You know, you were kinda cool back there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melissa lifts her head as she says this and gently kisses Jerome&#8217;s cheek.</p>

<p>Oh huh. It seems like I just completed God&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do anything, though!?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">****</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then I will give you my blessing, Mr. Allen, as I promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, God put his hand on my head and I felt as if something had entered my body.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is done. I&#8217;ll give Jerome and Melissa a blessing when the time is right for them to get married. I hope to see you again then.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, god disappeared in a scatter of light, and with him gone, there was no『Book of the Wind God』left behind.</p><p>&#8221;Ah, ah, um. A-Allen. Thank you so much!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;No, I really didn&#8217;t do anything. It was all because of your hard work, Jerome.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;B-but, I don&#8217;t think I could have gotten the courage to do it if it weren&#8217;t for you!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Like I said, It&#8217;s fine. Oh, wait. How about this, 4 years from now, in the summer, I want you to take a trip away from here. There might be something bad that&#8217;ll happen to you.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Huh? Oh, well, if you say so&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Fufu. So, your name was Allen? I also want to thank you. For before, and for this cloth you gave Jerry for his wedding dress.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;No problem.&#8221;</p><p>Apparently, Melissa already had a nickname for Jerome.</p><p>&#8220;So, when you really need our help, just once, We&#8217;ll help you no matter what. How&#8217;s that for our thanks?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-736084306"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-637812292"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>&#8216;Hmm, yeah, I&#8217;ll help you Allen!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a pretty great deal! Thanks a lot!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Jerome, you better not make Melissa cry, alright?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;A-ah, th-that&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Come on, say it straight!&#8221;</p><p>Melissa smacked Jerome&#8217;s head with her tail. She may have thought she was tapping him lightly, but the heavy thud made him shudder.</p><p>&#8220;I-I know. I will! Ah, Allen. Thank you! And see you later!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll see you later!&#8221;</p><p>After this strange experience, I set out to go back to the village of Frissen.</p><p>By the way, Jerome also gave me the extra magical stones that he got from the other wyvern&#8217;s corpse. What a deal.</p>
