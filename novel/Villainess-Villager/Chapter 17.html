<h3>Chapter 17 - Villager A becomes the saviour of the Elven Village</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8230; what! I&#8217;m still a virgin!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know where the story of virginity came from, but the suspicious person gave up on his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uncle, You were a virgin?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I&#8217;m not a virgin! Also, I did get a good name from my parents, I&#8217;m called Loringus&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how you think about it, the name itself smells like a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So what is this &#8216;Loringus-san&#8217; doing here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How admirable of you for listening to me. I only wanted to meet the spirits in the elf village&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The spirit has lived for thousands of years even though she looks like a little girl. In other words, it&#8217;s a legal loli!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do? No matter what, he is completely a pervert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a predicament, I look towards the Queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please, help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the Queen puts her hands in front of her chest and looks at me with glittering eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please, stop. I don&#8217;t know how to deal with a pervert like him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This pervert lolicon. Don&#8217;t approach this village for the time being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, Oops. My real intentions come out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this perverted man was clearly showing a shocked face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s rude! To call me a pervert. I just wanted to admire her without touching her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He doesn&#8217;t seem to be denying being a lolicon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you trying to touch her right now?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a misunderstanding. I decided not to touch her at the last minute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s even worse if you chase after her! Look how scared she is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8230;What! Was I scaring her? What was I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, if you understand then get out of this village and the lost forest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I yelled at the pervert whose soul is coming out due to the shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I can&#8217;t do that! I need to go through the lost forest to the Elven Village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? This is the elf village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looks at me with a stunned look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! Thank you for that! I can make the secret medicine now. Quick, let&#8217;s go to the elf queen. Um&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s Allen&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, take me to the Elven Queen.&#8221; (T/N: shi is similar to san &amp; kun)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I point towards the Queen, this pervert starts running immediately. So, I grabbed his collar to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Apparently, you have too many evil thoughts, and the elves think you&#8217;re some kind of evil spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! Is that so? Then I&#8217;d like Allen-shi to ask them for me. I need the petals of the spirit tree and the honey made by the elves to make the elixir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? If you get that, will you leave this village?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, got it. Your majesty! He said he would leave if he gets the petals of the spirit tree and the honey made by the elves. Is that okay with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, a relief voice of &#8220;Oh&#8221; is heard from the surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, someone, bring the petals of the spirit tree and the honey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after the Queen ordered, a pouch and a bottle were brought in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you!. Allen-shi, I will never forget this favour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert left the village after saying so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, is this all right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn to the Queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Allen-sama!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As expected of the Miko, favoured by the god of the wind!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm hmm! not bad.&#8221; (T/N: imagine a tsundere)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason a Tsundere is also here, well it&#8217;s okay. Wouldn&#8217;t it be easy if the elf helped me explore the lost forest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I was welcomed as a saviour who saved the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, the elf village was in a fuss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your majesty, What happened?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A spirit of light has been born.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Wasn&#8217;t the Spirit of Light born the day after Amy finished the event to save the village?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I can&#8217;t disclose the details of the game, so I have to get the gist by asking questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um! What great news, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s been 800 years. Maybe this is the birth of a saint in the human nations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen looks very happy. What she meant by a saint has to be about heroine Amy, but there was never an event like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Look, the Spirit of Light is playing with Miryl Leura over there. Ah, Miryl Leura is the little girl next to Sheryl Laura, She is her sister.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, around the little girl of about 3 to 4 years old, a little girl with faintly shining feathers, like a fairy, is flying around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fairy flew towards us when he noticed us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi! Thanks for helping yesterday! Because of you, I was able to make a secret medicine and become a spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To gain knowledge about Loli, I thought it&#8217;s better to start by becoming a Loli myself. Thanks to that, I think I&#8217;m able to understand how it feels being a Loli.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Are you Loringus? You&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, I&#8217;m no longer Loringus! By forming a contract with Miri-tan my name has changed to Rho-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Umm, Your majesty. She has formed a contract with Miryl Leura-chan without her permission&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, is that true? That&#8217;s a big deal. Miri-chan, tell me&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen ran towards Miryl Leura-chan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Now that I think about it, wasn&#8217;t the spirit of light supposed to form a contract with the heroine Amy? Ah, was it a blessing then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Well, whatever?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave up on thinking about it. I don&#8217;t remember the details well, and besides, events around here will occur after the villainess&#8217;s condemnation event. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, I&#8217;m grateful for your help. I have spent my whole life trying to master the path of Loli and may have finally reached that point. So this is a little thank you gift for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That pervert called Rho-chan says so and gives me a scroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a 『Scroll of No Chant』 made by me. I was thinking of presenting it to the Loli girl, but I didn&#8217;t get the chance to give it. I don&#8217;t need it anymore, also I&#8217;m indebted to you. So, I&#8217;ll give it to Allen-shi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Name:</strong> Scroll of No Chant</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Description:</strong> A scroll that allows you to acquire the 【No Chant】 skill. It disappears once used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Grade:</strong> Epic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried appraising it. Certainly, it was a Scroll of No Chant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, what should I do with this complicated feeling?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, thank you all for your help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked all the elf villagers who came to see me off and also to pervert Rho-chan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama is the hero who saved this village. Please come to this village anytime. This is a special amulet made with the prayers of our elf tribe. I&#8217;m presenting this to you as a sign of gratitude and friendship, Allen-sama. Please carry it with you all the time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen says so and hands over the amulet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll come back again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, I get into Buitor and start the engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;System all green, vertical engine, attitude control engine, start.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buitor gradually rises in altitude while maintaining an exquisite balance. Below everyone from the village is waving their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod a little and start the propulsion engine. Buitor gradually speeds up and flies through the sky of the lost forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flew Buitor in a straight line towards Lurden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About Multiple chanting and No-chanting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple chanting parallelizes the flow of magical power that is used to activate magic. Therefore, it is not possible to divide one&#8217;s thoughts in his/her head and cast multiple spells at the same time. One can use multiple magic at the same time if he/she uses a magical catalyst. But when combined with No-chanting, it will show its true value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No-chanting can be activated by omitting the part that expresses the process of realizing magic.</span></p>
