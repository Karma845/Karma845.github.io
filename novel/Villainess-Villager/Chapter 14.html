<h3>Chapter 14 - Villager A Captures the Tower of the Sage.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Course &#8211; clear, engine &#8211; On, take off&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I start the wind magic engine and take off with the wind magic glider from the runway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is no runway, I should make it. So, I made the runway by carving out the inner sections of the forest in the northeastern part of Lurden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle to go back and forth. Anyway, it&#8217;s impossible to take off and land in town. I should have done this from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The glider on which I was riding was steadily increasing in altitude, at this momentum, it will soon reach the height of the stratus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the Tower of the Sages is located in a rather inaccessible place. It takes about 10 days from Lurden to reach the town, and then another 4 days on foot to the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This tower is said to be built by an ancient sage, which has 300 floors above ground and looks like a deep blue skyscraper modelled after the Burj Khalifa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 300th floor is maybe 1,000 or 1,500 meters high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, in the game, you can come to this tower free-spirited to study for the school festival during the second grade. Nonetheless, if I don&#8217;t go now, I can still clear it later, which is unnecessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the Tower of the Sages is quite far away. Thus, thanks to the introduction of the wind magic engine, rather than gliding, it is proceeding at a considerably higher speed than the first time. At this pace, I&#8217;m expecting to reach it in a few hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wind magic glider has also been improved compared to the first time and is designed exclusively for capturing the Tower of the Sage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, the biggest improvement is the function to remove the core of the wind magic engine that powers the glider.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last time, the core disintegrated because it was fused all together with the materials. It became useless after getting damaged once. But this time even if an accident occurs, I will not lose this core part. I can reuse the old Wyvern magic stone every time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it is my hair that transmits the power. It was painful to pluck it out, but it can&#8217;t be helped, as if I can gain something without sacrificing anything. (T/N: The idiom on the last 背に腹は変えられない, I tried my best to convey the meaning.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not perfect and considering its short term usage makes me feel depressed. It would be better to upgrade it later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this cost reduction, the magic stones required to alchemise the core have changed to Orc magic stones instead of Wyvern magic stones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a rather large upgrade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Orc magic stones can be bought from the guild for around 100,000 cents. Although Orc is a monster that is hated for different reasons, it is very popular for its meat. As a result, it is also the main source of income for intermediate adventurers. So, Orc magic stones are always in stock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, the wind magic glider that achieves both cost reduction and performance improvement keeps on travelling smoothly in the air.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While chewing on the sandwich I made in flight, I saw a tower of tremendous height in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No doubt about it, that is the Tower of the Sages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, as planned, let&#8217;s get ready to start the operation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I control the elevator with my left hand to raise the altitude of the aircraft while flying around the tower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the altitude rises steadily, the glider breaks through the stratus and rises above the clouds. The stratus exists at a height of about 2,000 meters above the sky, so the current altitude is about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sea of white clouds spread under my eyes. The upper part of the tower protrudes as if it penetrates the cloud. And the rooftop of the tower is visible now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approach it while operating the glider, there is particularly no intervention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move the glider up to make some distance, then turn around facing down toward the tower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Direction okay! Altitude okay! Goal, the top floor of the Tower of the Sages. Glider missiles, assault!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fuel the wind magic engine at maximum output.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aircraft speeds up and rushes towards the top of the tower while making a rattling noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now! Eject!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remove the core used for the wind magic engine and activate the emergency escape device.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The device activates correctly and I get ejected straight up high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh! Mana, the source of all things, gather in my hands and become the wind.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open the prepared parachute while decelerating by driving the wind diagonally downward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And start the small wind magic engine that I had prepared and adjust the posture in the air. It&#8217;s as simple as adjusting the fall while not gaining momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this gear, it may be closer to a motor paraglider than a parachute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the glider I ejected from became a missile and crashed into the top of the Tower of the Sages with a loud noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it is light in weight, it will not offer much impact, but because of the iron attached to the tip, it should be able to do some damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I landed on the roof of the Tower of the Sage, I checked the condition of the tower. The part where the glider collided had collapsed making a hole, yet it seems that there is no particular effect on other places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly folded the parachute and used a rope to enter the top floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As planned!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I evaded the Sage Tower&#8217;s traps, monsters, bosses, all of them and reached the top floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the self-repairing function of the Tower of the Sage worked, and the outer wall was gradually repaired. It soon returned to its original state as if there had been no collision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the reason why I know that the outer wall of the Tower of the Sage can be destroyed from the outside is, of course, because there was such a description in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was an event in which Amy and her friends were celebrating their achievement of reaching the top floor of the Tower of the Sage when suddenly a black sky dragon attacked them by destroying the outer wall of the Tower of the Sage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The character design was cool, but suddenly getting attacked by an enemy character without any conversation event was a messed up scenario. At that time I cursed the Devs while playing without understanding anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well then, I who invaded the top floor in this way headed for the treasure chest placed in the centre of this floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the treasure chest opened with a squeaking noise, a scroll was there inside it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt that it is the『Scroll of multiple chanting』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately use the scroll to get the 【Multiple Chant】 skill.</span></p>
