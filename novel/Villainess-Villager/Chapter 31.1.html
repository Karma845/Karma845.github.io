<h3>Side &#8211; Anastasia (1)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are some excellent commoners. I thought I understood that in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was quite surprised when I saw the ranking of the entrance examination on the day of the entrance ceremony. After all, a commoner and a former commoner were in second and third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the information gathered by a member of my duke family, the second-ranked man was born into a single-mother family in a rather poor area, where he grew up with considerable difficulty from an early age. Even so, he is the youngest Grade Skipper in history, who has graduated from a school for commoners. And seems to have experienced the wilderness as an adventurer. (T/N:- all the signs of an OP MC)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the third place&#8217;s woman is apparently Baron Brayes illegitimate child. It seems that she was living a normal life with some assistance from the Baron family. Then, it turned out that she had the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">blessing and was suddenly taken over by the Baron Brayes family along with her mother. (T/N:- typical Otome game Heroine)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering it comprehensively, one should be careful of the man in second place. If you think about it normally, an adventurer from a poor family shouldn&#8217;t think about enrolling in this high school as he/she will not be able to do it financially in the first place. If my dukedom or the royal family had arranged it, then I should have known about it. But that&#8217;s not the case. That means maybe he is getting supported by some hostile faction or an evil organization from a foreign country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this high school, His Highness the Crown Prince, the prince of a neighbouring country, and the children of many aristocrats are attending. So no harm should be allowed to happen here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will need to be very careful so that he doesn&#8217;t involve His Highness in any extra hassle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I enter the auditorium where the entrance ceremony is held with my friends, I glance at the person sitting in the back corner who needs attention. No matter how I see it, he looks like an ordinary commoner, who has neat brown hair and brown eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this guy really that good?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my doubts, I decide to sit down before he notices my gaze.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the woman in third place, not the man in second place, who was vicious! The Crown Prince is my fiancée, even though it is a marriage of convenience with no love for each other!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make it tattered like this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much you are in school, there are limits to what you should do. Even though I haven&#8217;t got permission to talk to His Highness, she called out to him, and within the next word, she started calling him &#8220;Karl-sama&#8221; with a sweet voice. Was that woman a prostitute or something!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But His Highness forgives it and does not even listen to my words to make her stop it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it continues like this, His Highness will completely get fooled by that guileful woman, and the kingdom will be in chaos. When that happens, the cracks will eventually turn to the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an aristocrat, I have the responsibility to look after my people because they blessed me with their taxes. So, I will maintain my patience here, and without any option, I will let her continue to speak to His Highness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All right, His Highness is not a fool. I&#8217;m sure he will understand. (T/N:- no, he is the biggest fool in the group.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought so. However, contrary to my thoughts, the situation rolls from bad to worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first case was the first magic exercise class about a week after the entrance ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to the teacher&#8217;s call, His Highness and I demonstrated our magic. However, it seems that the fact that I broke the target made His Highness irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But His Highness&#8217;s magic was a fireball, and mine was an ice arrow. No matter how you look at it, an ice arrow that has a physical impact is better for destroying a target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness tried to use magic again, but he was not accustomed to controlling it, and as expected, made it run wild. Thanks to my quickness in extinguishing the fire, His Highness suffered some burns, but there was no harm to his life. I was able to prevent the fire, but that woman barged in here as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a low-level healing magic that I could hardly think of from a person who has received the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">blessing. It also took a considerable amount of time for that woman to complete the healing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, His Highness, who had never got seriously injured, had no experience of healing magic and was completely surprised. Also, it seems that his trust in that woman increased considerably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can&#8217;t stay like this. But the more impatient I become, the more the situation will get worse.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, as expected, the harassment of that woman begins. I stopped my friend from trying to take part in the harassment, but the harassment didn&#8217;t stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere of the class became worse, so I tried to do something about it, but all of it ended up in a mess, so only the sense of futility started accumulating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why on earth do I have to have such a hard time for her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The days of thinking about such things continued, and during that time his presence completely faded away from my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next time I remembered him was after seeing the results of the final exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How! I-I got removed from the first place. The cause was that I made a mistake in one option due to carelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be clear, my pride was severely hurt, but at the same time, I deeply reflected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened because, even though I enrolled in this high school to study, I neglected it in trying to rid His Highness of that woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even after getting completely ignored in this class, which has a terrible atmosphere, this commoner genius worked hard silently and took the top spot from me brilliantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to that, how stupid was I!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was able to applaud him honestly when he was praised by the teacher in front of the entire class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, what I had been thinking about in various ways had a very simple answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Focusing on studies first. Isn&#8217;t that good?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, my relationship with His Highness was of a political marriage without love. And marriage is impossible between the royal family and the baron&#8217;s family, considering the difference in status. Then I can just leave His Highness to play with fire. I didn&#8217;t have to worry my heart out from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I think about the independent research during summer vacation. As expected, there will be various problems with not doing it jointly with His Highness. So it would be better to go to the ruins that His Highness wanted to go to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there will be a need for an adventurer guide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, right, isn&#8217;t there just the right person for this in our class?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I realized that, I called out to Allen.</span></p>
