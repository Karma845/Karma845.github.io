<h3>Chapter 24 - Villager A traverses the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on, If I have Saiga, I don&#8217;t need anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saiga, on her debut in the actual battle, has shown such a big success that it makes me think so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the range is short, and even if the aim is slightly off, as expected, a shotgun is an ideal weapon for hunting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, I was able to proceed smoothly. And now I have arrived on the 28th floor. This dungeon has 8 gimmick floors where wind magic is absolutely necessary to breakthrough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This floor covers 10 floating islets. But to reach the next floating islet, it is necessary to use wind magic to hit a target as small as an apple on that floating islet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you will be transferred to that islet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can reach the next floor by going around these floating islets in the correct order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, if you make a mistake in the order, you will either get teleported to the entrance of this floor or you will fall head-on. (T/N:- I think at the end the floor judges if the order is correct or not)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also famous as a shitty dungeon in the game. In fact, it would be quite difficult to break through here without the Wiki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, if you fell, it would be game over immediately. So if I fell, my life would be game over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I carefully cross the islets. All the attacking monsters are shot down with Saiga, but, sadly, the defeated monsters fall as they are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, I reached the 5th floating islet. There is actually a hidden gimmick here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the north side of this islet, there is an entrance to the inside of the island. (T/N:- by inside it means underground)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This entrance is quite annoying. It gets smaller with each islet you cross over, i.e. the more islets you cross over the smaller the entrance gets. While cursing the evil intentions of the production team, I felt nostalgic over the memories of my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, normally the plan is to prepare a rope with a hook and go down the side of the floating islet along the cliff. But I have the costly cheat skill</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the help of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill, if I make stairs to go down, then there will be no danger. Of course, that&#8217;s if you could pay for it. It&#8217;s also possible in-game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I easily invade the inside of the islet in this way. The interior was a straight passage, with a place that looks like a small altar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on the altar that I arrived at, a pair of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute Ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> was enshrined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, there was a scene where the targeted capture character puts the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute Ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the heroine Amy&#8217;s finger and says &#8216;Next time, I want to give you the real one&#8217;. Event stills were also prepared for each targeted capture character. So it was quite a famous event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This event comes after the villainess condemnation event. So, I don&#8217;t care what happens to the event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since my safety is the priority, I gratefully took both of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute Ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. (T/N:- don&#8217;t want to spoil much, but, in a sense, the rings did fulfil their event purpose.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After putting one of them on the middle finger of my left hand, I hurried back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, I got the insurance for the worst.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I reached the front of the boss room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside is the Blizzard Phoenix, a dangerous monster that you would never want to face outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I check the condition of the guns and change Saiga&#8217;s bullets to slug bullets. Slug bullets are also called bear-killers. Although their range is not good, their power is enormous if they are shot from a short distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, this time, I also made a polycarbonate shield to block the attacks from reaching me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, all preparations are done!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I barged into the boss room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boss room is a vast dome-shaped room with a radius of about 100 meters. And the Blizzard Phoenix clad in ice was waiting, giving off a divine aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kyeeeeeeee!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the door opened, the Blizzard Phoenix, out of the blue, shot a snowstorm towards me, or rather, at the door I was invading from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m hiding as usual with my</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill. But for the time being, let&#8217;s expect a surprise attack when the door opens. That seems to be the Blizzard Phoenix&#8217;s way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While passing through the snowstorm with the shield, I hurriedly moved outside the path of the snowstorm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after that, the Blizzard Phoenix shot an ice arrow at the place where I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, I secretly approach the Blizzard Phoenix and hit it with Saiga&#8217;s bullets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doon, Doon, Doon, Doon</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot four times, but after getting hit once, It noticed me and distanced itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was a reaction. Blue blood is dripping from the Blizzard Phoenix&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And to my surprise, the blood drops that had spilt on the floor were already frozen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activate the Golden Combo of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill from the smokescreen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Blizzard Phoenix immediately slammed me with a snowstorm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use the shield to prevent direct hits and move out of the path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the Blizzard Phoenix shoots ice arrows one after another at me, who escaped from the snowstorm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I got hit by the snowstorm before hiding properly with the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried running to the side to avoid it, but I couldn&#8217;t avoid it. So, I immediately put the shield forward and took the ice arrow head-on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gagagagagagagaga</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the ice arrow crashed into the shield, it made a loud noise. The shield withstood the impact of the ice arrow, but it got frozen quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it goes on like this, I won&#8217;t be able to handle it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a poor situation like this, I took a new step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Forge&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forge a rock of enough size to hide next to the shield, then abandon the frozen shield and hide behind the rock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when I forge a new shield and equip it, I activate the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skill and start moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Blizzard Phoenix senses that I&#8217;m gone and is flying around looking for my whereabouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to hide until the last minute and aim for a headshot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, the Blizzard Phoenix starts attacking with a snowstorm, probably because he couldn&#8217;t find me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to receive a snowstorm, I hastily created a rock in front of me to hide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Blizzard Phoenix noticed me and shot an ice arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An overwhelming out of range attack power. But, when it comes to shooting from range, even I can do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I switched from Saiga to Nikov. Then hold the shield in front and start shooting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandandan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then hide behind the rock. Then again, shoot at the Blizzard Phoenix from behind the rock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I earnestly repeat this pattern of attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly the ice arrows stopped coming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I activated the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> skill and jumped out from behind the rock, I saw the figure of the Blizzard Phoenix there, lying on the ground twitching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems it got hit in the weak points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly approached and shot the Blizzard Phoenix&#8217;s head with Nikov.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, It was a close call, but I managed to beat it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started dismantling it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you look at it like this, the Blizzard Phoenix is ​​very beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, most of what I thought was the beautiful ice blue wings seemed to be made of ice. I tried peeling off the ice feathers, but the peeled feathers began to melt already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, it seems impossible to use it as a material.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can&#8217;t be helped, even so, it&#8217;s quite huge. I handle the Blizzard Phoenix in the same way I handle the other monsters. By doing that, I found a magic stone around its heart, so I took it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, I noticed something when I looked at the gradually melting ice feathers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh? There is something other than ice in the tail feathers. And also on the wings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> I recovered one beautiful ice-blue tail feather and two wind feathers from the remains of the melted Blizzard Phoenix.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The meat is &#8230;. for some reason it has a very bad colour, so let&#8217;s leave it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the game, there was no explanation that it could be eaten.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also collect the wing bones and proceed to the boss room. There, the familiar labyrinth core, treasure chest and pedestal are enshrined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the treasure chest and took the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this pedestal is a magic stone synthesizer. The existence of this device is the reason why I wanted to come here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this is a cheat device that breaks the common sense of this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What this device can do is, synthesize the same type of magic stone and increase the size of the magic stone. In the game, two magic stones of the same size could be synthesized to one size higher. In other words, it took two tiny magic stones to make a small one, four to make a medium one, eight to make a large one, and 16 tiny magic stones to make a huge one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, if you defeat an ordinary goblin, you can get a tiny magic stone. It sells for around 1,500 to 2,000 cents. But the larger size trades for 30,000 cents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this device, you can create something worth 30,000 cents with only 12,000 to 16,000 cents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, the goblins and orc magic stones that were stored so far will be sold after being synthesized here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, I put the magic stones I got while traversing this dungeon on the pedestal and synthesized them, then transferred to the entrance.</span></p>
