<h3>Chapter 34 - Villager A goes around the Cultural Festival.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I decided to look around the other exhibits after closing the store. As I&#8217;m free right now, I might as well enjoy the occasion, cause it will be a loss if I don&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Let&#8217;s start with Anastasia and the Crown Prince&#8217;s group&#8217;s exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I remember from the gossip, it&#8217;s about the lifestyle in downtown &#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to see the exhibition, the onlookers were already singing praises there. Since there was no one at the reception, I looked around without permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw the exhibition, I noticed that the contents were surprisingly thin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It explains the lifestyle of the so-called commoners rather than the downtown. But it was clear that they didn&#8217;t interview the commoners. It is probably based on how Amy lived before being taken over by the Baron. But to be clear, this is a pretty good life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the exhibition, commoner children basically live without starvation. They eat bread &amp; butter with soup. And also vegetables and meat, which is not dried, once a day. It also depicts that in many cases, 4 to 5 family members live in a room of 2LDK to 3LDK. And since there are magic stones, there is no problem with water, but many houses use firewood for the fire, it seems. Then it portrays that the commoner children go to school, and when they graduate, they go to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. I did not know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least it&#8217;s completely different from the area where I used to live. In my case, it&#8217;s different because ours was a single child-mother family, but it&#8217;s normal for a poor household of eight with lots of children to live in a one-room apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, the poorer the house, the more the children act as the workforce. Because of that, children get forced to work from an early age. And a significant proportion of them do not attend school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, there are quite a few people who cannot read. And that is one of the factors that bind them to live in poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And because of that, they rarely saw magic stones, so it is not uncommon for children to not know of their existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone spends their days this way, and their meals are usually hard bread, somewhat rotten vegetables, and a little dried meat or beans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I think the part where the support system for the commoners of this country is described, is organized well. The support measures and the history of the school system are summarized in an easy-to-understand manner. It is probably made by Anastasia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard the capture targets and Amy flirting from the next room, so I ignored them and left the exhibition room as it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it will make me feel uncomfortable, I&#8217;m sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I went to Margaret&#8217;s exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Woah, Allen, you came.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Anastasia who greeted me there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Um, excuse me for intruding?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you saying it in a questionable way? I was kicked out of His Highness&#8217;s group yesterday. So Margaret picked me up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I say? I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That wasn&#8217;t the case in the game. Moreover, in the first place, did she usually act like that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a face like that. Well, take a look at it because both Margaret&#8217;s and mine are on display.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, but I don&#8217;t know about embroidery &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, I went around the exhibition. I don&#8217;t know anything about embroidery, so I can&#8217;t judge whether it&#8217;s good or bad, but I thought that it&#8217;s like designing flowers, birds, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Margaret&#8217;s embroidery was colourful flowers, and Anastasia&#8217;s embroidery was fruit and cake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s good or bad, but I got hungry when I saw Anastasia-sama&#8217;s embroidery.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia, who said that, was a little embarrassed. I&#8217;m used to seeing her usual frozen expression, so I was a little startled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both stop talking, and an indescribable silence flows between us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right then, Margaret came for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen-kun, you came. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, even if I don&#8217;t know embroidery at all, what I understand is that I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Well, men are like that. By the way, the cultural festival is about to end. So we better clean up and go to the auditorium.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yes. Thank you for today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it means that you should go out because it will close. Interpreting that, I obediently went out and headed to the auditorium.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I will announce the Grand Prize winner of this year. The Grand Prize goes to the &#8220;About the downtown culture and life, along with the kingdom&#8217;s support system&#8221; exhibition, represented by His Imperial Highness Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren and his group.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">clap clap clap clap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yup. I knew it. It was a fixed race anyway, worthless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness&#8217;s exhibition focuses on those who live poorer than ordinary commoners and highlights their living conditions through interviews. It also considers the role that the kingdom plays and what it should be like in the future. It highly evaluated the contents of sociality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. Where in that thin content!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I curse in my heart. I&#8217;m sure I have an ugly face now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so, and for a while, I turned my face down so that no one could see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the capture targets and Amy, led by the crown prince, go up to the stage and receive the award. Of course, there is no figure of Anastasia, who got kicked out yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I would like to hear from the representative, the Crown Prince.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s Karlheinz. I&#8217;m glad I won the Grand Prize. First, I chose this theme from Amy&#8217;s idea. We royalty and aristocrats always exist to guide the weak people. So we did this exhibition to highlight the status quo. And to think about what we can do about it. We will also graduate from our prestigious high school and become human beings who have to stand on top of the people. So I hope it will give us an opportunity to think about what to do then. That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Your Highness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">clap clap clap clap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a very flimsy, and surprisingly, abstract speech, given from the top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes, It makes me annoyed when I think that he will be the next king!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t this country seriously in peril?</span></p>
