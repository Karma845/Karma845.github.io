<h3>Chapter 33 - Villager A sells Orc&#8217;s meat in the school festival.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were various things related to Amy, so whether it is safe or not will come later, now it was the day of the cultural festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky is finally whitening. And I&#8217;m now in the Great Dungeon of Orcs near Altmunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I came here at such a chilly time is to get the Orc meat that I will dismantle in the cultural festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I saw a relatively small orc alone, so to hunt it, I sneaked up and headshot it with Nikov, then hurriedly drained the blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I carried the hunted prey as it is and tied it to Buitor with a rope. Then, I took off vertically after starting Buitor and soar into the sky at once with the Orc hanging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a pretty surrealistic sight from the sides, but this is the only way to transport it by air. I had to sacrifice a few things for a greater cause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s autumn now, so the temperature isn&#8217;t too high, it&#8217;s chilly. If I go over the sky, it&#8217;s pretty cold, so I&#8217;m hardly worried about the meat rotting. Rather, I&#8217;m worried that it&#8217;ll freeze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flew Buitor at full speed and arrived at the private Lurden Airport after a few hours of flight. Then quickly carried the Orc and rushed to the school.</span></p>

<p style= "texy-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hung the hunted Orc in front of my stall. Right now, it&#8217;s 10 o&#8217;clock. The dismantling show is scheduled to start at 11 o&#8217;clock, so until then, it&#8217;s for attracting customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after some time, people start gathering around the Orc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s an Orc meat skewer stall.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a monster?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems to be the food of the commoners.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why is such a thing in this school?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since only aristocrats or rich children go to school, a whole orc is quite shocking, it seems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will start the Orc dismantling show from around 11 o&#8217;clock. Please come and see it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While advertising that, I skewered the Orc loin that I had prepared separately and started grilling it over the charcoal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, by the way, Orc meat tastes almost the same as pork. Even though they walk on two legs, look wise they are similar to pigs. They don&#8217;t exude feelings like human beings. Besides, the meat is good to eat and fetches quite a price when sold along with the fur. So they are considered good prey by the adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah, Although this is extra information, according to a senior adventurer from the rural areas, the dismantling method of pigs is similar to the Orcs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Orcs are monsters, a method to convert them to livestock is not possible, so its meat can only be eaten cheaply in and around Altmunt, which is near the Great Dungeon of Orc. And since Orc is rarely seen around the royal capital, eating Orc meat in the royal capital costs more than ten times the price of pork.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that case, people who bother to eat Orc meat, even though it tastes like pork, are probably quite fond of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, By the royal capital&#8217;s standard, it is high-class Orc meat, but due to this being a cultural festival, I will be selling it for 100 cents per skewer without profit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On an occasion like this, I don&#8217;t have any interest in making money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the loin meat was cooked and gave off a savoury smell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lightly sprinkle salt and pepper on it to adjust the taste, then keep it away from the fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s roasted! 100 cents a skewer. How is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, aside from looking at it from a distance, no one came near. When I saw the meat getting colder, I started grilling the new skewered batch and put the cold meat in my mouth as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, it&#8217;s delicious. Now that I think about it, I was in a hurry and hadn&#8217;t eaten anything since morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The juiciness of the meat, which tastes like pork, spreads in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, doesn&#8217;t it look like he is eating something delicious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, but it&#8217;s a monster, is it okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear them whispering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you have started already. Can I have one skewer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, when I turned to meet the person, I found Anastasia, along with her semi-long blue hair and blue-eye entourage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, and um&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s Margaret. Margaret von Altmunt. I&#8217;m fussy about the taste of Orc meat, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the! She is the daughter of the lord of Altmunt, where the Great Dungeon of Orcs is located?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse my rudeness, Margaret-sama. Well, then I will start the Orc meat dismantling show at 11 o&#8217;clock. This Orc is very fresh because it was alive until this morning, so I&#8217;m sure you will be satisfied.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? There shouldn&#8217;t be any Orcs around here, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, but I got it through a secret route. It&#8217;s an adventurer&#8217;s privilege.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this stage, I can&#8217;t disclose the fact that I&#8217;ve air transported it. What I can do right now is to take advantage of the fact that it&#8217;ll have a great impact on society and can start chaos if I use it in war. So I will have to disclose it after thinking it through about the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Is there something like that? Well, it&#8217;s fine, oh? That Orc meat, isn&#8217;t that of good quality? It&#8217;s hardly seen in the royal capital, isn&#8217;t it the &#8216;upper&#8217; rank loin?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As expected of Margaret-sama, you have good eyes. This is the &#8216;upper&#8217; rank Orc meat from Altmunt. I couldn&#8217;t prepare the &#8216;special&#8217; rank, so only the &#8216;upper&#8217; rank is what I can offer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But then, isn&#8217;t 100 cents a skewer too cheap? If someone wanted to eat it in the royal capital, he/she had to pay 10,000 cents to eat it, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the cultural festival. I wanted to make everyone understand the work of adventurers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? I&#8217;m impressed. Then, I might as well get a skewer too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I place the skewer and start to grill. When the fat falls on the charcoal&#8217;s fire and makes a gentle noise, a savoury scent drifts around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia then speaks loudly to Margaret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Margaret, you&#8217;re very familiar with Orcs. As expected you are still eating Orc meat in the Altmunt county, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Margaret responds with a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, of course. It&#8217;s a speciality of my Altmunt. I think Orc meat is healthier and tastier than pork. Moreover &#8216;upper&#8217; rank loin is not easily available in the royal capital. It’s rare after all. There is no loss in eating it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the people who were watching the conversation from a distance started ordering alongside them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama and Margaret-sama also, Thank you very much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We were just talking to each other, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems they are implying to not think much about their conversation. But, no matter how you look at it, they intentionally spoke loudly so that their conversation endorses this meat as nothing suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, the prepared loin meat was sold out in a blink of an eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The orc dismantling show also attracted a large crowd thanks to both of them, and the rest of the orc was sold out without waiting for the end of the cultural festival.</span></p>
