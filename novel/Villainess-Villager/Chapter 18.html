<h3>Chapter 18 - Villager A shifts the plan to the second stage</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Knock knock*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knock on the door of the Lurden Store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a bit, I heard an old woman’s voice from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to ask for the delivery of the recommended menu. The destination is in the belly of the black dragon.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Gacha*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened and I entered the store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Welcome. Oh, it&#8217;s you. Long time no see. What are you looking for today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I came to sell items.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you have the items you want to sell to me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give out three small bottles of elven honey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is&#8230; quite fresh. Is it freshly harvested?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I happened to get it from a certain connection. How much will you give for it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu. Good. How about 2 million in total?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old woman of the shop raises two fingers, by saying that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sold much higher than expected. By the way, this is the result of my appraisal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Elven Honey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Description: A precious honey that can only be obtained in the Elven Village. When eaten, it is nutritious and has effects such as beauty, health, and longevity. It is also used as a raw material for various elixirs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grade: Rare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Price: 300,000 cents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, there were five in total. It seems to have an effect on beauty, health and longevity, so I decided to give one as a gift to my mother and carry the other as a seasoning for when I camp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can you get more of this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult right away, but if I get it again, I&#8217;ll bring it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I request that you do. I haven&#8217;t seen it at all in the last few decades. I&#8217;ll buy 100, 200, or whatever you bring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. I accept your request. By the way, do you have a magic bag?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A magic bag is an item that can carry more things than its size with the power of magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This item didn&#8217;t appear in the game because inventory was there. I found out about its existence in the Adventurer Guild when a senior adventurer got it and was proud of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. How much capacity do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;d have been better if there was one with a capacity similar to this room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha, something like that is not available on the market, and even if it is, it&#8217;s a price that one can buy a country with.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I was too greedy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, if it is of a pouch size with the capacity of a bag, you will find around 500 of them. I do see it occasionally in the market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, do get one for me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the Lurden Store after such an exchange.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, my fate changing plan has finished the first stage, so I decided to move to the second stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I had all the skills I needed and the money to enrol. All that remains is to build the power to win the duel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So my next strategy is to level up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To raise the level, I need to train hard and defeat the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the enemy can also be a human rather than a monster, but I&#8217;m not planning to become a criminal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I decided to exterminate monsters as an adventurer after a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The destination is the village of Stresen. There is a Goblin Dungeon near this village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the otome game, it is the second battle part and also the first actual battle. (T/N: probably after the tutorial one.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my purpose is not the capture of the Goblin Dungeon. All I have to do is get rid of the goblins that occasionally attack the village and raise my level, for that I don&#8217;t have to break through the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, I went straight to the dungeon to capture it without knowing that I didn&#8217;t have to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, dungeons are terrifying and annoying existences that spawn monsters indefinitely. As the number of monsters increases, they will come out and rampage, so it is necessary to thin them out once in a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a boss room in the deepest part of the dungeon. Further back, a dungeon core is there. If you touch it, you will return to the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the setting told in the game. When I asked a senior adventurer, I heard that the body of a person who died in the dungeon had disappeared after some time, what a terrible story. it could have been the result of being eaten by a monster, I may be wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, there are rumours that if you break the dungeon core, you can kill the dungeon. But according to the records, no one has broken it, so there is no credibility to it. If you hit the core, the attack will be deflected to the ground. Even if you shoot magic, the outcome will be the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, monsters are both annoying and good sources of resources, so no one seems to be bothered about destroying them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I took a request from the guild to get rid of Stresen&#8217;s Goblins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen-boy. You&#8217;re finally making your debut to defeat goblins. Don&#8217;t let your guard down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, master. I&#8217;m going!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered master, a senior adventurer called me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-boy, don&#8217;t die&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know. I&#8217;ll run away if it becomes dangerous.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This person is a feckless senior adventurer who starts drinking alcohol in the morning at the guild tavern every day. Thank you for your concern and you should work too, is what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun will finally make his debut in exterminating goblins and become an adult from a boy. He looks reliable, I feel lonely, it&#8217;s complicated.&#8221; (T/N: I also felt complicated to translate your feelings. LOL)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Monica-sa.. whoa.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monica-san&#8217;s hug attack pushed my face against her plump hills. Before, I used to get pressed directly to her chest, but now I have to bend down a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My height has increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t overdo it? Do you understand?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know. I know it and I don&#8217;t feel like overdoing it, so please stop this skinship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You see, I&#8217;m also a man &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow getting rid of Monica-san&#8217;s hug attack I went home and told my mother about the request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mother knew that I would stay in Stresen village for a while. So, she kindly hugged me and told me not to overdo it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Monica-san, it was a very gentle hug.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom, please wait. I&#8217;ll definitely protect you from the destruction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Author&#8217;s Note:-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to you all, I won 19th place in the different world reincarnation category of the fantasy genre. I couldn&#8217;t believe that the ranking will rise again from yesterday.</span></p>
