<h3>Side &#8211; Anastasia (2)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the result, it was the right choice to invite Allen. I didn&#8217;t want to see the unusual situation in which that woman cuddles upon not only His Highness but also on the other four men. Besides, his escort in this expedition was wonderful with consideration for our safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, I had never heard of the ruins being a goblin nest seven years ago. At that time, I was young and lived in the territory, so I didn&#8217;t know that there was such an incident. But, he was working in and out of the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild from that time. Entering and exiting the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild from the age of eight must have been a lot harder than I imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along the way, she suddenly said she wanted to go to a room, which is out of our planned route. And while clinging to His Highness, she fawns with the other men. She was repeating eccentricities like this that made me want to frown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I wasn&#8217;t driven by strong emotions, probably because I was completely interested in this expedition because of Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And above all, it was also wonderful after returning to the royal capital. The word genius truly suits Allen. He lacked basic knowledge, but after learning once, he absorbed everything like a sponge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a blink of an eye, he quickly acquired enough knowledge to withstand discussions with expert teachers, and to summarize the complex issues in an easy-to-understand and accurate manner. Furthermore, he, who shouldn&#8217;t have written a thesis, for some reason, was writing a thesis. It may be the result of understanding what to do after reading the past theories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got goosebumps for the first time seeing his talents. At the same time, to be able to discuss with him, I was happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness is too childish when compared to him. To be honest, I felt that His Highness was immature, but I shouldn&#8217;t say it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thesis-style report that he took the initiative in compiling was evaluated highly as the achievement of His Highness. And yet, Allen was slandered, saying that he just rode on His Highness&#8217;s horse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I couldn&#8217;t tolerate this kind of treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a firm protest, and I think that at least the teachers understand the situation.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I became a little worried about Allen. As usual, he can&#8217;t talk to anyone. Even if I try to do something about it, neither me, who is His Highness&#8217;s fiancée, nor my friends, who also have fiancées, can speak to him. Also, I can&#8217;t ask someone outside our faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when I was going to lose heart, a good event called the cultural festival came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s okay to invite him to this event. Thinking so, I tried to invite Allen again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, what is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Have you decided what you will do at the cultural festival? If not, why don&#8217;t you help His Highness again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said so, He replied to me with an apologetic look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Actually, I have already submitted an application for an Orc meat skewer stall.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Is that so? I&#8217;m looking forward to it. Good luck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I was honestly disappointed. I wanted to see the work of that genius up close again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, but if it&#8217;s absolutely necessary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a blunder. It seems to appear on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words were out of concern after reading the expression of an aristocratic daughter. But if I think about it carefully, all of his credits will be taken by His Highness again, just like the time of the report. It may have been rude to invite him in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking so, I declined the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay. It’s not a big deal. I&#8217;ll come to eat your skewers later in the festival.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of Orc, it is a speciality that can only be found in my friend Margaret&#8217;s hometown, Altmunt. As a result, it is a luxury item that is rarely available in this royal capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How on earth are you going to do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became more and more interested in Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- she will not even realise how this interest will change to affection in this festival.)</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I helped with what His Highness said on the theme decided by him. The theme is &#8220;About the downtown culture and life, along with the kingdom&#8217;s support system&#8221;. In short, it exhibits how that woman&#8217;s past lifestyle was and what could the kingdom&#8217;s support system do if it gets introduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Worthless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I said that we should go to see the downtown. I also suggest that we should listen to the people in the class who are from there and ask for their cooperation. But my opinion was not heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I gave up and decided to summarize the history and contents of the support system that can be found by looking up in the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, every time that woman got involved to provoke me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I have no idea what she is trying to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, even if I make a legitimate complaint, His Highnesses take that woman&#8217;s side and scold me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is nothing I can do to help him now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why on earth did the Crown Prince of our Kingdom change into such a fool?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I keep preparing for the exhibition with a feeling of impatience, and after some time decide to return to the dormitory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walked down the hallway, I saw that woman standing with her back against the wall. When I ignored her and tried to pass by, she said with a provocative smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What a klutz. How do you feel about your fiancée getting robbed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I heard those words, I lost my sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was you who made His Highness a fool!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, all my patience ran out at once, and when I noticed, I was waving my right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fue~cushion&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at that moment, I heard a sneezing sound that was too deliberate. Thanks to that, I returned to my senses and lowered my right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sneezing culprit was Allen!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Oh? Anastasia-sama? And Amy-sama also? Ah, maybe you were talking? Excuse me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pretending to be the bystander who didn&#8217;t see anything, he apologized and ran away intentionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This &#8230; Did I get helped?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Allen, I regained my composure and warned the woman, knowing that it was useless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems useless to say anything to you, but remember. Your Highness is the future king of this country. You, who do not understand the role of the royal family and the aristocrat, are not suitable for him. Don&#8217;t approach His Highness. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I walked toward the dormitory. I felt that woman&#8217;s gaze pierce painfully on my back.</span></p>
