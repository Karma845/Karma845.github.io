<h3>Chapter 22 - Villager A challenges the Great Dungeon of Orcs.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m now in Altmunt, the nearest town to the Dungeon of Orcs. However, at present, the Orc Dungeon is an undiscovered dungeon. So it is known as a town near the Orc Forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are a lot of orcs as they are overflowing from the dungeon. But, the town is safe from the troubles because orcs are hunted regularly for their meat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, since orcs are monsters, they do attack humans. But it seems that the damage to humans is less because a small group of people deals with them regularly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time my plan is, of course, traversing the Orcs Dungeon. Also, there is a permanent request to subdue the orcs in the guild of Altmunt. I will take it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately head towards the orc forest. The dungeon is located at the foot of a beautifully shaped mountain, like Mt. Fuji, that can be seen far beyond this forest. But, I will not go there today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I&#8217;m here to find out the effectiveness of my firearms against the orcs. In the game, the orcs took more damage than the hobgoblins, but they were horribly tough. In other words, their HP is high while the defence is low.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I activate the 【Concealment】 skill and proceed through the forest. Then, after walking through the forest for about an hour, I found an orc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, let&#8217;s try shooting with Nikov.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandan Dandan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I shot four bullets from behind, the orc fell easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After my laps in Goblin Dungeon, I thought about various things and changed Nikov&#8217;s bullets to a type of bullet called Hollow-point bullet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hollow-point bullets are those that deform and expand when they hit a target. If the bullets pierce the target then their killing ability increases. Even in my previous life, this type of bullet was mainly used for hunting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kalashi&#8217;s large calibre bullet may not pass through hard monsters, so I only changed the bullets for the small calibre Nikov.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just in case, I shoot another shot in its head, then start dismantling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Orcs are large monsters that are over 2 meters long. It&#8217;s too big, so carrying everything is impossible. I peeled off only the magic stone and rare parts of the meat. The rest were of less value. So I burned it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After walking for about an hour, I met another orc. Kalashi&#8217;s turn now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don Don Don Don</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like before, four shots in the same way. It seems that at least one shot hit. But, even after getting shot at, it can move. It became angry and rushed towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot a few bullets at the oncoming orc. One of them seemed to have hit its head, as it fell facing forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it stopped moving, I approached it. The bullet pierced its head brilliantly. The result was as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, it seems to be a good balance to use Nikov for normal hunting, and Kalashi for hard enemies that Nikov&#8217;s bullets can&#8217;t pass through. It may change later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the magic stone and collected as many edible parts and skin as I could have this time, then returned to town.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, I came to the entrance to the Dungeon of Orcs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This dungeon is a huge dungeon consisting of 100 layers in total. And its feature is that there are floor boss rooms on all floors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the orcs and their evolved monsters appear. There are no gorgeous treasures. Also, no major traps are there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to my memory, the treasures along the way are of Uncommon grade. But when you defeat the last boss you can get an Epic class item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Epic class item is certainly just an event item, and it must have been a decoration that has no value other than increasing the likability of the target. I do remember collecting it to acquire the events stills. (T/N:- it means event illustrations.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I aim for the lowest layer and proceed at once by the shortest route. This time too, I&#8217;m using the 【Concealment】 skill and Nikov actively. By collecting only the magic stones while leaving the defeated orc meat, I move forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, I arrived at the boss room on the first floor. The bosses here were 5 orcs. Only Nikov was enough to deal with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the Goblin Dungeon, the boss here is not much stronger than the monsters that appear in that hierarchy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I collect the defeated orc magic stone, I move on to the next level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The orcs that appeared became stronger as they went up in the hierarchy. Next to the orcs are the High Orcs, the Orc Mages, the Orc Priests, the Orc Generals, and the last floor&#8217;s boss, the Orc king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The General and the King are especially troublesome. The General is a versatile warrior who has excellent physical ability and also uses magic. And the King is the very king of orcs who is even stronger than the General, has higher intelligence, and also commands his subordinates to take organized actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came to the lowest boss room where the Orc King was waiting. The bosses here are one Orc King and two generals. Also, 10 subordinates consisting of Highs, Mages, and Priests will appear randomly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time there are 4 highs, 2 mages and 4 priests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Guoooooo&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King notices me, who opened the door of the boss room, and raises his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmly fired Nikov at the priest. When it ran out of bullets, I created a smokescreen to hide. Then, after hiding using the 【Concealment】 skill, I move towards the Mages and Priests to deal with them first in the usual way by firing Nikov. And then, the Highs were also dealt with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are only three left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the generals shoots an arrow of fire. I hurriedly jumped sideways to dodge it. At that moment, another general shot an arrow of fire which made me unable to avoid it this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use the 【Wind Magic】 skill to move the wind to blow it away, and fire Nikov in rapid succession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandan Dandan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the generals was hit on the left shoulder. He moaned in a way that seems to be painful. The King touches the general and casts healing magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, another general shoots an arrow of fire at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it is troublesome to do anything when the king is still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use the smokescreen again to activate the 【Concealment】 skill again and hide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King and the General took a formation that keeps their backs together. It&#8217;s an action that shows they understand that I&#8217;ll appear from behind them to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time my aim was not that. I threw a pepper-filled water balloon that blinded the Goblin Lord at the King&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gugaaaaa&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the King held his eyes down, the Generals trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t miss the chance and kept shooting Nikov at the two generals until I ran out of bullets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Generals weren&#8217;t moving anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King looks at me with blood lust. It seems the blindfold has been healed and he is unharmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Nikov&#8217;s bullet hit the King, it couldn&#8217;t penetrate his skin. Probably it didn&#8217;t have enough power to penetrate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I switched to Kalashi. And at that moment, the King started rushing towards me. Judging from the situation so far, he probably thought that he would not be damaged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has great intelligence even though He&#8217;s a monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Kalashi&#8217;s bullets are FMJ bullets that specialize in penetrating power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held Kalashi, aimed at the King&#8217;s head, and pulled the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dandandandandandandandandandandandandandandandan ……</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dosa~tsu</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, the King became a corpse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, with this it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recovered the magic stone and proceeded to the room with the Dungeon core. There is a treasure chest in front of the Dungeon core.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I slowly opened the treasure chest, there was a bracelet in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Fertility bracelet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Description: A bracelet with a prayer for the prosperity of descendants. Women equipped with this bracelet are more likely to give birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grade: Epic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Price: 10,000,000,000 cents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that&#8217;s right. I remembered. It is an event item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this what signifies Orcs nature! (T/N:- did my best to translate the tsukkomi, here is the raw オークでそれってそういう事か！ do comment me if it needs to be changed)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The memory of my previous life where I use to add such Tsukkomi is revived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this thing is too valuable. It will be hard to cash this one. Let&#8217;s take it as a source of funds for the worst case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I picked up the fertility bracelet, I touched the Dungeon core and moved outside.</span></p>
