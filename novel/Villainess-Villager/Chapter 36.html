<h3>Chapter 36 - Villager A Participates in a Party.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, days passed by, and Amy wasn’t pushed down the stairs by Anastasia either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be precise, Amy was trying to summon Anastasia to the stairs using her tricks, but every time that happened, Anastasia excused herself using the teachers or her entourages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, the end of the semester came without the event where Amy gets pushed down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there was also a final test, and the results were posted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place &#8211; Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place &#8211; Allen (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">3rd place &#8211; Margaret von Altmunt (491)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">4th place &#8211; Isabella von Luinberg (456)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">5th place &#8211; Amy von Brayes (451)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">6th place &#8211; Markus von Beinz (441)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">9th place &#8211; Claude Justine de Westerdale (421)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">10th place &#8211; Oscar von Wimlet (419)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">29th place &#8211; Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (396)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">38th place &#8211; Glen Weitberg (379)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">39th place &#8211; Leonardo von Jukes (261)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels a little refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I&#8217;ll correct it. It feels rather refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It serves you right!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, Anastasia, who was mentally cornered, had a breakdown and lost first place in her grade to Amy. As a result, she was further cornered, which led her to lose her calm in the condemnation event, so she requested a duel. But the result this time was, opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy dropped to 5th place in the grade, Anastasia returned to 1st place, and Anastasia&#8217;s cronies improved to 3rd and 4th place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, Crown Prince Karlheinz, who has been talking so highly of himself, got a result which was easy to find if counted from the bottom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even more! Leonardo, the future knight Captain, who tried to force Anastasia to admit her false charges, is at the bottom of the list for the second term consecutively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serves you right!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was looking at the bulletin board with that in mind, Anastasia called me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen. I didn&#8217;t lose this time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia&#8217;s voice is bouncy. I turn back and compliment Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations to Anastasia-sama. You got a perfect score.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, isn&#8217;t Allen&#8217;s also a perfect score? As expected. Congratulations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I obediently bow to Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun, as expected, good job.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Margaret-sama, congratulations on 3rd place.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned to Margaret&#8217;s voice, there I saw Margaret smiling and standing side by side with another one of Anastasia&#8217;s cronies. This seemingly unassuming person with brown hair and dark eyes was, I believe, the one who harassed Amy in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, but if I had put in a little more effort, I could have lined up with Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she is saying that, her expression is one of satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, she&#8217;s Isabella. She&#8217;s the daughter of Viscount Luinberg. Isabella, as you know, Allen is a scholarship student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isabella-sama, I&#8217;m honoured to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nice to meet you too, Allen-san. I&#8217;m sure we will be in the same class starting next term.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, Isabella was in class B until this term. But with this grade, she will definitely be in class A. Get along well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you so much. I look forward to working with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said so while greeting her, but unfortunately, I would be leaving this school when the condemnation event happens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A vague feeling of guilt remained in my chest.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that night, a graduation cum promotion party was held at the banquet hall in the royal castle, inviting many guests and all of the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s December now, so the school is going into winter break, which will continue until the coming spring, resulting in a long vacation. It seems the aristocrats with territories will return to help or learn by themselves. In-game terms, it is treated as a period for level grinding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the sons and daughters of the aristocracy have already gathered in the banquet hall. And they are chatting with each other wearing luxurious dresses. However, such gorgeous dresses and chats have nothing to do with me. I wore my usual uniform, and as usual, I&#8217;m standing by the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The food provided is all cold and expensive food, but since I will never have a chance to eat it again, I will take my time savouring it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia is with her cronies, and Amy is along with the Prince &amp; Co. as usual. I felt a little sad when I thought that today would be the last time I would see this scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the party was in full swing &#8211; although there was no alcohol being served &#8211; the best student from each grade was announced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, a graduating second-year student was called in. He had excelled in academics, magic, and swordsmanship, but he hadn&#8217;t had enough of it, so he had done some research and worked with a university professor to develop a new magic stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He went up to the stage, gave a speech, and then, for some reason, thanked the Prince and went down. The venue was filled with applause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it was the turn of us, freshmen. An announcement was made in the hall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The freshmen highest award goes to Crown Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the name was announced, the audience erupted in applause. However, the expressions on the faces of those applauding varied: some seemed to be congratulating from the bottom of their hearts, some looked disappointed, and others were not interested but were applauding just for the sake of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, no matter which route it is, the Crown Prince is always called here, and the condemnation of the villainess from the stage is the event in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The Crown Prince has achieved excellent results, especially in swordsmanship and magic, and has been involved in well-rounded research with the experts in academics, as well as deeply dug into social issues. This award will be in recognition of those achievements of his.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince went up to the stage and received the award as if it was a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he turned around and looked at us from the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, everyone, but this wasn&#8217;t something I could have done alone. Now, those who are being called come up on the stage. Claude Justine de Westerdale, you never cease to amaze me with your excellent eye for detail. Please continue to be my good friend.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Markus von Beinz, you are my rival in magics, but at the same time, your cool judgment has always helped me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leonard von Jukes, you have always been my sword, and I thank you for your tireless efforts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oscar von Wimlet, you never cease to amaze me with your ability to see the true value in things. I&#8217;m counting on you to keep up the good work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You can count on me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the capture targets go up to the stage. And after a pause, the Prince opens his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy von Brayes, I think I&#8217;ve grown a lot as a person since I met you. I hope you&#8217;ll always be by my side.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy happily ran up to the stage and into the arms of the Prince. However, many guests frowned at her unconventional behaviour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This achievement of mine was only possible with their help. I will not forget this and promise to  study hard to become a good king who guides the people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. You can do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will also support you with all my heart.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A farce took place on the stage, and the audience applauded it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was staring at the scene with cold eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And there&#8217;s one more thing to declare here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince declared in a clear voice and took a breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, come forward.&#8221;</span></p>
