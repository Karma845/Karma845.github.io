<p><b>Side &#8211; Amy (2):-</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels good to see the villainess getting more and more awkward these days. Even though she is different from me in many ways, her beauty is irritating. But I can see that her complexion is getting worse little by little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to understand because of her usual hard to read impression, but recently I meet her face to face every day, because of that, I can understand it. Your skin is getting rough little by little, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel sorry for you for getting rough skin at this age. (lol)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, she forcibly crashed into my and Karl-sama &amp; Co.&#8217;s performance, so we allowed her to help us, but she started giving her opinions. So obviously, you&#8217;ll get disliked by Karl-sama even more, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess should do what she is ordered, like a servant. Besides, how convenient of her to even do the errands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there should be an event where the villainess hits me, but I think it&#8217;ll happen later. Truth be told, she should misunderstand my lines and hit me, but as per the scenario, I need to act here for her to follow the settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, you are still here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s not cute like that, you&#8217;re not loved by Karl-sama, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Our engagement is not like that. It&#8217;s for the country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? But that kind of Karl-sama looks cute, don&#8217;t you know? I&#8217;m sure, Karl-sama and the citizens understand that a cute queen is more good, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, the air in the room got cold. Fufufu, she took it, she is angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess has two blessings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, because of her anger the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">is leaking out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I push one more time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? What&#8217;s wrong? It&#8217;s not good. Look, the future Queen is smiling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked into the villainess while making my deadly pose and smiled. (T/N:- a pose to make the men fall for her)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, are you insulting me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Noo, Anastasia-sama, you&#8217;re scaring me.&#8221; (T/N:- Imagine it as if doing it to anger someone.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, the villainess sighed and started preaching again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, already. Why didn&#8217;t you hit me!??</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Listen, this country has a social status system. It can&#8217;t be overturned even by the students of the same school. So behave yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s strange because Anastasia-sama and I are both humans. Everyone is equal before God.&#8221;</span></p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3CYCMjh/Image00035.jpg" />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s the story before God. I&#8217;m just telling you to behave according to your status. To begin with, who do you think you are? Cuddling with men who have fiancées. Don&#8217;t do anything that will mislead others!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice of the villainess is gradually getting louder. As expected, this woman likes Karl-sama even though she is being treated like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not the case, I and Karl-sama are friends. Also, Marx, Leo, Oscar, Claude are all-important friends. Don&#8217;t blame my friends!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s weird. Choose a man without a fiancé!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll not let an outsider like Anastasia-sama interfere with our friendship!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air got colder, and I thought she was going to hit me this time, but Karl-sama and the others came back. That&#8217;s sad. The timing was a little wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Anastasia. What the hell are you doing? Weren&#8217;t you both preparing things? Didn&#8217;t I warn you not to quarrel? Can&#8217;t you do that even though you usually say things while making yourself look great?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness! That&#8217;s, this woman!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama. I only wanted to get along well, but Anastasia-sama was rude to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that and hung down, Karl-sama gently hugged me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess made a loud voice, but Karl-sama shouted at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! Shut your impudent mouth now! It&#8217;s an order!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu~tsu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The relationship between me and you is when we are outside. Don&#8217;t bring that relationship to the school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Under&#8230;stood……&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess resumed her work as our servant with a hard to read look like that of a Noh mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How unsightly. Ah, it feels good.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the room with Karl-sama and others but came back saying that I had something to do alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stood in the hallway and waited, the villainess with that expression came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, really, that&#8217;s what it means. (T/N:- I don&#8217;t know what she is saying, but the translation was this only.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess ignored me and tried to pass by, so I grinned and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What a klutz. How do you feel about your fiancée getting robbed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the villainess heard that, she opened her eyes, and with her face bright red, she raised her right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, with this, the event will end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fue-cushion&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought so, someone got in my way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess, who was surprised because of that nerd&#8217;s ridiculous noise from his sneeze, did not hit me!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously don&#8217;t mess it up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was desperately trying to set the flag. This shitty nerd! Take responsibility! (T/N:- it feels awkward to hear(read) the famous &#8216;sekinin'(responsibility) word from that heroine.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Oh? Anastasia-sama? And Amy-sama also? Ah, maybe you were talking? Excuse me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That nerd, he ran away after saying something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, he is really making me crazy. After expelling the villainess, He will be next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy is a commoner, isn&#8217;t he? What are you doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems useless to say anything to you, but remember. His Highness is the future king of this country. You, who do not understand the role of the royal family and the aristocrat, are not suitable for him. Don&#8217;t approach His Highness. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess walked away when she said that with a look like the Noh mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, mou. It&#8217;s all because of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glared at the back of the villainess so much that I thought she might get a hole in her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is happening? That shitty nerd Allen shouldn&#8217;t even appear in the extra mode!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops. It&#8217;s okay. No one is here, I instinctively said to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, even so, I&#8217;m mad!</span></p>
