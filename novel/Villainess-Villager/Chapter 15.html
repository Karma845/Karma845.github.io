<h3>Chapter 15 - Villager A gets lost in the lost forest.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Course – clear, engine – On, take off”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on my homemade goggles and start the wind magic engine to launch the vertical takeoff and landing type wind magic glider, Buitor. Of course, the origin of the name is the Katakana version of VTOL. (T/N: for those who don&#8217;t know what Katakana is, it is a Japanese syllabary used for the transcription of words from foreign languages or loanwords.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buitor, along with me, accelerates as if sliding on the runway, and at the optimal speed it took off at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh! What happened to vertical takeoff and landing you say?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It consumes too much magical power and makes me tired, so I don&#8217;t do it when I don&#8217;t need it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Buitor can take off and land vertically. This has been demonstrated in research and development over the past two months</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, Buitor is similar to the previous wind magic glider, but has undergone significant improvements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like before, the propulsion engine is below the belly, and the style of manoeuvring Buitor is the same as the wind magic gliders so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the aircraft has a double structure, with two wind magic engines installed under the propulsion wind magic engine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The buoyancy for vertical takeoff and landing is obtained by taking in air from the front with those engines and discharging it from near the nose and tail of the aircraft directly below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, winglets are created at the tips of the left and right main wings, and a mechanism that transforms the winglets into a wind magic engine that assists attitude control during takeoff and landing is also incorporated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, a winglet is a bent up part at the tip of the main wing of an airplane. Winglets are also attached to the wings of the Hoda Jet, made by a major automobile manufacturer in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, Buitor can&#8217;t go against the limitations of physics &#8217;cause it is physically flying. Taking off with lift from the wings consumes much less energy than taking off against gravity with just the force of the wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the same reason, fighter jets that take off and land vertically do not normally take off and land vertically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this time&#8217;s destination is the lost forest. And the target item is the 『Scroll of No Chant』, which is sleeping before the entrance of the infinite corridor of the lost forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like this in the game settings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, there was a gentle sage who could use a lot of magic without casting spells. He used his magic to help people. One day, the wise sage went to the elf village in the lost forest to get the ingredients for the medicines, but he got lost and passed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it was said that he was unable to go to heaven because he died in the middle of his ambitions. So, by becoming a &#8220;scroll without chanting&#8221; he is waiting for someone to carry on his aspirations of helping people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no such boss battle for this scroll. It ended with a polite burial of the remaining corpse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And because the corpse was in front of the infinite corridor, I&#8217;m sure the wise sage was once captured in the infinite corridor but managed to escape with his power. It was said in the game that he might have fallen there due to exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, after passing through the lost forest, there is another elf village on Temple Street. But I have no use there, so I have no plans to go there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, you can&#8217;t enter unless you go there with an elf, who trusts you. And even if you enter with an elf, there is nothing particularly remarkable to see in the elf village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, a forced event occurs in the summer of the second grade. The village gets attacked by the monsters that live nearby, So the heroine will be asked by an elf, whom she met by chance in the town to help them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After defeating the monsters and saving the elf village, the queen of the elf will give her a fairy hair ornament. It is like a pass to the elf village. Where I&#8217;m going now, there will be no monsters and nothing should be happening. By the way, the setting of the scroll was that you get it by chance on the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It takes about two weeks to get to the Lost Forest by carriage from Lurden. It&#8217;s further beyond the northern mountains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll arrive in the evening, so let&#8217;s enjoy Buitor&#8217;s flight.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sunlight is barely reaching the surroundings of the mountain. According to the map I bought at the guild, I should arrive at the village of Linzea, but I can&#8217;t find a place like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The village of Linzea is the closest village to the lost forest and my destination. Even in the game, you have to go to the lost forest from this village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the current situation is not very good. Because of the deep forest, I lost sight of the highway, and I don&#8217;t know where I am. In short, I&#8217;m lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I don&#8217;t find it quick, the sun will set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just want to avoid the situation where I can&#8217;t find the village and had to look for a campsite for the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, strong monsters appear around here. Of course, I have brought my weapons, but I shouldn&#8217;t take any extra risks here. I can defeat monsters because of the surprise hit from using【Concealment】. I&#8217;m definitely not strong myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, if I fly around the forest properly-, the sun begins to set over the mountains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not good!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I started looking around impatiently, I found a part of the forest that was open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What if the village is in there?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself and turned Buitor toward it. Maybe I can make it in time before sunset, and if I can land on flat land, I&#8217;ll be able to find a campsite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually nearing the open place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is a village. I can see something like a house made of wood, and some human figures can also be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, in addition to it, I noticed that there was a gaping plain area some tens of meters away from the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I suddenly land in the village, it will make a fuss, so let&#8217;s land there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gradually lower the altitude while circling the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Vertical engine, start!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the speed and altitude have dropped a lot, I start the engine for a vertical landing. The intake and exhaust ports are opened and airflow begins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here on, fine control is important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to control the altitude of the aircraft while reducing the speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Altitude control engine, start!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Auxiliary engines attached to both wings also start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By sending magical power to the four engines and at the same time using the main engine well, Buitor&#8217;s speed gradually decreased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, magic power gets scraped off by the stone. Keeping in mind the practices, I calmly control the aircraft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And my Buitor landed safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the seat belt for safety and got off the aircraft, stepping on the ground with both feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m tired&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mutter involuntarily and stretch out greatly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hiding the Buitor, I start walking towards the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t move!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a man&#8217;s voice and several men appeared from the woods. They are all aiming at me with a bow and arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And to my surprise, their ears were long!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……How did this happen?</span></p>
