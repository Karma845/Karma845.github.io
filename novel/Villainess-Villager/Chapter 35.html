<h3>Chapter 35 - Villager A helps the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the season when the wintry wind blows. The tree leaves have fallen completely, and the clothes of the passers-by are ready for winter. As usual, I am enjoying the figurine lifestyle, but the stage of the game is gradually approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, if I remember, Anastasia&#8217;s condemnation event was after finishing the final exams, so there is another event that must be stopped before that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s also a template event that is common in otome games, where the heroine is harassed by the villainess and her entourage, and then finally pushed down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, unlike the game, Anastasia endures without doing such an act, and it seems that Margaret and the other entourages are also holding back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s unclear why Anastasia &amp; Co. are behaving differently from the game, as Anastasia and her entourage are different from Amy and me, who have reincarnated with the game&#8217;s knowledge. If not, they should try to act better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, regardless of the reasons, if this template event is stopped, Anastasia will not have any relation to the wrongdoings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, there is another difference in the game. It&#8217;s the relationship between Anastasia and the Crown Prince. Since the incident at the cultural festival, the relationship between Anastasia and the crown prince has completely collapsed. It has deteriorated to the point where they hardly speak even when they meet face-to-face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, this relationship breakdown was the result of the villainess being scolded by the Crown Prince after the completion of this template event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I&#8217;ve been watching it since summer vacation, Anastasia seems to have left the stage of being obsessed with the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better to become a queen only in shape if it stabilizes the country. Isn&#8217;t that the only thing in Anastasia&#8217;s head?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She should just throw away a man like him and look for her happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me thinking that, may be the proof that I have formed a bond with Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, just to be clear, even if the engagement between Anastasia and the Crown Prince is resolved gracefully, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible for me to come around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I can&#8217;t even speak to her first. And when the engagement gets called off, will Anastasia, the daughter of the Duke, not get marriage proposals from aristocrats and royalties from other countries, who want to connect with the Ramslet family, one after another?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there is no room for me to get in there. I think I already understood the reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, my real purpose is to protect my mother and the people who took care of me. Only that can never be compromised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the event should occur on a cold, rainy day, so let&#8217;s keep an eye on it until then.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days later, when I went to the classroom, the female students were unusually present this early and were whispering about the rumours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I listened to it, I got to know that Amy was harassed by burning the pen that she had taken good care of in the girl&#8217;s dormitory. After which Amy appealed to the crown prince that it must have been done by Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the crown prince who swallowed it called Anastasia and took her to the corridor as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m a figurine and a stalker, so when I left the classroom, I hid using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and looked for Anastasia &amp; Co. Then, I came across the scene where the Crown Prince, Amy, and the capture targets surrounded Anastasia alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia! give up already. What are you thinking, harassing the kind-hearted Amy by burning her pen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, I didn&#8217;t do that, and I have told my friends not to do this kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But considering the situation, there can be no one other than you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right? Miss Anastasia. No matter how cute Amy is, being jealous is ugly, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to support the Crown Prince, Prince Claude teases Anastasia with a ridiculous tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia sighs loudly when she sees the six with a frozen look. On the other hand, Amy hid behind the capture targets and grinned as if to provoke when she looked at Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. So it was you who burned it to create this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Anastasia speaks in a cold voice without changing her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be told such a thing without evidence. So excuse me, the lessons will start soon.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then after bowing, Anastasia turns to walk away. At which Leonardo grabs her arm and forcibly stops her steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait. The talk isn&#8217;t over.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leonardo von Jukes, I didn&#8217;t allow you to touch me. You, a Viscount&#8217;s son, dare to touch me, a Duke&#8217;s daughter, without permission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! If you plead guilty, I&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that a threat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s bad that you don&#8217;t plead guilty. There can be no one other than you who did this to harass Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after this, Anastasia didn&#8217;t change her expressions at all and looked at Leonardo with a cold expression. No, what&#8217;s behind those eyes may be contempt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it would be bad if it stays like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I disable</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, I deliberately made loud footsteps and approached Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me for disturbing you while you were conversing! It&#8217;s almost time for the class to start!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I kneel and thank my liege.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tch, enough. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that one word from the Crown Prince, Amy&#8217;s reverse harem returned to the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you &#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, it&#8217;s time. The class will start.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interrupted Anastasia&#8217;s words by saying that, and I hurried back to the classroom.</span></p>
