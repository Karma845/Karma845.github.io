<h3>Chapter 33 &#8211; Villager A makes a report with the Villainess.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the long summer vacation, which seemed short, was over in no time. After that exploration, I had to write a report, so my remaining vacation got spent on it. In the end, I couldn&#8217;t go to the Elven Village or the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason, Anastasia&#8217;s enthusiasm was not satisfied with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, from where should I start talking?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, let&#8217;s start from the day after the exploration was complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after the exploration, Anastasia summoned me in front of the school gate. And then we boarded a gorgeous carriage with the Ramslet family crest on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for coming. Also, thank you for guiding us yesterday. It really helped.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, about the matters of making a report.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First, I made an appointment with a dungeon expert, a history expert, and finally an expert in studying those ruins. We&#8217;ll be listening to their explanation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Do we have to do that much for independent research?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally spoke my thoughts. Because this is a summer vacation free study of junior high or high school level, it&#8217;s like going to a university professor to write a report of that level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t it overkill?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so, but it seems that was not the case for Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Allen is a commoner, so for these things, you can be sloppy. But, listen carefully. This report is for the Crown Prince, Prince Claude, and the future high aristocrats of our country.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, having great expectations for the future is simply the fame and hard work of their ancestors. I don&#8217;t think they have any potential.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t know when and where you will fall short if you submit a half-hearted or incorrect report.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Therefore, we should listen to the opinions of experts, understand them well, and compile a report based on that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure how the school report will make someone fall short, but it&#8217;s probably shameful or something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether the crown prince or the capture targets fall short, but Anastasia&#8217;s sincere feelings have goodwill in them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then let&#8217;s do it to the point where everyone will give praise!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I graduated from a famous national university in my previous life. I&#8217;ll be fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just like that, Anastasia successfully put me on it, so I decided to listen to the lectures of the expert teachers from various fields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after receiving the lectures from each expert teacher, we went to the Royal Palace Library and searched the literature. Furthermore, the content was discussed and summarized with Anastasia in the form of a proper academic thesis. Then, we asked an expert teacher to see the report, got the feedback, and finished it as a report.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, annoyingly, none of the Prince &amp; Co. helped with writing this report. We decided the day to meet and issue invitations many times. But every time we receive a reply of their absence in the name of the crown prince. (T/N:- I think it means the crown prince&#8217;s response to them on behalf of others.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this case, no matter how much of a duke&#8217;s daughter Anastasia is, she can&#8217;t be forced this much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to show the resulting report to the Crown Prince the day before the end of the summer vacation. By the way, the chief editor is supposed to be the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, he has a status, so I can&#8217;t help it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, despite all the work we did, the words of the Crown Prince were heartless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Long. Explain it in 3 minutes so I can understand immediately. I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, hmm. I know how it feels if you were my boss. It&#8217;s like reading a thesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, you&#8217;re a student in the same position as me, aren&#8217;t you? Is it okay to speak like this from this age?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to yell at him, but if I said that, I would get thrown into prison for lese-majesty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While enduring my anger, I explained it as simply as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After explaining the main points, the Crown Prince left, saying &#8216;good work&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was amazing that I didn&#8217;t yell at his back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness is that kind of person. I&#8217;m sorry, but please bear with it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was strangely impressive that Anastasia said that with a look that gave up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That expression does not show the love and attachment to the crown prince, as shown in the game. To me, it looked like a girl who gave up and accepted her fate as a piece of a political marriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the report that was completed in such a way naturally received high praise. As expected of his highness the Crown Prince, as expected of Prince Claude, and so on. Anastasia was also getting praised, but I got treated as a goldfish shit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure how the rumours went around. But I was treated as a scrap that got on the crown prince ride and had only his name entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in such a situation, I don&#8217;t have the opportunity to argue. Because I&#8217;m a commoner and my opponent is an aristocrat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wondering what this school was for. At least, I&#8217;m sure that human behaviour and such things are not present in its philosophy at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, only Anastasia is saying that I participated in the discussion as the leading role. But the current situation is that where the voices of those who are trying to curry favour to the crown prince are much louder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;ll have to bear this kind of lifestyle for another half year. If I put up with it for half a year and make the Prince &amp; Co. tattered in a duel, I will drop out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a good chance that I will get executed after that, but I think I have a good relationship with Anastasia, so in the worst case, I think me and my mother will be able to escape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, while convincing myself, I renewed my determination to endure this shit-like school life.</span></p>
