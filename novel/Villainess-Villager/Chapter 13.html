<h3>Chapter 13 - Villager A Dreams of VTOL.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oi Oi, Allen-boy. You&#8217;re all soaked. What the hell did you do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I, who crash-landed on the lake, came to the guild for a hot shower to warm my body, I was found out by master.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I made a small mistake and fell into the water, so I was wondering if I could borrow the hot shower.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yeah. Be careful. Newbies like you are the ones who easily die first. You can&#8217;t just leave your mother and die first, can you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered so, but this time Monika-san found me and started complaining to master.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Isn&#8217;t Allen-kun all soaked? What happened? No way! Rudolph-san! Wait, no matter how much you train him, you can&#8217;t wake him, who passed out, by pouring water. He is still a kid, you shouldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? wait a minute. He got soaked and came back. There was no practice today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Monika-san heard that, she looked at master with scornful eyes and smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so, well, that&#8217;s fine. Allen-kun, if you stand all soaked in a place like this, you&#8217;ll catch a cold. Come now, onee-san will wash it&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I can wash it myself, so it&#8217;s okay!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere became suspicious, so I ran away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Believe me, I&#8217;m not kidding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear Monika-san&#8217;s voice from behind, I wonder if it was a joke or not. In any case, I&#8217;m having trouble dealing with what to do when I&#8217;m pressed by that big-breasted nee-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I paid 1,000 cents to take a hot shower to warm myself up, then changed into the clothes I brought from home and returned to the guild reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master, I want you to buy this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I offer the treasure item I saw in the Frissen village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Name:</strong> Flame Knife</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Description:</strong> When cut, it has a low chance of dealing additional fire damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Grade:</strong> Rare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Price:</strong> 450,000 cents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen-boy as always a good connoisseur. How much do you hope it will be?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If it&#8217;s 400,000 cents&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a reasonable price. Good, It&#8217;s bought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My savings have increased by 400,000 cents. Of course, it&#8217;s still not enough to reach the target amount, so I need to earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s not the time yet to rush things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-boy, don&#8217;t do anything reckless, okay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s slow down for a while and start by making the VTOL, vertical takeoff and landing glider.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I spent about a month doing various research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I learned that there are two important things in making things with【Alchemy】skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is the blueprint. The accuracy of the finished product and the required magical power will change depending on how accurately you can imagine what you are making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, Amy made a high-performance carriage with a fluffy image, but it was only possible when she grew up dramatically as the main character at the end of the game and also because of her extraordinary amount of magical power. In other words, it&#8217;s impossible for me to do the same thing now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, it is important to prepare a blueprint that is as accurate as possible and imagine the structure in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the other one is to prepare the ingredients as precisely as possible. This is a disposition that I confirmed by conducting an additional test because there were many depictions of it in the game, but the amount of magical power required varies depending on the presence or absence of the substances used as the material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Particularly, it is almost impossible for me now to create anything from nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, even if there are not enough materials, similar materials can be used for synthesizing. This trend was especially noticeable in monster materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What makes me happy is that I don&#8217;t need to make it using only the Wyvern film, but can also significantly reduce the cost by mixing the bat monster&#8217;s film, which is relatively easy to obtain from Giant Bats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I learned a few things while controlling the aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, the positive discovery is that I have almost verified the material for transmitting magical power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To operate the rudder and elevator, I use the【Alchemy】skill with my left hand to transform it. At that time, I discovered that my hair was the most suitable material for transmission like an electric wire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a coincidence that I discovered this. At first, I was experimenting with monster materials from different types and parts of monsters. It happened to be that a hair fell on the experimental tools, which I accidentally used while being in a daze due to lack of sleep. Surprisingly, it worked well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the negative finding is that I can&#8217;t control multiple locations at the same time. This is a problem related to my ability. If I try to control something in one place, I can&#8217;t seem to be able to control another place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, if I fuel the engine with wind magic, I&#8217;m not able to operate the rudder or elevator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is pretty deadly and is quite difficult to achieve vertical takeoff and landing with just one engine. I need at least two like the Osprey, which became a hot topic in Japan. If possible four like a drone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached this conclusion, I decided to stop my research for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that, if I can&#8217;t use multiple spells at the same time, I will not be able to operate them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know, there is an item called </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll of Multiple Chants</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the top floor of a place called the Tower of the Sages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To capture this area high magical power is required, and even if I sneak in with the【Concealment】skill, I will not be able to climb it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if it&#8217;s the current me, I am confident that I can capture it in another way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I started designing the tools and procuring supplies needed to capture the Tower of the Sages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About alchemy, magic, chanting, and magic circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic is activated by properly using magical power to combine the methods of identifying the completed state and the process to achieve it as a set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chants are the words that describe the process of achieving the complete state that you imagined in your head. These words and the completed state imagined in your head are connected by magical power to activate the magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A magic circle is the description of the complete state and the process to achieve it. Magic is activated by applying magical power to it. It&#8217;s easy to understand if you think of it as a magical blueprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy: It&#8217;s a kind of magic where you create something by fusing the materials. Since in alchemy the complete state and the process of achieving it are very complicated, it is common to use magic circles instead of chanting.</span></p>
