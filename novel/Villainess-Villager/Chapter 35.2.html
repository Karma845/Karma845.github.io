<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (3)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For him to get in my way at the exact time when I was going to get hit, Is that nerd aiming for the villainess?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a villainess and has the worst personality, but her face and pedigree are good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, the villainess should get crazy after being coldly treated by Karl-sama. For her to get secretly helped by that nerd &#8230; it&#8217;s not good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because there is a difference in status, that nerd only has a one-sided crush on that person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why is it so irritating to think that there is a man who has feelings for her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it would be refreshing if I made that nerd fall for me and add him to my reverse harem, but it was better I stop thinking that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is better to deviate from the scenario after the game is cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, I don&#8217;t like his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but so sorry. The villainess will get abandoned and banished, then fall into darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but since she will get raped after being banished, Will I be able to see the despair in that nerd&#8217;s face?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because that nerd is a man of this world where virginity is important, What kind of reaction would such a man have if the woman he fell in love with becomes a non-virgin broken woman?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I&#8217;m excited just thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, I feel refreshed after imagining something fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. The scenario should still be okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This world revolves around me, its heroine!</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha. The cultural festival is over, but the misery of the villainess was awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really want to say it right on her face, but I will be patient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I didn&#8217;t expect Karl-sama to kick her out the day before the cultural festival. It&#8217;s different from the scenario, but this is also proof that Karl-sama and her relationship has broken, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, Karl-sama and that woman didn&#8217;t speak a word even if they met each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, this is the state where Karl-sama&#8217;s flag is 100% set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there are some things that are worrisome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, Karl-sama&#8217;s state should be after the events which will occur when the cultural festival was over, i.e. my belongings getting burned and I get pushed down the stairs by the villainess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I strategise things a little too fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I&#8217;m a little worried. If I keep these things as it is, I wonder if the events will trigger or not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It should &#8230; right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now that I think so, why am I not getting harassed like before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess always has a creepy expression like the Noh mask, treats me as nothing. She treats me like I don&#8217;t exist and doesn&#8217;t do anything to me. Also, that stupid class-B girl Isabella, who is supposed to be a crony and harasses me, doesn&#8217;t do anything either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m worried if this is the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I decided to ad-lib things like a play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The perfect moment came when she was the only one in the girl&#8217;s dormitory, so I put my pen and paper on the common desk and lit it on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I found the burnt pen with Karl-sama and others. When I made a scene, she got forced to come out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she was the first to get doubted as the criminal as there was no one else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came out, Karl-sama and his friends found out that there was no one else in this dormitory, so he was very angry for my sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt great already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, he returned to his room. Since it was a women&#8217;s dormitory, Karl-sama and his friends couldn&#8217;t pursue further in the middle of the common area, so they escaped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, according to the event, everyone gave me a pen to compensate for the pen that got burned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, it&#8217;s just like the scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next morning, Karl and his friends surrounded her to make her apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as expected, she didn&#8217;t apologize until the end. So Leo got angry for me even though there was a difference in the status of his and the villainess. This completes the reverse Harem Leo&#8217;s flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been nice if he had made her apologise by kneeling on the floor (T/N:-the so-called dogeza pose), but he was disturbed by that nerd again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but thanks to that, I wasn&#8217;t late for the class. Hmm, was that okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I&#8217;m looking forward to the condemnation event. Why can’t it come earlier?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t wait to see her desperate look.</span></p>
