<h3>Chapter 23 - Villager A Challenges the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m finally 13 years old.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the level-ups due to high-speed laps in the Orc Dungeon for about half a year, the achievements of orc hunting have accumulated, resulting in acquiring the Orc slayer title. Thanks to this, my rank increased to D, and the level also went up to 23. I heard that I have to take an escort request to reach rank C. But I don&#8217;t have any intention of doing it yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I refused the party invitation from my seniors, saying that I want to train alone for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, it seems that there has been a lot of fuss about the fact that orcs have stopped appearing in Altmunt recently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I want to believe it is not my fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have also saved money thanks to the regular trade of Elven honey. Now, I need 5 million more to reach the minimum target amount.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Allen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rank: D</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age: 13</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessing:</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind God</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Skills:</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Appraisal</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple Chant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">No Chant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Level: 23</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strength: D</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magical power: B</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Achievements: Goblin Dungeon Conqueror, Goblin Slayer, Orc slayer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the people in the elf village were doing well, and the airport was also maintained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The runway is only 300 meters long because I didn&#8217;t want to cut through the forest much. Also, I&#8217;m not worried about the landing because the brake function of Buitor has been strengthened. Also, The spirits of the wind help by providing a moderate headwind at the time of takeoff. So, VTOL is possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, in the village, it seems that it is usually used as a playground for children and as a place for practising archery. Even in the village, no one complains about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I&#8217;m not able to raise my level anymore in the Orc Dungeon, so I&#8217;m going to challenge a high difficulty dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon which I&#8217;m going to challenge next is the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain. The recommended capture level in the game is 30, the Orc Dungeon was 15, and the Valley of the Flying Dragon is 25. So you can imagine how difficult it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain is a famous dungeon that was already discovered, and a capturing race was held by the famous adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of now, the deepest floor record that has been traversed is only up to the 8th floor. It has a history of swallowing many famous adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, there were 30 floors in all. And it was a mysterious place with an empty sky even though it was located underground. The monsters that come out are all monsters that fly in the sky. Also, there were traps here and there that cannot be cleared without using wind magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt nostalgic of the fact that in my previous life I got game over when I charged into it without knowing that I could not capture it until I get the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Book of the Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Marx Route or the Valley of the Flying Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the story for later, the remarkable thing is that the treasures you can get in this dungeon are two </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. And the drop from subduing the boss at the bottom is the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the name suggests, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is an item that can revive the user only once even if he/she dies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a sword that evolves the blessing into</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">when equipped by a person who has the blessing of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. When you become a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, your tendency for getting </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> increases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, I equipped Leonardo, the son of the Chief of the Imperial Knights, with this item to awaken him. But I remember that </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> did not play an active part because of his low magical power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the last boss of this dungeon is Blizzard Phoenix. If I fight normally, it will be a strong enemy that I can hardly win now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blizzard Phoenix is ​​a terrifying monster that blows a strong snowstorm from far above, depriving you of sight and physical strength. Also, it unilaterally shoots an ice arrow from quite a distance like a rain hail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the size of the dungeon boss room is limited, so it is not much one-sided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, during the royal route, the trick was to defeat it by attacking the weak points with the powerful flame magic of Crown Prince Karlheinz. And if you get close enough, its defence power is not high, so you can defeat it even with a physical attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the physical attack goes through, my gun should also be able to handle it. With that in mind, I decided to challenge the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A D-rank adventurer, Allen, is it? Solo is deadly though. Something like this at that age. Well, no problem. You can enter. But if you don&#8217;t want to die, just look around the first layer only.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed my guild card and register for a free pass at the guild in Zeiben, the town closest to the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain. This dungeon is managed by the guild and can only be entered at rank D or higher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can enter it without permission. But if an item obtained in the dungeon under control is taken out of the dungeon by a person who was not registered for a free pass, then that person will be treated as a thief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this dungeon is usually challenged by A-rank and B-rank adventurers, in parties. A 13-year-old, D-ranked kid like me came challenging it would seem like a reckless guy who was daredevil, only to be ridiculed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m going to traverse it and capture it. Rather, I will be doing high-speed laps in this dungeon until I enter school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if I stand out anymore, it would lead to unexpected situations. So I&#8217;m not going to report after capturing it.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then left the town and came to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first floor is no different from other dungeons. What comes out of the cave is a blood-sucking vampire bat. It is a huge vampire bat of about 1 meter in length, and are a terrifying monster that sucks up all the blood in the body when it bites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I proceeded while using my </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> skill, about 5 vampire bats were hanging from the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is where the new weapon, the shotgun, comes into play. It&#8217;s a shotgun made from utilizing the results of Kalashi. I named it Saiga. The origin is, of course, the famous Russian shotgun, Saiga-12.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the contents are of a magic gun that is completely different from Saiga, but it looks quite like it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a lot of trouble to make Saiga function properly as a shotgun, but this time it was finally complete and ready for actual battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doon, Doon</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pulled the trigger, I was able to easily defeat the Vampire bats. It feels like overkill, but the shotgun is still great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After collecting the magic stones of the Vampire bats, I quickly head to the next floor. From the second floor, even though it is underground, it is bright and even the sky is there. It&#8217;s really a mysterious place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also from here, the dungeon-like area of ​​the wind mountain dungeon, where many bird monsters come out, continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Saiga in my hand, I walked deep into the dungeon.</span></p>
