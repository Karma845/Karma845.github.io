<h3>Chapter 27 - Villager A is overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the class.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since Amy treated the crown prince, who got injured by his runaway magic, she was harassed more or less, which may be a natural consequence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, when Amy enters the classroom, some students deliberately ignore her while gossiping quietly, but with a voice loud enough for her to hear, about the rumours, such as that she has negligible mana, a former commoner, has poor manners, a prostitute&#8217;s child, etc whether they are true or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve also heard rumours that, in the girl&#8217;s dormitory, she can&#8217;t find her belongings in her room sometimes. About this one, I&#8217;m not familiar with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, the harassment in the school was led by Anastasia&#8217;s so-called entourage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, because they disappeared from school after the civil war, it seems there was no clear description about them. It was written that some aristocrats were crushed, so they quit school. I think that&#8217;s what happened to them, probably. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I have witnessed many times that Anastasia was careful not to get herself involved in such low and worthless harassment when she saw such scenes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I usually use </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to hide while collecting information, but when I saw her at that time,  Anastasia was careful, so I think she was thinking about trying to stop it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Amy, on the other hand, is sneaking up on the crown princes and the other capture targets with a cat-like voice, ignoring all the bullyings. It seems that her character is quite different from Amy in the game. Well, the game did not show any scenes other than the event. So it may have been this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, a girl who has lived as a commoner suddenly gets taken over by the Baron family and enrolled in a school full of aristocrats and gets bullied. If the crown prince and the sons of influential aristocrats take care of her, then it may be unavoidable to fall for them while relying on them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, because of such circumstances, the atmosphere of the class is already the worst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls in the class divide themselves into Anastasia&#8217;s and the Crown Prince&#8217;s factions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia&#8217;s faction did want to eliminate Amy, as I explained earlier. But they don&#8217;t seem to have much going on because Anastasia herself has stopped doing anything. Also, their number is overwhelmingly small.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the Crown Prince&#8217;s faction is not monolithic. They appear to be using Amy to oust Anastasia. However, the Crown Prince&#8217;s faction doesn&#8217;t care about Amy. So they are often seen backbiting and harassing her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, the crown prince has a lot of problems in his behaviour. Despite having a fiancé, he only spends his time with Amy. He does not even talk to Anastasia, except when necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the people around me are planning to oust Anastasia because of that. But honestly, I want them to stop doing sloppy things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it&#8217;s royalty or aristocrats, they&#8217;re collecting taxes from the commoners and living a luxurious life. So I want them to at least fulfill their responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially the crown prince, since he has to unite the country as the future king, but what he does is intolerable. Anastasia is the daughter of the Duke of Ramslet, who controls the southern breadbasket, which boasts the country&#8217;s largest wheat production.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can understand the meaning of this marriage of convenience, right!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Amy is Baroness Brayes, from a so-called ordinary aristocratic family. She is not particularly poor or rich, but that doesn&#8217;t mean she has strong connections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the likes of the Brayes family, it would be profitable if Amy becomes queen even if she was an ordinary child. But for the country, the disorder is inevitable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back on the history of this country that I have learned, there are many stories of the queens, who had a weak backing at her parent&#8217;s house, being replaced by the daughter of a high-ranking aristocrat. For example, she was forced to divorce when her parent&#8217;s house collapsed or was not suitable. Or she was assassinated when it was terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, for the benefit of this country, the crown prince should take Anastasia as a queen and Amy as a royal concubine, ie. a mistress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, this country is monogamous, so he can&#8217;t have a concubine. But the rich are openly flirting with their mistress, and I&#8217;ve never heard anyone blaming them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, after all, this world is the world of that annoying otome game. And according to fate, the royal capital and I, my mother, master, Monica-san, and my senior adventurers are all on the road to ruin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling depressed, I let out a big sigh and walked to the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, today also, the day of sitting around the corner of the classroom as the air began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, by the way, I&#8217;ve successfully established the position of a statue. Nobody talks to me, and I&#8217;m a commoner, so I can&#8217;t talk to aristocrats except when necessary in class. Perhaps they think my presence is thin, so they don&#8217;t care about my whereabouts all the time. Probably I&#8217;m treated as a commoner who can only study.</span></p>
