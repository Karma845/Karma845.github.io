<h3>Chapter 17 - Fiancee and Heartbreak</h3>

<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri first looked at the girls who were with them.</p>



<p>Hijiri looked at Arisa, and Yuzuru looked at Tenka.</p>



<p>Then they turned their gazes to their companion girls.</p>



<p>Yuzuru looked at Arisa, and Hijiri looked at Tenka.</p>



<p>Arisa had a very troubled expression on her face.</p>



<p>Then she looked at Yuzuru and gave a small nod.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have to deceive them skillfully.</p>



<p>I thought I heard such a voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Once again, what an odd coincidence, Hijiri, and Nagiri-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217; s right, Takasegawa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both of them said this with calm expressions, their initial agitation gone.　</p>



<p>As expected of people from Ryozenji and Nagiri, they are very good at what they do.</p>



<p>Then the two of them glanced at Arisa, who was standing next to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Arisa Yukishiro, in the same class as Takasegawa-san. Nice to meet you, Ryozenji-san and Nagiri-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa also made a small bow with the fake smile that she usually wore at school.</p>



<p>She looked like a well-mannered honor student.</p>



<p>“I’m Yuzuru&#8217;s friend, Hijiri Ryozenji.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Tenka Nagiri, a classmate of Ryozenji-kun”</p>



<p>After exchanging greetings, we got down to business.</p>



<p>The one who started it first was Hijiri.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.So Yuzuru, what are you doing with Yukishiro-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just happened to run into her here &#8230;&#8230;. Isn&#8217;t that right? Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I happened to meet Takasegawa-san by chance,&#8230;&#8230;, and we decided to play tennis together &#8220;</p>



<p>It was a bit of improvisation, but Arisa went along with it.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t strange at all, since there were facilities like batting machines here where one could play by themselves.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll ever accidentally bump into a classmate though.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Are you guys close?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To the point where if we happen to bump into each other, we might play tennis together, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the same class after all&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not an answer at all, but it&#8217;s okay because I don&#8217;t plan to answer it in the first place.</p>



<p>Hijiri also guessed that Yuzuru did not want to answer.</p>





<p>He didn&#8217;t say anything in particular.</p>



<p>Now, it was Yuzuru&#8217;s turn to ask.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about you, Nagiri-san and Hiriji?”</p>



<p>&#8220;We met here by chance, too. Right, Nagiri?”</p>



<p>&#8220;We were playing tennis a while ago. We thought we&#8217;d go bowling now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hijiri and Tenka said this as they took advantage of Yuzuru and Airisa&#8217;s lie.</p>



<p>Ah, that&#8217;s a lie&#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a date for sure, Yuzuru guessed, but he didn&#8217;t go into it deeply.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230; The important thing is that we were able to confirm each other&#8217;s intention to hide this matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230; Please don&#8217;t tell anyone about this. I don&#8217;t like to make a big deal out of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand&#8230;&#8230;. Please take care of this side, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri promised each other to keep this a secret.</p>



<p>Yuzuru saw off Hijiri and Tenka, and then looked at Airisa.</p>



<p>She raised her well-defined eyebrows and asked Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;Will it be okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a tight-lipped guy, so it should be fine&#8230;&#8230;. If he tells anyone anything, we might let it be known that Nagiri and Ryozenji are having an affair. I&#8217;m sure he wouldn&#8217;t like that either, so he probably won&#8217;t talk about us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope it is so.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was understandable that Arisa was worried.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t know Hijiri&#8217;s personality. She probably only has the impression that he is a flirtatious person.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also doesn&#8217;t know Tenka&#8217;s personality (nor does Arisa).</p>



<p>The impression of her appearance and demeanor is that of a ladylike Yamato Nadeshiko (<em>TN: the ideal Japanese girl</em>)&#8230;&#8230;, but what about her personality?</p>



<p>According to Hijiri, she&#8217;s &#8220;like a demon&#8221;.</p>



<p>(But would you go on a date with a demon?)</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to think about it too much, but he might have said &#8220;demon&#8221; in the same way a second-grader might say something bad about a girl he likes.</p>



<p>If that was the case, Yuzuru thought, it would be very amusing and he would make fun of him someday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are those two people in a relationship?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re lovers, but I&#8217;m sure they have some feelings for each other. If not, they wouldn&#8217;t have come here alone together.&#8221;</p>



<p>And after saying that, Yuzuru realized.</p>



<p>It was a big boomerang for them, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Takasegawa-san. Are you waiting for me to interject there?&#8221;</p>



<p>As expected, Arisa noticed and said in a somewhat exasperated voice.</p>



<p>And looked at Yuzuru with slightly cold eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are a little different. We have to play the role of two lovers.&#8221;</p>



<p>He scratched his cheek and said as if to make an excuse.</p>



<p>It is natural to say that they are here to report to the parents of both parties that they have been on a proper date because they are lovers and fiancées. But usually, people do not go on dates unless they have the appropriate feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we play tennis?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.”</p>



<p>Feeling slightly awkward, they decided to quickly end the conversation and start playing tennis.</p>



 


<p>&#8220;There was some trouble at first, but it was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the way home.</p>



<p>On the way to take Arisa home, Yuzuru muttered to himself.</p>



<p>Arisa nodded as if to agree with him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it was. You&#8217;re very athletic, Takasegawa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You too. It was great for someone who has only taken a few lessons for tennis in physical education. &#8220;</p>



<p>At first, the two of them only continued to play rallies. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>After we discovered that we both could play tennis reasonably well, we played a couple of matches.</p>



<p>Yuzuru won the match because of his superior muscle strength and stamina, but Arisa also put up a good fight.</p>



<p>In terms of ability (excluding gender), it seems that they are evenly matched, or perhaps Arisa is slightly better.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try other games next time. You can play &#8230;&#8230; bowling and darts, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, we can do that. Let&#8217;s come back next time we have a chance.&#8221;</p>



<p>He naturally made a promise to play with her next.</p>



<p>Yuzuru looked at the profile of Arisa as she walked next to him.</p>



<p>The setting sun made her flaxen hair shine golden and brightly illuminated her beautiful features.</p>



<p>Her art-like appearance was slightly torn.</p>



<p>It was a natural and soft expression, different from the artificial and inorganic expression she showed at school, which she only showed in front of Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just thinking how great it is to have this kind of relationship with you&#8230;..The matchmaking was a hassle, but I&#8217;m really glad I met you.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said this, Arisa also gave a small nod.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m really glad that I was able to make friends with Takasegawa-san. I would never have gone to a place like that by myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>She gave a slight smile as she said this.</p>



<p>For a moment, Yuzuru&#8217;s heart made a sound.</p>



<p>It was like an illusion that he had fallen in love, that he had started to like her.</p>



<p>(&#8230;&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s probably just my imagination)</p>



<p>However, when he looked at Arisa’s face again, no such feelings came to mind.</p>



<p>Just a feeling that it is beautiful as if you were looking at a work of art or a flower.</p>



<p>It was a little bit of a relief for Yuzuru.</p>



<p>While this exchange was going on, we reached the vicinity of her house.</p>



<p>Feeling a little regretful, I was about to say goodbye to Airisa.</p>



<p>But then.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro-san!&#8230;&#8230;Long time no see.&#8221;</p>



<p>A boy who looked to be around the same age as I approached us.</p>



<p>Yuzuru looked for a person whose face matched his in his mental picture book&#8230;&#8230; but he couldn&#8217;t find any&#8230;</p>



<p>He concluded that he was probably a student from a different high school.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kobayashi-san, right? It&#8217;s been a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know each other?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We were classmates in junior high school.&#8221;</p>



<p>The expression on Arisa’s face was &#8230;..the usual masked expression she would show at school.</p>



<p>But it is not easy to tell the difference between the two unless you know her as well as Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strange coincidence that we meet at this place&#8230;&#8230; How is high school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fun. How about you, Kobayashi-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that, Arisa smiled at him.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the usual fake smile.</p>



<p>Yuzuru reaffirmed that the sudden smile from the expressionless face had misled many men.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s just normal for me. By the way, that person is? &#8220;</p>



<p>Kobayashi turned his gaze towards Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Somehow, Yuzuru sensed a hint of jealousy or hostility in his gaze.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Takasegawa, one of Yukishiro&#8217;s classmates. Nice to meet you, Kobayashi-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru stepped forward, then gave Kobayashi a social smile.</p>



<p>Kobayashi&#8217;s face showed a slight flinch.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, uh, &#8230;&#8230; nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then he fell silent.</p>



<p>Arisa, who was acquainted with Kobayashi, looked at me as if to say, &#8221; What should we do?&#8221;.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru and Kobayashi have no connection to each other, and as long as Arisa and Kobayashi are silent, this is the end of the conversation.</p>



<p>Then, as if he couldn&#8217;t stand the awkward silence anymore, Kobayashi suddenly opened his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8221; Well, I&#8217;ll be going now. See you next time, Yukishiro-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that, he ran off into the dusk.</p>



<p>Yuzuru pointed to the back of his figure and said to Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he likes you&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to be told.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Arisa sighed deeply.</p>



<p>She looked very tired.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy for me to tell someone clearly that I don&#8217;t like them if they confess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8230; you can’t just abruptly tell someone that you don&#8217;t like them when they haven&#8217;t said anything after all&#8221;</p>



<p>To be continuously approached by a guy you don&#8217;t even like.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt a little bit of sympathy for the beautiful girls for their difficulties.</p>



<p>In addition, he also sent his condolences to Kobayashi-kun, whose heartbreak was already confirmed.</p>
