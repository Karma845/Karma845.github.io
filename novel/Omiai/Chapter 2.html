<h3>Chapter 2 - Mummified Mummies</h3>

<p>I didn’t want to attend an arranged marriage meeting, so I put out unreasonable condition, which could never be met, but a beautiful girl from my class came along.</p>



<p>Is there such a story?</p>



<p>And Yuzuru sighs.</p>



<p>(No way &#8230; I didn&#8217;t think that Arisa Yukishiro was on the old man&#8217;s network. &#8230;&#8230; I shouldn’t have taken Old man’s network lightly.)</p>



<p>Maybe that old man is invincible within Japan?</p>



<p>And again, while being impressed by the awesomeness and obsession of the old man &#8230; I stare at Arisa in front of me.</p>



<p>Wherever you look at it, she is a well-rounded beauty, like a work of art.</p>



<p>“Likewise, I am Takasegawa Yuzuru. …&#8230;It’s been a while!”</p>



<p>Yuzuru also sits on the floor and returns the greeting with his hand.</p>



<p>Now that situation has come to this, I have no choice but to refuse her politely so as not to be rude.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa do not care about the arranged marriage, but their guardians (Grandfather and Father in Yuzuru&#8217;s case, and Foster father and Foster mother in Arisa&#8217;s case) began to get excited, saying things like, &#8220;I was surprised that they were classmates,&#8221; and &#8220;Maybe this is fate” without their permission.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa showed pasted-up smile while giving appropriate response saying, “Yes, you&#8217;re right. I was surprised.” “I was surprised”.</p>



<p>And, after some time……</p>



<p>Their respective guardians suggested , “Why don&#8217;t you two young people get to know each other better while admiring the view of the garden at a restaurant?”.</p>



<p>Unable to say no, Yuzuru went out to garden with Arisa.</p>



<p>Going out to the garden while escorting Arisa. The view of the garden was truly breathtaking as it is used as a matchmaking venue.</p>



<p>(Well…&#8230;How should I refuse?)</p>



<p>You can usually say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we are a good match&#8221; and turn down a matchmaking, but it&#8217;s like saying in a roundabout way, &#8220;You&#8217;re not attractive&#8221;!.</p>



<p>As long as I came to the matchmaking, I have to show some interest…&#8230;or else I may end up hurting her if I turn her down poorly.</p>



<p>Even though we don&#8217;t have much to do with each other to begin with, we are in the same class.</p>



<p>I don’t want to feel stiff when thinking about today event.</p>



<p>“Um, Takasegawa-san……”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>As Yuzuru was hesitating, Arisa, who had been silent until now, spoke up.</p>



<p>She tightened her grip on the cloth of her kimono and bowed her head.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m really sorry. I was forced to accept this matchmaking by my foster father. I originally had no intention of getting engaged!”</p>



<p>After hearing those words, Yuzuru felt a sense of relief as if the tightness in his chest was finally lifted.</p>



<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.. What, you too?”</p>



<p>“…&#8230;you too?”</p>



<p>“Like you, I was also forcibly brought in here. &#8230;&#8230; I figured they would back off if I put out a unreasonable conditions. Like If you want to me to go to a matchmaking, bring me a blonde haired, blue-eyed girl! I didn&#8217;t think they would really bring someone along”</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said that with a sigh, Arisa clapped her hand and said, “I see”.</p>



<p>“So that’s what it is”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I heard that Takasegawa-san had nominated me. …&#8230;So I agreed to it” (She is talking about his Grandfather)</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Sorry for the inconvenience”</p>



<p>“No, it&#8217;s mutual. To be precise, &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s my foster father who caused an inconvenience, It seems that Mr. Takasegawa talked to him and he got super excited.”</p>



<p>When it became clear that neither of them wanted to get engaged &#8230;&#8230; somewhere, the distance between them got narrowed.</p>



<p>Yugen chuckles inwardly at how strange it is that they don&#8217;t like each other, but it function as a common topic of conversation and he feels a sense of familiarity.</p>



<p>“Takasegawa-san. …&#8230;I have one suggestion”</p>



<p>“Suggestion?”</p>



<p>“Wouldn&#8217;t you rather have a false, fake『Engagement』??”</p>



<p>“…… I see”</p>



<p>In other words, it is a proposal to disguise &#8220;Engagement&#8221; and fool both guardians.</p>



<p>While Yuzuru and Arisa are “Engaged”, neither side will talk about noisy matchmaking.</p>



<p>Using “Engagement” as a shield, both side will enjoy their free romance.</p>



<p>And when we grow up and become capable to go against our parents, we will annul our &#8220;Engagement&#8221;</p>



<p>That will definitely be the case.</p>



<p>“Hmm &#8230; I can&#8217;t say &#8220;yes&#8221; right now. It seems to be difficult”</p>



<p>However, it is a difficult matter whether the effort to hide the disguise of &#8220;Engagement&#8221; for a long time is well-balanced with the effort to keep refusing the matchmaking.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s nerve-wracking to keep up the act.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t reply so easily.</p>



<p>“I see &#8230; I&#8217;m looking forward to a good reply”</p>



<p>Arisa looked a little depressed, but soon a soft smile appeared on her face.</p>



<p>At school, It’s a gentle expression which is secretly feted and misleads boys.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru only sees it as a forced smile.</p>



<p>And, at that time.</p>



<p>Meow, Cat&#8217;s meow could be heard.</p>



<p>“Takasegawa-san, Takasegawa-san! Over there!”</p>



<p>“Yup? That’s &#8230; a cat”</p>



<p>Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t know the age of the cat, but it&#8217;s probably under one year old.</p>



<p>A small cat was meowing on the tree.</p>



<p>“What a stupid guy. Why would you climb the tree when you are afraid of descending”</p>



<p>“Why would you climb when you can’t get down? …… But what should we do? If we don’t do something It might hurt himself”</p>



<p>Arisa says in uneasy voice.</p>



<p>Apparently, she is a cat person.</p>



<p>Whenever cat wanders around tree branches, Arisa also follows it in fluster.</p>



<p>“Should I call inns employees”</p>



<p>“But &#8230; wouldn&#8217;t it fall before they arrive?”</p>



<p>“…… Well, Indeed!”</p>

<p>The movements of cat is starting to get dangerous from earlier.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who isn’t particularly fond of cats, was also starting to feel nervous.</p>



<p>“What should I do &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t have any experience in tree climbing,&#8230;&#8230; So, what about you, Takasegawa-san?”</p>



<p>She implicitly asked, “Can you help the cat?”</p>



<p>I don’t have any reason to help the cat, nor do I have any obligation to listen to Arisa&#8217;s wishes, but &#8230;…</p>



<p>If the cat falls down and dies, it will be bad for my conscience.</p>



<p>“I am a dog person, but …&#8230;It can’t be helped”</p>



<p>Yuzuru muttered to himself and began to untie his obi and take off his clothes.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s milky-white skin turned rose-colored and turned away in a panic.</p>



<p>“Hey! Why are you suddenly taking off your clothes!”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry. I was wearing a t-shirt and pants underneath, so it’s okay”</p>



<p>“If, If that’s the case, please say so from the beginning……”</p>



<p>After seeing her flustered, those stories about not being in a relationship with anyone seemed to be true.</p>



<p>If a little bit of undressing is enough to make her face turn red and confused, her immunity is really poor.</p>



<p>Yuzuru messily folded his kimono and handed it to Arisa.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro, you …&#8230;are good at sports, right?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Ah, yes”</p>



<p>“If the cat falls before I can get to it in time, use that as a cushion to catch it”</p>



<p>After saying that, I put my hands on the fine tree.</p>



<p>It’s been a long time since I climbed a tree, but…… Fortunately, the tree looks easy to climb (Which is probably why the cat climbed it), So I think I can handle it.</p>



<p>Yuzuru quickly climbs onto the tree.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the cat shows no sign of escaping.</p>



<p>“Alright…… I caught it!”</p>



<p>I succeeded in rescuing a cat without difficulty.</p>



<p>I felt relieved, and relaxed for a moment.</p>



<p>…… That was bad.</p>



<p>“Meow!!”</p>



<p>“Ouch! oh, hey, you, towards your lifesaver…&#8230;don’t go wild…..hey……”</p>



<p>I started to lose my balance.</p>



<p>Before I realize I was getting closer to the ground.</p>



<p>Yuzuru hurriedly adjusts his position, but…</p>



<p>“Gahhh!!”</p>



<p>“Ah, Takasegawa-san!?”</p>



<p>His right ankle was bent grandly.</p>
