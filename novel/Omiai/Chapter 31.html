<h3>Chapter 31 - Fiancee in Goldfish Scooping</h3>


<p>After that, Yuzuru bought some takoyaki and Arisa bought some candied grapes.</p>



<p>Unlike the candied apples, the candied grapes were a big hit with Arisa because they were small and easy to eat.</p>



<p>&#8220;What should we eat next?　I think it&#8217;s time for something sweet. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, goldfish scooping. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa raised a small voice.</p>



<p>She stopped and stared at the stall.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to try it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8230;&#8230;, but I&#8217;ve never done it before. It&#8217;s difficult, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Everything is a challenge, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>He encouraged her, but she seemed to be lost in thought.</p>



<p>Huh?　Yuzuru thought that if she wanted to do it, she should do it, but he soon got the point.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t keep it, we&#8217;ll just take it to my home. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We have a pond and the goldfish I caught in the past are still swimming there.&#8221;</p>



<p>The goldfish in the goldfish scoop game may be of poor quality, to begin with, or they may be stressed out from being chased around, so they die easily.</p>



<p>However, the goldfish that have overcome this tendency is very stubborn.</p>



<p>They can live for more than ten years without hesitation.</p>



<p>Yuzuru took Arisa, who was relieved to hear that Yuzuru would take care of the goldfish, and went to the stall.<br><br></p>



<p>At first, the owner of the stall smiled and said, &#8220;Welcome,&#8221; as if he had a new customer, but when he found out that it was Yuzuru, he frowned.</p>



<p>&#8220;Geez!　It&#8217;s the brother from Takasegawa!　I&#8217;ve already told you that siblings are not allowed in here!&#8221;</p>



<p>The owner of the other stall was very friendly to Yuzuru, so this stall owner&#8217;s attitude was surprising to Arisa.</p>



<p>She looked up at Yuzuru with a surprised expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What did you do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221;I overfished the goldfish a long time ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How many goldfish did you catch?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How many you ask? &#8211; Fifty, including my sisters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cruel.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now that he thought about it, he was about to destroy the store.</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru and Ayumi were very young at the time.</p>



<p>Incidentally, Yuzuru&#8217;s father later paid for the goldfish, so it didn&#8217;t go out of business.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8230;.. It&#8217;s not me who will scoop them up, it&#8217;s her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said and patted Arisa on the shoulder.</p>



<p>Arisa bowed to him.</p>



<p>The owner of the store was surprised and widened his eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, &#8230;&#8230;, that&#8217;s quite a pretty girl. I&#8217;d like to say that I&#8217;d welcome such a lovely girl &#8230;&#8230;, but I don&#8217;t suppose she&#8217;s an expert goldfish scooper, is she?”</p>



<p>&#8220;She has no experience in scooping goldfish.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; FIne then.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the time being, he seemed to be convinced.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>The shopkeeper gave Arisa a bowl and a poi in exchange for money. (<strong>TN</strong>:<em> Poi: the scooper)</em></p>



<p>Arisa rolled up her arms and dunked her poi into the water with a nervous look on her face.</p>



<p>Then she pulled it up on the goldfish, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>The paper was torn.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm &#8230;&#8230; It is difficult. Are you sure you can scoop it up with this paper?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your boyfriend and his sister almost destroyed our house with that paper.&#8221;</p>



<p>The owner of the store said pleasantly.<br></p>



<p>Probably because he realized that Arisa was a real inexperienced person.</p>



<p>From his point of view, she was a good duck.</p>



<p>However, they cannot afford to waste too much money.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I want to show her how it&#8217;s done, so will you let me do it? I&#8217;ll pay you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, Not you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I will return what I scoop up. Also, I won&#8217;t do anything to weaken them by overfishing. I want to show this girl(friend) a cool side, you know&#8230;&#8230;.. Please help me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Can&#8217;t help it then.&#8221;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a good guy at heart, so when Yuzuru brought up the idea of the girlfriend, he was easily won over.</p>



<p>However, the word &#8220;girl&#8221; here is a synonym for Yukishiro Arisa and does not mean girlfriend.</p>



<p>So Yuzuru was not lying.</p>



<p>(<strong>TN: </strong><em>The word “Kanojo” in Japanese can mean ‘girl’ or ‘girlfriend’ depending on the situation. Here Yuzuru used it to deceive the shopkeeper. It’s lost in translation)</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru took the poi and began to lecture Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you lift it up and down vertically, the paper will tear. So drain the water and move it at an angle when you pull it up or put it in.&#8221;</p>



<p>If possible, one should try not to put the tail on it, but it seems impossible for a beginner like Arisa, so he taught her from the first rudiments.</p>



<p>Then she tried practicing with one or two of them in front of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we try it together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Letting Arisa hold the poi, Yuzuru went behind her.</p>



<p>He grasped her hand and moved it slowly to scoop up the goldfish.</p>



<p>When it was the third one,</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, do I have to let these go too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course .&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what the shopkeeper told him, so he released the three goldfish back.</p>



<p>Then he got a new poi and gave it to Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Try it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Holding the poi with a more serious expression than usual, she slowly approached the goldfish.</p>



<p>The target was the ones that came up close to the surface.　</p>



<p>She dipped the poi under the goldfish and scooped it up.</p>



<p>The goldfish were placed on the paper.</p>



<p>Yuzuru quickly pulled out a bowl, and Arisa placed the goldfish in it.</p>



<p>&#8221; I did it, I did it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa was beaming with joy.</p>



<p>She was in a good mood and was smiling happily.<br></p>



<p>She is beautiful and pretty enough in her normal state, but when she smiles&#8230;&#8230;, she looks much more attractive than usual.</p>



<p>This is a fact that only Yuzuru knows.</p>



<p>&#8220;You did it. As expected of Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru patted Arisa on the shoulder.</p>



<p>Normally, he wouldn&#8217;t be so careless as to touch her body, but today he was in the mood for it and let himself be carried away.</p>



<p>&#8211;In the meantime, Arisa was not particularly bothered and smiled happily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hurry up and do it, will you?&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the shopkeeper&#8217;s blunt words as he turned away brought him back to himself.</p>



<p>Arisa’s cheeks blushed slightly, and Yuzuru also looked at the goldfish out of awkwardness.</p>



<p>Then she scooped up three goldfish, bringing her total to five.<br></p>



<p>It was a great achievement for her first time.</p>
