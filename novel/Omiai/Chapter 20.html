<h3>Chapter 20 - Unintentional Coincidence</h3>

<p>As I walked along with Arisa, I noticed that we stood out even after all this time.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, there aren&#8217;t a lot of miscreants looking at her, but many men do a double-take, and some even glance at her.</p>



<p>It is inevitable, though, since she has such a conspicuous appearance and great proportions.</p>



<p>I guess it&#8217;s like a beauty tax.</p>



<p>However, it is interesting to note that not only men&#8230;&#8230;, but also several women are looking at Arisa, giving her a look of envy and jealousy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Beautiful women have a tough time being noticed, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru made fun of her, for some reason, Arisa looked annoyed</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I think it&#8217;s half your fault. Don&#8217;t you realize that?&#8221;</p>



<p>“No, well&#8230;.it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t &#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle.</p>



<p>&#8212; He is aware of the fact that he is at least as handsome as most people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Takasegawa-san, we can rent floating rings. I want to relax, so I will borrow it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said while pointing to a corner of the poolside.</p>



<p>There are many different types of floats, large and small, for rent.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/X8r3rYK/187093.jpg" alt="187093" border="0"></a>

<p>Some are orthodox, while others are more unusual, such as those that resemble orcas.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are some for two people as well &#8230;&#8230;. What do you want to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please use common sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru dropped his shoulders as she glared at him.</p>



<p>Of course, the sensible thing to do here is to rent a single-person float.</p>



<p>It will be too much to get a two-person float where there is a high chance of skin-to-skin contact when two of them are not dating.</p>



<p>Arisa rented a single person&#8217;s floatation device using her checkout band.</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san, are you sure you don&#8217;t want one?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just thought I&#8217;d go for a swim.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two of them slowly submerged themselves in the water.</p>



<p>Arisa was floating in the water on the ring as she lay down.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, on the other hand, held the strap of Arisa’s floatation ring in his hand as he followed her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8230;&#8230; that feels good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm &#8230;&#8230;, yes it does. I&#8217;m glad I came, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa replied to Yuzuru’s words with a nod.</p>



<p>Usually, she does not lose her cool expression, but today her eyes are squinted and she looks as if she is enjoying herself.</p>



<p>However, it was boring to just drift along, so Yuzuru grabbed the strap of Arisa’s floatation ring and decided to take a quick swim.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m riding in a carriage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, this was well received by Arisa.</p>



<p>She completely relaxed and let Yuzuru pull her along. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have much desire to move on her own.</p>



<p>&#8220;More like a dog sled?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it because you are a big dog?&#8221;</p>






<p>The two of them were swimming along smoothly, but then they stopped.</p>



<p>They got caught in a crowd of people.</p>



<p>Somehow, a lot of people had stopped in that area against the current.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congestion?　Is there something on &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8216;Well, I wonder what&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s look at it later from the poolside. It would be annoying to stop.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa were a little bit tempted, but they decided to pass the spot quickly, thinking that stopping in a flowing pool would be annoying.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;but they were unfortunate (or fortunate).</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kya!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa screamed in unison.</p>



<p>It was like a bucket of water falling from above.</p>



<p>Yuzuru wiped the water on his face with his hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;So this is what everyone was looking at&#8230;&#8230; I was surprised.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said, looking up.</p>



<p>There was a huge bucket of water above their heads, and water is being poured into it.</p>



<p>After a certain period, the water seemed to fall from above.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was so surprised. My heart is still racing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa raised her body from a lying position and swam as if she were holding onto the float.</p>



<p>The two large fruits were riding up on the floats.</p>



<p>One could see drops of water trickling down into the valley.</p>






<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san?</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was also surprised, but it was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said to cover it up, and Arisa smiled at him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you think that I didn&#8217;t notice?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>






<p>When they had completed one lap of the flowing pool, they got out of the water.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been to a wave pool before. Can I go with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time, too. I&#8217;ve never been either. Yeah, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was called a wave pool, and it looked like the ocean.</p>



<p>Of course, there is no sandy beach, just a poolside that is colored like a sandy beach.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa entered the pool and tried to move to the back, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Arisa who was using a floating ring seemed to have a hard time moving as she was being swept away a bit with each wave.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want me to drag you?</p>



<p>“Please do.&#8221;</p>



<p>He grabbed Airisa&#8217;s float and proceeded to move deeper into the water as if he was pushing her.</p>



<p>When the waves recede, Arisa is swept along with them, and when the waves come in, she is swept in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>Whenever she was about to be swept to the shore, Yuzuru caught her as she was swept away.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting because it&#8217;s less dangerous than the ocean.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With the float rings, it looks like you can ride the waves and enjoy it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not exactly like surfing, but she looks like she&#8217;s having fun as she&#8217;s being bobbed up and down by the waves.</p>



<p>Of course, the change in her expression is small&#8230;&#8230;, but you can tell at a glance that she is enjoying it because her eyes are narrowed and her mouth is relaxed.</p>



<p>Yuzuru wondered a bit if he should borrow a floating ring too.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, do you want to take a little turn?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to monopolize it.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Arisa said that, she slipped out of the floating ring.</p>



<p>And then she tried to give the float to Yuzuru. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hiya!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro!&#8221;</p>



<p>A large wave hit us from behind, and we were swept far forward.</p>



<p>When Yuzuru rushed over to her, she was confused and clung to him as if she were hugging him.　</p>



<p>She seemed to be drowning a little, so Yuzuru supported her body as he embraced her.</p>



<p>Arisa’s body was soft, warm, and surprisingly light.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Keho.., I drank some water.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then she coughed lightly.</p>



<p>Later she seemed to realize that she had been hugging Yuzuru and hurriedly pulled away.</p>



<p>Her skin flushed slightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I apologize for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied with an expression of no concern, pretending to be oblivious to the situation.</p>



<p>Then, Arisa also made up her mind to pretend that she didn&#8217;t notice.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not that good at swimming. I like swimming pools, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh? That&#8217;s surprising.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru thought that Arisa, who was very athletic, could at least swim.</p>



<p>Then Arisa answered with an amiable smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t swim twenty-five meters. I&#8217;m not very good at holding my breath. &#8220;(<strong>TN:</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>25 meter- a lap in the pool</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;&#8216; Then I&#8217;ll teach you next time I have a chance. &#8216;</p>



<p>Yuzuru hastily swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth.</p>






<p>About an hour and a half had passed since they started swimming.</p>



<p>It was time for a break and they climbed out of the pool.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re kinda tired, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said, ruffling her wet hair.</p>



<p>The gesture was very sexy and lustrous.</p>



<p>I think so &#8230;&#8230;.. It&#8217;s 11 o’clock. Do you want to take a lunch break?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru turned his gaze away from Arisa and said while looking at his waterproof watch.</p>



<p>This is a bit early for lunch &#8230;.., one would say, but they were hungry because they used a lot of energy just floating around, surprisingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I agree. &#8230;&#8230; I believe there is a place where you can eat in your swimsuit, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, there is. This way, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>This large pool has a restaurant where you can eat in your swimsuit and kiosks that sell food.</p>



<p>When they moved to that area &#8230;&#8230;.</p>






<p>&#8220;I prefer the shop over there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I prefer that one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care which one. Just hurry up, will you?&#8221;</p>



<p>They heard a voice they had heard before.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa hurriedly turned away.</p>



<p>They were about to walk away from the scene with an indifferent look on their faces when&#8230;</p>






<p>&#8220;Eh? Isn&#8217;t that Yuzuru over there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san, why are you running away?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that &#8230;&#8230; Yukishiro-san next to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>They’ve been spotted.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa both sighed together.</p>



<p>“(What should we do?)”</p>



<p>“( I guess we&#8217;ll just have to cover it up.)”</p>



<p>The two of them gathered their courage and went to the three of them &#8211; Soichiro, Chiharu, and Ayaka.</p>



<p>Yuzuru greeted the three of them with a face as if nothing was wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a coincidence, you three.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, what a coincidence. Yuzuru. By the way, &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That pretty girl over there is Yukishiro-san, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuzuru. Why are you two together in such a popular spot for couples?&#8221;</p>



<p>The three of them asked Yuzuru with a smirk on their faces.</p>



<p>Arisa was shrinking, hiding in Yuzuru&#8217;s shadow.</p>



<p>She seemed to be planning to completely throw the explanation to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>“Ah, this is&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8221; “This is?&#8221; &#8221; &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;We just happened to run into each other. I never thought I&#8217;d see you guys here too. Coincidences do happen, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said that&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>The three of them looked at each other.</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s just not possible&#8221; &#8221; &#8220;</p>






<p>There was no way to cover it up.</p>
