<h3>Chapter 25 Fiancee's Older Brother</h3>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while, Haruto-san. I see that you&#8217;ve returned. &#8230;&#8230; Did something happen?　I was under the impression that you would not be coming back in the summer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa asked Haruto nonchalantly.</p>



<p>The Amagi family has a son who is a university student living alone in Kansai.</p>



<p>So Yuzuru guessed that he must be their son.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, that was the plan. But then I heard that Arisa got engaged. I was wondering what was going on, so I came home.&#8221;</p>



<p>Haruto then turned his gaze to Yuzuru, who was standing next to Arisa.</p>



<p>It was not a very friendly expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; And you are?&#8221;</p>



<p>Haruto queriedYuzuru.</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied, thinking that in a situation like this, in manga and anime, they would say, &#8221; Before you ask someone their name, you should tell them yours.&#8221;.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you, Airisa&#8217;s stepbrother. I&#8217;m Yuzuru Takasegawa . I&#8217;m Arisa-san&#8217;s fiancee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, you&#8217;re the one&#8230; I see. I am Haruto Amagi, Arisa’s stepbrother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, after a moment of silence, Haruto asked Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Are you really Arisa&#8217;s fiancee, Yuzuru-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; How old are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fifteen. I&#8217;m in the same grade as Arisa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru, like Arisa, smiled socially and responded calmly.</p>



<p>He is educated as to the next head of the family, so he can do this much.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s too soon, Yuzuru-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, he thinks so.</p>



<p>However, there is no way that Yuzuru, the person involved in this matter, can deny this &#8220;engagement&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, it would also be out of line with common sense if he didn&#8217;t feel any discomfort at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s why we won&#8217;t get married until after college.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Are you planning to get married?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru thought inwardly that he was being absurd, but he did not say it directly.</p>



<p>&#8221; Where in the world would someone enter into an engagement without intending to get married?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied with sarcasm and a play on words.</p>



<p>If you ask me where in the world they are, they are here.</p>



<p>Because Yuzuru and Arisa have no intention of getting married.</p>



<p>Then Yuzuru gently tugged on the sleeve of Arisa’s dress and gave her a look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that right, Arisa-san.?&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether or not we should tell him the truth, he asked for confirmation from Arisa Implicitly.</p>



<p>Then, in a whisper, she whispered into Yuzuru’s ear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hide it&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, she wanted him to keep it hidden.</p>



<p>Yuzuru is not sure if Haruto is trustworthy or not, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>He decided that if Arisa, who he had lived with for many years, decided that he could not be trusted, then he should follow her decision.</p>



<p>&#8220;I plan to marry Yuzuru-san after I graduate from college. I&#8217;m sorry for not telling you. I just assumed that Naoki-san had already told you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Naoki-san is Naoki Amagi.</p>



<p>In other words, it must be Arisa’s adoptive father.　</p>



<p>Since there was no direct contact with Arisa, Yuzuru somehow realized that Haruto was not trusted by Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; are you guys okay with this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Haruto looked a little shocked at the nonchalant attitude of Yuzuru and Arisa.</p>



<p>However, if anything, his words seemed to be directed more at Arisa than Yuzuru.</p>



<p>(I see. &#8230;&#8230;)</p>



<p>At this point, Yuzuru can kind of understand what kind of feelings Haruto has for Arisa.</p>



<p>He probably likes his cousin, Arisa.</p>



<p>Whether he is aware of it or not, Yuzuru was not sure.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s against Arisa’s marriage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. Arisa-san is a very attractive woman. To be with her would be my greatest dream.</p>



<p>&#8220;I also think that I can spend the rest of my life with Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both Yuzuru and Arisa answered in unison, but &#8230;&#8230; Haruto seemed unconvinced.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, as he couldn&#8217;t take the frustration out on Arisa, the person he had feelings for, he decided to target Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-kun, do you know &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Know what?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Arisa&#8217;s, and Amagi&#8217;s situation. &#8230;&#8230; This marriage is a political marriage for the sake of betrothal money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru knew this without being told.</p>



<p>In the first place, marriages between prominent families have always had some element of this in them, now and in the past.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you trying to say?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Arisa can&#8217;t say no because of her position. You know what I mean. She&#8217;s just being told what to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, Yuzuru heard a small sound.</p>



<p>It was a small, tiny, tongue-clicking sound&#8230;&#8230; Arisa had released.</p>



<p>He looked to the side to check Airisa&#8217;s expression.</p>



<p>(U~wa&#8230;&#8230; she&#8217;s angry.)</p>



<p>Her eyes, cold and dead from the start, grew increasingly cold.</p>



<p>Her expression maintained the smile from earlier, but her lips twitched occasionally.</p>



<p>It was obvious that she was in a bad mood.</p>



<p>But Haruto didn&#8217;t seem to notice it at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa-san. Your step-brother is claiming that&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haruto-san, you&#8217;re overthinking this. Thank you for your concern about me &#8230;&#8230;. But don&#8217;t worry. I want to marry Yuzuru-san from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what she should say for now.　</p>



<p>As for Yuzuru, he thought, &#8220;If he&#8217;s against marriage too, why don&#8217;t you tell him what&#8217;s going on and ask him to help? &#8220;</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>But he decided that it is better to leave it at that since Arisa has decided that she can&#8217;t trust Haruto.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true..”</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Well, yes. In Arisa&#8217;s position, she has no choice but to say so. Yuzuru-kun, you understand,right.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, Haruto doesn&#8217;t trust Arisa either,&#8230;&#8230;at least not on her word.</p>



<p>Of course, it is by no means a mistake, Arisa is lying to Haruto.</p>



<p>However, no matter what Arisa says, the fact remains that she always ends up being &#8220;made to say&#8221;.</p>



<p>In other words, no matter what kind of intentions Arisa expresses, if it&#8217;s inconvenient for Haruto, it&#8217;s probably false for him.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that Arisa doesn&#8217;t trust Haruto.</p>



<p>And moreover&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Is it because Arisa doesn&#8217;t believe in Haruto that Haruto can&#8217;t believe in Arisa?</p>



<p>Or is it because Haruto doesn&#8217;t believe in Arisa that Arisa can&#8217;t believe in  Haruto?</p>



<p>Which comes first is like the question of whether the egg comes first or the chicken comes first, and there is no answer.</p>



<p>But there is no doubt that a two-way distrust exists between the two.</p>



<p>&#8220;But let&#8217;s say that&#8217;s the case, &#8230;&#8230; Haruto Amagi-san. What do you expect from me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If Yuzuru-kun loves Arisa, please stop forcing her to marry you. &#8230;&#8230; Yuzuru-kun wouldn&#8217;t want Arisa to be unhappy, would you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That, well, &#8230;&#8230; it is as you said&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa was starting to lose her patience with her fake smile.</p>



<p>And it would be a shame to make the cab driver wait too long.</p>



<p>Therefore, Yuzuru was going to end the conversation in a slightly snarky way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if I were to cancel my marriage to Arisa-san unless the financial situation of the Amagi family improves, wouldn&#8217;t Amagi-san try to get Arisa-san to marry a wealthy man?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; no, but &#8230;..&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a different thing If you have the power to protect Arisa-san. But if you don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s best not to do anything unnecessary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru was not wrong in his prediction that Haruto, who was merely a college student and who did not seem to be on good terms with the head of the family, Naoki, would not have any authority or power.</p>



<p>With that Haruto fell silent and didn&#8217;t speak again.</p>



<p>After confirming this, Yuzuru bowed his head.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I was out of line. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for being rude. This is a matter for the Amagi family. So I&#8217;ll try to stay out of it. Then&#8230;, Haruto Amagi-san, Arisa-san. I&#8217;ll take my leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru stated, and promptly left the place.</p>
