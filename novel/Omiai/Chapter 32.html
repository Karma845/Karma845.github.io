<h3>Chapter 32 Fiancee and Watermelon</h3>

<p>After that, they enjoyed the festival by playing games such as ring toss, target shooting, and yo-yo scooping.</p>



<p>When they finished playing, they started to get a little hungry.</p>



<p>&#8220;The yakisoba and takoyaki at these places look delicious, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, they do &#8230;&#8230;. It smells good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Driven by the atmosphere, the smell, and the sound, they bought one yakisoba and one takoyaki.</p>



<p>Then they sat down on the stairs near a nearby shrine.</p>



<p>They shared half of it with each other.　</p>



<p>Though Yuzuru&#8217;s portion was a bit larger than Arisa’s since Arisa was a small eater.</p>



<p>The yakisoba looked very unhealthy, covered in artificial flavorings.</p>



<p>It was a little too salty, and some parts were slightly burnt and crispy, but that was also a good thing.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s only delicious when you eat them in a festival-like setting while enjoying the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The takoyaki had a squishy dough and was covered in sauce.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a little too salty.</p>



<p>The octopus parts were not as much as they were expecting, but the available ones were bigger than they thought. So this takoyaki was a &#8220;hit&#8221; rather than &#8220;miss&#8221;.</p>



<p>Of course, it was at a festival.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious when you eat it at a festival, isn&#8217;t it? Well, I think 90% of it is the atmosphere.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it is&#8230;&#8230;. But the firepower of a teppan is hard to produce at home, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a taste you don&#8217;t get to have very often.&#8221; (<strong>TN:</strong> <em>Teppan &#8211; takoyaki pan)</em></p>



<p>It was tasty, but it was still salty.</p>



<p>Yuzuru took a sip of the lemonade he had bought at the stall.</p>



<p>Incidentally, it was made by mixing lemon juice and syrup, adding ice, and pouring Mitsuya Cider into it.</p>



<p>When he thought about it calmly, he felt that 300 yen for this was expensive. But he bought it because of the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The taste was not bad, but whether it was worth 300 yen is another story.</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8211;On the other hand, Arisa, who doesn&#8217;t like carbonated drinks, sipped on orange juice.</p>



<p>It was in a container, not a PET bottle or Can, so it looked tasty.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s probably just the way it looks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san, that &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to try soda?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru asked her, Arisa gave a small nod.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, but you know, but it&#8217;s my first time trying it, so hurting too much is&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s already pretty well gone. It&#8217;s not that much.&#8221; (<strong>TN</strong>: <em>they are talking about the carbonated content.)</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru said and handed a plastic cup to Arisa.</p>



<p>She put her glossy lips on the cup and took a sip.</p>



<p>“How is it?”</p>



<p>&#8220;It hurts a little, but it tastes good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Yuzuru checked his watch.</p>



<p>It was only thirty minutes before the fireworks started.</p>



<p>He gathered up the trash from the yakisoba and takoyaki he had finished and stood up.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can see the fireworks from my house, and I think it will be more relaxing to watch them that way. So we should go home before then, what do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so&#8230;&#8230. I think it would be more beautiful to watch the fireworks from Takasegawa-san&#8217;s house, in terms of atmosphere.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa nodded her head in agreement.</p>



<p>The place where you can see the fireworks beautifully is crowded with people, so there is no sense of elegance.</p>



<p>However, it is a different story if you are two lovers who can create a world of their own.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we can stop by at least one other place. &#8230;&#8230; What do you want to eat?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think I saw a crepe shop on the way back to Takasegawa-san&#8217;s house. I&#8217;d like to try it.?</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Then let&#8217;s buy some crepes and go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>They went to the crepe shop on the way back to his house.</p>



<p>Yuzuru bought a blueberry crepe and Arisa a strawberry crepe.</p>



<p>As a matter of course, they shared a bite with each other.</p>



<p>Holding hands, they walked down the street eating their crepes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a very refined thing to do, but it&#8217;s allowed only on festival days.</p>



<p>When they finished eating their crepes, they arrived home just in time.</p>



<p>It was getting quite dark.</p>



<p>When they went through the outer gate, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Woof, woof, woof, the sound of dogs once again could be heard.</p>



<p>It was a little scary to see their eyes glowing in the dark.</p>



<p>However, dogs can see well at night. So they immediately understood that it was Yuzuru and Arisa who had come.</p>



<p>Their tails were wagging wildly, and they approached with a vigor that made it seem as if they hadn&#8217;t seen each other in ten years.</p>



<p>They lightly stroked the four dogs, and then entered the house.</p>





<p>There were less than ten minutes left before the fireworks started.</p>



<p>Therefore, Yuzuru and Arisa sat down on the edge of the porch facing the fireworks.</p>



<p>By the way, Ayumi, who judged on her own not to disturb them, was sitting about ten meters away from them.</p>



<p>Although Yuzuru and Arisa are not lovers,&#8230;&#8230;, but if they were real lovers, Yuzuru would have thanked Ayumi.</p>



<p>This is a girl who can take care of things when they need to be taken care of.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not like she was all alone and lonely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kya&#8230;Don&#8217;t lick me! You&#8217;re such a helpless child.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was playing with two dogs, a Spanish Mastiff and an English Mastiff.</p>



<p>They had recently graduated from puppyhood and were still in the prime of their lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For all intents and purposes, it&#8217;s a child being attacked by a predator.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both of them are mastiffs, with a body that is more than half the height of Ayumi&#8217;s, more than her height when standing up, and almost twice her weight.</p>



<p>It must be hard just to keep up with them.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Ayumi&#8217;s body was turned over.</p>



<p>Her shorts were peeking out from between her long white legs.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no fun to look at your sister&#8217;s underpants, so Yuzuru shifted his gaze to Arisa.</p>



<p>“Is it okay if you don&#8217;t help her?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been trained to wait when you tell them to wait, so don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m sure Ayumi likes to do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s only a matter of time before she told them to wait.</p>



<p>As Yuzuru was thinking this, he heard his mother&#8217;s voice calling him from the kitchen.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Have a safe trip&#8221;</p>



<p>As he walked to the kitchen, he smelled something sweet.</p>



<p>&#8220;Watermelon?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru muttered, and Sayori, holding a plate in her hand, nodded.</p>



<p>She handed the large plate to Yuzuru.　</p>



<p>It was cut into small dice, probably to avoid staining their yukata.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, this is for Yuzuru and Arisa-chan. Tell Ayumi to come, too. And if she is touching the dog, make sure she washes her hands first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>He carried two plates to the porch.</p>



<p>When he arrived, the two dogs were already away from Ayumi.</p>



<p>They looked absent-minded and dreary.</p>



<p>They must have been told off by Ayumi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Ayumi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Niisan? What&#8217;s up? &#8230;&#8230; oh, that&#8217;s a watermelon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is for us. Wash your hands first. Then go get your own from mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, ~&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayumi ran along the edge, flapping her arms.</p>



<p>Even though it is a pet dog, a dirty thing is a dirty thing.</p>



<p>After seeing Ayumi off, Yuzuru went over to Arisa.</p>



<p>“Thanks for waiting, Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Thank you for the watermelon.&#8221;</p>



<p>They put the watermelon on the edge and picked it together using toothpicks.</p>



<p>&#8220;This watermelon is very sweet and delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps attracted by the smell of the watermelon, two dogs, a Spanish Mastiff and an English Mastiff, came to their feet.</p>



<p>Two more dogs, an Akita and a German Shepherd, approached them, wagging their tails.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think we’re being targeted?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa hurriedly grabbed a plate and raised it to her chest level.</p>



<p>If four of them attacked, they would take the watermelon in a flash.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, on the other hand, remained calm.</p>



<p>&#8220;We keep separate plates for people&#8217;s food and dog&#8217;s food, and I&#8217;m sure they know what they&#8217;re doing. Besides, I&#8217;m sure Ayumi or my mother will bring the dog food soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as Yuzuru had said, Ayumi and Sayori appeared with the plates.</p>



<p>What Ayumi is holding is probably a watermelon for herself.</p>



<p>Sayori placed her plate a little farther away from the edge, put her fingers in her mouth, and whistled.</p>



<p>Then the four dogs that had gathered around Yuzuru and Arisa quickly ran to Sayori.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, wait!　Good boys. I&#8217;ll give it to you now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayumi and Sayori placed a large cut watermelon in front of the dogs.</p>



<p>Then they made him wait for about five seconds.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Sayori gave her permission, the four dogs all started eating the watermelon at once.</p>



<p>Ayumi sat directly on the edge and started eating her watermelon.</p>



<p>&#8211;Sayori, on the other hand, winked at Yuzuru for some reason and then left for the kitchen.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are well-disciplined, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;RIght?　I&#8217;m sure the dog is the best.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I think cats are the best.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Is that non-negotiable?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Non-negotiable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cats are cute, sure.</p>



<p>But they can&#8217;t be ordered to wait or sit.</p>



<p>He thought the best partner for humans is a dog.</p>



<p>Just as Yuzuru was about to expand on his theory.</p>



<p>There was a loud noise from the sky.</p>



<p>When he looked up, he saw beautiful fireworks lighting up the night sky.</p>
