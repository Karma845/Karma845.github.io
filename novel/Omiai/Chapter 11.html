<h3>Chapter 11 - Fiancee and the Gift</h3>

<p>"This is ...... again, what can I say? Thank you, thank you very much."</p><p>Arisa received the paper bag with a puzzled look.<p>
She was unusually upset for a girl who usually kept her composure.</p><p>
This was the first time she's been this upset since ...... the first time she got complimented by yuzuru on her cooking.</p><p>"I'm happy, even if it is for 'acting'"</p></p><p>Arisa squinted slightly.</p></p>
It was not the artful smile she usually wore at school, but a natural smile.</p>
Just for a little, just for a moment. ......</p><p>Yuzuru's heart bounced.</p><p>(...... Good for eyes, but bad for the heart.)</p></p><p>Yuzuru didn't like Arisa's dead eyes, or her artful, unnatural smile.</p><p>However, he thought her natural smile was really beautiful and lovely.</p><p>"It's not for acting though ....... I got a gift for you, because even though we're faking the engaged, we still have a very close relationship."</p><p>"...... Is that how it works?"</p><p>"Because we're friends. ......&nbsp; Or maybe I was the only one who thought we were friends?"</p>
Yuzuru scratched his cheek involuntarily.</p></p><p>If it was Yuzuru's one-sided assumption, it would be quite embarrassing.</p><p>Then Arisa shook her head from side to side in panic.</p><p>"No, no, ......I'm sorry, I don't know much about that kind of thing. If you ask me if I'm a friend......."</p><p>"It's not like you don't have any ...... friends, is it?"</p><p>"Yes, I do. ...... If friends are the ones that you eat lunch with and you just give each other a high five, then I have a lot of friends."</p><p>Arisa said in a somewhat cold tone.</p><p>Her green eyes were dark and stagnant.</p><p>"I'm not saying that I've never been to a classmate's house or anything but...... Takasegawa-san is the first person I've ever been this close to."</p></p><p>Arisa was always in close contact with her classmates.</p><p>But <u>at the same time </u>she didn't have any special friends.</p></p><p>There was no distinction between the classmates.</p><p>But between herself and others, she kept a transparent and solid wall.</p><p>"That's the way Arisa Yukishiro socializes."</p>
It's no wonder that she wasn't interested in birthdays because she didn't have any person in relationship to celebrate with.</p></p>I'm sure you'll be able to understand why I'm not interested in birthdays, as there is no one in my life who would be interested in celebrating them.</p><p>"For the first time celebrating with a friend......, So is that an honor for you?</p>
She told Yuzuru to tease, thinking that it wasn't good for the atmosphere to take it seriously.</p><p>"That's right. It's a great honor."</p>Then Arisa lovingly patted the paper bag Yuzuru had given her.</p></p>Then she looked up at Yuzuru.</p></p><p>Her cold, inorganic eyes, like the usual frozen lake, got a little warmer ... Yuzuru felt like that.</p><p>"In October, I prepare something."</p><p>"I'll be waiting with anticipation."
Yuzuru replied.</p></p><p>Arisa gave a small nod and placed the paper bag on the floor.&#12288;</p><p>But she soon began to fidget ... she held it in her hand again and put it on her lap.</p><p>Then she asked Yuzuru.</p><p>"Can I take a look inside?"</p><p>"Ofcourse, go ahead. I rather want to hear what you think. It will help me in the future."</p>
Considering the fact that they would be in an "engaged" relationship until they graduated from college, it was very important to know what Arisa's interests were right now.</p><p>"Then I'll give you my honest thoughts ...... Is this soap?"</p><p>Yugen gave Arisa an assortment of soaps.</p><p>The set included a nice smelling solid soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a hand towel.</p>
He was struck between lotion, hand cream, and lip balm, but he chose the soaps for the coming summer season.</p><p>"This is a famous brand, isn't it? Isn't it expensive?"</p>
Yuzuru could hear the joy and confusion in Arisa's voice.</p></p><p>She not sure if she should be happy to have received something so nice, or she should be sorry ...... for buying her such an expensive item.</p><p>"So what do you think? What are your impressions? It's okay if you give me a hard time about it."</p><p>"Even though I got a expensive product , I can't look at the evaluation from above .... But I got a much better product than I expected. I feel like that. I never thought I would get such a wonderful thing. "</p></p><p>Arisa's voice was a little bouncy.</p><p>Her expression remained calm, but her cheeks were slightly flushed.</p><p>"I've never been given one of these before, never bought one, never got to use one. So I'm really, really ...... happy."</p></p><p>After Arisa said so, she sighed a little.</p><p>Her Midoritama's eyes gradually lost their light, and began to become cloudy</p><p>"I'm the only one. Everyone had them, my&nbsp; sister-in-law, as well as my classmates."</p><p>Little by little, Arisa's eyes began to moisten.</p><p>Her voice rubbed up and her body quivered slightly.</p></p>
Quickly Arisa turned her face down.</p><p>Her amber hair hid her expression.</p><p>"I pretended not to be interested, but I really wanted one. I was jealous of everyone else, but there was no way I could ask them to buy it for me. ...... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I got a little emotional"</p></p><p>Arisa said, and she turned her back against her Yuzuru.</p><p>Her shoulders were shaking&nbsp; a little.</p><p>After a while, there was a loud inhale and exhale.</p>
By the time Arisa turned around again, ...... her expression had regained its usual calmness.</p>
Her eyes were ...... slightly red, though.</p><p>"Please dont ask me anything now."</p><p>"Fine, I'll not"</p></p><p>He was always ready listen her complain.</p><p>He already told her that he is always willing to help if she asks.</p><p>He also told her that he would respect her intentions .</p><p>And then she told him not to ask anything.</p><p>Then he won't.</p><p>"For the time being, is it okay to use the same thing next year?"</p><p>"Yes. ......, please."</p></p><p>But ...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be permissible to give her some reason to fulfill her wishes, or to provide her with an escape.</p><p>Yuzuru thought so.</p></p><p>At that night.</p></p><p>As usual, Yuzuru was taking Arisa home.</p><p>"Takasegawa-san, I've been thinking about you for a while. ......"</p><p>"What's up?"</p><p>"When you're in the room with me, you wear a t-shirt, but when you go outside, you put on a jacket. ...... I'm sure it's hotter outside than in your room this season."</p></p><p>Arisa's voice had some thorns to it.</p></p><p>Yuzuru thought that he should be dressed properly as long as he goes out and walk alongside Arisa.
&#12288;
That's why he put on a jacket and dressed up.</p></p><p>However, Arisa seemed to be a little uncomfortable with Yuzuru's attitude.</p></p><p>Of course, there is no way that anyone would want to walk next to her looking so shabby. ......</p><p>&nbsp; "In other words, you want me to be fashionable even when we are alone. Is that so?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right. I think it's disrespectful that you care about people's eyes but not my eyes."</p></p><p>Yuzuru understood what she was trying to say.</p></p><p>In short, she was annoyed that she was not treated like a woman.</p><p>"But I don't understand. You don't really like me, do you? Do you want me to care about that even though we're faking......?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm asking you the other way around, Takasegawa-san. What do you think if I come in a jersey up and down on my unkempt head?".</p><p>"No, that would be disgusting indeed. No, but i am not that bad, am I ? I just dress like a normal person. ...... Just throw on a jacket and you're dressed for the occasion...... Maybe this is lame? Like a top and bottom jersey?"</p><p>Yuzuru didn't think that his fashion sense is particularly good, but he also thinks that it's probably not bad.</p>
However, when you put it that way, it instantly makes him feel uneasy.</p><p>"Don't worry about that. I think it's good."</p><p>"Well, ......."</p><p>"I can forgive you if you're wearing a jersey. What I have a problem with is not the fashion sense, but the attitude of Takasegawa-san. In other words, ...... you would only fix your hair and put on a jacket when you go outside, right? When you're in front of me, you do 60% of what you're capable of, but when you go out, you do 80% of what you're capable of. ...... That's a little annoying."</p></p><p>When you look at it this way, it is true that Yuzuru's attitude was not good.</p><p>Yuzuru thought that this should be reflected ... This time, the strong tone was changed, and Arisa made a bearish voice.</p></p><p>"I'm sorry, I said too much now. I understand ... It's Takasegawa-san's room in the first place, and I think it's Takasegawa-san's right to relax there. I'm in the way. But ... that's right. I'm aware of Takasegawa-san in my own way. "</p><p><u>"... Are you aware of me?"</u></p><p>So Arisa's words were a bit of a surprise to Yuzuru.</p><p>"It's not that I'm not interested in you. I'm not a ...... romantic interest, of course. It's just that ...... I am aware that you are a man......&nbsp; or you're not?"</p><p>"No, I'm a man. ...... You make jokes like that too."</p><p>"Please don't make fun of me. I'm serious. If I treat you as a man and you don't treat me as a woman, isn't that a bit unfair?"</p><p>Arisa says this with her mouth agape.
Her cheeks were slightly reddened by the setting sun.</p><p>Yuzuru nodded broadly.</p><p>"You have a good point. I'm sorry. I took advantage of your kindness and became insensitive. I'll be careful next time."</p><p>"I'd appreciate it if you would."</p><p>That day, the distance between Yuzuru and Arisa shortened dramatically</p>
Yuzuru felt that way.</p>
