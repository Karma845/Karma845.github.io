<h3>Chapter 24 - Train Person and Taxi Person</h3>


<p>After having a lot of fun, the five of us changed into our casual clothes and left the leisure facility.</p>



<p>Then, although a little early, they finished their dinner at a nearby restaurant.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call a cab. &#8230;&#8230; How many do we need?　Yuzuru and Soichiro are ‘train people’, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>(<strong>TN: </strong><em>Train people and taxi people refers to their preferred mode of travel</em>)</p>



<p>In short, they were asking whether they should take the train or a cab to their house.</p>



<p>Yuzuru said as he reclined on the seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a &#8216;train person&#8217;, but &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really tired today. Please call me a ride as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>He had been having too much fun and was feeling fatigued all over.</p>



<p>The swimming competition in the pool that we had in the middle of the day was particularly impactful.</p>



<p>&#8220;Same goes for me&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t have the energy to take the train home.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soichiro replied with his elbows on the table, slumped over as if he was already on the verge of going down.</p>



<p>Chiharu is playing around with Soichiro&#8217;s hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I will be taking the train&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ll take Yukishiro home while I&#8217;m at it, so just take one set of cabs. I&#8217;ll pay for it, so don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru spoke up as if to interrupt Arisa’s words.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m totally fine with going by train&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll say later if I send you home by train alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Well, if that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</p>



<p>After hearing Yuzuru and Airisa&#8217;s exchange, Ayaka and Chiharu voiced their admiration.</p>



<p>Then they both shook Soichiro, who was about to fall asleep.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want a ride home, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please give me a ride too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You guys live in the opposite direction. &#8230;&#8230; I mean, I just want to go home. Please let me go home. I&#8217;m sleepy. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;d rather you guys give me a ride.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soichiro looked sleepy when he said that.</p>



<p>Yuzuru thought it was a nice gesture, but the kind-hearted Arisa seemed to feel sorry for him.</p>



<p>So She offered a helping hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Ayaka-san, Chiharu-san &#8230;&#8230;. Would you like to exchange contact information?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, we haven&#8217;t done that yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>The three of them exchanged their contact information.</p>



<p>From the looks of it, they&#8217;ve gotten along quite well in the pool today.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt a little bit happy about that.</p>





<p>&#8211;On the way home later that day.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa were sitting side by side in a cab.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was fun today.&#8221;</p>



<p>said Arisa, looking somewhat sorrowful.</p>



<p>The normally cool girl seemed to have been carried away by Ayaka&#8217;s and Chiharu&#8217;s excitement and seemed to have enjoyed the day.</p>



<p>From Yuzuru&#8217;s point of view, it was satisfying to see something so rare.</p>



<p>“Ayaka-chan and Chiharu-chan seem to have gotten along quite well with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; Will it be okay if I say that we&#8217;ve become friends?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the girls think so whether you like it or not.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the way it looked to him, they seemed to like Arisa quite a bit.</p>



<p>Secretly, he was given strict orders: &#8220;If you make Arisa-chan cry, you will be executed,&#8221; and &#8220;If you are a man, be responsible for making her happy.&#8221;.</p>



<p>……..Though it was explained that she was a fake fiancée.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, Takasegawa-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The three of them&#8230;.. are from very wealthy families, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?　Well, I guess they are one of the wealthy ones.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, there are differences between the &#8220;wealthy&#8221; ones.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where do they all live? Do they usually use cabs?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka had summoned a cab so casually that she must have been curious about how they usually got around.</p>



<p>Yuzuru pulled from his memory the current residence and commuting status of the three of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ayaka-chan lived within an hour&#8217;s drive. I think. I believe she had a full-time driver to take her to and from school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?　I&#8217;ve never seen that before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She seems to have gotten off about a three-minute walk away from the school&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s usually embarrassing to be dropped off right in front of the gate, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s high school is a private school, and there are many children from wealthy families.</p>



<p>But if you look at the overall number, it goes without saying that the majority of children come from ordinary families.</p>



<p>She is also a girl of that age, so she has an appropriate amount of shame about such things.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Satake-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t remember the exact distance, but he usually commuted from home. He&#8217;s a &#8216;train guy&#8217;, though. &#8230;&#8230; He has a lot of brothers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of brothers?　How many?　Four, maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>The birth rate is declining these days.</p>



<p>Even if there are only four of the children, it can be said that the couple has fully contributed to the population problem of Japan.</p>



<p>But the Satake family is on a different level.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember that there were enough of them to make a baseball team.&#8221; (<strong>TN:</strong><em> baseball team needs 9 </em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; quite a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>This surprised Arisa, who widened her eyes.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Soichiro, as you can tell from his name, is the eldest son&#8230;&#8230;. I don&#8217;t remember how many kindergarteners, elementary, and junior high school students there are, but to drive more than nine people to and from school every morning, you&#8217;ll need a reasonable number of drivers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, it might not be impossible to hire one for each.</p>



<p>At least the family thinks it&#8217;s unnecessary.</p>



<p>It seems that all boys of a certain age walk to school.</p>



<p>The girls are taken to school by car.</p>



<p>&#8220;They also said things like, &#8216;You should walk for your health&#8217;. And well, he never said it out loud, but I guess he&#8217;s embarrassed to be being sent in the car. He&#8217;s a man after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Chiharu-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Her parents live in the Kansai region. Since she cannot commute, she is living alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, she&#8217;s the same as Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Although, there is a big difference in the necessity from Yuzuru, who is willing to spend an hour or so commuting to school.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not safe for a girl to live alone, is it? She&#8217;s from a good family, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. So it looks like there are SPs or servants, I don&#8217;t know, living on both sides of the apartment, but they are related&#8230;&#8230;. What a way to live alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>He wondered if he could call it living alone.</p>



<p>It was a reasonable decision, though.</p>



<p>Some evil people in the world pretend to be couriers and break into your room.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230; Chiharu is a martial artist. Even though she may look normal, she can fight off any lousy man.</p>



<p>&#8220;So does that mean the two neighbors of Takasegawa-san is same  as well?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, both my neighbors are normal people, and I&#8217;ve never checked for such exaggerated security&#8230;&#8230;. I can&#8217;t say for sure that they&#8217;re not there, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru did not intend to actively search for it.</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t WALL-E, so he didn&#8217;t have to look for anything.</p>



<p>If you do not know, it&#8217;s okay not to know.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; By the way, Yukishiro. What about the Amagi household?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My foster father has hired a driver. But well …, basically everyone is on the train&#8230;&#8230; Our family is saving money at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it again.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the rumor has it, Amagi&#8217;s financial situation is not good.</p>



<p>The reason for this situation was that the previous head of Amagi, Arisa’s adoptive father&#8217;s father, failed in business. And the current generation is scrambling to rebuild.</p>



<p>When you think about it, the fact that they want to get support money by marrying off Arisa&#8230;&#8230; does not make one sympathetic to their feelings, but, understandably, they are desperate.</p>



<p>As they talked about this, they arrived near Arisa’s house.</p>



<p>Yuzuru got down first and then extended his hand to Airisa.</p>



<p>For a moment, Arisa looked puzzled, but &#8230;&#8230; then she quickly took Yuzuru&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>He helped Arisa out of the car.</p>



<p>&#8220;See you later, Yukishiro. Maybe we&#8217;ll meet again during the summer vacation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ll invite you from my side at that time&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when it happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa!&#8221;</p>



<p>The voice of a young man could be heard.</p>



<p>A young man in his twenties, holding a carry-on bag, walked towards them.</p>



<p>He was a good-looking guy with a well-developed face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked in a whisper, and Arisa replied in a whisper as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;That is Haruto Amagi, my cousin and step-brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>At first glance, Arisa’s face seemed gentle. But in reality, she had a masked smile on her face that did not show any emotion.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Haruto looked happy. But when he noticed Yuzuru next to Arisa&#8230;&#8230;, his expression clouded.</p>



<p>This is going to be another troublesome situation, Yuzuru sighed inwardly.</p>
