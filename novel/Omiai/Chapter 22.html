<h3>Chapter 22 - Boy's Side</h3>

<p>&#8220;Here, Arisa-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! Chiharu-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops, Ayaka-san!&#8221;</p>



<p>Three beautiful girls were passing a beach ball around each other in an ordinary pool with no waves or currents.</p>



<p>There are no clear rules, but it seems that you should not drop the ball into the water.</p>



<p>And two men were watching the three beautiful girls from a distance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru, I sometimes think&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Soichiro declares with a sincere and somewhat enlightened expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think there is no need for men in this world?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru gave a small snort in response to his words.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What I mean is&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;or that&#8217;s what I would have said a while ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru watched the three beautiful girls &#8211; Arisa, Ayaka, and Chiharu &#8211; playing happily.</p>



<p>Arisa has strong foreign genes, and her skin color, hair color, and facial features are also somewhat different from normal Japanese.</p>



<p>Her slender body with its unevenness is somehow artistic and not at all obnoxious.</p>



<p>Such is the case with Arisa, who wears a black triangle bikini decorated with a ribbon in the center.</p>



<p>She has an innocent impression, but when she wears such a bold swimsuit, she suddenly looks more mature.　</p>



<p>The black fabric against her white skin made her look very beautiful.</p>



<p>Ayaka, like Yuzuru, is distantly related to Caucasian genes, which may have given her a somewhat Japanese appearance, and her face is deeply sculpted and very well-formed.</p>



<p>Her high nose, beautiful cherry-red lips, and other individual parts are very beautiful and arranged in a balance that could be called the golden ratio.</p>



<p>Her hair is glossy black silk and her eyes are a reddish amber. Her skin is a beautiful ivory color and very smooth. She is as wonderfully proportioned as Arisa. Her arms and legs are long, her waist is slender, and her chest and buttocks are beautifully formed.</p>



<p>Ayaka was wearing a very simple, bright red triangle bikini.</p>



<p>When she wears this passionate red bikini, she looks as sensual as an adult.</p>



<p>She did not look like she was fifteen years old.</p>



<p>Chiharu is the heiress of a shrine with a long history and tradition.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why, or maybe it has nothing to do with it at all (probably not), but she has a somewhat mysterious air about her.</p>



<p>Her eyes are the color of hazel, and her hair is a bright brown that shines in the sunlight. She has a Japanese look, with a well-developed nose and long, lashes-covered, patchy eyes.</p>



<p>Her skin is as smooth and beautiful as white porcelain. And her breasts and hips are fuller than those of Arisa and Ayaka, but her waist is tight and narrow.</p>



<p>Also, her arms and legs are slender and long.</p>



<p>Chiharu was wearing a bikini made of white and pink fabric with frills around the edges.</p>



<p>The frills slightly concealed her cleavage and buttocks, giving her an impression of innocence despite the exposure.</p>



<p>It was very picturesque to see these girls getting along and playing together.　</p>



<p>The best part is that all three of them have amazing breasts.</p>



<p>Whenever they lifted the ball up, the balls on their chests would also shake.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a heavenly sight.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, we don&#8217;t need men in this world.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was Yuzuru&#8217;s impression.</p>



<p>&#8221; Yuzuru &#8230;&#8230; you finally understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; Ah&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve been so immature up until now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt ashamed of himself for not knowing the world before.</p>



<p>Until now, he could not agree with Soichiro&#8217;s opinion because he did not know about the wonderful scenery.</p>



<p>But now, he could empathize.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay if you understand&#8230;&#8230;. my best friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Soichiro, thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Soichiro formed a firm handshake.</p>



<p>Then they let go of each other&#8217;s hands. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that the farce is over, I&#8217;d like to thank you for your help. To be honest, it was difficult for me to spend the day alone with Yukishiro&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru thanked Soichiro in a serious way, different from his earlier antics.</p>



<p>He doesn’t dislike Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8211;He could see that she was fun to be with.</p>



<p>It was fun to play in the flowing pool and the wave pool with her.</p>



<p>But &#8230;&#8230; There is a limit.</p>



<p>If they were real lovers, they might be able to continue flirting and body touching and stuff forever, but Yuzuru and Arisa couldn&#8217;t do that. (At least Yuzuru had no intention of betraying her trust.)</p>



<p>So it was nice to be able to meet up with Ayaka and Chiharu.</p>



<p>As long as the girls were together, they could play without hesitation.</p>



<p>And Yuzuru can relax his shoulders in front of Soichiro.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;It is the nature of men to be nervous in front of girls, wanting to show off their good qualities.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same for me as well&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m not going to lie, it&#8217;s exhausting to deal with those two guys all day. No, but it&#8217;s fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a lot of work just to deal with one girl.</p>



<p>With two of them together, it must be even harder.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt sorry for Soichiro.</p>



<p>&#8230;But if you think about it calmly, it was his fault for being two-timing, so there was no room for pity at all.</p>



<p>Yuzuru immediately regretted feeling sorry for him even for a moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Yuzuru. Do you think it is possible to force someone to marry?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not impossible, but there&#8217;s no merit in taking such a risk, is there?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied to Soichiro&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217; s right. In the past, it would have been possible, but in this day and age, it&#8217;s just not feasible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;ah&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s outdated to let people do that,&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the past, you would have had no choice but to cry yourself to sleep, but now we live in a wonderful age where you can sue for power harassment and sexual harassment.</p>



<p>If they ignore Arisa&#8217;s wishes and make her get married, they might be sued.</p>



<p>So, if someone had proper risk management, they would not do such a thing.</p>



<p>In the end, even if you force her to marry someone she doesn&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s obvious that the marriage will break up. If they had any common sense, they wouldn&#8217;t do it.</p>



<p>&#8211;The worst thing that could happen is that the story would be picked up by a newspaper.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be funny.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re saying that Yukishiro-san&#8217;s parents have no common sense?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know about her adoptive mother, but I hear her adoptive father is a good man in his own right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; how can they not be smart enough to take such risks?&#8221;</p>



<p>However, this is not the case where Arisa is lying, either.</p>



<p>So Yuzuru&#8217;s guess is&#8230;</p>





<p>&#8220;Yukishiro looks like that, but he has a timid personality. So I think it might be a mental thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to go against your adoptive parents when you&#8217;ve been taken in, both mentally and from a position of power.</p>



<p>Since Arisa did not reject the proposal, they mistakenly thought that she was interested and proceeded with the marriage, and in the meantime, she could not say no anymore.</p>





<p>That could be the possible situation.</p>



<p>While Yuzuru and Soichiro were talking about this, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Soichiro-kun! Yuzuru!! Let&#8217;s play together!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just then, an invitation came from Ayaka.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Soichirou looked at each other and then swam over to the three of them.</p>
