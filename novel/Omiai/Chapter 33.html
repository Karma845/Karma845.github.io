<h3>Chapter 33 - Lies of Fiancee</h3>


<p>Fireworks shoot up into the sky one after another.</p>



<p>The blue and red lights brightened the dark sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>muttered Arisa.</p>



<p>Yuzuru shifted his gaze from the fireworks to Arisa.</p>



<p>Every time a firework went off, it illuminated her art-like face.</p>



<p>It was very picturesque to see this beautiful girl looking up at the night sky with her eyes squinted and her mouth slightly relaxed, looking dazed but happy.</p>



<p>The garden, fireworks, and Arisa.</p>



<p>If one could capture these three in a photograph, it would be a wonderful work of art.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Takasegawa-san? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I just thought it was beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fireworks, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, the fireworks.&#8221;</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;You&#8221;.</p>



<p>Yuzuru shifted his gaze from Arisa to the fireworks again.</p>



<p>The two of them found themselves in silence.</p>



<p>There was no conversation between them.</p>



<p>But strangely, there was no awkwardness, and Yuzuru felt somewhat comfortable.</p>



<p>Finally, spectacular fireworks lit up the night sky, and the fireworks display was over.</p>



<p>Now that the main fireworks were finished, the festival was over.<br></p>



<p>&#8211;In an hour or so, the stalls would be ready to be taken down.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It was beautiful, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their eyes met.</p>



<p>Arisa smiled at him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a great time today. Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too. It was fun to spend time with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru expressed his honest feelings to Arisa.</p>



<p>Then Arisa turned her gaze to the night sky again.<br><br></p>



<p>After the fireworks were over, the night sky looked strangely lonely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san&#8217;s family were all good people, too. They were kind, gentle, and cheerful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just a little excited that you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That may be so. But &#8230;&#8230; still, it&#8217;s very different from our house.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said, looking somewhat forlorn.</p>



<p>There was a touch of envy and a slight hint of jealousy on his face.</p>



<p>Then, Arisa shifted her gaze to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>There was a hint of hesitation in her eyes.</p>



<p>Anxiety, fear, and guilt &#8230;&#8230; mixed with a variety of emotions.<br></p>



<p>Arisa looked like she was about to cry, but she clenched her fists tightly as if she had made up her mind about something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I truly apologize&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Arisa bowed her head to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Yuzuru had no idea what Arisa was apologizing for.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you do something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I told you a lie.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Arisa said in a small muffled voice.</p>



<p>She lied.</p>



<p>In other words, she deceived Yuzuru</p>



<p>Yuzuru braced himself a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;What was the lie ?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt a little nervous, afraid that it would be something outrageous.</p>



<p>And the same goes for Arisa, who is also feeling nervous.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you&#8230;&#8230; that my adoptive father forced me to accept it when I was on matchmaking.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a shaky voice, Arisa said.</p>



<p>Indeed, that&#8217;s what she said to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>This is why Yuzuru decided to make a fake engagement to protect her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What is the difference?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My adoptive father &#8230;&#8230; just asked me if I would like to accept an arranged marriage meeting. He didn&#8217;t force me to do anything. But I&#8230;&#8230; was scared, &#8230;&#8230;so I said I would take it&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa turned her face down as if she was afraid to look at Yuzuru&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t see her expression, but from the slight tears in her eyes, he could tell that she was worried and scared.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I still didn&#8217;t want to, so I kept refusing &#8230;&#8230;. That&#8217;s how I lost track of it&#8230;&#8230;. So it was all my fault. I was the one who strangled myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Droplets of water fell on the porch.</p>



<p>With a shiver, Arisa&#8217;s small shoulders quivered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought, if I told you this, &#8230;&#8230; you would never cooperate with me. So I hid the inconvenient things. After that, I couldn&#8217;t say anything about it&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry that I took advantage of your kindness, Takasegawa-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then Arisa fell silent.<br></p>



<p>It seemed that this was the end of her confession.</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;What, that&#8217;s all it was? &#8230;&#8230; raise your face.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When Yuzuru said this, Arisa looked up with a look of fear on her face.</p>



<p>Her beautiful face was smeared with tears.</p>



<p>Yuzuru turned to Arisa and put his hands on her shoulders.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t really care about that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said slowly and delicately.<br></p>



<p>Then Arisa&#8217;s expression became distorted.</p>



<p>&#8220;B, But&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the first place, It&#8217;s not a lie .&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru interrupted Arisa&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>He then looked into Arisa&#8217;s eyes and spoke as if to convince her.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You were mentally trapped. At least, you couldn&#8217;t refuse your adoptive father&#8217;s proposal. You were in such a state of mind. So you had no choice but to accept your adoptive father&#8217;s proposal, didn&#8217;t you?　That&#8217;s called being &#8220;forced&#8221; in the common sense of the word.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t know how her adoptive father, Naoki Amagi, felt at the time of proposing to Arisa, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try an arranged marriage?&#8221;.</p>



<p>Maybe he was really just asking for Arisa&#8217;s free will.</p>



<p>Maybe he thought that Arisa really wanted to have an arranged marriage.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have to ask the person himself to find out more about this.</p>



<p>But, as a result of it&#8230;&#8230;, Arisa was forced to go on an arranged marriage.</p>



<p>She was forced into a situation where she was forced to get engaged and married.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;As I said a while ago, you are a victim. You may think you are at fault for your actions, and maybe you are. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be unhappy. And it doesn&#8217;t remove your right to ask for help.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>If there is something to be angry about,</p>



<p>If there was something Yuzuru to complain about,</p>



<p>There is only one.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you before. That I wouldn&#8217;t be bothered if you asked for my help. Just rely on me a little.”</p>



<p>That was all he wanted to say to Arisa.<br></p>



<p>Then she said in a thin voice, with red eyes and tears in her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, can I ask you one thing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Please lend me your chest.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru did as he was told and hugged Arisa.</p>



<p>She pressed her face against Yuzuru&#8217;s chest and started sobbing softly.</p>



<p>As he hugged her, he realized how small and slender she was.</p>



<p>He could feel her heat, her softness, and the trembling of her body.</p>



<p>She must have endured a long time with this small body.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s some kind of defense instinct that makes her feel guilty so easily.</p>



<p>The reason for her unhappiness is that she is at fault, not because of the irrationality of the situation.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what she has been trying to convince herself&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Either way, her timid personality and the way she puts up walls between people are probably due to her repressed family environment.</p>



<p>Yuzuru stroked Arisa&#8217;s head gently, trying not to ruin her hair.<br></p>



<p>Whether this would help her or not, he didn&#8217;t know, but he still wanted to do something for her.</p>





<p>After a while.</p>



<p>Arisa looked up from Yuzuru&#8217;s chest.</p>



<p>Her eyes were still wet with tears, but she looked a lot better than before.</p>



<p>She was blushing, probably embarrassed that she had cried in front of Yuzuru.</p>



<p>She turned her gaze away awkwardly and remained silent.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro, are you finished?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;can I be selfish?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please let me do this a little more.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said and pressed her face against Yuzuru&#8217;s chest again.</p>



<p>This time not burying her face, but pressing her cheek against it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please stroke my head.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, princess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.. Aren&#8217;t you embarrassed to say that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that it&#8217;s more embarrassing when someone points it out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I thought it would be embarrassing even if it wasn&#8217;t pointed out&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think your little plea is pretty much the same.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Even as he said this, Yuzuru stroked Arisa&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>It was smooth and very comfortable to the touch.</p>



<p>As he hugged her tightly and stroked her while performing the ‘good-girl,good-girl’ routine, Arisa opened her mouth again.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Um, Takasegawa-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up this time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Can I call you by your name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; Yuzuru-san, is it okay if I call you that?&#8221;</p>



<p>For a moment, Yuzuru was taken aback.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because he was flustered, his hand stopped stroking Arisa&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>Then Arisa said as if to make an excuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because Satake-san, Ayaka-san, and Chiharu-san call you by your first name. &#8230;&#8230; I think it&#8217;s a bit distant that I&#8217;m the only one who calls you with the last name.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said it somewhat sulkily.</p>



<p>She glanced up at Yuzuru with upturned eyes, as if she was a little worried.</p>



<p>Yuzuru began stroking Arisa&#8217;s head again.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Can I call you Arisa as well &#8230;&#8230;?　Everyone calls you by your first name after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Please call me that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa gave a small nod of satisfaction and closed her eyes.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>Then she tightly grabbed Yuzuru&#8217;s body with both hands like a baby who refuses to let go of his favorite blanket.<br></p>

<p><br><br>&#8220;Hey, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How long do you want me to stay like this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked as he stroked Arisa&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s tiring to keep stroking her, and even at night, it&#8217;s a little hard to hold her body against his in the summer.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s answer was as follows.</p>



<p>&#8220;All the way to my heart&#8217;s content. Is that no good?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru sighed.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no choice then. At all.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru continued to stroke Arisa&#8217;s head.　</p>
