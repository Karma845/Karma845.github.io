<h3>Chapter 10 - Fiancee's Birthday</h3>

<p>The important thing is the feelings towards the other person, so don't think about surprises and listen honestly.</span></p><p>That was the advice of Yuzuru's friend, Soichiro Satake.</span></p><p> But, however.</span></p><p>It is a thank-you item with daily gratitude.</span></p><p>It's a little different from a birthday present.</span></p><p>For birthday gifts, the expectation of "what on earth will you give me?" Is also important, isn't it?</span><span>That is the value of Yuzuru.</span></p><p>By the way, he asked Soichiro last time ...</span></p><p>Surprisingly he turns out to be useless.</span></p><p>Holy ... Given the business of his house, he knows how to drop (also called deceive) a girl, but Yuzuru doesn't want to drop Arisa.</span></p><p>After all, it is faster to ask the girl directly about this kind of thing.</span></p><p>When Yuzuru decided so, he sent an email to his childhood friend.</span></p><p>Next day.</span></p><p>After school, Yuzuru went to his childhood friend's class.</span></p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Yuzuru. You have a person named Soichiro who decided the future. You can't accept your love ..."</span></p><p>Black silk hair and reddish amber eyes.</span></p>
<p>Appearance with a slightly exotic atmosphere on white skin.</span></p><p>A girl with a well-proportioned body like a model, not to mention her face.</span></p><p>One of the childhood friends in common with Soichiro.</span></p>
<p>Ayaka Tachibana</span></p>

<p>Said to Yuzuru.</p>

<p>"When did i confess love to you?"</span></p><p>Yuzuru had a frightened face and returned.</span></p>
<p>However, her glue is usual, so it can't be helped.</p>

</span></p><p>

<p>Even this is a relationship I have had since I was a baby.</span></p>

<p>"As I said, I have a female friend and I want to give her a birthday present."</span></p>
<p>"I don't like her"</span></p><p>"If so, you should stop using accessories."</span></p><p>"Well."</span></p><p>I don't know Arisa's hobbies in the first place, so I can't give something like that.</span></p>

<p>Even if you buy Tiffany, it will go online.</span></p>

<p>...... I don't think Arisa is a child who sells things that people give her.</span></p>

<p>"What kind of relationship do you have?"</span></p>

<p>You can't tell that you're in a false engagement, and you can't tell it.</span></p>

<p>The information network of the Tachibana family cannot be ridiculous, and Ayaka looks like this and is smart and easy to guess.</span></p>

<p>If you say bad things, you will find out the relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa in no time.</span></p>

<p>...... Maybe she've even got the information.</span></p>

<p>"She&#8217;s a female friend, but ... I'm not as close as you are ... but I'm not unfamiliar ... In other words, I'm close to you, but I'm keeping a certain sense of distance. And I want to continue to get along with that child. "</span></p>

<p>"Hmm. In other words, friends who are not lovers or thoughtful people, but apart from ordinary friends, they have some kind of deep connection and share some profits ... like friends?"</span></p><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Well, that &#8217;s right.&#8221;</span>

</p><p>Why is this guy so easy to guess?</span></p>

<p>"Yuzurun, do you give me an assortment of sweets every year? Isn't that bad?"</span></p>

<p>Yuzuru and Ayaka have a relationship with an infant.</span></p>

<p>Naturally, I give a present as a step-in-law on my birthday.</span></p>

<p>Every year, Yuzuru sends her an assortment of cookie-like sweets that will last for a long time.</span></p>

<p>"No ... well, I thought about it. That ... is it ... a sense of duty?"</span></p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't seem to matter if you put it out at the year-end gift or midyear gift."</span></p>

<p>The relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa is that they are fiancés and lovers.</span></p>

<p>Giving that person the same thing as a childhood friend's girl friend ... definitely will be told by her grandparents later.</span></p><p>And for sweets, you can prepare a cake.</span></p>

<p>It's not very good because it will be worn as a gift.</span></p><p>When they are both worried like that ...</span></p><p>"Oh, Ayaka-san to Yuzuru-san. What are you talking about?"</span></p><p>Occasionally, another girl appeared from the hallway.</span></p><p>Bright brown hair and hazel eyes.</span></p><p>A well-organized Japanese-style face.</span></p><p>It's a little short, but the chest bulge is noticeable.</span></p><p>One of his childhood friends.</span></p><p>Chiharu Uenishi</span></p><p>It is.</span></p>

<p>Arisa Yukishiro, Ayaka Tachibana, Chiharu Uenishi, and another one,Nagi Nashi Amaka</span></p><p>Nagiri Tenka</span></p><p>The four girls, including the girl, have a reputation for being very beautiful in the school.</span></p><p>By the way, Yuzuru has no direct acquaintance with Nagi Amaka, but according to his friend in the same class as her, "that is a devilish woman."</span></p><p>"Yuzurugasa, You want to give a present to a girl."</span></p><p>"Hey, is it spring for Yuzuru-san? It smells like water if you don't talk to me."</span></p><p>"I was going to talk to you after Ayaka-chan. And it's not spring."</span></p><p>After refusing that, I muttered inwardly that it would be noisy when these two people gathered.</span></p><p>He don't hate it, and although He&#8217;s a close friend, it's hard to stop when these two people with high-tension personalities come together.</span></p><p>However, it became more and more noisy to say that, so Yuzuru decided to finish the matter quickly.</span></p><p>"That's why Chiharu-chan. What kind of things would you like to receive?"</span></p><p>"It's something other than sweets, isn't it? Well, what about cosmetics?"</span></p><p>"Cosmetics? ... I don't know at all."</span></p><p>Isn't it a nuisance to be given a makeup tool?</span><span>Yuzuru tilts his head.</span></p><p>"I have a taste for authentic things, but if it's a lotion, lip balm, soap, etc .... I'll use it if it's not very strange."</span></p><p>"Sure, that's convenient. It's a range where you don't feel any romantic feelings."</span></p><p>Ayaka agreed with Chiharu's opinion.</span></p><p>If it is such a thing, it may be good to distinguish it from the ones given to Ayoka and Chiharu.</span></p><p>"I see, yeah, thank you. I'll look it up myself."</span></p><p>"Tell me when it comes to fruition"</span></p><p>"A man is courageous!"</span></p><p>"You're saying you're not in love."</span></p><p>Yuzuru sighed and then left.</span></p><p>Well, about a week has passed, Saturday.</span></p><p>The 25th of June.</span></p><p>That day was exactly the day before her birthday ....</span></p><p>As expected, it doesn't cover birthdays.</span></p><p>As usual, Yuzuru played a light game with Arisa.</span></p><p>Then take a short break and eat the cake as usual.</span></p><p>"Somehow, I'm sorry for always having you treat the cake."</span></p><p>"Speaking of that, I have you cook my meal."</span></p><p>They are like each other.</span></p><p>After Yuzuru said that ... as if I suddenly remembered it, I was a little forcible.</span></p><p>"Speaking of cake"</span></p><p>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p>"Happy birthday, will it be tomorrow?"</span></p><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Ah, that's right.&#8221;</span></p><p>After a brief pause, Arisa reacted as if she remembered.</span></p><p>No way, Takasegawa san would like to celebrate her birthday!</span></p><p>It's not a surprise.</span></p><p>"... Maybe you never forgot your birthday?"</span></p><p>"Well ... I remember the date. I don't usually think about it."</span></p><p>Arisa turned her eyes a little and replied.</span></p><p>Apparently he didn't really realize that his birthday was near.</span></p><p>...... Maybe there has never been a celebration due to family circumstances?</span></p><p>Yuzuru felt very pitiful.</span></p>

<p>"Why does Mr. Takasegawa have my birthday?"</span></p><p>"It was written in the material at the time of the matchmaking ... And recently, I was contacted by my grandfather."</span></p><p>"I see .... That's right. If you're a fiancé, you have to know each other's birthdays. It was a complete blind spot."</span></p><p>"Well, fortunately my grandfather didn't seem to be particularly skeptical that I didn't know your birthday, so rest assured. I was shocked."</span></p><p>When Yuzuru replied, Arisa bowed apologetically.</span></p><p>"... I'm sorry I didn't tell you."</span></p><p>"Because they are like each other. By the way, my birthday is ... October 16th. Nice to meet you."</span></p><p>When Yuzuru said so, she recorded the information on her smartphone.</span></p><p>With this, Arisa no longer misses Yuzuru's birthday.</span></p><p>"And Youkishiro-san "</span></p><p>"Yeah?"</span></p>

<p>"Of course, I prepared a birthday present."</span></p>

<p>When Yuzuru took out the cute paper bag hidden in the shadow and said so ...</span></p><p>This time, Arisa was surprised and solidified.</span></p>
