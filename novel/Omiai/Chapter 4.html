<h3>Chapter 4 - Taking Care of Fiancee</h3>


<p>Oh shit!”</p>



<p>“Look out!”</p>



<p>Yuzuru staggered greatly, but thanks to Arisa, who moved quickly, he was able to avoid kissing the ground.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p>“Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Oh, Oh…thank you” (I think something soft is touching my face.)</p>



<p>While getting up, Yuzuru thought about “soft cushion” that caught his face.</p>



<p> Fortunately, Arisa didn’t seem to notice or simply care about it.</p>



<p>(It smelled good, and…it was really soft.)</p>



<p>While re-supporting himself with the crutches received from Arisa, Yuzuru recalls.</p>



<p>This is a bit of a perk, isn’t it?</p>



<p>“I’m greatful for the feelings, but it’s okay. I don’t want to bother you.”</p>



<p>It’s lame to have a girl protect you, his pride starts to kick in.</p>



<p>And most importantly, …weird rumors will start circulating if Arisa starts taking care of me.</p>



<p>If somebody sees Arisa together with me, they may misinterpret our relationship and the whole school will come to know about our engagement. At school, there are many students who are close to Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>Anyone can start a rumor but none can stop it. We’ll be the center of attention at school in no time.</p>



<p>“Says the person who just fell.”</p>



<p>“Geh…”</p>



<p>I can’t deny it though. Yesterday, I was struggling alone in the room.</p>



<p>“I just don’t want to owe you anything so let me return the favor.”</p>



<p>“But you know, if somebody saw us together…”</p>



<p>“Rest assured, Takasegawa-san. I understand. I also don’t want people to start strange rumors either. When you go to school, I will help you until you leave the apartment. Then we won’t be seen together by other students, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s…yeah, that’s right. Then, I owe you a debt of gratitude.”</p>



<p>Even if I refuse her she will probably follow me, so I meekly decided to borrow her help. In fact, I was facing difficulty just to press the switch on the elevator, so I was grateful for her help until I leave the apartment.</p>



<p>“Well then I’ll go ahead. …It’s okay, right?”</p>



<p>“Oh, no problem.”</p>



<p>I’d rather have you go ahead of me as soon as possible. It’s only a short walk from my apartment. The school’s students could walk by at any time.</p>



<p>“Can we exchange contacts before that?”</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, we haven’t exchange yet.”</p>



<p>It will certainly be necessary, he nods.</p>



<p>However, since my hands are occupied by crutches, I’ll have Arisa take out my smartphone from my bag and let her do it.</p>



<p>“I’m done. Then, please contact me when you leave school.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I understand.”</p>



<p>Arisa bowed with an unemotional expression on her face and headed to school with a slight sprint.</p>



<p>Then Yuzuru leisurely and cautiously went to school while prodding the crutches.</p>



<p>………………………………………</p>



<p>My classmates were surprised when they saw me arrive at school on crutches, …they didn’t pursue it anymore, when I explained them that it was only a slight sprain.</p>



<p>At lunch.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was sitting with his friends together on the desks in the classroom.</p>



<p>“Hey take this, the bread is as requested.”</p>



<p>“Oops, thanks”</p>



<p>Soichiro, one of my friend, threw the bread at me that he had purchased. And he placed the Tea in front of me that was purchased by my another friend.</p>



<p>“So…How did you injure yourself?”</p>



<p>My another bad friend, Ryozenji Sei, asked me. He gave an impression that made him looked like flirty student. He was also wearing his uniform a little like me and Soichiro, but … in addition, he had a black necklace hanging from his neck.</p>



<p>The dress code of this high school is “Dress and Hairstyle appropriate for the high school student ” (Translation : Freedom if you follow bare minimum common sense), so it is not a violation of school rules.</p>



<p>“I went out and bought you bread from cafeteria because of your injury. Come on, you have to answer me.”</p>



<p>Soichiro also sat down and asks Yuzuru about it.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, Soichiro and Sei.</p>



<p>These three people were very close, and they were always acting together.</p>



<p>However, in fact three of them were in different classes. They usually ate at cafeteria, but because of Yuzuru’s injury they decided to eat at Yuzuru’s classroom.</p>



<p>“Well…there was a cat on the tree…it’s an honorable injury.”</p>



<p>When I told them my story.</p>



<p>First, Soichiro spurted out.</p>



<p>Subsequently, Sei burst into laughing while pointing his finger at me.</p>



<p>“This is what it means, when a mummy hunter becomes a mummy.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;re so dumb!”</p>



<p>“Shut up…that cat went wild”</p>



<p>“…It must have really hated to be rescued by you.”</p>



<p>“You were dropped by a cat! It’s too funny.”</p>



<p>Soichiro and Sei laughed hysterically. With a snort, Yuzuru crossed his arms.</p>



<p>“Well, well…don’t get angry. I am sorry…”</p>



<p>“It was just too funny.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>



<p>The proverb &#8220;like begets like&#8221; flashed through my mind for a moment, but I crumpled it up and threw it outside. These two continued to laugh for a while, but soon got bored and brought up another topic.</p>



<p>“By the way, Yuzuru. What happened to arrange marriage.”</p>



<p>“Oh, there was that story! You ordered in a beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed, pale skin, big breasted girl, right?　Did the beautiful girl come as ordered?”</p>



<p>“Hey, guys, don’t say it out loud…”</p>



<p>Arisa is also in this classroom, eating lunch with her classmates. “Beautiful girl with blonde hair, blue-eyed, pale skin”, is fine but I don’t want her to hear “big breasted girl” part.</p>



<p>“Nobody came, …there is no way someone like that will ever come…”</p>



<p>“It’s boring”</p>



<p>“Huh, say that she came even if it was a lie.”</p>



<p>My story of arrange marriage is just a joke to them, someone else problem.</p>



<p>…Well, of course, for me its a good thing , because it will be problematic if they take it seriously.</p>



<p>(There’s no way I can say, I am “Engaged” with Arisa Yukishiro, to them.)</p>



<p>For the time being, I should stay tight-lipped…I can visibly imagine getting ridiculed, if I told them the truth.</p>



<p>“More importantly, Soichiro. What’s going on with Ayaka-chan and Chiharu-chan?”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s right. This human waste! Be clear!”</p>



<p>“Wait a second. Don’t suddenly point your spear at me.”</p>



<p>By forcibly diverting the conversation, Yuzuru avoided further inquiries.</p>



<p>………………………………………………</p>



<p>After school.</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked his friends to help him go down the stairs and went to his apartment alone.</p>



<p>When he reached home,in front of the apartment, Arisa was waiting for him.</p>



<p>“I will carry your luggage.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>I obediently indulged in Arisa&#8217;s kindness and asked her to walk me to the door. Even though it was an elevator, it was still easier to have a little bit of human assistance, and more importantly, there was a certain amount of comfort in having someone on your side.</p>



<p>“Then, Yukishiro. Let’s stop at this today…”</p>



<p>“Let me help you take off your shoes. Isn’t that hard?”</p>



<p>“There is a key in my bag pocket.”</p>



<p>He gave her his key thinking that she will probably help until the end, because of kindness.</p>



<p>Arisa open the door with her usual clam expression.</p>



<p>…But her clam expression froze in an instant.</p>



<p>She froze with her eyes wide-open.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong, Yukishiro?”</p>



<p>“What is this room? …there is no place to even step.”</p>



<p>Arisa frowned at the room, when she saw the room littered with garbage, junk food and handouts. Yuzuru isn’t very good at cleaning and tidying up.</p>



<p>“For the time being, I’m organizing it in my own may. I know where my things basically are…”</p>



<p>“Whether you truly understand your situation or not, Takasegawa-san. But it’s too dangerous for you to walk around in this junk filled room with those crutches.”</p>



<p>Arisa said so, while helping me take off my shoes. Thanks to that, I was able to go into my room without difficulty.</p>



<p>“Hey, Takasegawa-san.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“You should at least wipe the tip of your crutches before you go into the room, it’s dirty.”</p>



<p>Arisa said so as she took out wet wipes from her bag and carefully wiped the tip of crutches. Then, she let out a sigh…</p>



<p>“You can take care of yourself, right?”</p>



<p>“Sorry. I don’t care…”</p>



<p>“Please care! …I’m going now, is that okay?”</p>



<p>Arisa said so with a deep worry, while looking at my devastating room and my crutches. She had an expression that says “I can’t go home like this”. He walks around the room to show that there is particularly no problem in order to assure Arisa.</p>



<p>“It’s okay. This is my room, so I know its terrain properly.”</p>



<p>While he was demonstrating, he stepped on a piece of a paper which caused him to slip and his body leaned heavily.</p>



<p>“…Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Wow, sorry. I really appreciate it.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, I didn’t fall, Arisa, who was at my side supported me in time.</p>



<p>I was acting impatient. I break out in a cold sweat.</p>




<p>“Aah… I can’t leave you alone like this. I will clean the room, okay?”</p>



<p>There was something about such Arisa that made her indesputable.</p>



<p>It’s pathetic to have a classmate girl, to clean up your room, so I’d like to avoid it, but I can’t overturn the fact that I almost fell down earlier.</p>



<p>“Alright”</p>



<p>I could only nod helplessly.</p>
