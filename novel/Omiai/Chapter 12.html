<h2>Chapter 12 - Fiancee and the Teller</h3>

<p>
I was on my way to return the book to the library in the school ...</p>
<p>"Eh !? Why?"</p>
<p>I heard a frivolous voice.</p>
<pIt's a joke, but it sounded more like it's angry.</p>
<p>"Hey, just a little ... Iets have a trial run. One month ... No, one week, no, three days! starting from friends ..."</p>
<p>Apparently, it seemed to be a love dispute.</p>
<p>However, I didn't have a hobby to get his head caught in a stranger's color love, so I just ignored it and tries to pass by ...</p>
<p>"No, Because I don't like you"</p>
<p>I stopped at a familiar voice.</p>
<p>A dignified and beautiful, but somehow inorganic and freezing cold voice.</p>
<p>It was a girl's voice that I knew well.</p>
<p>When you know each other, you can't leave the other person alone in such situations.</p>
<p>I headed for the voice.</p>
<p>The place was unpopular, shaded by trees.</p>
<p>Secretly, I looked around that what's going on.</p>
<p>The familiar voice was my "fiancé", Arisa Yukishiro.</p>
<p>And one persistently clinging to that "fiancée" is ...</p>
<p>One is my senior.</p>
<p>(If my memory is correct ... It's the ace of the soccer club.)</p>
<p>I remembered seeing the award being given at the morning assembly or something.</p>
<p>He is a person whose name has recently come up in conversation with Soichiro and Sei.
&#12288;
The name is Umihara.</p>
<p>"Well! Which side do you not like ? I don't think i am that bad ..."</p>
<p>"Overall, everything"</p>
<pArisa cut his words off in between.</p>
<pAnd the umihara ... looks a little frustrated.</p>
<p>"Well, don't say that hard ... I'm sure I'll help you."</p>
<p>"I don't need your help."</p>
<p>"Your father's company is having a hard time running right now, right?"</p>
<p>Arisa's expression froze.</p>
<p>The original expressionless expression changes to a Noh mask-like expression.
<p>"Because my dad is a member of the city council. I'm sure it will be useful for you ..."</p>
<p>"no thanks!"</p>
<p>Arisa throw the words away, and she turns her heels back and tries to leave.&#12288;</p>
<p>However, the senpai grabbed that arm.</p>
<p>"Please let go .... I'll tell the teacher."</p>
<p>"Wait, wait. Let's talk a little more ..."</p>
<p>Icouldn't leave her alone any longer.</p>
<p>"She hates you."</p>
<p>When I came out, I blamed the senpai with a strong tone.</p>
<p>I approaches while staring at the eyes of the senpai.</p>
<p>"Ah? Who are you ... it has nothing to do with you...."</p>
<p>He distorted his expression in a bad way.</p>
<p>For the time being, he seemed to be aware that he is forcing himself.</p>
<p>"As a classmate, I can't leave her alone .... Why don't you let go?"</p>
<p>I says so and approached him ...</p>
<p>The senpai looked a little away.</p>
<p>He was a unexpectedly weak person.</p>
<p>"Don't get in the way of your senpai."</p>
<p>With that said, Umihara reached out to push my body.</p>
<p>I didn't have the courage to hit him.</p>
<p>However, I waa scared when approached.</p>
<p>It was an action because of human&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; psychology.</p>
<p>I grabbed his hand strongly.</p>
<p>Then lightly twist it up.</p>
<p>"I ..."</p>
<p>Umihara frowned in pain.</p>
<p>With that pain, he let go of the hand that was holding Arisa.</p>
<p>And Arisa hid behind me.</p>
<p>I let go of the Umihara.</p>
<p>"You ... what's your name?"</p>
<p>Frustrated, Umihara asked me.</p>
<p>There is no reason to be afraid, frightened, or hidden, so I answered honestly.</p>
<p>"I'm Yuzuru Takasegawa."</p>
<p>"... Takasegawa, hey, I'll remember."</p>
<p>I threw him away and left Umihara to escape.</p>
<p>After that, I relaxed my shoulders.</p>
<p>"... That, Takasegawa-san"</p>
<p>Arisa tended to be reluctant and called out to me with a frightened expression.</p>
<p>Then she bowed her head.</p>
<p>"&#8230;&#8230;I apologize for the inconvenience"</p>
<p>"No, don't worry. Rather than that ... I wonder if I should'nt have intervane "</p>
<p>Arisa seems to hate being intervened in her own circumstances.</p>
<p>That's why I wanted to just look at the situation if possible.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't resist force, so I decided to intervene.</p>
<p>"No ... I was really in trouble, so I was saved."</p>
<p>"Well, then ... well, I can't say i am happy. It was a disaster."</p>
<p>"... I'm okay, but ... is Takasegawa fine ?"</p>
<p>Arisa worriedly said to me.</p>
<pWell, I tilts my head as to what it means ...</p>
<p>Immediately I understood, what was the point.</p>
<p>Perhaps I've caught the attention of Umihara.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's okay, it's okay. I can't do much about that. He seems like a weak type ... at best, I'll tell my parents."</p>
<p>"That's ... isn't it difficult? That person, dad ... Isn't he a powerful person in that line? And surely ... he was the ace of the soccer club, right?"</p>
<p>"Well, he's a celebrity."</p>
<p>But ...</p>
<p>"That person originally has a bad reputation."</p>
<p>"&#8230;&#8230;Really?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't seem that the soccer team members like him much."</p>
<p>I've heard my classmates talks.</p>
<p>Well, originally I didn't want to hear much about people's bad words ...</p>
<p>However, he was relatively famous.</p>
<p>"And it's also famous as verbal demon."</p>
<p>"Verbal demon ?"</p>
<p>"Recently, my female friends seems to have been involved. It was annoying."</p>
<p>The female friends were Ayaka Tachibana and Chiharu Uenishi.</p>
<p>Maybe he wanted to improve his position by making a cute first grader, a little good girl, a lover ...</p>
<p>"It seems that he was forcing it."</p>
<p>"... Are they all right?"</p>
<p>"Ah, a friend broke in. I heard that they had some trouble,but not bad as now. they must have set him off."</p>
<p>The friend was Soichiro Satake.</p>
<p>At that time, I thought that he was quite enthusiastic, such as forcibly urging the child of Tachibana and Uminishi to associate and having a fight to Satake.</p>
<p>Apparently, he was just a naive pampered son.&#12288;&#12288;</p>
<p>When talking about family affairs, you should at least remember not only your own "house" but also the "house" of others.</p>
<p>"Are you really okay?"</p>
<p>"Just let it go .... But if anything happens, tell me."</p>
<p>"&#8230;&#8230;Okay"</p>
<p>Arisa nodded with an uneasy expression somewhere.</p>
<p>Well, three days later.</p>
<p>lunch break.</p>
<p>"Hey, Takasegawa .... Senior Umihara is calling you. Also, Yukishiro."</p>
<p>I was approached by a soccer member in the same class.</p>
<p>I tilted my head, wondering what the matter is.</p>
<p>However, there was no doubt that it was related to the matter the other day.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? Takasegawa .... that person, Umihara, was frustrated."</p>
<p>Anxiously my classmate asked.</p>
<p>I fluttered my hand and said brightly.</p>
<p>"That's bad. Maybe it was me who annoyed him.... please don't let it bother yourself."</p>
<p>"No, we're good."</p>
<p>Don't worry, I told the soccer team boy.</p>
<p>Then I turned my gaze toward Arisa.</p>
<p>t seems that she was also contacted.</p>
<p>Although she was always expressionless, her eyes seemed to be shaking with a little anxiety.</p>
<p>Then I turned his gaze toward the classroom door.</p>
<p>With a frustrated expression on his face, I can see Umihara with his arms crossed</p>
<p>I decided to do things as comfortably as possible and not to bother Arisa.</p>
