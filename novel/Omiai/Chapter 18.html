<h3>Chapter 18 - Fiancee and Summer Vacation</h3>


<p>The day before the summer vacation started, a piece of paper was handed out to the students along with their report cards.</p>



<p>Fifth place. That&#8217;s better than before.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded in satisfaction as he looked at the results of the school mock exam.</p>



<p>His school has about three hundred students.</p>



<p>&#8211;This school is classified as a &#8220;preparatory school,&#8221; so the fifth place is enough to be proud of.</p>



<p>(Will Yukshiro make it to the top?)</p>



<p>As a rule, only the students themselves are informed of their grades.</p>



<p>But the students ranked tenth or higher are posted in front of the staff room, so you can find out if you go see that.</p>



<p>Normally Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t care about other people&#8217;s rankings, but this time he felt like he should go and take a look.</p>






<p>Thus, Yuzuru went to see the ranking list.</p>



<p>It was a little crowded, as it was just after it was posted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro is &#8230;&#8230; in first place again.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems that her efforts have paid off.</p>



<p>Even though it was not about me, I felt a little delighted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, Yukishiro-san came in first again this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; It seems so&#8230;&#8230;eh.? Ayaka-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuzuru.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before he knew it, Ayaka Tachibana was right beside Yuzuru.</p>



<p>For some reason, she was smirking at him.</p>



<p>Yuzuru had a bad feeling about this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuzuru. Why did you care about Arisa Yukishiro&#8217;s ranking?</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the same class, so it&#8217;s not strange, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s true.. Yuzuru, unless it&#8217;s someone close to you, you&#8217;re not interested in their grades normally.&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, Yuzuru sighs at how perceptive she is.</p>



<p>And then he glanced at the ranking list and &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Ayaka-chan. Congratulations on your third place.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same as last time. Soichiro-kun is in eighth place, and Nagiri-san is in tenth place.&#8221;</p>



<p>“</p>



<p>Nagiri means Tenka Nagiri Right?&#8230;&#8230; She seems like a smart girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that surprising that she&#8217;s smart, since her impression from the outside was that she was a very serious person.</p>



<p>“So, Yuzuru. If you don&#8217;t care about Nagiri-san, why were you curious about Yukishiro-san’s ranking? Wow, You look blatantly uncomfortable. You don&#8217;t want me to pry into it at all huh. So that means you have some kind of connection right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The only reason I made an uncomfortable face was that I thought it was annoying that when she just happened to mention something that caught my eye, my childhood friend was asking me something like this. She&#8217;s a classmate, so it&#8217;s not surprising that I’m somewhat curious about her.&#8221;</p>



<p>If Yuzuru and Arisa were in completely different classes, it might be a little strange for him to be concerned about it, but they are in the same class. So it wasn&#8217;t strange to be concerned about how well their classmates were doing.</p>



<p>When Yuzuru replied like that, Ayaka put her hand on her chin and began to think about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. When you think about it calmly, it&#8217;s just a bit too much of a hunch on my part&#8230;But something is fishy. The reason why I suspected Yuzuru is something &#8230;&#8230; Ah!! I remember!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka clapped her hands with a pop.</p>



<p>Then she grinned, a nasty smile on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The person you gave that birthday present to, was it Yukishiro-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s heart thumped achingly.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru is the next head of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>He can at least keep his emotions out of his face, keep a clean slate, and tell a lie.</p>



<p>Even Ayaka, who has good intuition, could not seem to decipher the truth from Yuzuru&#8217;s expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, am I thinking too much?</p>



<p>&#8220;You should probably work on your love life with Soichiro rather than my love life.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to worry about that Yuzuru, Soichiro and I love each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>I hope that is the case.</p>



<p>Yuzuru sighed as he remembered the face of his other childhood friend.</p>






<p>‘Come back once for the summer vacation.’</p>



<p>This was one of the conditions for Yuzuru to live alone.</p>



<p>However, since he had a part-time job, he didn&#8217;t plan to stay at home for long.</p>



<p>He would only be staying at home for about two weeks at most.</p>



<p>So Yuzuru packed his luggage in his carry-on bag and got on the train to go home.</p>



<p>Then &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Yukishiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah Takesagawa-san, what a strange coincidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coincidentally, he bumped into Arisa who was occupying a seat.</p>



<p>Arisa looked at Yuzuru&#8217;s carry-on bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;That reminds me, you said you were going back to your parents&#8217; house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8230;What about you Yukishiro?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d go shopping for summer clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems that she just happened to be there.</p>



<p>However, it is a bit lucky that we met here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Once again, &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll see you in two weeks.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what he told her on Saturday, the last time they saw each other, but it wasn&#8217;t the last time since he had school afterward.</p>



<p>And since I didn&#8217;t get a chance to say hello to Arisa at school, this was a good opportunity.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa replied matter-of-factly.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s goodbye in this life, and it&#8217;s not that sad, considering that they can meet in just two weeks and can be contacted by email or phone.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa exchanged a brief greeting and promised to meet again in two weeks.</p>






<p>At this moment, they had no idea what to expect.</p>



<p>They never thought that they would not be able to fulfill their promise to meet again in two weeks.</p>



<p>To think that something like that would happen &#8230;&#8230;</p>






<p>It was three days after the summer vacation started.</p>



<p>Arisa was quietly working on her summer vacation assignment.</p>



<p>But as if to interrupt her concentration, the phone suddenly rang.</p>



<p>Eh? Not many people call me, though. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>When she checked the number, it was Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yukishiro?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is my phone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s also true.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s voice was a little tense.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the matter, he&#8217;s calling me?</p>



<p>Arisa was a little worried.</p>



<p>Unless it was an urgent matter, he could just text her.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I have a little favor to ask you. &#8230;&#8230; Is this a good time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was just thinking that I need to take a break.</p>



<p>This is a good way to relax.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to force you at all. You can say no if you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to ask you to do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what is it?&#8230;.. If you&#8217;re too tense, I&#8217;ll start getting nervous too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this such a serious matter to discuss?　</p>



<p>Arisa felt her heart beat a little faster.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I want you to go on a date with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A date? At the previous general entertainment center?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa remembered that it was fun to go there.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>But Yuzuru immediately denied it.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no. The old man &#8230;&#8230; had already prepared tickets for the two of us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. &#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s another meddling huh&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, he said he got it from someone. &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true or not. I tried to say no, but &#8216;What couple doesn&#8217;t go out once during the summer vacation!&#8217; is what he said&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t argue with that at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a &#8230;&#8230; good argument. Fine, we&#8217;ll go out together.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Arisa who proposed this &#8220;engagement&#8221; to Yuzuru in the first place.</p>



<p>Before Yuzuru’s grandfather made his move, Arisa should have suggested several things to him to keep the image up.</p>



<p>So this was her fault as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m glad when you say that&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, where is the place we need to go?&#8221;</p>



<p>It is a ticket to somewhere, so something like an amusement park or a movie?</p>



<p>Arisa asked Yuzuru while thinking</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, can you repeat that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;For a moment there was a noise and she couldn&#8217;t hear him.</p>



<p>So she asked him to say it again.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the pool. &#8230;&#8230; I was wondering if you would go to the pool with me.&#8221;</p>
