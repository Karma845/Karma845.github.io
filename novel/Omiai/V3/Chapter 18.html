<h3>Chapter 18 – The Fragrance of “Fiancé”: After</h3>

<p>Arisa soaked herself in the bathtub, making an unladylike noise.</p>



<p>She stretched her arms and legs.</p>



<p>Whether it was thanks to the effects of the fatigue-relieving bath salts or not&#8230; she felt a pleasant sensation as if the fatigue was slipping away from her body.</p>



<p>Then, as she gazed blankly at the bathroom wall, she muttered.</p>






<p>“&#8230;Yuzuru-san didn&#8217;t see that, did he?&#8221;</p>







<p>Inside Arisa&#8217;s bag.</p>



<p>There was a towel and a change of clothes in there&#8230; but there were also other items as well.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s weird that I brought my school swimsuit, right&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa had brought her school swimsuit with her.</p>



<p>It was just a whim.</p>



<p>The idea of taking a bath together in a school swimsuit had crossed her mind a little bit, just a little bit.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t go through with it&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa breathed a sigh of relief.</p>







<p>Although they were supposed to be in love, Arisa and Yuzuru were not officially lovers yet.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that they are in love with each other, but as long as they have not confirmed to each other that they are lovers &#8230;taking a bath together is indeed skipping too many steps.</p>







<p>(<em>I wish he would just confess already</em>)</p>







<p>Arisa muttered to herself internally</p>







<p>To be honest, Arisa was a little impatient with the fact that Yuzuru was not telling her how he felt about her.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru is not the kind of person who would be hesitant about whether or not to confess&#8230; Or so Arisa thinks.</p>







<p>And Ayaka, Yuzuru&#8217;s childhood friend, told Arisa that Yuzuru is the type of person who prepares meticulously.</p>



<p>Although it is frustrating, between Arisa and Ayaka, Ayaka has known Yuzuru longer than Arisa.</p>



<p>And that Ayaka has endorsed that Yuzuru will confess his love for her, so there&#8217;s no doubt about it.</p>



<p>But that itself was bothering her.</p>







<p>That&#8217;s why Arisa came up with this &#8220;massage plan&#8221; to urge Yuzuru on.</p>



<p>Arisa is aware of the fact that her body is attractive to men.</p>



<p>She also knows that Yuzuru is attracted to her.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the two parties give each other a &#8220;massage&#8221; and their bodies touch each other…&nbsp; Yuzuru will surely desire Arisa intensely.</p>







<p>&#8230;of course, it&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s expecting him to make a &#8220;mistake&#8221;.</p>



<p>Rather, Yuzuru would probably not do anything like assaulting Arisa&#8230; at least Arisa thought so.</p>







<p>Now that she thought about it, there were many times when she was defenseless, but Yuzuru did not try to do anything to Arisa.</p>



<p>So he won&#8217;t do it again this time.</p>



<p>His reason is very strong.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; not that I wouldn&#8217;t&#8230; mind at all..&#8221;</p>







<p>It could be said that she&#8217;s trying to rush Yuzuru to confess, but in the end, what she is doing is the same as seduction.</p>



<p>Then it can&#8217;t be helped but if he does this or that.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not that she wants him to do anything, and she definitely doesn’t expect him to do anything.</p>







<p>The kind of perverted tendency that expects him to force himself on her doesn&#8217;t exist in her at all, not even the slightest bit.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that if it&#8217;s him&#8230; if it&#8217;s someone she likes that’s pushing her down, she just thinks that it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>







<p>&#8220;I just want him to tell me how he feels about me as soon as possible, and I want to put the current situation of uncertainty behind me&#8230; It is not that I am expecting Yuzuru-san to become a wolf, nor am I inviting him to do so. Ju, just that&#8230; if something like that happens, at that time I am willing to forgive Yuzuru-san as it can&#8217;t be helped. That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>She had prepared contraceptives, just in case.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s expecting anything like that.</p>







<p>&#8220;I, I mean, we haven&#8217;t even kissed yet&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa sank into the bath, her face turning bright red.</p>



<p>Just imagining it made her feel hot and helplessly embarrassed.</p>



<p>Her chest grew sad, her back felt as if it were on fire, and her lower abdomen tingled.</p>







<p>&#8220;A, As expected it&#8217;s impossible&#8230; It&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa mumbled something like that, even though no one was listening to her.</p>



<p>Then she stood up.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa, now completely exhausted, decided to get out of the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I&#8217;m done with the bath, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>After getting dressed, Arisa called out to Yuzuru, who was sitting on the sofa playing with his cell phone.</p>



<p>Then, for some reason, Yuzuru trembled.</p>







<p>&#8220;A, ah&#8230;okay.&#8221;</p>







<p>For some reason, Yuzuru was fidgeting.</p>



<p>Then&#8230; he tilted his head.</p>







<p>&#8220;That looks really cold&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought this would be more convenient for the massage&#8230; I&#8217;ve brought my winter clothes separately.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said and put her hand on her chest.</p>



<p>Arisa was wearing a thin short-sleeved shirt and shorts that she had brought as a change of clothes.</p>



<p>If she intended to do massage, she should wear clothes that were thin in fabric and could be wrinkled.</p>







<p>&#8220;.. I see.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa felt that Yuzuru&#8217;s gaze &#8230;went to her chest.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just the chest, but also the legs that stretch out from the slightly shorter-length shorts that Yuzuru&#8217;s gaze focused on.</p>







<p>&#8230;It&#8217;s not that she was aiming for it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that she remembered that Yuzuru used to occasionally cast passionate glances at certain parts of her in her gym clothes during the sports festival.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t that she dared to wear a shirt that would show off her body lines or pants that would show off her legs as much as possible.</p>



<p>She is aware that her breasts are very attractive to men and that her legs are classified as &#8220;beautiful&#8221;, but she has never chosen to wear clothes that emphasize them.</p>



<p>It really is just a coincidence.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just embarrassing that Yuzuru would look at her like that, and there is no such emotion as happiness or anything like that&#8230; not at all.</p>







<p>“&#8230; Well, I guess I should put on a thin shirt for a change as well.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru muttered something like that.</p>



<p>Yes, as Yuzuru admitted, it was an extremely rational decision to wear a thin fabric garment for a massage.</p>







<p>So the reason why Yuzuru is feeling lustful for Arisa in such a way is that Yuzuru Takasegawa is a really troublesome person, and he is a pervert&#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that Arisa is weird.</p>



<p>Arisa is perfectly normal, not weird at all, and there is no such thing as being a pervert like Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll get in the bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. Have a nice time.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru disappeared into the changing room.</p>



<p>Arisa sat down on the sofa where Yuzuru had just sat down, feeling nervous.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;I messed up a bit.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa blushed a little as she remembered the mess she had made of her clothes in the changing room.</p>



<p>At the time, she had been in a hurry and had been so upset that she hadn&#8217;t had the presence of mind to straighten her clothes.</p>



<p>In addition to that, there is a side of conceit that Yuzuru will not come into the changing room and it will not be seen&#8230;</p>



<p>However, in her haste, she forgot to bring a change of clothes and a towel, and her carelessness allowed him to see her dirty clothes and&#8230; underwear.</p>



<p>It was very embarrassing.</p>







<p>&#8220;As expected&#8230; he must have seen that, right&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>Maybe the reason why Yuzuru was so fidgety was that he saw Arisa&#8217;s dirty clothes.</p>



<p>No, that must be it.</p>



<p>When she thought about it&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;No, No way&#8230; Yuzuru-san.. he didn&#8217;t do anything weird to my clothes, did he?&#8221;</p>







<p>Looking back on it, it seemed like the position had changed a bit&#8230;</p>



<p>She couldn&#8217;t help but feel that way.　</p>



<p>No. it&#8217;s probably just her imagination, but it&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility.</p>







<p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s not fair that only mine was seen, right?&#8221;</p>







<p>As she said this to herself, Arisa stood up.</p>



<p>She went to the changing room and&#8230; gently opened the door.</p>



<p>Yuzuru seemed to be taking a shower in the bathroom.</p>



<p>At least he doesn&#8217;t seem to notice her.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>In the changing room, she found Yuzuru&#8217;s gym clothes strewn all over the place.</p>



<p>There was also a piece of underpants on the floor.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s not my fault. It&#8217;s Yuzuru-san&#8217;s fault for leaving them here like this.&#8221;</p>







<p>In the first place, it was Yuzuru who saw Arisa&#8217;s gym clothes that were taken off.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8230; It was Arisa&#8217;s fault for taking them off in the first place, but in Arisa&#8217;s mind, Yuzuru had become the definite villain.</p>



<p>Yes, it was Yuzuru who did the wrong thing first.</p>



<p>So, Arisa should have the right to get back at Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san is&#8230; probably a smell fetishist, right? Sometimes he tries to smell me, doesn&#8217;t he? He really is a&#8230; pervert, isn&#8217;t he? I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s my fiancé&#8230; I really don&#8217;t know what I like about him&#8230; But even if he&#8217;s such a pervert, he&#8217;s my fiancé.&#8221;</p>







<p>She needs to understand him.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Yes, this is an action to do the same thing as Yuzuru, to understand how Yuzuru feels.</p>



<p>&#8230; Apart from the fact that it was not an observed fact (for Arisa) that Yuzuru smelled Arisa&#8217;s gym uniform. Such details were not important.</p>



<p>The important thing is that Arisa has &#8230;a good reason to do it.</p>







<p>She picked up Yuzuru&#8217;s gym uniform with her fingertips as if she were handling something dirty &#8211; yes, this is dirty to her, and it&#8217;s not that she likes doing it. She had no other choice, yes no other choice, but to touch it &#8211; she picked up Yuzuru&#8217;s gym uniform.</p>



<p>It was moist and wet with sweat.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa gulped.</p>



<p>Could it be that she was doing something terrible right now?</p>



<p>As a person, as a girl, she was going beyond the realm of what she should not be stepping into.</p>



<p>Such concerns flashed through her mind&#8230;</p>







<p>Ignoring all of this, Arisa put Yuzuru&#8217;s gym clothes near the tip of her nose.</p>



<p>Then she took a deep breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha~a&#8230; what am I doing&#8230;?&#8221;</p>





<p>Later.</p>



<p>Arisa sat slumped on the couch, self-loathing.</p>
