<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; New Year’s Eve of the Takasegawa Family</h3>

<p>New Year&#8217;s Eve.<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru was sipping New Year&#8217;s Eve soba with his family.</p>



<p>By the way, the soba noodles are not the ones that Yuzuru&#8217;s mother cooked&#8230;</p>



<p>It was a delivery order from a neighborhood soba noodle shop that he frequented.</p>



<p>It was a familiar taste, which made him feel at ease.</p>



<p>But&#8230;<br></p>



<p>(<em>I&#8217;ve never eaten Arisa&#8217;s handmade soba noodles, come to think of it</em>.)<br></p>



<p>Despite how good Arisa&#8217;s cooking is, soba noodles are probably store-bought for her as well.</p>



<p>She might be able to make soba noodles by hand, but it would be difficult to beat the store-bought ones.<br></p>



<p>However, when it comes to soba soup, Arisa must be able to make the soup stock from scratch.</p>



<p>If she can make such a delicious miso soup, her soba soup must also be delicious.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Niisan, are you thinking that you want to eat Soba noodles made by Arisa-san?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>It was Yuzuru&#8217;s younger sister, Ayumi Takasegawa, who asked with a grin.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never eaten Arisa&#8217;s soba.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that you want to try it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I&#8217;d like to try it, that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;<br></p>



<p><em>How could it not be delicious?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru thought to himself that he would ask for it next time.</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;What? &#8230; Is this Amagi girl&#8217;s cooking that good?&#8221;</p>



<p><br>The person who asked Yuzuru this was an old man with blue eyes and a deeply chiseled face.<br></p>



<p>He had sharp eyes and a hooked nose.</p>



<p>Sogen Takasegawa.</p>



<p>He was the grandfather of Yuzuru, the previous head of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>His father is a Scandinavian-American, so his facial features are quite different from Japanese.</p>



<p>&#8230;Although he was born and raised in Japan<br></p>



<p>At present, most of the business matters are left to his son, Yuzuru&#8217;s father, and he is technically retired.</p>



<p>What &#8221; technically &#8221; means is that he is actually in charge of the &#8220;diplomacy&#8221; of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>Using the connections he has cultivated, he is involved in a variety of activities at home and abroad&#8230; It may seem a bit too cool to say it like that, though.</p>



<p>In fact, it was more like half a vacation.<br></p>



<p>However, as you can see from the fact that he brought Arisa as Yuzuru&#8217;s fiancée, he is not playing around.</p>



<p>Of course, he wanted his great-grandchildren, but he also thought it would be beneficial to the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>&#8230;. At least that&#8217;s what Yuzuru wanted to believe.<br></p>



<p>“I&#8217;d love to try the food made by her, by all means&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe Yuzuru said that much.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>This is Yuzuru&#8217;s grandmother, Chiwako Takasegawa.</p>



<p>She is a Japanese woman with a calm atmosphere and appearance compared to Sogen, who at first glance looks scary.</p>



<p>&#8230; Most importantly, she is scarier than Sogen when she is angry.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa-san&#8217;s cooking is really good, Mother-in-law!　I can&#8217;t wait for her to marry into the family. Oh, but will it be the two of you living together at first?　Hey, Yuzuru. What are you planning to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>The one who asked Yuzuru in high tension was Sayori Takasegawa, Yuzuru&#8217;s mother.</p>



<p>She may not look like it, but she is a researcher of American literature.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Sayori. Surely Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t think about the future like that yet, and he wouldn&#8217;t want to be asked&#8230; Besides, it hasn&#8217;t been officially decided yet.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya Takasegawa, Yuzuru&#8217;s father, narrowed his eyes.</p>



<p>He is the current head of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>Basically, the policy seems to be to leave it up to Yuzuru when it comes to the final decision on whether or not to get married.</p>



<p>&#8230;It&#8217;s not a surprise, since it&#8217;s Yuzuru&#8217;s life.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;So, how&#8217;s everything going so far Yuzuru?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I meant. I was just wondering if you have any intention of getting married&#8230; Of course, you can answer that you have not thought about it yet as well.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya said this as he stared at Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Somehow, Yuzuru felt as if all his feelings and plans were being seen through.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s see&#8221;<br></p>



<p>If it was the Yuzuru of a while ago, he would have either lied or tried to cover it up with a vague answer.</p>



<p>But right now, he was not in the mood for that.</p>



<p>When it came to his own feelings for Arisa, he didn&#8217;t want to lie.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I know I want to spend my life with her.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru said clearly.</p>



<p>He felt his ears heat up a little.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s strong words were a little unexpected for Kazuya, and his eyes widened in surprise.</p>



<p>However, he quickly returned to his calm expression poker face.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Then&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya was about to say something.</p>



<p>Perhaps he was trying to say something like, ‘If you&#8217;re so keen on it, we might as well proceed a little more positively’.</p>



<p>But his words were cut short by Yuzuru&#8217;s words.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s also important to know what Arisa&#8217;s will is&#8221;<br></p>



<p>It goes without saying.</p>



<p>Yuzuru added at the end.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to force Arisa to get married&#8230;even if it&#8217;s indirectly&#8230; This is about my romance. I will settle it all with my own hands. There is no need for any unnecessary meddling.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Clearly, Yuzuru conveyed his own thoughts to his father and grandfather.</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, he told them not to do anything that would put pressure on the Amagi family.</p>



<p>It was as if he had nailed it down.</p>



<p>Neither Yuzuru&#8217;s grandfather nor his father is evil, so basically they would never do such a thing&#8230; is something that&#8217;s hard to say.<br></p>



<p>After all, they are working for the benefit of the Takasegawa family and the companies under their umbrella, and in some cases, they may use any means at their disposal.</p>



<p>If there is a good reason, such as to support the love of his son, even more so.</p>



<p>In the past, the Takasegawas were known as the &#8220;political Takasegawa&#8221; in contrast to the &#8220;economic Tachibana,&#8221; and the Takasegawas are a family with a strong tendency to make such political moves &#8211; in other words, to put pressure and lay the groundwork.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why it was necessary to inform them about it properly.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ho~&#8230;&#8230;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya and Sogen raised their eyebrows at the unexpected defiance of their son and grandson.</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t seem to be in&#8230; a bad mood.</p>



<p>If anything, it was more of a curiosity and admiration.<br></p>



<p>From the looks of the two of them, Yuzuru judged that they would probably not try to force the marriage to proceed.</p>



<p>&#8230;They should not think of creating a conflict between the next head of the family, the current head of the family, and the previous head of the family for the sake of Arisa alone.<br></p>



<p>It is also true that the atmosphere has become slightly worse.</p>



<p>As if sensing this&#8230;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Niisan!　You&#8217;re really into her!　I&#8217;m a little jealous.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m losing my son. I&#8217;m so lonely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru has become a grown man huh&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Ayumi teased him, while Sayori made fun of him, and Chiwako said sincerely to him.</p>



<p>With the intercession of the three of them, the atmosphere that had momentarily turned sour cleared.<br></p>



<p>After that, the Takasegawa family spent New Year&#8217;s Eve happily.</p>
