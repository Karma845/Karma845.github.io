<h3>Chapter 19 – Massage (Whole Body Course * Excluding Some Area) Yuzuru-kun’s Turn</h3>

<p>&#8220;Did I make you wait,　Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no&#8230; it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>





<p>Arisa, who was sitting on the sofa, greeted Yuzuru as he got out of the bath.</p>



<p>For some reason, she was fidgety and would not make eye contact with Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Perhaps because she had just taken a bath, or perhaps for some other reason, &#8230;Arisa&#8217;s skin seemed to be rosy and flushed.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is there anything wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, nothing.&#8221;</p>







<p>In response to Arisa&#8217;s question, Yuzuru replied with some hesitation.</p>







<p>It was because to Yuzuru&#8217;s eyes, Arisa&#8217;s figure looked very seductive.</p>



<p>The area of skin exposure was very large.</p>



<p>Of course, she wasn&#8217;t wearing a bikini but just a short-sleeved white shirt and shorts, so it was healthy &#8220;loungewear&#8221;&#8230;</p>



<p>However, the fact that she had been wearing winter clothes recently, which tend to hide her skin and body lines, made the stimulation feel relatively strong.</p>



<p>She was wearing a jersey up top and down during the marathon, except when she was running, although it was about as revealing as a gym uniform.</p>



<p>He observed Arisa&#8217;s breasts swaying slightly while she was running, but he did not get a good look at her body.</p>



<p>In addition, the clothes that Arisa is wearing are thinner than&#8230; gym clothes.</p>



<p>The gym clothes are made of solid fabric, but the top and bottom clothes that Arisa is wearing are probably for loungewear or sleeping, and are very &#8220;rough&#8221;.</p>



<p>As a result, the fabric was thin and the unevenness of Arisa&#8217;s body was clearly visible.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the white camisole she was wearing underneath was also showing through.</p>



<p>The shorts she was wearing were black, so her underwear was not visible, but this made Arisa&#8217;s white skin seem dazzling.</p>



<p>Above all, the rough and domestic appearance, which is different from the usual very fashionable clothes&#8230; that can be said to be &#8220;defenseless&#8221;, stimulated Yuzuru&#8217;s desire</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;is that what you&#8217;re aiming for?</em>)</p>







<p>If someone comes into a man&#8217;s room and says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a massage!&#8221; and dresses like this, one would normally think that they are trying to get him to do it, or that they are inviting him to do it.</p>



<p>But at the same time, Arisa is a bit of an airhead, so the possibility that she&#8217;s just being sincere can&#8217;t be denied.</p>







<p>&#8220;Um, Yuzuru-san?　If you keep looking at me like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-ah&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, he had been staring at Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa squirmed in embarrassment.</p>



<p>Yuzuru apologized lightly and looked away.</p>







<p>(<em>If she&#8217;s inviting me, I don&#8217;t think she would be showing this kind of shyness&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>Now, that was not the kind of embarrassment that seduces a man, but rather the kind of embarrassment that makes a man feel guilty, such a pitiful kind of embarrassment.</p>



<p>The image was of glasswork that might break if touched.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that she is very pretty, but it is the kind of feeling that makes you hesitate to actually attack her.　</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;I wonder if it&#8217;s like, she was trying to look good, but when she saw me, she suddenly became embarrassed and regretted it?</em>)</p>







<p>Somehow, he felt that this was the right answer.</p>



<p>It was a truth that was typical of Arisa, who was smart but had a slightly stupid streak.</p>



<p>Well, if Arisa is a stupid virgin, then Yuzuru is also a stupid virgin, so there was no real way to tell.</p>







<p>&#8220;How should we go about the massage?&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said as if to cover up the awkwardness in the air.</p>



<p>Then Arisa put her clenched fist in front of her.</p>







<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play rock-paper-scissors. The winner gets it first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>







<p>The result of the rock-paper-scissors game was that Arisa won.</p>







<p>&#8220;Then, if you&#8217;ll excuse me&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>After saying that, Arisa laid down on Yuzuru&#8217;s bed, face down.</p>



<p>In front of Yuzuru&#8217;s eyes, he could see Arisa&#8217;s slender back through her thin shirt.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;It&#8217;s a situation I don&#8217;t really understand even when I think about it calmly.</em>)</p>







<p>However, it&#8217;s too late to say that Yuzuru and Arisa&#8217;s relationship is not very clear.　</p>



<p>Objectively speaking, they are probably lovers.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re supposed to be engaged to each other.</p>



<p>And they probably have feelings for each other.</p>



<p>But they haven&#8217;t told each other their feelings.</p>




<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll start&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said, and then touched Arisa&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>He only touched it slightly, but he could tell that it was very stiff.</p>



<p>After all, if one runs for a long time with weights attached to the chest, the muscles in the shoulders will probably be stretched to a certain extent.</p>







<p>“Anh~&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>When he applied a little more pressure with his thumb, Arisa let out a small whimper.</p>



<p>It seemed to be more of a reflex than a sign of pain.</p>







<p>&#8220;Is that enough pressure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; More pressure, please&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>After being told that, Yuzuru decided to massage Arisa&#8217;s shoulders and back while putting his weight on her.</p>



<p>He applied quite a bit of pressure, but it seemed to be just right for the stiff muscles.</p>







<p>&#8220;Nn&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>







<p>As usual, is she aiming for it or is this just natural?</p>



<p>Arisa made a charming sound every time he massaged her.</p>







<p>( <em>It doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230; I wonder how Arisa&#8217;s breasts are doing now&#8230; They are probably crushed. Doesn&#8217;t that hurt?</em>)</p>







<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s rationality was on the verge of dissolving to the point of thinking about such an unimportant thing.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, he held his ground.</p>



<p>If the stronghold of reason were to fall here and now, all of his plans would be ruined.</p>







<p>&#8220;How is it, Arisa.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; It feels good&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>She replied in a melodious voice.</p>



<p>She really seems to feel good.</p>



<p>&#8230;Probably, the sounds she was making were natural.</p>







<p>(<em>I hope you don&#8217;t mix the calculative part with the natural part&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>But perhaps it&#8217;s the weakness of love that makes such a part of a person endearing.</p>



<p>He took Arisa&#8217;s right arm while smiling in his mind.</p>



<p>He massaged the right side of her back with his palm while stretching her arm.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;(<strong>TN: </strong><em>It’s lost in translation, but actually what Arisa said here is “ahh, sore, suki desu..” which can also mean I like you.</em>)</p>







<p>For a moment, Yuzuru&#8217;s heart skipped a beat.</p>







<p>&nbsp;“&#8230; I&#8217;m glad you liked it.&#8221;</p>







<p>Don&#8217;t tell me you like it so casually. (<strong>TN: </strong><em>Again, Yuzuru here refers to the “suki desu” part of her dialogue</em>)</p>



<p>And with that in mind, he took the other arm and massaged the other side of her back as well.</p>







<p>“It&#8217;s pretty stiff here too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm.~&#8230; Is that so?&#8221;</p>







<p>Little by little, the point where Yuzuru was massaging went down.</p>



<p>As Yuzuru applied pressure to Arisa&#8217;s lower back&#8230; he lowered his gaze slightly.</p>



<p>There was&#8230; Arisa&#8217;s buttocks, which were large for her age.</p>



<p>The shape was clearly visible, perhaps because she was wearing thin shorts.</p>



<p>He may or may not be able to see through her shorts if he looked hard enough.&#8217;</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230; Buttocks are better than one might think, isn&#8217;t it?</em>)</p>







<p>Maybe he likes buttocks better than breasts.</p>



<p>Though Yuzuru was thinking about it.., he felt that touching the buttocks would indeed cross the line, so he decided not to.</p>



<p>Therefore, the next step was the legs.</p>







<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go for the legs.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said as he looked at Arisa&#8217;s long white beautiful legs.</p>



<p>They were translucent white and looked soft.</p>







<p>“Yes&#8230; Ah!&#8221;</p>







<p>As soon as he touched the base of Arisa&#8217;s thigh, her body trembled in surprise.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Did it hurt?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it was just a little tickle. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>







<p>It seems to be okay, so Yuzuru decides to continue the massage.</p>



<p>But it was obvious by touching it that&#8230;</p>



<p>Underneath the soft-looking fat, there was a solid muscle.</p>



<p>A thin layer of soft fat on top of a base of muscle.</p>



<p>This must be the secret of Arisa&#8217;s beautiful legs. Yuzuru understood an unimportant thing.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s legs were so beautiful and shiny that if he didn&#8217;t think about such unimportant things, he would have lost all reason.</p>







<p>(<em>I thought her buttocks were nice, but her legs are nice too&#8230; it is difficult to say which of the two is better</em>)</p>







<p><em>I can&#8217;t pick just one out of breasts, buttocks, and legs!</em></p>



<p>Thinking about such things as a cheating man, Yuzuru touched Arisa&#8217;s calf.</p>



<p>He felt that they were a little swollen, probably due to fatigue.</p>







<p>“Ha&#8230; That part is okay to skip&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can do that for me as well later, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Said Arisa drowsily.</p>



<p>However, if she fell asleep now, Yuzuru would not be able to receive a massage from Arisa.</p>



<p>This was a bit of a problem, so Yuzuru decided to move on to massaging Arisa&#8217;s feet.</p>



<p>He pushed on the sole of her foot with his bent forefinger joint.</p>







<p>Then&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;HIGU!!!&#8221;</p>







<p>A cute scream went up.</p>



<p>It seemed to have hurt her a little.</p>







<p>“Are you okay, Arisa.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, I&#8217;m fine&#8230;kku&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s body trembled with each press of her foot.</p>



<p>She clutched the sheet with both hands.</p>



<p>Seeing her like that made him feel a little sorry for her.</p>







<p>&#8220;If it hurts, I&#8217;ll stop&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m okay with this much. Please continue&#8230; Hi~gyi~&#8221;</p>



<p></p>







<p>A scream escaped from Arisa&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>However, since she says it&#8217;s okay, then it must be okay.</p>



<p>Yuzuru trusted Arisa&#8217;s words and started to massage Arisa&#8217;s feet harder.</p>



<p>It was interesting to see how Arisa&#8217;s body trembled with each finger pressure&#8230; a little bit.</p>



<p>It tickled his sadistic tendencies a little bit, just a little bit.</p>







<p>&#8220;Hau~&#8230; Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;you better remember this later, okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa glared at Yuzuru with fierce eyes.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was inwardly smitten with the fact that she looked so cute when she was a little angry.</p>
