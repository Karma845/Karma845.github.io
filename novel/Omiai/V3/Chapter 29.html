<h3>Chapter 29 – White Day</h3>

<p>On white day.</p>




<p>After school, Yuzuru and Arisa decided to go home and get ready before meeting up.</p>



<p>Yuzuru arrived at the rendezvous ahead of her, and nervously checked his watch over and over again.</p>







<p>(<em>I&#8217;ve been working on it for today. Unless I do something really stupid, the results shouldn&#8217;t be that bad</em>.)</p>







<p>As he waited, thinking this over and over again&#8230;</p>



<p>His cell phone rang.</p>



<p>As he checked the text, it read, [&#8220;Behind you&#8221;].</p>







<p>When Yuzuru turned around&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san, please take care of me today.&#8221;</p>







<p>There was a very beautiful girl standing there.</p>



<p>Her slightly make-up-covered skin was a beautiful milky white, and her lips were very glossy.</p>



<p>Her amber hair was braided into a mature chignon.</p>



<p>Her blue dress had lacy sleeves that allowed a little bit of her white skin to show through.</p>



<p>The pearl necklace on her chest accentuated her beauty.</p>







<p>She&#8230; Arisa spoke to Yuzuru with her jade-green eyes downcast in embarrassment.</p>







<p>&#8220;U-um&#8230; Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ah, I&#8217;m sorry. You look so beautiful, I was just admiring you.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa was truly beautiful.</p>



<p>The proof is in the fact that the eyes of those around her were all focused on her.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt proud that this girl was his girlfriend.</p>







<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. I don&#8217;t get to wear this kind of clothing very often, so&#8230; That&#8217;s good to hear.&#8221;</p>







<p>She smiled at him.</p>



<p>Then she looked up at Yuzuru with a faintly blushing face.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san also looks great&#8230; It&#8217;s a kind of fresh look, with the necktie&#8221;&nbsp;</p>







<p>The restaurant they were going to was not very formal, and it was enough to wear &#8220;plain clothes&#8221;, so a tie was not mandatory.</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru wore a tie to get into the spirit.</p>



<p>This is the first time Arisa has seen Yuzuru in a necktie since the uniform for boys at his high school is a gakuran. (<strong>TN: </strong><em>It’s a type of uniform with a black coat-like top part.</em>)</p>







<p>&#8220;I think&#8230; It&#8217;s very mature and cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Thank you.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru felt a little embarrassed.</p>



<p>However, today was a very important day for Yuzuru.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t stay in this mood for too long.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s go. Arisa.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said and held out his hand.</p>



<p>She gave a small nod and gently placed her hand on Yuzuru&#8217;s hand.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes.”</p>




<p>The restaurant that Yuzuru had made a reservation at was a French restaurant in a reasonably famous hotel.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa sat down in the private room they were shown.</p>







<p>&#8220;Wow&#8230; It&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa exclaimed in admiration at the night view she could see through the window glass.</p>



<p>The neon lights glittered like jewels in the dark night.</p>



<p>Yuzuru patted his chest, relieved that she liked it.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Um, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>







<p>But the relief was short-lived.</p>



<p>He noticed that there was a hint of anxiety on Arisa&#8217;s face.</p>







<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this place&#8230; you know, maybe a little bit expensive?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230; it&#8217;s not that expensive.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru shook his head in response to Arisa&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>At least by &#8220;Takasegawa&#8221; standards, this restaurant was one of the cheapest.</p>



<p>However&#8230;, in terms of Yuzuru&#8217;s part-time job savings, it was an expensive one.</p>







<p>&#8220;Consider it my White Day present to you&#8230; You&#8217;ve always taken care of me, making my lunch and all that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; I understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>She probably thought it would be rude to be too reserved or too worried about Yuzuru&#8217;s wallet.</p>



<p>Arisa gave a small nod.</p>



<p>As they were having this conversation, a male waiter requested a drink order.</p>







<p>&#8220;What do you want, Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure about the options&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru thought for a moment before answering.</p>



<p>Mineral water would have been fine, but he wanted Arisa to have something tasty to drink.</p>







<p>&#8220;A cocktail that goes well with the food&#8230; Oh, a non-alcoholic one, please.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru, who was about to order an alcoholic drink as a result of habit, added that to cover up his mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was not a restaurant that is frequented by the Takasegawa family, nor was it a formal restaurant, so there was no way that Yuzuru, who was underage, would be served alcohol.</p>







<p>&#8220;Do they serve non-alcoholic cocktails?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Well, yeah&#8230; To put it bluntly, it&#8217;s juice.&#8221;</p>







<p>But to be honest, Yuzuru did not know much about it.</p>



<p>Compared to Arisa, he may be more familiar with this kind of place, but he was still a sixteen-year-old with limited life experience.</p>



<p>Besides&#8230; The best stuff comes out when you leave it to the experts.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the dishes were brought out.</p>



<p>First was the amuse-bouche, or appetizer.</p>







<p>&#8220;Then, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>The two of them raised their glasses of cocktails and lightly toasted each other.　</p>



<p>They then gazed at the view and tasted the food.</p>



<p>The quality of every dish was high, as one would expect from a high-class restaurant, if not the best.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8230;very delicious.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa narrowed her eyes as she said that.</p>



<p>Her mouth loosened, the corners of her eyes drooped, and her expression broke out&#8230; It was really cute.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been here before, but yeah, it&#8217;s good. It lives up to its reputation. Or maybe&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m with you that it tastes so good.&#8221; (<strong>TN:<em> </em></strong><em>Wow&#8230; Such a corny line</em>)</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said that, Arisa smiled happily and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re very good at this.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Yuzuru didn&#8217;t mean it as flattery.</p>





<p>Then Yuzuru and Arisa continued to eat while chatting and laughing&#8230;</p>



<p>Finally, They had dessert and a cup of coffee after dinner.</p>







<p>&#8220;But seriously&#8230; The professional&#8217;s work is amazing.&#8221;</p>







<p>While drinking coffee, Arisa said sincerely.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s cooking is more delicious if you are talking about a family restaurant or a cafe, but it is not as good as a high-class French restaurant.</p>







<p>“That&#8217;s true. But&#8230; I still like your cooking better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Again, you flatter me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s true&#8230; If I ate this kind of food every day, I&#8217;d get sick of it.&#8221;</p>







<p>Expensive food is delicious because you eat it once in a while.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not something you should eat every day.</p>



<p>Home cooking has its own merits.</p>







<p>“Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s true too.&#8221;</p>







<p>And Arisa smiled.</p>







<p>&#8220;Then &#8230;I will keep doing my best from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah, I&#8217;ll be counting on you&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Then Yuzuru took a big, deep breath.</p>



<p>He straightened his back and looked straight at her.</p>







<p>Arisa tilted her head curiously at Yuzuru, who suddenly had a new expression on his face.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Arisa. I&#8217;d like to talk to you about the future. Is that okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said this, Arisa&#8217;s expression became tense.</p>



<p>Then she straightened her back in a panic.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ye-yes&#8230; what is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You and I are&#8230; you know, &#8216;engaged&#8217;, right? &#8230;A false one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Th-that&#8217;s right. Yes&#8230; I&#8217;m indebted to Yuzuru-san for your help.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa nodded her head in agreement.</p>



<p>The nervousness could be seen in her expression.</p>







<p><em>&#8230;It would be a terrible thing to mischievously unsettle her by talking too roundaboutly.</em></p>







<p>Yuzuru made up his mind and stood up.</p>



<p>He moved away from his seat and walked up to Arisa&#8217;s side.</p>







<p>&#8220;U-um&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa. I want to cancel this false &#8216;engagement&#8217; with you that I’ve continued until now&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s eyes widened at Yuzuru&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>Then Yuzuru got down on one knee and pulled out a small box from his pocket.</p>



<p>He gently opened the red box, directing it at Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then&#8230; I want to be formally engaged with you again.”</p>




<p>Yuzuru said to Arisa, who was frozen in place with her beautiful jewel-like eyes wide open.</p>
