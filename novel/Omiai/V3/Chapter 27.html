<h3>Chapter 27 – Something Trivial</h3>

	
<p>(<em>Scary&#8230;scary&#8230;</em>)</p>






<p>Yuzuru ran into the bathroom, feeling slightly terrified of Arisa.</p>



<p>He felt as if he were a husband who had been caught cheating on his wife.</p>



<p>Of course, it wasn&#8217;t cheating or anything, it was just force majeure, to begin with.</p>



<p>He pulled out the package from his bag.</p>



<p>After carefully unwrapping the box, he checked the contents.</p>







<p>(<em>As I thought, it&#8217;s handmade chocolate&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>It was heart-shaped handmade chocolate that screamed &#8220;exactly&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then he checked inside the box&#8230; to see if there were any letters or messages.</p>



<p>“No sender, as I thought&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>After confirming that there was nothing that could identify the sender, Yuzuru looked at his phone.</p>



<p>There were already a couple of messages.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Did you open it?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;What was in it?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Did you find out who it was from?&#8221;]</p>







<p>No, there was another message at the same time he was checking the messages, so technically there were three messages.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; What are you going to do when you find out who gave it to me?&#8221;</p>







<p>It&#8217;s not like Arisa was going to do anything with that girl.</p>



<p>&#8230;Or so he wanted to believe, but he couldn&#8217;t be sure, seeing as how she was reacting to &#8220;someone&#8217;s genuine chocolate,&#8221; that it would never happen.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;well, that&#8217;s cute in its own way..</em>)</p>







<p>The strong jealousy was proof that Arisa liked Yuzuru that much.</p>



<p>And Yuzuru knows exactly how Arisa feels.</p>



<p>If Arisa received a love letter from someone, he would be concerned about it as well.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t figure out who it was from.&#8221;]</p>







<p>To reassure her, Yuzuru sent a text message.</p>



<p>The reply came soon after.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Can you show me a picture?&#8221;]</p>







<p>In other words, Princess Arisa seemed to be asking for a picture of the contents.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru had nothing to be ashamed of, nor was there anything in the package that would cause him any trouble &#8211; besides, what kind of gift would cause trouble if it were seen in the first place? &#8211;&nbsp; So he took a picture and obediently sent it to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a while, he received a reply.</p>







<p>[&#8220;It&#8217;s handmade huh.&#8221;]</p>







<p>He waited for a while and soon received a new email.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I think it&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;I think you should not eat something if you don&#8217;t know who made it.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Hygiene is also not certain.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Looking at the text alone, it sounded like she was concerned about Yuzuru, but&#8230;</p>



<p>It was obvious that she was telling him not to eat out of jealousy and possessiveness.</p>







<p>(<em>Arisa has such a side to her as well huh&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>No, this is probably the true nature of Arisa.</p>



<p>By nature, she is a selfish girl with a strong sense of jealousy and possessiveness.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that she usually suppresses it and doesn&#8217;t show it.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I know, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Yuzuru replied to Arisa.</p>



<p>If&#8230; the chocolate he received was a commercial product, he would have eaten it, because food is not to be wasted.</p>



<p>Also, if the sender was known and trustworthy, then he would have eaten it even if it was homemade. If it contained a letter expressing their feelings for Yuzuru, then he would have met the girl in person and turned her down.</p>







<p>Even if Arisa had told him not to, he would have done so.</p>



<p>He would have eaten what was given to him, and he would have responded properly.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the least he can do to be polite to others.</p>







<p>But when it comes to handmade chocolates from an unknown sender, it&#8217;s a different case.</p>



<p>As Arisa said, the hygienic aspect of the chocolates was uncertain.</p>



<p>There was also the problem of not knowing what was in it.</p>



<p>In fact, Yuzuru&#8217;s parents had strictly instructed him not to eat anything that he didn&#8217;t know who made it.</p>







<p>The Takasegawa family had a lot of power, both good and bad, and they were resented everywhere.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just resentment, there are probably some people who would genuinely benefit from the downfall of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>Also, if Yuzuru dies, the seat of the next successor of the Takasegawa family will be vacant.</p>



<p>It is not like there is absolutely no one who wants that seat.</p>



<p>&#8230;well, of course, it&#8217;s not like there are always people trying to kill him, and there are no particular problems in his daily life.</p>



<p>In the first place, it&#8217;s hard to believe that they would commit such a sloppy crime that a little research would reveal.</p>



<p>Even so, there was nothing wrong with being cautious.</p>



<p>There is a lot of danger in food from an unknown sender.</p>







<p>That&#8217;s why Yuzuru can&#8217;t eat these chocolates, although he was very sorry to the girl who made them, irrespective of whether Arisa wants him to or not.</p>







<p>[&#8220;My parents told me not to eat anything if I don&#8217;t know who made it.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Is that so? I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Arisa seemed to be relieved by Yuzuru&#8217;s reply.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also sighed in relief.</p>



<p>&#8230; and as he was relieved, he also felt a little bit angry.</p>







<p>Even though he had done nothing wrong, why is it that he has to feel as if he is being blamed?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s cute that Arisa is jealous, but there are limits.</p>







<p>[&#8220;But still, hand-delivered presents are the best, right..&#8221;]</p>







<p>Feeling like fighting back a little, Yuzuru sent such a text.</p>



<p>Of course, the intention was to hurry the Valentine&#8217;s Day chocolate from Arisa.</p>







<p>But&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; huh?&#8221;</p>







<p>He waited for five minutes, but no reply came back.</p>



<p>It was an unexpected read and ignored situation.&nbsp;</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;Did I make her angry?</em>)</p>







<p>Yuzuru was driven to anxiety.</p>



<p>Later, Yuzuru spent his lunch break feeling gloomy.</p>



<p>After that, no matter how long he waited, he didn&#8217;t receive any chocolates or even a reply&#8230; and it was time for the homeroom at the end of the day.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;I never thought that the day would end without getting chocolates</em>)</p>







<p>He was expecting to get chocolates from Arisa, so he was genuinely shocked that he didn&#8217;t get any.</p>



<p>In addition, not getting chocolates on Valentine&#8217;s Day means not being able to give back naturally on White Day&#8230;</p>



<p>It meant that the &#8220;plan&#8221; needed to be reworked.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;well, that&#8217;s unavoidable.&#8221;</p>







<p>After the homeroom was over, Yuzuru stood up and muttered to himself.</p>



<p>There was no point in being depressed forever.</p>



<p>Besides, even if he didn&#8217;t get it at school, there was a possibility that he would get it later.</p>



<p>It was too early to give up.</p>



<p>At least, he was sure that Arisa had prepared chocolates for him.</p>







<p>As a last resort, Yuzuru could directly ask for chocolates from Arisa.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Yuzuru picked up his bag to leave the classroom.</p>




<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san!!!&#8221;</p>




<p>A clear and beautiful voice stopped him.</p>



<p>When he turned around, Yuzuru&#8217;s beloved, Arisa Yukishiro, was there.</p>



<p>Arisa was holding something to her chest and had her head lowered.</p>







<p>“&#8230;Arisa?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru called out to her, Arisa slowly looked up.</p>



<p>Her face had turned bright red.</p>







<p>&#8220;This is for you&#8230; It&#8217;s something trivial, but please take it!&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said this in a high-pitched voice and held out the thing she was holding to her chest&#8230;</p>



<p>She handed the cutely wrapped parcel to Yuzuru as if forcing it on him.</p>







<p>&#8220;T-then&#8230; Bye!&#8221;</p>







<p>Before Yuzuru could thank her, Arisa ran away.</p>



<p>The back of her figure became farther and farther away&#8230; and in no time at all, it was out of sight.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;She got me.&#8221;</p>







<p>Having attracted the attention of his classmates, Yuzuru&#8217;s face remained bright red. He scratched his cheek to cover it up.</p>
