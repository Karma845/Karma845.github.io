<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; History of Takasegawa</h3>

<p><br>Yuzuru and Arisa were walking together, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder.</p>



<p>There was no conversation between the two.</p>



<p>For some reason, Arisa was embarrassed by Yuzuru&#8217;s proximity to her and turned her face down as she walked, while Yuzuru actively closed the distance to Arisa and walked straight ahead, pretending not to notice Arisa&#8217;s manner.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, um, &#8230;&#8230; Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, where are we headed?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Unable to stand the silence, Arisa asked Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru didn&#8217;t take Arisa out without a reason.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a shrine nearby. I&#8217;ve already paid my first visit with my family&#8230; but would you like to go with me to pay your respects?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yes. I think that would be great. I hadn&#8217;t yet paid a visit.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa gave a small nod.</p>



<p>Then suddenly, perhaps curious&#8230; Arisa asked Yuzuru.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I heard that &#8230;&#8230;Yuzuru-san&#8217;s family is&nbsp; Christian.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hm? Yeah&#8230;well, they&#8217;re Protestants, at least.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay to go to the shrine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s kind of a joke.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Back in the Meiji era, the Takasegawa family accepted the Protestant faith.</p>



<p>However,.. it was not because they were impressed by Protestantism, but for very political reasons.</p>



<p>Therefore, the then head of the Takasegawa family, who agreed to convert, was not a very ardent believer in Protestantism, even though he was favorable to it.</p>



<p>Naturally, his descendant Yuzuru was no different.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; political reasons, is it?　Is it okay if I ask about it?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa seemed to be a little interested in the history of the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>For Yuzuru, it was a great pleasure to know that Arisa had a strong interest in his family.</p>



<p>Besides,&#8230; eventually, Arisa would become Yuzuru&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p>This has already been decided in Yuzuru&#8217;s mind.<br> </p>



<p>(<em>Now, how much should I tell her?&#8230;</em>)<br></p>



<p>If he wanted to talk about it, he would have to talk about the complicated political and economic situation at the time, and even the international situation surrounding Japan at the time. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>It is not something that Yuzuru would want Arisa to get bored with in the middle of.<br> </p>



<p>“The Takasegawa family &#8230;at the time was on the side of pushing for modernization and westernization. This is why they took the initiative and converted to Protestantism.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there any particular reason why you chose to become a Protestant?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Tachibana family at that time had already converted to Catholicism. The Tachibana family at that time was very pro-French. &#8230;&#8230; Well, in opposition to that, my family took a pro-German position and chose to become Protestant. &#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s how it happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>In short, the reason for this is a sense of rivalry with Tachibana.<br> </p>



<p>When Yuzuru said that&#8230;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Were the Takasegawa family and the Tachibana family not on good terms in the past?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>The way Yuzuru said it, in a manner that made it seem as if Tachibana and Takasegawa were at odds with each other, seemed to have stuck with Arisa a bit.</p>



<p>Arisa asked Yuzuru&#8230;with a slightly uneasy expression, but with a strong sense of curiosity.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Well, not just in the past, but &#8230; still is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Even now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Takasegawa family and the Tachibana family basically have an antagonistic relationship. Especially in domestic politics and diplomacy, they often take opposite positions.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>In domestic politics.</p>



<p>Even in diplomatic relations.</p>



<p>It is a kind of tradition that Takasegawa and Tachibana belong to opposite camps.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, are the two families actually at odds with each other?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way. We&#8217;re actually very close, so it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Um, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words&#8230; to explain it in simple terms, it&#8217;s like pro-wrestling.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Takasegawa and Tachibana always belong to the opposite camp.</p>



<p>This is an ostensible pose.</p>



<p>In the first place, this world is not so simple that it can be divided into two halves.</p>



<p>There are various interests involved.<br>  </p>



<p>&#8220;Pro-wrestling&#8230;.is it? Why would you do that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more profitable that way&#8230;I guess.　Well, it&#8217;s a grown-up thing.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>In fact, Yuzuru didn&#8217;t know much about it either.</p>



<p>Although he was their heir, Yuzuru&#8217;s father and grandfather were not so reticent as to give information to a mere high school student.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Was it okay for you to tell me about that grown-up situation?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Takasegawa and Tachibana are at odds with each other, but it&#8217;s really just an act of pretense. It&#8217;s an open secret, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>If the two families are at odds with each other, it is an act. And if it was a secret, Yuzuru and Ayaka would not be able to study together at the same school.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;.. That&#8217;s good to know. I was wondering if I learned something I shouldn&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much that I know that you shouldn&#8217;t know.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>When Yuzuru replied that, Arisa gave a small laugh.</p>



<p>Then, with a mischievous smile on her face, she asked Yuzuru.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;So there are things like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, a little bit.&#8221;<br></p>



<p> </p>



<p><em>‘I would like to convey my feelings to you at the right place and at the right time.’</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru inwardly muttered.<br></p>



<p>As they walked along, they came to a shrine.</p>



<p>They put in the five yen coin and bowed with two bows and two claps.<br><br></p>



<p>And on the way back.</p>



<p>Arisa asked Yuzuru.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Did you make any wish?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sort of.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru answered briefly and then told her what he wished for.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I wished that I could spend another year with Arisa.&#8221;<br><br></p>



<p>He did not pray that his confession would go well.</p>



<p>He did not pray &#8230; that he would be able to marry Arisa.</p>



<p>This was something that Yuzuru felt that he should make happen with his own hands.</p>



<p>He felt that it was he, not God, who would make Arisa happy.</p>



<p>Yuzuru had such an insignificant, possessive desire.</p>



<p> <br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; it is the same, huh&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Same &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>“I also prayed&#8230;. that I could be with Yuzuru-san again this year.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s cheeks were slightly flushed as she said this.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also felt his own ears getting hot.</p>



<p>The two regripped each other&#8217;s hands.<br></p>



<p>After that&#8230; they walked home in silence.<br></p>



<p>Strangely, the silence was comfortable.　</p>
