<h3>Chapter 22 – “Fiancée” and Dining Out</h3>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>





<p>Right next to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>The girl who had been sleeping quietly raised a small voice.</p>



<p>Looking at it, her jade green eyes were dimly open.</p>



<p>She looked as if she was still in a dreamy state of delirium.</p>







<p>&#8220;Are you awake, Arisa.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;es.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa rubbed her eyes sleepily and slowly raised her torso.</p>



<p>She stared at Yuzuru with a dazed gaze.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa, are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; Why is Yuzuru-san&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>She mumbled something like that in her sleep.</p>



<p>And the next moment.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yu-yuzuru-san!? Why?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa backed away in a panic.</p>



<p>She was confused and didn&#8217;t realize that she would fall off the bed if she moved back.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fu~e?　Hi~ya&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru hurriedly grabbed Arisa&#8217;s arm and pulled her body forcefully.</p>



<p>As a result, Arisa was able to avoid falling off the bed, but she had to leave her body in Yuzuru&#8217;s hands.</p>







<p>&#8220;Wh, why&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Calm down. This is my room. &#8230;You fell asleep in the middle of your massage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;eh?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Arisa heard Yuzuru&#8217;s words, she made a peculiar sound.</p>



<p>She then scampered around &#8230; and finally realized that this was not her own room.</p>



<p>Her face instantly turned beet red.</p>







<p>&#8220;This is&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>







<p>She shivered.</p>



<p>Seeing Arisa like that &#8230;Yuzuru was a little relieved.</p>







<p>(<em>Thank God &#8230;she was asleep after all.</em>)</p>







<p>After Arisa had fallen asleep,</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who was overtaken by evil, did various kinds of mischief to Arisa.</p>



<p>He was aware that he had done something rather akin to sexual harassment, something that could not be excused if he were to be caught in the act.</p>



<p>At that time, he had such a light-hearted feeling that Arisa would forgive him, but when he thought about it, it was an act that he could be hated for.</p>



<p>&#8230; He didn&#8217;t want Arisa to hate him.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; no wonder. You must have been tired.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said something plausible to cover it up.　</p>



<p>Then Arisa asked him,</p>







<p>“What time is it?”</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230; just before five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>







<p>To be exact, it was 4:45.</p>



<p>Just in time to start preparing dinner.</p>







<p>&#8220;Is it that late? I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; Shall I make you dinner?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, it would be nice to be able to have dinner with you.&#8221;</p>







<p>Today is a weekday.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a good idea to keep Arisa around for too long. &#8230;Above all, she should be tired from the marathon today.</p>







<p>&#8220;If it’s okay with you, why don&#8217;t we eat outside?&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru suggested.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how Yuzuru and Arisa went to a famous high-class French restaurant&#8230; Not. Instead, they went to a famous family restaurant chain in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>With Yuzuru needing a lot of money, and Arisa having a limited amount of spending money, their options were inevitably limited.</p>



<p>When they finished ordering food for both parties&#8230;</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked Arisa, who looked strangely fidgety from earlier.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Is there something you want to ask me?&#8221;</p>





<p><em>After all, could it be that she was awake at that time?</em></p>



<p>Such anxious thoughts passed through Yuzuru&#8217;s mind.</p>



<p>However, when Yuzuru asked, Arisa&#8217;s jade green eyes slightly turned away, and her white skin was dyed rose-color&#8230; and she asked reservedly.</p>







<p>&#8220;Etto, when I was asleep&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah?&#8221;</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>Thump, thump, thump.</em></p>



<p>Perhaps from nervousness and fear, Yuzuru&#8217;s heart thumped violently.</p>







<p><em>No way. Did she notice it?</em></p>







<p>&#8220;Y-you know&#8230; did you notice anything unusual when I was sleeping &#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>It was an odd question, to say the least.</p>



<p>Just what would happen differently while Arisa was asleep?　Normally, nothing would happen, or you would think so.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why one doesn&#8217;t ask such questions.</p>



<p>But since she was asking as such, she thought that something unusual had occured.</p>



<p>In other words&#8230;</p>



<p>It was equivalent to asking, &#8216;While I was asleep, did you do anything? &#8216;</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;Let&#8217;s calm down.</em>)</p>



<p></p>







<p>Arisa had been awake at that moment and had noticed his prank.</p>



<p>Such a possibility crossed Yuzuru&#8217;s mind.</p>







<p>But if she had been awake &#8230; would she have stayed still like that?</p>



<p>Assuming that she was awake at the time in the first place.</p>



<p>How long had she been asleep?</p>







<p>Surely, Arisa was not awake at that time.</p>



<p>She was definitely not pretending.</p>







<p>Just that&#8230; She is suspicious that Yuzuru might have played some kind of dubious prank on her while she was sleeping&#8230;</p>



<p>In that sense, she must have asked the question with such an implication.</p>



<p>No, that must be it.</p>







<p>Having made such a deduction, Yuzuru replied while maintaining as much composure as possible.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;no, I don&#8217;t think there was anything special about it.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Seriously, what are you worrying about?</em></p>



<p><em>Really, I don&#8217;t understand.</em></p>



<p>Pretending as such&#8230; Yuzuru asked her.</p>







<p>&#8220;Did something not feel right to you?&#8221;</p>







<p>After a moment of silence, Arisa replied,</p>







<p>&#8220;No, I was sleeping well &#8230;yeah, I was &#8230;sound asleep.&#8221;</p>







<p>There was something implied in the way she said it.</p>



<p>However, he felt that it would be dangerous &#8230;for both parties to go into details about it.</p>







<p>Now, as Yuzuru and Arisa were playing such a psychological game&#8230;</p>



<p>The waitress brought in the food.</p>



<p>Yuzuru had spaghetti soup, while Arisa had hamburger steak.</p>



<p>A delicious aroma filled the table.</p>







<p>“Shall we eat?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>







<p>The two of them picked up their forks and knives and brought their meals to their mouths.</p>



<p>This type of chain restaurant food is consistently delicious no matter where you eat.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru knows of better restaurants, and he also knows that Arisa&#8217;s homemade food is much better.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s that, and this is this.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that the food at the chain restaurants isn&#8217;t good, and it&#8217;s not that it is not good enough to eat.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hey, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You want a taste?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;fu fu&#8230; I mean, This had happened before as well. It&#8217;s not the same store, though.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said and cut the hamburger with a knife and fork.</p>



<p>And&#8230;</p>



<p>She stuck the fork she had been using earlier into the hamburger.</p>



<p>Slowly, she lifted it up, making a plate with her hands so that the sauce would not drip onto the table.</p>



<p>She blew gently on the hot hamburger and let it cool.</p>



<p>Then Arisa leaned forward.</p>







<p>&#8220;Here you go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Aah.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru naturally opened his mouth.</p>



<p>Arisa, on the other hand, placed the hamburger in Yuzuru&#8217;s mouth without hesitation.</p>



<p>Yuzuru slowly closed his mouth.</p>



<p>With a fork, the hamburger was trapped in Yuzuru&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>The juices and the thick demi-glace sauce stimulated Yuzuru&#8217;s taste buds.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru was so nervous that he couldn&#8217;t even taste the food.　</p>



<p>Arisa, on the other hand, slowly pulled the fork out of Yuzuru&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>The fork, stained with grease and saliva, was pulled from Yuzuru&#8217;s lips.</p>







<p>&#8220;How is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;it is delicious.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru managed to squeeze out a few words and asked Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;Do you &#8230;want a taste too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>She nodded with a sly grin.</p>



<p>Yuzuru used a spoon and a fork to twirl the pasta so that it was easy to eat.</p>



<p>When Yuzuru leaned forward, Arisa opened her glossy lips.</p>



<p>Her white teeth and pink tongue peeked out, and Yuzuru gently inserted the fork he had been using just a moment ago into her mouth.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt his body become intensely hot and his heart thumping wildly.</p>



<p>Arisa, on the other hand, closed her mouth without hesitation.</p>







<p>“Mmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa narrowed her eyes.</p>



<p>Yuzuru slowly pulled the fork from her beautiful lips.</p>



<p>After waiting for Arisa to finish chewing, Yuzuru asked,</p>







<p>“Do you like it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s very &#8230;delicious.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa smiled at him.</p>



<p>The smile looked very seductive and sensual in Yuzuru&#8217;s eyes.</p>




<p>Then Yuzuru and Arisa fed each other several times.</p>
