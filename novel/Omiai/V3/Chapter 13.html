<h3>Chapter 13 – Uenishi’s Father</h3>



<p>While Arisa repeatedly asked, Hijiri let out an exclamation of surprise.</p>



<p>Chiharu, on the other hand, seems to be in a good mood at Arisa&#8217;s reaction.</p>






<p>&#8220;By f, father&#8230; which father?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; My father. Our Uenishi will bear the child of the father and pass the blood to the daughter.&#8221;</p>






<p>And then Arisa noticed something strange and asked Chiharu.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Are you making fun of me?　It&#8217;s ridiculous, you know. Because&#8230; that would mean that Chiharu-san&#8217;s father is two thousand years old.&#8221;</p>







<p>Uenishi will give birth to a daughter of their father.　　</p>



<p>This means that Chiharu&#8217;s &#8220;father&#8221; will be her mother&#8217;s &#8220;father&#8221; and her grandmother&#8217;s &#8220;father&#8221; at the same time.`</p>



<p>There is only one father&#8230; and if the history of Uenishi is 2,000 years old as the legend says, then Chiharu&#8217;s &#8220;father&#8221; is over 2,000 years old.</p>







<p>&#8220;Though I&#8217;m making fun of you, I&#8217;m not lying, okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Chiharu smirked.</p>



<p>By listening to her words, Hirjiri let out an &#8220;Ah~&#8221;.</p>



<p>He seemed to have guessed the point.</p>







<p>&#8220;Since he is a god, it wouldn&#8217;t be strange for him to live for more than two thousand years, would it?&#8221;</p>







<p>So Chiharu finally cleared up the matter.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, Chiharu Uenishi is a demigod, a human deity.</p>



<p>For generations, Uenishi has spun history by conceiving the children of the gods to whom they have dedicated themselves.</p>







<p>&#8221; Eh? ..Really, with a God?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, of course not. It&#8217;s just a matter of faith.&#8221;</p>







<p>Chiharu said in a deadpan tone.</p>



<p>She was the daughter of a shrine and supposed to be a living deity.., but she has very little faith.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, in other words&#8230; you&#8217;re practically getting the seed from somewhere else. There are no boys in the Uenishi family tree. That&#8217;s to protect matrilineal inheritance.&#8221;</p>







<p>You can&#8217;t marry because you are going to have a child with a god.</p>



<p>This was a system created by Uenishi to prevent a son-in-law from taking over the family.</p>



<p>Of course, if they don&#8217;t have sexual intercourse, they can&#8217;t have children, so some people become de facto husbands.</p>



<p>However, they are not recorded in the family tree and are not treated as family members.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s how it is.</p>







<p>&#8220;Our clan, the Uenishi, is made up entirely of women. Isn&#8217;t that interesting?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; So that&#8217;s how it is. That is interesting.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s eyes shone a little.</p>



<p>In response to Arisa&#8217;s expression, Chiharu proudly stuck out her large chest.</p>



<p>It was a little poisonous to the eyes.</p>







<p>&#8220;Hm?　Isn&#8217;t that strange?　A son could be born, too. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re an Amazonian.&#8221;</p>







<p>And then Hijiri interrupted her.</p>



<p>Biologically, Chiharu was a respectable homo sapiens, not some mythical mysterious race or species, so of course, she could have a boy.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; They do get born these days. But we put them up for adoption&#8230; strictly speaking, we put them in the de facto husband&#8217;s registry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;These days?&#8221;</p>



<p>“It is said that they weren&#8217;t born in the past.&#8221;</p>







<p>To Chiharu&#8217;s words, Hijiri had an expression of &#8220;what is she talking about&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then he immediately let out the words &#8220;oh&#8230;&#8221; and shut up.</p>







<p>&#8220;He~e, There are some mysterious things huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t seem to notice.</p>



<p>She seems to think that there really were no boys born in the past.</p>







<p>&#8220;Eh? What&#8217;s going on, everyone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing, Arisa. Yeah, it&#8217;s&#8230; mysterious.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said, agreeing with Arisa&#8230;, and covered up the situation.</p>



<p>There is no need to notice what you don&#8217;t need to notice.</p>



<p>The pure Arisa was cute as she was.</p>







<p>&#8220;I was just thinking, Chiharu-chan&#8217;s mother would be, in other words, Chiharu-chan&#8217;s older sister, right?&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka remarked as if she had an epiphany.</p>



<p>If they all had a common father, then all the women in Uenishi would be sisters.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you&#8217;re right. That means I&#8217;m going to be giving birth to a sister.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a world of myth right&#8230; It really is like a myth.&#8221;</p>







<p>Tenka wondered to herself.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, according to the &#8220;setting,&#8221; the Uenishi family line is forever multiplying itself within the family&#8230; Genetically speaking, you and your father are ninety-nine percent the same person, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. As the time passes, the first generation&#8217;s blood gets thinner and the father&#8217;s blood gets thicker.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Hijiri and Yuzuru said this, Chiharu puffed out her large chest.</p>







<p>&#8220;You can call me God Chiharu, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; In effect, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re having a baby with yourself.&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro muttered.</p>



<p>Then Ayaka let out a slightly over-excited, raised voice.</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s practically mast&#8230; what is it? Soichiro-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re eating.&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro stopped Ayaka from ranting.　</p>



<p>But then Chiharu said in a cheerful voice.</p>







<p>&#8220;Essentially it&#8217;s masturbating!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You said that yourself huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but let out a bewildered voice.　</p>



<p>Arisa, on the other hand, giggled.</p>







<p>&#8220;Wel&#8230; It might be Kojiki, but it&#8217;s a pretty amazing story.&#8221; (<strong>TN:<em> </em></strong><em>Kojiki &#8211; Record of ancient matters. More like legends</em>)</p>







<p>There was no unpleasantness in Arisa&#8217;s expression or tone of voice.</p>



<p>Rather, she seemed to be enjoying it a little.</p>



<p>&#8230;surprisingly she seems to be comfortable with the crude stuff.</p>







<p>However, in retrospect, it&#8217;s not that Arisa is a prude, it&#8217;s just that she&#8217;s not used to men.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a joke, it&#8217;s probably within the acceptable range.</p>



<p>But if it was an obscene conversation, it might be a different story.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230; I tried not to make jokes like that because I didn&#8217;t want her to dislike me. But surprisingly, it&#8217;s okay to do it?</em>)</p>



<p><em>Next time there is an opportunity, perhaps I should try to find out what Arisa&#8217;s tolerance level is.</em></p>







<p>That&#8217;s what Yuzuru thought.</p>



<p>That evening.</p>







<p>&#8220;Thank you for today.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa thanked the person on the other end of the phone.</p>



<p>The other party was&#8230; Ayaka Tachibana.</p>







<p>[“<em>No, don&#8217;t worry about it. It&#8217;s just meddling on my part.”</em>]</p>







<p>Just as Yuzuru was troubled about his &#8220;love&#8221; with Arisa,</p>



<p>Arisa was also worried about her &#8220;love&#8221; with Yuzuru.</p>







<p>And if they were to become lovers, it was only natural that Arisa would be concerned about her reputation among the people around her.</p>



<p>Unlike Yuzuru, she was the one who was concerned about it, so she was deeply worried about it.</p>







<p>[<em>“Well, if you need anything, just let me know. I&#8217;ll help you, and I&#8217;m sure Chiharu-chan and Tenka-chan will too.&#8221;]</em></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes. I understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Ayaka said in a cheerful voice, Arisa bowed her head and said so.</p>



<p>To put it bluntly, Arisa felt uncomfortable with the &#8220;group&#8221; she was a part of.</p>



<p>In fact, she was sick and tired &#8230;of the company she belonged to, where she would just bob and weave to uninteresting conversations and reply to unproductive emails.</p>



<p>Of course, she didn&#8217;t like it that much before &#8230;but as her relationship with Ayaka and the others deepened, she realized that the &#8220;group&#8221; she belonged to was not so &#8220;fun&#8221;.</p>



<p>Especially when it comes to the &#8220;Keeping-in-check&#8221; of lovers and relationships within their own &#8220;group&#8221;, she felt a kind of disgust.</p>



<p>When she didn&#8217;t particularly like someone, it didn&#8217;t bother her that much, but&#8230; now it&#8217;s just an obstacle.</p>



<p>This is why Arisa wanted to keep her distance.</p>







<p>&#8230; But, she was afraid of bullying.</p>



<p>Even if it doesn&#8217;t develop into bullying, being bad-mouthed and isolated is no less frightening for the feeble-minded Arisa.</p>







<p>It was Ayaka and the others who offered their cooperation to Arisa.</p>



<p>If Ayaka and the others are willing to become her allies in case of emergency, Arisa could rest assured.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;As for me, it&#8217;s in my interest to ingratiate myself with the next Mrs. Takasegawa, Arisa-chan. You should give payment at the time of childbirth.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230;It&#8217;s too soon to tell.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle.</p>



<p>Sometimes she suddenly feels it.</p>



<p>Ayaka and her friends are more mature than herself.</p>



<p>Or perhaps it could be called insightful.</p>







<p>They don&#8217;t want to get used to each other or have a casual relationship with each other like the &#8220;group&#8221; to which Arisa belongs, but they want a clear &#8220;profit and loss&#8221;.</p>



<p>At first, this confused her, but once she got used to it, she felt comfortable.</p>



<p>It was easier to draw a line when it was clearly stated, because it was easier to understand, and it made things easier.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t even know how much Yuzuru-san likes me.&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>When Arisa said that, there was a moment of silence.</p>



<p>Then Ayaka replied.</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;A Family of Schemers.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;That&#8217;s the evaluation of the Takasegawa family. That household is very good at behind-the-scenes maneuvering and that sort of thing. Their methods are rather nasty in many ways&#8230;&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>Judging by the words alone, it was just bad-mouthing.</p>



<p>But the tone of her voice was anything but bad-mouthing.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re dexterous or clumsy, but they&#8217;re able to hold back their emotions at the moment. That&#8217;s why they look heartless. Takasegawa is calm, cool-headed, and cold-blooded&#8230; They put reason and planning ahead of temporary emotions. So, it may be frustrating, but wait for him.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka&#8217;s words showed her deep understanding and trust in &#8220;Yuzuru Takasegawa&#8221;.</p>



<p>Arisa was a little bit jealous of that&#8230;</p>



<p>Of course, she already knows that she is not in love with him and he certainly is not in love with her.</p>







<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t Ayaka-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think marriage is&#8230; too early or something?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa suddenly asked a question that she had been wondering about.</p>



<p>She was already thinking that she could marry Yuzuru, or even that she wanted to.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s not common for high school students to be thinking that much.</p>



<p>But Ayaka doesn&#8217;t seem to have any doubts about Yuzuru and Arisa getting married.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;By early, you mean in high school?　That&#8217;s too early.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;No, of course not&#8230; I&#8217;m not thinking of getting registered while I&#8217;m still in school or anything like that&#8230; I&#8217;m thinking that after high school graduation is the earliest. But I think it&#8217;s too early to be thinking about such things while you&#8217;re still in high school&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>At least the high school sweethearts around them are not thinking that far into the future.</p>



<p>&#8230;Of course, there can be a pattern of excessive lack of thought also.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about in general&#8230;&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>Ayaka replied to Arisa&#8217;s question.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;I and Yuzurun must have a child someday to keep our family and blood together.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it ever since I can remember.&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>Arisa was convinced that this was true when she was told.</p>



<p>At the same time, she felt a culture shock.　</p>



<p>From the beginning, they had different attitudes toward the idea of marriage.</p>







<p>“Ayaka-san&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;With, um, Satake-san?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Arisa asked, and after a moment of silence, she heard Ayaka&#8217;s voice.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;I wonder&#8230;.. Soichiro-kun is Satake&#8217;s eldest son.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; I&#8217;m sorr&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>[<em>&#8220;But Soichiro-kun is a passionate man despite his appearance. He told me that he was willing to give up his right to inherit the family name for my sake.&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>That was a little unexpected for Arisa.</p>



<p>For Arisa, Soichiro Satake is a person who&#8230; to put it bluntly, she doesn&#8217;t really know what he&#8217;s thinking.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;Well, you see&#8230; I&#8217;m the only daughter of the Tachibana family. I can only hope that Soichiro-kun will throw away a lot of things for me now&#8230;&#8221;</em>]</p>







<p>Arisa felt that her words contained a hint of optimism, resignation, and envy.</p>



<p>And Ayaka, without waiting for Arisa&#8217;s words, said.</p>







<p>[<em>&#8220;Yuzurun is also in a similar position to me. Arisa-chan also&#8230; should prepare yourself, for many reasons.&#8221;</em>]</p>



<p>Those words weighed heavily on Arisa&#8217;s mind.</p>
