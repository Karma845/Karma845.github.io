<h3>Chapter 14 – Post-Marathon Rewards</h3>

<p><br>&#8220;Tomorrow is the marathon, right?&#8221;</p>






<p>On the way home.</p>



<p>While Yuzuru was walking home with Arisa, she said this to him.</p>







<p>Yes, The next day was the day when the boys will have to run 10 kilometers and the girls will have to run 7 kilometers.</p>



<p>And for Yuzuru, it&#8217;s also the day of his &#8220;competition&#8221; with Soichiro and Hijiri.</p>







<p>&#8221; Arisa &#8230;you seem like you don&#8217;t like much?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah &#8230;.no, it’s not that I hate it.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru asked, Arisa chuckled.</p>



<p>Some people are good at long-distance running, but you don&#8217;t often hear of people who like long-distance running.</p>



<p>Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t want to run either if he doesn&#8217;t have to.</p>



<p>Arisa felt the same way.</p>







<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between running for voluntary exercise and being forced to run for a school event after all&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true&#8230; At the very least, we should be rewarded for our hard work.&#8221;</p>







<p>In addition, on the day of the marathon, the school will be over in half a day.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a reward.</p>



<p>However&#8230;, if you ask whether they want to go out and have fun after running 10 kilometers, it&#8217;s a bit complicated.</p>



<p>Instead, one would want to relax and unwind at home.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; A reward, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa seemed to be thinking about something.</p>



<p>Her cheeks&#8230; appeared to be slightly blushed.</p>







<p>&#8220;um&#8230; tomorrow, after the marathon&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay if I drop by your house&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t have a part-time job tomorrow anyway.&#8221;</p>







<p>As for Yuzuru, he would welcome the opportunity to hang out with her.</p>



<p>However&#8230;, it can be assumed that his body will indeed be exhausted, so he cannot do anything intense.</p>







<p>&#8220;Do you mean like playing a game or something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not really a reward, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>







<p>That is what Arisa and Yuzuru always do on their days off.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that they dislike it, in fact, they enjoy it&#8230; But whether it motivates them to run long distances of ten kilometers (or seven kilometers) was not entirely certain.</p>







<p>&#8220;So what do you want to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s, well&#8230;That&#8217;s..&#8221;</p>







<p>After a few moments of silence, Arisa said in a quiet voice,&nbsp;</p>







<p>&#8220;A massage, maybe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Massage?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but ask back&#8230; Arisa&#8217;s face turned red and she began desperately trying to explain herself.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah, no.., I didn&#8217;t mean it in a weird way. You know&#8230;, we did it before during the sports festival. It felt pretty good, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8230; that&#8217;s right, we did.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru also remembered what happened a while ago.</p>



<p>At that time, &#8230;Arisa was very lustrous.</p>



<p>And after remembering many dangerous things, Yuzuru forcibly erased the memory from his mind.</p>







<p>&#8220;And of course, I wouldn&#8217;t just make Yuzuru-san massage me. I can also&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m good at it, but I can at least tap your shoulder&#8230; How about that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>







<p>If you were to get a massage somewhere else, you would be charged several thousand yen for an hour.</p>



<p>This means that there is still enough need to spend that amount of money&#8230; In short, that&#8217;s how good it feels.</p>



<p>There is a difference in feeling between a massage by yourself and a massage by someone else.　</p>



<p>Besides&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s fine. A massage sounds like fun.&#8221;</p>







<p>He could legitimately touch Arisa.</p>



<p>That was what Yuzuru had thought when he answered.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was also a healthy high school boy and wants to touch the body of the girl he loves in various ways.</p>



<p>&#8230;Of course, it&#8217;s not a good idea to touch a girl&#8217;s breasts, so restraint is a must.</p>







<p>&#8220;Is that so&#8230; That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa, on the other hand, seems somewhat relieved.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was not a mind reader, so he doesn&#8217;t know exactly what Arisa was feeling&#8230;</p>







<p>(<em>Perhaps, Arisa is also &#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>Does she have an ulterior motive for wanting to touch or be touched by Yuzuru?</p>



<p>Yuzuru suddenly wondered.</p>







<p><em>But such a thing is not possible for Arisa.</em></p>



<p>Or so he thought. But though Yuzuru and Arisa had not conveyed to each other their feelings, they were both in love with each other.</p>



<p>It would not be surprising if Arisa had something similar to the desire that Yuzuru has for Arisa.</p>







<p>(<em>I have to be careful about a lot of stuff.</em>)</p>



<p>There should be no mistakes.</p>



<p>At least Yuzuru has to be solid.</p>



<p>Yuzuru clenched his fists and made up his mind.</p>







<p>&#8221; Ah, by the way&#8230; can I borrow your bath&#8230;.?　I&#8217;ll bring a change of clothes and a towel.&#8221;</p>







<p>As Yuzuru was making strange preparations in his mind, Arisa asked Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Thinking about it, their bodies would be covered in sweat after a run.</p>



<p>Massaging each other&#8217;s bodies afterward&#8230;</p>



<p>(<em>&#8230; is what I wish for.</em>)</p>



<p><em>Arisa&#8217;s body odor and sweat are totally acceptable.</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru said inwardly thinking that if Arisa heard about it, she might punch him in the face with her fist.</p>







<p>However, Arisa would probably not like it.</p>







<p>&#8220;Oh, sure. &#8230;Before the massage, it would be better to take a bath to improve blood circulation.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru stated plausibly without a trace of concern on his face.</p>



<p>And Arisa&#8230; also nodded plausibly.</p>







<p>&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s right&#8230; Oh yeah, how about some onsen materials?　I have some at home, I can bring it to you if you want.&#8221; (<strong>TN:</strong> <em>Onsen &#8211; Hot spring bath</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any bath salts at home. So yeah, I&#8217;d love to have some.&#8221;</p>







<p>Though he was not sure how effective it would be, it&#8217;s not like he dislikes it. So if she can bring it, that would be good.</p>







<p>&#8220;A, and, uh, here&#8217;s a suggestion&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>







<p>When he asked Arisa who raised a shrill voice&#8230; she shook her head from side to side.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;N, no. It is.. nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then she fell silent.</p>







<p><em>What did she want to suggest?</em></p>



<p>Although Yuzuru inwardly tilted his head&#8230; He was looking forward to the day of the marathon.</p>




<p>&#8220;To wear a swimsuit and go in together for the bath is indeed &#8230;too aggressive, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? &#8230;Did you say something, Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing&#8221;</p>
