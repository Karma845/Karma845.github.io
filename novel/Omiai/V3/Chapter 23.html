<h3>Chapter 23 – Men’s Association Part 1</h3>

<p>Sometime later.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, Soichiro, and Hijiri were having a meal at a family restaurant.</p>



<p>Of course&#8230; it was Hijiri&#8217;s treat.</p>



<p>And when three men get together, &#8230; there&#8217;s one thing they always do.</p>



<p>Yes, indecent talk.</p>






<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking lately how wonderful buttocks are.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru said as he sipped his grape drink from a glass.</p>



<p>His face was faintly red.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, the buttocks are essentially the greatest sex appeal for the hominids.&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro said in a calm voice.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded exaggeratedly in agreement with his friend.</p>







<p>&#8220;Right? Well, breasts are nice, too. I still think the butt is the real thing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no rational reason why a fake can&#8217;t beat the real thing.&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro poured the grape juice in the decanter into his own glass while saying this.</p>



<p>Then he said to Yuzuru with a serious face.</p>







<p>&#8220;We are hominids, but we are also human. The difference between an ape and a human is &#8230;in the chest. Then shouldn&#8217;t we love the breasts?&#8221;</p>







<p>While poking at the mussels, Hijiri said with a sigh to Yuzuru and Soichiro.</p>







<p>&#8220;You guys just don&#8217;t understand&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru and Soichiro looked at Hijiri.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the legs. Slender legs are more artistic than just big breasts and buttocks.&#8221;</p>







<p>Breasts and buttocks may be sexual.</p>



<p>But there is an artistic eroticism to legs that goes beyond that, he argued.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well.. at the end it is all of them, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it comes down to.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not simply all of them, it&#8217;s a matter of balance, and degree.&#8221;</p>







<p>In the end, they concluded that everyone is different and everyone is great.</p>



<p>Then the topic shifted to another hobby.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru, what do you usually watch?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The genre, the genre.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; Genre huh.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru thought for a while before answering.</p>







<p>“Well, it&#8217;s a normal one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Netorare one?&#8221; (<strong>TN: </strong><em>Feel free to google</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not normal right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it seems to be the most popular genre.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</p>







<p>He doesn’t know if it&#8217;s the most popular or not, but at least Yuzuru didn&#8217;t have that kind of taste.</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru regretted that &#8220;normal&#8221; was not a good answer.</p>







<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of &#8230;massage stuff lately.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean like lymphatic flow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah. That kind of thing.&#8221;</p>







<p>While saying that&#8230; Yuzuru remembered the &#8220;massage&#8221; with Arisa a while ago.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru did not do anything to regulate the lymphatic flow of Arisa, but it was fun in many ways&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;So while asking me that, what are you watching these days?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been into VR lately.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen it. Is it fun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very immersive.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there a sense of reality in it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Try it and you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Hijiri said that, it made Yuzuru want to give it a try.　</p>



<p>However, he doesn’t have the time to buy such trivial things right now because he has to save money for a gift for Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;What about Soichiro?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuri.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t waver at all, do you&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro answers Hijiri&#8217;s question immediately.</p>



<p>Yuzuru laughed at his &#8220;hobby&#8221; as usual.</p>







<p>&#8220;It has to be yuri for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Anything with yuri in it is okay with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a guy involved, then it&#8217;s not for me&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh come on, this is like the shame until the end of the generation&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Soichiro is the last of his generation.&#8221;</p>







<p>In addition, &#8220;the end of the generation&#8221; does not refer to the descendants, but the next life. And &#8220;shame until the end of the generation&#8221; means shame until the next life.</p>



<p>Of course, all three of them knew that.</p>







<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, are you going to be son-in-law to Tachibana after all?&#8221;</p>







<p>Suddenly, he asked Soichiro about the information he had overheard.</p>



<p>He had heard about it through his father.</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what will happen if things go in order.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then Satake&#8217;s governorship will be&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out.&#8221;</p>







<p>Tachibana and Satake do not have a bad relationship.</p>



<p>However, Satake would not want to become a part of Tachibana.</p>



<p>The man who would become Tachibana&#8217;s son-in-law could not possibly become the head of Satake, and it was only natural that Soichiro would have to decline the position of the next successor.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, I have many brothers, unlike Tachibana. So, it doesn&#8217;t have to be me. I guess I should be the one to go down.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soichiro said and stood up, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to the washroom&#8221;</p>







<p>After he left the table, Hijiri asked Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t know as much about their relationship as you do, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while if Tachibana and Uenishi are actually &#8216;a thing&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve been &#8216;good friends&#8217; for a long time.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru answered vaguely while drinking a grape beverage.</p>







<p>In response, Hijiri nodded, &#8220;I see&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, that guy&#8230; gave up Satake&#8217;s governorship because the three of them can be happy together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a surprisingly lovestruck man&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Satake is a major landowner in the eastern part of Japan, mainly in the Kanto region, and also has extensive connections in the local assembly and civil engineering.</p>



<p>The position of the heir to the governorship will not be something that can be thrown away so easily.</p>



<p>And&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told by Tenka, but is he the one who will be providing seeds to Uenishi? But Uenishi is in Kyoto, and Tachibana is in Tokyo. What&#8217;s he going to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t it just a&#8230; duolocal marriage?　He can just do it linearly.&#8221;</p>







<p>It will be a life of regularly going back and forth between the two houses.</p>



<p>Of course, Ayaka and Chiharu are &#8220;good friends,&#8221; so it&#8217;s not uncommon for them to sleep over at each other&#8217;s houses.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Poor guy, he&#8217;ll never have a specific home to go back to.&#8221;</p>







<p>Hijiri&#8217;s words contained sympathy and, nevertheless, some respect for the guy who left his house for the woman he loves.</p>







<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</p>







<p>As Yuzuru agreed with Hijiri&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, to be honest, Tachibana and Uenishi have more money than Satake.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re scum after all, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>







<p>Hijiri said to Soichiro, who had just returned from the bathroom.</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first thing you say to your friend when he comes back from the bathroom?　&#8230;Isn&#8217;t it shit which should be said there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not a gag. What&#8217;s with the feces man routine? Are you in grade school or what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Dirty jokes make your drink..,kohon!&#8230; makes your juices taste bad, so stop it.&#8221;</p>







<p>You can&#8217;t get off&#8230; no, you can&#8217;t eat with dirty things&#8230;</p>



<p>Yuzuru complained to Hijiri along with Soichiro.</p>
