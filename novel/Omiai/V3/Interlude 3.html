<h3>Interlude – Wants to Express</h3>

<p>When he told me this, at first I thought I had done something wrong.<br> </p> <p>Because I had just gone to his parents&#8217; house for New Year&#8217;s greetings.</p> <p>Or maybe he had grown tired of me.<br></p> <p>Feeling uneasy, I asked my foster father.</p> <p>After thinking about it for a while, my foster father answered.<br></p> <p>Originally, Mei-chan was supposed to be the one to get engaged to him, not me, according to my foster father.</p> <p>However, his family had nominated me.</p> <p>And since I was hoping for an arranged marriage, we decided to tie the knot.<br></p> <p>But&#8230;</p> <p><em>&#8220;I was wondering if you really don&#8217;t want to have a marriage proposal.&#8221;</em><br></p> <p>That&#8217;s apparently what he meant.</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t know how to answer, so I just stood there in a daze.</p> <p>When I remained silent, my foster father said, <em>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to get married if you don&#8217;t want to. I have no intention of forcing you to do anything. If you don&#8217;t like it, just say no&#8230; I&#8217;ll wait a while to answer&#8221;</em>.<br></p> <p>It&#8217;s true that I didn&#8217;t like it until a while ago.</p> <p>But I don&#8217;t hate it now.<br></p> <p>It was a little too late to say anything, and the words were meaningless now.</p> <p>Why did he start saying this now?<br></p> <p>Suddenly, it hit me&#8230; there&#8217;s my adoptive mother.</p> <p>My adoptive mother hates me.</p> <p>She seems to be bitter about this marriage proposal, and about me marrying him.</p> <p>Could it be that she wants to use my dislike as an excuse to break up our engagement?</p> <p>And then get him engaged to her own daughter, Mei-chan.</p> <p>My adoptive father also wants to marry him to his own daughter, since she is naturally cuter than me&#8230;<br></p> <p>It may be that I am a little too paranoid.</p> <p>But there is no denying it.<br></p> <p>Or was it &#8230; that person again, telling my foster father or foster mother something unnecessary?</p> <p>That person is really, always, always, always &#8230;&#8230;</p> <p>No, let&#8217;s not do that.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not decided just yet.<br></p> <p>Whatever the case, there was no doubt that a dark cloud was gathering over my engagement with him.<br> </p> <p>This suddenly made me feel uneasy.　</p> <p><em>Is he really in love with me?</em>&nbsp;<br> </p> <p>Until a little while ago, I was absolutely confident that he was in love with me,&nbsp; &#8230;although that may sound a little arrogant.<br> </p> <p>He&#8217;s been so kind to me.</p> <p>He also gave me a very nice gift.<br> </p> <p>Most importantly&#8230;, one would never say, &#8220;Can I hug you?&#8221; to someone you don&#8217;t like.</p> <p> <br>It&#8217;s definitely a mutual love. </p> <p>I thought that he loved me so much that maybe he thought I was his lover already and that&#8217;s why he didn&#8217;t bother to tell me his feelings.<br> </p> <p>But maybe it&#8217;s all in my imagination.</p> <p>I think that because I like him, I only see what is convenient for me&#8230;<br> </p> <p>This possibility crossed my mind.<br> </p> <p>He&#8217;s just trying to be a &#8220;fiancée&#8221;.</p> <p>He might be thinking of me as just a friend of the opposite sex.</p> <p>When I thought about it, I realized that he was very close to the girls he grew up with.</p> <p>Maybe this level of closeness is normal for him&#8230;<br> </p> <p>No, no&#8230; indeed, it&#8217;s impossible.</p> <p>You can&#8217;t try to hug someone you don&#8217;t like or pat them on the head.</p> <p>Even if it&#8217;s not a strong romantic feeling, I&#8217;m sure he likes me in some way&#8230;Probably.</p> <p>But even if that is the case, I still feel uneasy.<br></p> <p>He is a wonderful man.</p> <p>He doesn&#8217;t stand out much at school, but that&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t usually get his hair done.</p> <p>When he goes out on a date with me, he dresses up nicely.</p> <p>When he is properly dressed, he is very cool.</p> <p>He is also tall.</p> <p>He&#8217;s kind and a gentleman.</p> <p>He is very caring.</p> <p>He is smart, well-educated, and athletic.</p> <p>He can tell jokes and is very fun to talk to.<br> </p> <p>And &#8230; although it would probably offend him to mention this when listing his good points, the Takasegawa family is very rich.</p> <p>Until half a year ago, I was so naive that I didn&#8217;t know how much money and political power his family had, but now I do.<br> </p> <p>Of course, I didn&#8217;t like him because he&#8217;s rich and it’s not that I love him for that.</p> <p>Even if his family were to fall, I would never lose my love for him.<br> </p> <p>Just that.. Girls who are attracted to that money might come after him.</p> <p>A very good classic way to say it is &#8216;thieving cat&#8217;.<br> </p> <p>Of course, he&#8217;s not the kind of guy who would ever cheat on his wife.</p> <p>I believe in his character.<br> </p> <p>But he has never confessed his love to me or proposed to me.</p> <p>In other words, without the &#8220;fiancée&#8221; in the relationship, he and I are just friends of the opposite sex.<br> </p> <p>What if he doesn&#8217;t like me that much, or at least doesn&#8217;t like me as much as I like him?</p> <p>And what if a very attractive woman approached him?</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want to even think about it.<br> </p> <p>I want certainty.</p> <p>I want him to say that he likes me, that he loves me.</p> <p>I want him to express it in words.</p> <p>This brings me back to the question&#8230; Why doesn&#8217;t he tell me that he likes me?<br> </p> <p>He is in love with me.</p> <p>He should be &#8230;&#8230; in love with me.<br> </p> <p>And I think I have shown him by my actions that I like him.</p> <p>I think it&#8217;s about time he told me how he feels about me.<br> </p> <p>Despite this, he has yet to share his feelings with me.</p> <p>&#8230;Of course, that&#8217;s something I can tell myself as well.</p> <p>If he doesn&#8217;t tell me he likes me, then I should tell him I like him.</p> <p>That&#8217;s the way it should be.<br> </p> <p>I know that it was not good to remain silent forever, and have him do what I wanted him to do without saying out loud and enjoy it.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a very bad habit of mine to just look at what I want without saying anything.<br> </p> <p>Just that&#8230; Even if it is very selfish of me to do so&#8230; I want him to say &#8220;I love you&#8221; to me.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a bit of an exaggeration to call it a dream, but I have a desire for a romantic confession from the man I like.</p> <p>I think this is a common desire of many women, not just me.<br> </p> <p>And &#8230; although this is a bit of an excuse, I&#8217;m sure he himself would like to confess to me.</p> <p>His household is very old-fashioned (maybe not the best way to put it).</p> <p>I think it&#8217;s ingrained in him.</p> <p>In fact, he always walks on the side of the road when he walks with me and gives me a hand when I get out of the car.</p> <p>Of course, I don&#8217;t think he even has a male chauvinistic mindset&#8230;<br> </p> <p>He might be thinking that confessions and proposals are supposed to be done by men.</p> <p>So I&#8217;d rather wait for him to do it.<br> </p> <p>Let&#8217;s go back a little bit on this topic.<br> </p> <p>For some reason, he has not told me that he likes me.</p> <p>Even though I&#8217;m always prepared to receive it.</p> <p> Then, after much pondering, I suddenly came across a possibility.<br> </p> <p>Could it be that he is&#8230;</p> <div style="height:157px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div> <p>Could it be that he is incredibly dense?<br> </p> <p>Does he not realize that I like him?</p> <p>Isn&#8217;t it possible that he doesn&#8217;t know that I have feelings for him?<br> </p> <p>Thinking back, at the New Year&#8217;s holiday.</p> <p>He casually took my hand.</p> <p>I was very happy and embarrassed at the same time.</p> <p>I think it showed in my expression.</p> <p>The fact that I was flattered to have his hand in mine should have shown on my face that I liked him.</p> <p>But he was like,<em> &#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</em><br> </p> <p>He&#8217;s very good at hiding his emotions, so I thought he was probably just hiding his embarrassment. But&#8230;,</p> <p>Maybe he doesn&#8217;t really understand my fondness for him.<br> </p> <p>It was like that when he suddenly asked me to go home with him.</p> <p>I was the only one who seemed to be embarrassed.<br> </p> <p>What if he is incredibly dense and doesn&#8217;t know how much I like him?</p> <p>That would explain why he hasn&#8217;t told me how he feels about me.<br> </p> <p>He&#8217;s a very brave man, but, understandably, he would be reluctant to share his feelings with someone who may or may not like him.</p> <p>But this means he won&#8217;t be able to tell me his feelings for me anytime soon.<br> </p> <p>If he&#8217;s incredibly dense, he&#8217;ll never notice me from the way I&#8217;ve been treating him.</p> <p>What should I do&#8230;?<br> </p> <p>It might have been a bad idea to worry about such things so seriously.</p> <p>I caught a cold on a beautiful Saturday.<br> </p> <p>And just at the time when my foster mother and Mei-chan were not around.</p> <p>&#8230; No, it was probably for the best, though, because I felt more at ease without my foster mother.<br> </p> <p>When I told him about it, he was very worried about me.</p> <p>He said he would visit me.</p> <p>At first, I felt very bad.</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t have a serious cold at that time, and I didn&#8217;t want him to catch it.</p> <p>But&#8230; It was also true that I felt vulnerable.</p> <p>I guess he could feel it over the phone.</p> <p>He brought up the fact that I had nursed him in the past and guided me so that I could easily ask for his help.</p> <p>I was very happy to hear his concern.</p> <p>At the same time, I was apologetic.</p> <p>I decided to ask him to help me.<br> </p> <p>As it turned out, it was the right decision.</p> <p>My cold had gotten worse after his arrival.</p> <p>I had such a high fever that I couldn&#8217;t help but show my undergarments in front of him, and my judgment and consciousness were impaired.</p> <p>It was really reassuring to have him there.<br> </p> <p>Besides&#8230;, I thought it was a bit of a perk that he gave me a princess carry.<br> </p> <p>Then he took me to the hospital and even prepared a meal for me after we returned.</p> <p>He offered me a tray with a bowl and a spoon on it.<br> </p> <p>Then suddenly,&#8230; It occurred to me.<br> </p> <p>If I continue to treat him the way I usually do, he will not notice my affection.</p> <p>And no matter how much I would wait for his confession, it would not be good for me to remain passive.</p> <p>I need to change as well.</p> <p>I need to be more proactive in communicating my feelings to him in a way that is easy to understand.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Feed it to me, please.&#8221;</em></p>
 <p>I selfishly expressed my desire.</p>
